Under SOPA, a contractor is entitled to payment upon the completion of works, as detailed in ss 2 and 5 SOPA:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. …</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">“payment claim” means a claim made by a claimant for a progress payment under section 10; … </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">“progress payment” means a payment to which a person is <span class="font-italic">entitled</span> for the <span class="font-italic">carrying out of construction work</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">5.  Any person who has carried out any construction work … under a contract is <span class="font-italic">entitled</span> to a progress payment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">SOPA timelines apply notwithstanding termination</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 If a contractor exercises its statutory entitlement to progress payment for the completion of construction work via a payment claim, s 10(2) SOPA provides that such “payment claim <span class="font-italic">shall </span>be served (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) … in accordance with the terms of the contract; or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where the contract does not contain such provision, at such time as may be prescribed” [emphasis added]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Consequently, a SOPA payment claim <span class="font-italic">must </span>be served in accordance with the timeline set out in s 10(2) SOPA, which expressly applies to “payment claim[s]” and does not alter the timeline simply because of a subsequent termination of the contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Therefore, contrary to the Adjudicator’s determination, termination of the contract subsequent to the point of time the statutory entitlement to payment had arisen and accrued does not alter the timeline for service of a SOPA payment claim that applies to that contractor’s accrued <span class="font-italic">statutory</span> entitlement to payment. Instead, the timeline for service is determined at the point the statutory entitlement to payment arises; if the contract stipulates such a timeline, the contractual timeline applies pursuant to s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) SOPA. Like the contractor’s statutory entitlement to payment, this timeline remains unchanged even if the contract is subsequently terminated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 This interpretation is consistent with prior decisions, which have held that contractual provisions relating to timelines survive termination for the purposes of claims under SOPA: <span class="font-italic">AET Pte Ltd v AEU Pte Ltd </span>[2010] SCAdjR 771 (<span class="font-italic">“AET</span>”) at [37]–[43]; <span class="font-italic">Taisei Corp v Doo </span><span class="font-italic">Ree Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd </span>[2009] SGHC 156 (“<span class="font-italic">Taisei</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In <span class="font-italic">Taisei,</span> the main contractor, Taisei, had terminated the appointment of the subcontractor, Doo Ree. After the termination, on 29 November 2008, Doo Ree submitted Payment Claim 25 (“PC25”). Less than 21 days after, on 19 December 2008, Doo Ree lodged an adjudication application. A day later, on 20 December 2008, Taisei lodged its payment response. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Even though the court was cognisant of the fact that the contract had been terminated by the time PC25 was submitted, it held that the adjudication application was premature, given that clause 16.3 of the (terminated) contract required Doo Ree to give Taisei 21 days to respond to the payment claim (PC25) before<span class="font-italic"> </span>Doo Ree lodged its adjudication application (<span class="font-italic">Taisei</span> at [17], [81]). Here, Doo Ree had lodged its adjudication application less than 21 days after submitting PC25. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 However, both <span class="font-italic">AET </span>and <span class="font-italic">Taisei </span>did not detail the reasons for their findings, and were therefore of limited guidance to this court. Nonetheless, the results therein support the conclusion at [21] above that the contractual timelines must be adhered to for payment claims under SOPA for work done prior to termination <span class="font-italic">even if </span>the contract has been terminated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">PC10 was a SOPA payment claim, and was accordingly served too early</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In this case, while PC10 was ostensibly a claim for works done until 30 August 2018 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>including work done after the termination date of 20 July 2018), the parties did not dispute that no<span class="font-italic"> </span>work was in fact done after 10 July 2018, when the CSC was received. In fact, there was no work left to be done, as the works were already completed and the Contract was terminated shortly after. Hence, PC10 was essentially a claim for works done until 10 July 2018, prior to the termination of the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Having completed the works on 10 July 2018, the Sub-Contractor was statutorily entitled to a “progress payment”, which it could claim for via a “payment claim” under SOPA (s 2 SOPA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The Sub-Contractor did make such a “payment claim” for works done until 10 July 2018 via PC10, which it submitted for adjudication on 24 September 2018. Hence, PC10 was indubitably a SOPA, rather than a contractual, claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Contract was still subsisting when the works were completed and the CSC was obtained on 10 July 2018. Therefore, the Sub-Contractor’s statutory entitlement to further progress payment had arisen and accrued as of that date (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>10 July 2018). The SOPA payment timeline for that accrued entitlement to further progress payment under SOPA would accordingly have to follow that which was specified in s 10(2) SOPA read with clause 37 of the then subsisting Contract. Clause 37 of the Contract stipulated that the penultimate payment claim (being PC10) had to be served not earlier than three months after the receipt of the CSC (see [14] above). This timeline was not abided by when PC10 was served on 30 August 2018, less than three months after the CSC was received on 10 July 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 As a result, unless clause 37 can be shown to be void, PC10 was served too early, in breach of s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) SOPA, and the AD will be invalid.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Clause 37 is not voided by s 36(2) SOPA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In further arguments, the Sub-Contractor submitted that clause 37 was void as it contravenes s 36(2) SOPA,

</div> the main contractor applied to set aside an adjudicator’s decision. One issue that arose was whether clauses 12.6(h) and 12.6(i) of the contract were void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Clauses 12.6(h) provided that a payment claim submitted by the sub-contractor would be void if it did not comply with certain conditions, such as ensuring that the payment claim was submitted to the main contractor’s project manager. If the payment claim was so void by virtue of clause 12.6(h), clause 12.6(i) then provided that the sub-contractor’s payment claim would be deferred to the same day of the following month (<span class="font-italic">John Holland </span>at [6] and [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Fraser JA (White JA and Peter Lyons J agreeing) held that clause 12.6(i) was void under Queensland’s equivalent of s 36(2) SOPA (Building and Construction Industry Payments Act 2004 (Qld) s 99(2)) as it deferred the sub-contractor’s statutory entitlement to progress payment (<span class="font-italic">John Holland </span>at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Therefore, the Sub-Contractor submitted that, by deferring its penultimate payment claim by at least three months after the receipt of the CSC, clause 37 offended s 36(2) SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 On one hand, the deferment of the Sub-Contractor’s right to submit its penultimate payment claim by virtue of clause 37 appears to offend the object of SOPA, which entitles a contractor to payment upon completion of works (s 5 SOPA). This is to facilitate cash flow for parties in the construction industry (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(16 November 2004) vol 78 at col 1112 (Cedric Foo Chee Keng, Minister of State for National Development)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 On the other hand, SOPA accords primacy to the parties’ agreement with respect to payment claim timelines (see s 10(2) SOPA at [13] above). In accordance with this, the parties agreed, via clause 37, that the penultimate payment claim was to be submitted at least three months after the receipt of the CSC. This was so as to give the Main Contractor sufficient time to assess the total value of the Sub-Contractor’s works upon completion. Being a re-measurement contract, a final measurement of the work done and certified was necessary for valuing all the works completed by the Sub-Contractor.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Furthermore, as the penultimate payment claim included a claim for half of the retention monies, more time would also be needed by the Main Contractor to investigate if there were any uncompleted works or defects to be highlighted to the Sub-Contractor, all of which would have to be subsequently made good by the Sub-Contractor. The three-month window following the issuance of the CSC would therefore be helpful in allowing sufficient time for completing any uncompleted works or making good any defects.  If they remain uncompleted or unrectified, it would then allow the Main Contractor to raise a set-off in response to the penultimate payment claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Hence, clause 37 is unlike clause 12.6(i) in <span class="font-italic">John Holland</span>, which applied indiscriminately to defer <span class="font-italic">all </span>progress payment claims so long as they did not conform with the contractual conditions for the submission of payment claims; the contractual conditions included providing the payment claim in the appropriate format and to deliver them to the main contractor’s project manager (<span class="font-italic">John Holland </span>at [6]). Patently, failure to comply with such contractual conditions would not cause a significant delay in the valuation of works such as to justify a one-month deferment of the sub-contractor’s right to payment for works done. In contrast, the deferment of the payment of the penultimate payment claim by virtue of clause 37 was justified for the reasons stated in [38] and [39] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Given its limited scope (applying to the penultimate payment claim only) and that the deferment was justified, I find that clause 37 is not voided by s 36(2) SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In conclusion, notwithstanding the termination of the Contract, clause 37 (which is not voided by s 36(2) SOPA) was applicable and PC10, having been served less than three months after the CSC was received, was served too early, in breach of s 10(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) SOPA.
