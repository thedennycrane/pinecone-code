        Belinda Ang Saw Ean J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, MGA International Pte Ltd
                    (“MGA”), is a Singapore-incorporated company whose principal
                    activity is log trading. The plaintiff’s Chairman and Managing Director,
                    Gupta Mukesh (“Mukesh”), owns 30% of MGA’s issued capital
                    and the remaining 70% is held indirectly by Mukesh and his wife through an
                    Indian company called Shipra Ocean Trade Private Limited. The defendant, Wajilam
                    Exports (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Wajilam”), is in the business of
                    wholesale trading in spices. It also trades in logs and provides trade financing
                    to other log traders. Wajilam’s Managing Director is Tarun Chamanlal Mehta
                    (“Tarun”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Typically, MGA would finance its purchases of
                    round logs by arranging for Wajilam, a third party, to use its bank facilities
                    to apply for letters of credit. For present purposes, the action concerns and
                    turns on the basis upon which Wajilam provided trade finance to MGA for its
                    purchase of PNG round logs shipped onboard the “<em>Marina
                        I</em>”. Counsel for both sides confirmed on the sixth day of
                    the trial on 18 January 2010 that the narrow issue before the court relates to
                    the quantum of Wajilam’s commission: the question of whether the
                    commission should be the sum of US$376,477.67 or US$70,170.19 depends on what
                    was the commission term upon which Wajilam provided trade finance to MGA.
                    However, if the court rejects the opposing views of the parties, MGA’s
                    argument is that a reasonable sum is to be paid as commission. I should mention
                    that Wajilam does not object to the use of the word “commission”
                    to refer to the remuneration for its services to MGA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Wajilam’s objection was to
                    being called a “commission agent”, which Wajilam insisted it was
                    not. Therefore, in this judgment, for convenience, the word
                    “commission” or “remuneration” is used
                    interchangeably.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff company, MGA, was incorporated in
                    2003 after Mukesh relocated to Singapore and became a permanent resident. As
                    early as 1987, Mukesh imported logs from Malaysia to sell to buyers in India.
                    According to Mukesh, Indian financial institutions generally issued
                    “usance” letters of credit which would pose a problem for Muksesh
                    as log suppliers in Malaysia wanted their sale to be based on
                    “sight” letters of credit. To resolve this documentary credit
                    mismatch, Mukesh would arrange for a third party to apply to its bank for
                    letters of credit to finance his company’s purchases. In return, Mukesh
                    would reimburse the third party for the value of the letter of credit, bank
                    charges and, in addition, pay a commission for its finance
                services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       From 1987 until 2000, Mukesh would finance its
                    purchases in the way described by arranging for either Trusha Impex Pte Ltd
                    (“Trusha”), Tat Hin Timber Pte Ltd (“Tat Hin”), or
                    Wajilam to open letters of credit in favour of his suppliers. During that time,
                    besides Malaysian suppliers, Mukesh bought logs from suppliers in other regions
                    like Africa, Solomon Islands, New Zealand, Russia, and Alaska. After 2003,
                    Mukesh also obtained logs from Guyana and Papua New Guinea
                    (“PNG”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Between June 2006 and November 2007, MGA
                    financed its purchases of round logs by arranging with Wajilam to apply to its
                    bank(s) for letters of credits to be opened in favour of MGA’s suppliers
                    (hereafter referred to as “the trade finance services”). The
                    letters of credits opened in favour of suppliers named by MGA are hereafter
                    referred to as “the import letters of credit” or “the
                    import letter of credit” as the case maybe. It is common ground that the
                    parties treated each and every finance transaction according to shipments as
                    distinct and separate. Most of the shipments were for round logs of Sarawak
                    origin while three other separate shipments were for logs from Guyana. The
                        <em>Marina I</em> shipment was the only one involving
                    round logs from PNG. MGA on its part, agreed to name Wajilam as beneficiary of
                    the letters of credit or other documentary credits opened by its buyers in the
                    India (“the export letters of credit” or “the export letter
                    of credit” as the case maybe). In addition, any cash advances received by
                    MGA from its Indian buyers would be directed to Wajilam. In providing the trade
                    finance services to MGA, Wajilam would be able to discount the bills of
                    exchange; and where necessary, Wajilam would have recourse against MGA as well
                    as the buyers in India as acceptors of the bills of exchange. MGA on its part
                    had also agreed to reimburse the amount of the import letter of credit and
                    expenses connected with the opening of the import letter of credit including
                    late payment interest at the rate of 12% per annum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Although not expressly discussed, it was also
                    understood that at the end of the finance transaction, Wajilam would prepare
                    what was known as a “transaction statement”, setting out in
                    detail, amongst other things, the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_i"></a>(i)     the cash portion and the proceeds
                        received by Wajilam under the export letter of credit;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the amount paid under the import
                        letter of credit;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the expenses and disbursements that Wajilam had paid out in the
                        course of the finance transaction which MGA was required to reimburse
                        Wajilam; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     the commission payable to Wajilam.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       A typical transaction statement would enable
                    both parties to reconcile their accounts after the completion of the transaction
                    in order to determine who should pay whom and the exact amount to be
                    paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       It is common ground that the purchases of round
                    logs were duly shipped and paid for by MGA under the respective import letters
                    of credit. Hence, to clarify, this case is not about non payment of bills of
                    exchange, documents against acceptance or other forms of documentary credit that
                    had fallen due and went unpaid in respect of the export letters of
                    credit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Both sides understood, and there is no dispute,
                    that Wajilam would be paid a commission for providing trade finance services to
                    MGA. The present dispute is limited to the amount of commission to be paid
                    (hereafter referred to as “the contractual claim”). MGA’s
                    pleaded case is that commission was calculated by reference to the quantity of
                    the logs bought and resold (<em>ie</em>, 14,034.038 cubic
                    metres (“cbm”) which was in fact the actual quantity of logs
                    shipped), and, based on the parties’ prior dealings, the rate of
                    commission applicable to the subject transaction was US$5 per cbm. In response,
                    counsel for Wajilam, Ms Wendy Tan (“Ms Tan”) argued that
                    there was no agreed rate of commission as pleaded by MGA. Instead, it was an
                    implied term of the contract between the parties that Wajilam had absolute
                    discretion to decide its own remuneration or commission for providing trade
                    finance services (this alleged term will hereafter be referred to as “the
                    discretionary commission term”), and that was the basis upon which
                    Wajilam had provided trade finance services. I noted that the evidence on the
                    key issues as described was primarily oral. The persons involved in the
                    negotiations for the financing of MGA’s purchases of round logs, in so far
                    as it may be relevant, were Mukesh (on behalf of MGA) and Tarun (on behalf of
                    Wajilam). The conversations between the two protagonists were <em>not</em> documented and much will turn on the oral testimony of both
                    men. One additional thing to note is that, in this judgment, I have not referred
                    to a large part of the evidence that was adduced before me because that evidence
                    has no bearing upon the issues to be decided in this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The <em>Marina I</em> shipment of PNG round
                logs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The facts concerning the purchase of PNG round
                    logs, which were shipped onboard the <em>Marina I</em>, are
                    straightforward. In or about early June 2007, Mukesh spoke to Tarun about
                    MGA’s purchase of 14,034.038 cbm of round logs of PNG origin from a Hong
                    Kong company called Borion Enterprise Limited (“Borion”). The sale
                    was initially on FOB terms and MGA as FOB buyer chartered the <em>Marina 1</em> to carry the logs from PNG to India. The freight was
                    approximately US$1.2m. According to Mukesh, MGA managed to raise only US$400,000
                    for the freight. Mukesh therefore began negotiations with Borion to change the
                    terms of sale from FOB to CNF terms (with a corresponding increase of the price)
                    so that Borion would bear the freight upfront. Borion eventually acceded to
                    Mukesh’s request to sell the PNG round logs on CNF terms. As such, the
                    purchase price for the PNG round logs was increased from US$4,882,275.16 to
                    US$5,674,115.84 (which sum took into account the US$400,000 advance freight made
                    to Borion). I note that there is no documented evidence before the court as to
                    who paid the freight of US$400,000. Each party claimed to have paid US$400,000
                    freight to Borion. There is no dispute that the CNF letter of credit value is
                    US$5,832,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As usual, Wajilam prepared the consolidated
                    statement dated 14 November 2007 (the “sixth consolidated
                    statement”) and sent it to MGA on the same date. Attached to it was a
                    cash flow statement dated 6 November 2007 for the <em>Marina 1</em> finance transaction. It showed to MGA’s
                    credit, a cash surplus of US$998,500.18. This sum was derived from the proceeds
                    of the export letter of credit in Wajilam’s favour. The consolidated
                    statement showed the running account balance as of 11 September 2007 as
                    being US$11,730.64 in favour of MGA. This figure of US$11,730.64 was arrived at
                    after deducting from the cash surplus of US$998,500.18, (a) US$892,700.92 being
                    the previous balance in favour of Wajilam, and (b) two other sums of US$78,000
                    (for a payment made on behalf of MGA by Wajilam on 15 August 2007) and
                    US$16,068.62 (interest on the running balance from 19 July until
                    11 September 2007). Notably, there was no entry showing
                    Wajilam’s commission for the <em>Marina 1</em>
                    finance transaction in the sixth consolidated statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Two weeks later, on
                    28 November 2007, Agarwal Soham Ghanshyam (“Soham”) (he
                    is now the Assistant Vice-President of MGA), sent Wajilam an e-mail with a
                    consolidated statement (the “seventh consolidated statement”)
                    attached to it. (At the material time, Soham was the person handling MGA’s
                    accounts and he was responsible for checking MGA’s accounts with Wajilam.)
                    This time around, unlike the previous occasions, it was MGA, instead of Wajilam,
                    who prepared the consolidated statement. The title heading for the seventh
                    consolidated statement was “Wajilam Account 15/07/2007 to 28/11/2007
                    – ROUGH” and it included entries pertaining to the <em>Marina 1</em> shipment as well as one other MGA purchase of
                    Guyana logs which the parties had referred to as “the Barama container
                    shipment” (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> below for
                    details). Also in the statement was an entry described as “Marina-1
                    Commission (14,034.038 cbm @ USD 5)” with the corresponding figure of
                    US$70,170.19. In the seventh consolidated statement (based on MGA’s
                    computation), the running account balance as at 28 November 2007 was
                    US$477,424.11 in favour of MGA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Even though Tarun received Soham’s
                    e-mail and its attachment, he did not respond to it, in particular, the rate of
                    commission at US$5 per cbm of the quantity of round logs shipped onboard the
                        <em>Marina I</em>. Eventually, MGA learnt that Wajilam
                    had taken 50% of the net profit as its commission. That worked out to be
                    US$376,477.67 as compared to MGA’s figure of US$70,170.19 which was based
                    on the rate of US$5 per cbm of the actual quantity of round logs shipped. I now
                    turn to the rival arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">MGA’s case on commission</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     MGA’s pleaded case is that Wajilam was
                    engaged as its commission agent to provide trade finance services on the terms
                    set out in paragraphs 3 to 15 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1).
                    As already mentioned in brief at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above,
                    it was specifically pleaded (at paragraph 5) that the commission was
                    calculated by reference to the quantity of the logs bought and resold (<em>ie</em>, 14,034.038 cbm which was in fact the actual quantity
                    of logs shipped), and, based on the parties’ prior dealings, the rate of
                    commission applicable to the subject transaction was US$5 per cbm. It was not
                    disputed by Wajilam that for round logs from Sarawak, Wajilam would receive
                    commission at the rate of US$3 per cbm of the quantity of logs shipped, and for
                    round logs from Guyana, Wajilam would receive commission at the rate of US$5 per
                    cbm of the quantity of logs shipped. In his written testimony at
                    paragraph 34, Mukesh recounted his understanding with Tarun on the matter
                    of commission as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...If there was going to be any variation to the arrangements [<em>ie</em> US$3 per cbm or US$5 per cbm], my understanding
                        was that [the] parties would discuss it specifically beforehand and agree
                        upon it. [Wajilam] had clearly exhibited that it shared a similar
                        understanding insofar as it had:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Charged a commission of USD3 per cubic metre for
                            transactions from Sarawak and USD5 per cubic metre for transactions to
                            Guyana ...; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Confirmed the terms as to commission, being either
                            USD3 per cubic metre or USD 5 per cubic metre, by paragraph 9 of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The relevant part of Wajilam’s letter of
                    25 July 2007 (“the 25 July letter”) is at paragraph 9,
                    where Tarun wrote:</p>

                                T/R’s by corresponding sales accrues interest at 12%. This was
                                not discussed earlier, but common sense must be applied. Obviously,
                                the bank’s TR rate cannot apply, and hence a rate of 12% to
                                compensate for our O/D interest as well as the huge
                                inconvenience.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Mukesh confirmed that the rate or amount of
                    commission was not specifically discussed with Tarun when they spoke to arrange
                    the opening of the import letter of credit for MGA’s purchase of the PNG
                    logs from Borion. However, MGA never expected to pay anything more than US$5 per
                    cbm of the quantity of logs shipped given that the sea voyage from PNG to India
                    is shorter than the sailing time from Guyana to India. To elaborate,
                    Mukesh’s evidence was that the commission to be paid to Wajilam was to
                    compensate it for the risks involved in utilising its banking lines to open the
                    import letter of credit before the export letter of credit was opened in its
                        favour.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>(Usually, the import letter of credit is opened
                    well before the export letter of credit, which is typically opened only when the
                    vessel is near or has arrived at the discharge port.) As the sea voyage from PNG
                    to India would take an average of about 20 to 25 days (as compared to 12 to 14
                    days for a sea voyage from Sarawak to India, and 40 to 45 days for a sea voyage
                    from Guyana to India), Mukesh reckoned that the rate of commission would, at
                    most, be US$5 per cbm of the quantity of logs shipped, and not as much as
                    US$26.82 per cbm that was charged (taking US$376,477.67 ÷
                    14,034.038 cbm of logs shipped). Mukesh’s point as explained by
                    MGA’s counsel, Mr John Seow (“Mr Seow”) in his
                    closing submissions was that the factor to look at was the turnaround time
                    needed to free the credit line that was utilised and committed to a particular
                        transaction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Elaborating, Mr Seow
                        said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...the commission payable is a function of that period or the time frame
                        between the opening of the [import] LC and the export LC so that’s how
                        the ...commission rate [is] arrived at. That ...is a point I am making
                        here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Simply put, MGA’s case was that the
                    formula explained at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above had been
                    used in the past dealings between the parties, which had involved logs from
                    either Sarawak or Guyana, to determine the commission to be paid to Wajilam.
                    Although the <em>Marina I</em> shipment involved logs of
                    PNG origin, the formula by which the commission was determined was the same and
                    constituted a contractual term incorporated by the parties’ previous
                    course of dealings (hereafter referred to as “MGA’s incorporated
                    term”). Applying MGA’s incorporated term argument, Wajilam’s
                    remuneration or commission would be US$5 per cbm of the quantity of logs shipped
                    onboard the <em>Marina I</em>. MGA’s fallback
                    argument is that a reasonable sum is to be paid as commission. On the evidence
                    before the court, Mr Seow submitted that the reasonable rate of commission
                    on a <em>quantum meruit</em> basis should also be no more
                    than US$5 per cbm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In summary, MGA’s
                    position was that commission should either be US$70,170.19, or a reasonable sum
                    calculated on a <em>quantum meruit</em>
                basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Wajilam’s case on commission</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Counsel for Wajilam, Ms Tan, contended
                    that there was no implied contractual term for Wajilam to be remunerated at the
                    rate of US$5 per cbm of the quantity of PNG logs shipped onboard the <em>Marina I</em>. Rather, it was an implied term of the
                    parties’ contract that Wajilam would be paid commission at a rate or
                    amount as Wajilam deemed fit and/or reasonable. (I earlier referred to this term
                    as the “discretionary commission term” at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above.) Ms Tan submitted that the discretionary
                    commission term was a term (a) implied by conduct; or (b) implied to give effect
                    to business efficacy to the parties’ agreement; or (c) incorporated in the
                    agreement based on the parties’ previous course of dealings. In this
                    regard, Ms Tan sought to examine the conduct of the parties throughout
                    their relationship to support Wajilam’s case that on each and every
                    occasion when Wajilam had provided trade finance services to MGA, Mukesh had
                    left the rate or amount of commission to be determined by Tarun. Ms Tan
                    sought to use that <em>modus operandi</em> as the basis for
                    implying or incorporating a term that the commission rate or amount for the
                        <em>Marina 1</em> shipment would be at a rate or
                    an amount which Wajilam deemed to be fit and/or reasonable <em>in
                        its absolute discretion</em>. In the circumstances, Wajilam was
                    exercising its contractual discretion when it charged 50% of the net profit
                        (<em>ie</em>, US$376,477.67) as its commission for that
                    shipment. Accordingly, MGA’s action should be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Outline of this judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The main question to be decided in the action
                    is: what was the basis upon which Wajilam was to be paid commission? There are
                    two opposing positions: (a) MGA’s position is that it was an incorporated
                    term of the contract that Wajilam would be paid commission at the rate of US$5
                    per cbm of the quantity of the logs shipped, and (b) Wajilam’s position is
                    that the contract has an implied or incorporated term that Wajilam has absolute
                    discretion to decide the amount of commission to be paid. Ms Tan submitted
                    that the opposing views are different sides of the same coin, and as such, she
                    would only need to deal with issue (b) which is Wajilam’s case on
                    contractual discretion. I agree with Ms Tan’s submissions only to the
                    extent that if Wajilam manages to prove the existence of the discretionary
                    commission term, then obviously MGA’s incorporated term in issue (a)
                    cannot stand. However, it does not follow that MGA’s incorporated term in
                    issue (a) is proven if Wajilam cannot prove issue (b). From this perspective,
                    the parties’ opposing views on the term governing commission rate are
                        <em>not</em> different sides of the same coin, and a
                    third outcome is possible, where the court rejects the opposing views because
                    neither view is tenable. In the event, the court can hold that there was a valid
                    contract by implying a term in fact that a reasonable sum was to be paid as
                    commission. The discussions below will follow the sequence of the various
                    permutations outlined here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Wajilam’s case on contractual discretion
                    involves a consideration of two matters: First, whether the discretionary
                    commission was a term allegedly agreed orally at the discussion between Mukesh
                    and Tarun way back in June 2006 when Mukesh approached Tarun to finance
                    MGA’s Guyana log purchases (hereafter referred to as “the First
                    Transaction” and see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> below). Second, if the answer to the
                    first inquiry is in the affirmative, the next consideration is whether the
                    discretionary commission term was incorporated by a prior course of dealing(s)
                    into the agreement to provide trade finance services for MGA’s purchase of
                    PNG logs in June 2007. In my view and judging from the facts in evidence, the
                    straightforward analysis that relies on a course of dealing to enable the
                    Wajilam to rely on the discretionary commission as an incorporated term of the
                    contract is the correct way of putting Wajilam’s case. Its alternative
                    case for implication of a term (<em>ie</em>, the
                    discretionary commission) by the conduct of the parties, or implied to give
                    business efficacy to the contract is completely misconceived. Conceptual
                    difficulties make the alternative case for implication of the term hopeless, and
                    quite apart from this, there is no need for a term on discretionary commission
                    to be implied into the agreement for business efficacy. I say no more about that
                    misguided assertion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Both sides relied on prior dealings to imply
                    or incorporate the commission term. In the circumstances, to consider the main
                    question, it is necessary to now set out the past transactions in some
                    detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The history of the parties’ relationship</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Vinashin Sun/Royal transaction <em>(“the
                    First Transaction”)</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Sometime in June 2006, Mukesh approached
                    Tarun to procure Wajilam’s assistance to open an import letter of credit
                    in favour of a company in Guyana by the name of Barama Company Ltd
                    (“Barama”). Mukesh had successfully negotiated, on behalf of MGA,
                    the purchase of Guyana round logs, and needed financing. At that time, MGA had
                    credit facilities with the following three banks: Bank of East Asia, United
                    Overseas Bank, and Oversea Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC
                    Bank”); and the credit limits from those bank facilities were S$1m,
                    approximately S$1.5m, and US$2.5m respectively.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> At the material time, MGA’s
                    credit line with OCBC Bank was frozen (to use Mr Seow’s terminology)
                    on account of some problems with earlier shipments involving the vessels
                        <em>Annie Sierra</em> and <em>Trinity
                        Sierra</em>. In June 2007, at the time of the <em>Marina I</em> transaction, MGA’s bank facility with the OCBC
                    Bank was US$6m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It was at this meeting in June 2006 that
                    Tarun and Mukesh agreed to the following arrangement:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_i"></a>(i)     Wajilam would open the import letter
                        of credit in favour of Barama and also pay the freight and insurance premium
                        for the shipment of the logs from Guyana to India.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     MGA would arrange for its Indian
                        buyers to open export letter of credit in favour of Wajilam. Any cash
                        advance from the Indian buyers would be directed to
                    Wajilam.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Wajilam would then deduct, utilising the receipts from the export letter of
                        credit, the following items: (a) the expenses that would be borne by
                        MGA, and (b) Wajilam’s commission.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     Wajilam would return the balance receipts, if
                        any, to MGA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Since MGA was buying the round logs from
                    Barama on FOB terms and subsequently on-selling them to its Indian buyers on CIF
                    terms, MGA, as the party responsible for chartering the vessel to ship the logs,
                    had the opportunity to make additional profits over and above its trading
                    profits if it managed to secure cheaper freight rates. MGA initially signed a
                    fixture note for the <em>Vinashin Sun</em> in
                    May 2006, but as it turned out, the vessel was delayed and MGA had to ship
                    the logs on another vessel, the <em>Royal</em>. Later on,
                    MGA decided to purchase more logs from Barama, and this time they were shipped
                    onboard the <em>Vinashin Sun</em>. In all, the two
                    shipments of logs from Guyana to the Indian ports of Kandla and Tuticorin came
                    up to approximately 16,516.2806 cbm of round logs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Wajilam’s commission was agreed at the
                    rate of US$5 per cbm of the quantity of logs shipped. The dispute is as to how
                    the rate was arrived at, and I will come to this aspect of the dispute later.
                    More importantly, both sides conceded that, at that point in time, the
                    arrangement between them in respect of the First Transaction was contemplated as
                    a one-off transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Dynasty finance transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Shortly after the First Transaction was agreed
                    by the parties, MGA and Wajilam entered into a second trade finance transaction
                    in June 2006 (“the <em>Dynasty</em> finance
                    transaction”). This time, MGA had purchased 2,202.3228 cbm of Sarawak
                    round logs from a Malaysian company, Kayuneka Sdn Bhd
                    (“Kayuneka”), on FOB terms for the price of US$400,000. The
                    Sarawak logs were to be shipped on the vessel <em>Dynasty</em> around mid-2006 for carriage to India. Since MGA had
                    already paid for the freight, Wajilam was only required to open the import
                    letter of credit in favour of Kayuneka and to pay the insurance premium for the
                    shipment. Other than that, the same arrangement that was agreed for the First
                    Transaction applied to the <em>Dynasty</em> finance
                    transaction as well. Wajilam opened the import letter of credit in June
                    2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On the matter of commission, Mukesh testified
                    that he and Tarun discussed the rate of commission at a meeting in June 2006,
                    and it was agreed that commission was to be at the rate of US$3 per cbm for the
                    quantity of Sarawak logs shipped.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Mukesh’s
                    testimony was rejected by Tarun who denied any such discussion or
                        agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Eventually, Wajilam did not charge any
                    commission for the <em>Dynasty</em> finance transaction.
                    Tarun claimed that since MGA made a loss on the <em>Dynasty</em> shipment, Wajilam decided not to charge any
                        commission.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Simply put, it was Wajilam’s case that
                    since MGA had left it to Wajilam to decide on its own remuneration as Wajilam
                    deemed it fit and/or reasonable, it was Wajilam’s prerogative not to
                    charge any commission. By contrast, Mukesh testified that the commission rate
                    had earlier been agreed at US$3 per cbm, and the commission, which amounted to
                    about US$6600, was a small sum to forego and he interpreted the accommodation as
                    a goodwill gesture on the part of Wajilam to promote a newly developed business
                    relationship for future gains.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The four Sawarak shipments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On or about August 2006, Wajilam opened
                    letters of credit in respect of MGA’s purchases of 2,118.9149 cbm and
                    1,870.9054 cbm of Malaysian round logs of Sarawak origin, which were shipped on
                    the vessel <em>Success</em> (v4/06) and the vessel
                        <em>Seletar</em> (v6/06) respectively. The import
                    letters of credit in question were opened by Wajilam on
                    18 August 2006. There were two further letters of credit opened by
                    Wajilam for MGA’s purchases of 4,539.7389 cbm and 3,928.1249 cbm of
                    Sarawak logs, which were shipped onboard the vessel <em>Asean
                        Unity</em> (v6/06) and the vessel <em>Asean
                        Victory</em> (v8/06) respectively. The import letter of credit for the
                        <em>Asean Unity</em> (v6/06) shipment was opened on
                    18 August 2006, and the import letter of credit for the <em>Asean Victory</em> (v8/06) shipment was opened on
                    19 September 2006. Wajilam’s commission for each of the four
                    Sarawak shipments was based on the rate of US$3 per cbm of the quantity of logs
                    shipped. Tarun maintained that US$3 per cbm was the rate which he had deemed it
                    fit and/or reasonable to charge as its commission. Mukesh disagreed, arguing
                    that it had nothing to do with the alleged oral term on discretionary
                    commission. I took him as adopting the evidence in paragraph 30 of his
                    written testimony (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Royal Crystal transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The next shipment that followed was for
                    19,863.7594 cbm of Sarawak logs. After MGA had secured the supplier and Indian
                    buyers for the shipment, Mukesh approached Glory Ship Management Pte Ltd to
                    enquire about freight rates. After he learned that the freight rate would be in
                    the region of US$53 to US$55 per cbm, Mukesh decided to approach Wajilam in the
                    hope of obtaining cheaper freight. Subsequently, Tarun succeeded in chartering
                    the <em>Royal Crystal</em> at a cheaper freight rate. The
                    import letter of credit for this shipment was opened by Wajilam on
                    8 November 2006. MGA paid Wajilam 50% of the profit earned as
                    commission instead of the usual US$3 per cbm for Sarawak logs. This transaction
                    was viewed as an exception by Mukesh since Tarun had chartered the vessel
                        “<em>Royal Crystal</em>”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> He
                    also stated in his written testimony that it was specifically agreed with Tarun,
                    and this agreement was reached in “late October 2006, or early November
                    2004, or shortly after”, to pay Wajilam a commission of 50% of the profit
                    derived from the transaction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    Tarun subscribed to the opposite view arguing that Wajilam was exercising its
                    contractual discretion when it charged 50% of the profit as its
                    commission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Dana Muheiddine transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The following transaction concerned logs of
                    Guyana origin and shipped onboard the vessel <em>Dana
                        Muheiddine</em>. The import letter of credit for this purchase was
                    subsequently opened by Wajilam on 21 November 2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Before
                    that, in or about October 2006, MGA had separately purchased from Wajilam, on
                    CFR terms, a cargo of Ghanaian teak round logs which were to be shipped from
                    Takoradi, Ghana to Kandla, India, also onboard the vessel <em>Dana Muheiddine</em>. Wajilam then entered into the fixture of the
                    vessel for this transaction instead of MGA. Tarun deposed that there were no
                    discussions or negotiations on the rate of commission as the amount of
                    commission was left to Wajilam to decide. He followed the First Transaction as
                    Guyana logs were involved and adopted the same rate of US$5 per cbm of the
                    quantity of logs shipped. Mukesh agreed that the rate of commission was US$5 per
                    cbm for Guyana logs but disagreed that the rate had anything to do with the
                    alleged contractual discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The seven Sarawak shipments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     After the <em>Dana
                        Muheiddine</em> transaction, there were a total of seven shipments of
                    Sarawak logs to India: the vessels were the <em>Seletar</em> (v2/07), <em>Oriental Glory</em>
                    (v3/07), <em>Asean Unity</em> (v3/07), <em>Seletar</em> (v3/07), <em>Success</em> (v5/07),
                        <em>Asean Victory</em> (v4/07), and <em>Asean Mariner</em> (v4/07). Again at Mukesh’s request, Wajilam
                    opened import letters of credit for MGA’s purchases. The import letters of
                    credit were opened in March 2007, April 2007 and May 2007. Tarun maintained that
                    US$3 per cbm was the rate which he had deemed it fit and/or reasonable to charge
                    as Wajilam’s commission. Mukesh disagreed. As Sarawak logs were involved,
                    the applicable rate was US$3 per cbm. It had nothing to do with the alleged
                    contractual discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Marina 1 transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As stated in <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above, in early June 2007, Mukesh spoke to Tarun about
                    MGA’s purchase of 14,034.038 cbm of logs of PNG origin from Borion.
                    Subsequently, two import letters of credit were opened by Wajilam: the first was
                    on 22 June 2007, and the second one was on 2 July 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Wajilam argues that it
                    was exercising its contractual discretion when it charged 50% of the net profit
                    as its commission. This contention was rejected by MGA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Barama shipment in containers </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     This purchase of Guyana sawn timber was after
                    the <em>Marine I</em> finance transaction, but the import
                    letter of credit was opened by Wajilam in July 2007. The import letter of credit
                    was for 10,551.038 cbm of sawn timber of Guyana origin and it was, as mentioned,
                    opened in July 2007. The purchase of the Guyana sawn timber was from the company
                    Barama, and as usual, the purchase was for on-sale in India. The consignment of
                    sawn timber was shipped in containers. The parties have referred to this
                    transaction as “the Barama container shipment”. Again there was no
                    discussion or negotiation on the rate or amount of Wajilam’s commission.
                    Wajilam maintained that the rate or amount of commission was left to it to
                    decide, and that it was exercising its contractual discretion when it charged
                    the rate of US$5 per cbm as its commission. This contention was rejected by MGA.
                    I should state here that on the sixth day of trial on 18 January 2010,
                    Mr Seow informed the court that MGA had studied the accounts for this
                    shipment and was no longer seeking production of the accounts, but the issue of
                    costs remains.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Oriental Glory (v9/07) transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     This was the last transaction between the
                    parties. The shipment was for logs of Sarawak origin which were shipped onboard
                    the vessel <em>Oriental Glory</em> (v9/07). Wajilam opened
                    the import letter of credit in November 2007. Again there was no discussion or
                    negotiation on the rate or amount of Wajilam’s commission. Wajilam
                    maintained that commission was left to it to decide, and that it was exercising
                    its contractual discretion when it charged the rate of US$3 per cbm as its
                    commission. Again, this contention was rejected by MGA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The running account and the account statements </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     After the successful conclusion of the first
                    few shipments, the parties began, out of convenience, to maintain a running
                    account between them. This was largely because there would be a new trade
                    finance agreed to before the previous one was completed. The amounts due in the
                    running account would be updated from time to time in what was referred to as
                    “consolidated statements”, which were prepared by Wajilam and sent
                    to MGA for verification and acceptance. It was Soham’s responsibility to
                    verify the statements from Wajilam.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The first consolidated statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The first consolidated statement was dated
                    24 November 2006, and it reflected the running account balance as
                    US$1,602,784.98 in favour of Wajilam as at that date. The first consolidated
                    statements covered the shipments on the following vessels:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_i"></a>(i)     the Vinashin
                    Sun/Royal;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the
                        Dynasty; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the four Sarawak shipments (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Attached to the first
                    consolidated statement were the individual transaction statements
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     There was one transaction statement for the
                        <em>Vinashin Sun</em> shipment, and another for the
                        <em>Royal</em> shipment. In the <em>Vinashin Sun</em> transaction statement, an entry described as
                    “Commission to Wajilam Exports at USD 5/- per cbm” can be found
                    with the corresponding figure of US$35,777.20. In the <em>Royal</em> transaction statement, there was also an entry for
                    Wajilam’s commission at the rate of US$5 per cbm with the figure of
                    US$47,004.21 stated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For the four Sarawak shipments, each and every
                    one of the transaction statements had an entry described as “Commission
                    to Wajilam Exports at USD3/- per cbm” and the following figures:
                    US$16,562.18 for the <em>Success</em> (v4/06) transaction
                    statement; US$5,612.72 for the <em>Seletar</em> (v6/06)
                    transaction statement; US$13,619.22 for the <em>Asean
                        Unity</em> (v6/06) transaction statement; and US$11,784.37 for the
                        <em>Asean Victory</em> (v8/06) transaction
                    statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In contrast, there was <em>no</em> entry for commission in the <em>Dynasty</em> transaction statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The second consolidated statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The second consolidated statement was dated 31
                    January 2007 and the amount due from MGA to Wajilam was updated to
                    US$988,068.27. The finance transactions involving the vessels listed below were
                    included in the consolidated statement:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_i"></a>(i)     the Dana Muheiddin;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the Royal
                        Crystal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the transaction statement for the <em>Dana Muheiddin</em>, Wajilam’s commission was
                    US$45,919.47 based on US$5 per cbm. Although there was no entry for
                    Wajilam’s commission in the <em>Royal Crystal</em>
                    transaction statement, MGA was given credit for only 50% of the profit derived
                    from the <em>Royal Crystal</em> shipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The third consolidated statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The third consolidated statement was in fact
                    two statements in one and it reflected the amounts due from MGA to Wajilam on
                    two different dates. As of 31 March 2007, the amount due from MGA to
                    Wajilam was shown as US$907,133.44 whereas as of 30 April 2007, the
                    amount due, after taking into account the <em>Oriental
                        Glory</em> (v3/07) shipment, the amount due from MGA was reduced to
                    US$741,739.44. Soham confirmed the correctness of this figure of US$741,739.44
                    in an e-mail dated 17 May 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Attached to the third consolidated statement
                    were two transaction statements. In the <em>Seletar</em>
                    (v2/07) transaction statement, Wajilam’s commission rate and commission
                    amount were reflected as US$3 per cbm and US$8,496.16 respectively. The
                    commission rate and commission amount reflected in the <em>Oriental Glory</em> (v3/07) transaction statement were US$3 per cbm
                    and US$9,036.79 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The fourth consolidated statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Although the fourth consolidated statement was
                    dated 9 May 2007, it did not update the running account balance, but
                    merely supplied the supporting accounts for the period of time between the
                    second and third consolidated statements (31 March and 30 April 2007).
                    The running account balance in the fourth consolidated statement was reflected
                    as US$790,986.67. That was in fact used as the <em>opening
                        figure</em> in the third consolidated statement. Therefore, the
                    running account balance as of 9 May 2007 remained the same as the
                    amount in the third consolidated statement: the sum of US$741,739.44 in favour
                    of Wajilam.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The fifth consolidated statement and the 25 July

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The fifth consolidated statement was dated
                    19 July 2007, and it was sent to MGA as an attachment to a letter dated
                    25 July 2007 (<em>ie</em>, the 25 July
                    letter). By then, the running account balance due from MGA to Wajilam had
                    increased to US$892,700.92. The following statements were included with the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The material facts that are not in dispute
                    are:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Each and every one of the 18 finance transactions
                            was a separate and different contract. Both sides conceded that the
                            arrangement between them in respect of the First Transaction was
                            contemplated as a one-off transaction.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The agreement to provide trade finance services
                            for the <em>Marina I</em> shipment was concluded
                            orally between Mukesh and Tarun. Both representatives did not discuss
                            the rate or amount of the commission at all. Even though an important
                            point like remuneration was not discussed, both sides understood that
                            Wajilam would be paid a commission.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Neither party is taking the position that
                    there was <em>no</em> contract even though remuneration was
                    not actually discussed at the time Tarun agreed to provide trade finance
                    services to MGA for its purchase of PNG logs. Both sides relied on prior
                    dealings to imply or incorporate the commission term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">
<b><em>MGA’s incorporated term</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     MGA’s incorporated term depended on the
                    formula explained at [16] as the basis upon which Wajilam was
                    “engaged” to provide trade finance services. Mr Seow conceded
                    that his argument on MGA’s incorporated term would only succeed if the
                    court accepts Mukesh’s evidence on the formula at [16].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> In my view, Mr Seow’s argument on
                    MGA’s incorporated term is not made out due to a number of inconsistencies
                    contained in MGA’s own pleadings and evidence. First, nowhere in
                    MGA’s pleaded case was there any mention of the formula explained at [16].
                    The assertion that the commission rate per cbm was dependent on the duration of
                    the sea voyage only surfaced as a factor in Mukesh’s written evidence (see
                        <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above). Second, not only was the
                    alleged formula not pleaded, the formula is inconsistent with the position taken
                    in the pleadings. The pleaded case is that the terms of MGA’s
                    “engagement” of Wajilam’s services are those set out at
                    paragraphs 3 to 15 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1), of which
                    paragraph 5 deals specifically with commission, and how it was to be
                    calculated by reference to the actual quantity of the logs shipped and the rate
                    per cbm was dependent on the <em>origin</em> of the logs.
                    Third, the inherent inconsistencies in Mukesh’s written testimony militate
                    against the veracity of the MGA’s incorporated term. Inconsistencies can
                    be found by comparing different parts of Mukesh’s own written testimony.
                    In particular, Mukesh claimed in paragraph 34 of his written testimony that
                    the rate of US$5 per cbm was specifically intended for Guyana logs, and that the
                    parties were expected to negotiate the rate or amount of commission if the
                    origins of the logs were not Sarawak and Guyana (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above). Since it was common ground that the <em>Marina I</em> shipment was the first trade finance
                    transaction involving PNG logs, and if paragraph 34 of Mukesh’s
                    testimony is to be believed, parties would have had to <em>expressly</em> agree on the rate of commission for the <em>Marina I</em> shipment because it involved a new source of
                    logs. Hence, on the one hand, MGA was claiming that the remuneration for
                        <em>Marina I</em> had to be expressly agreed because it
                    involved a new source of logs, and on the other, it was arguing that the term of
                    remuneration was incorporated through the parties’ previous course of
                    dealings in transactions that did not involve PNG logs. Finally, even
                    MGA’s own witness, Ngui Ing Chuang (“Mr Ngui”) did not
                    support Mukesh’s testimony on the vital point that voyage duration was a
                    factor. Mr Ngui testified that, in his experience, the length of sea voyage
                    was never a consideration in determining commission in trade
                finance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Wajilam’s discretionary commission term</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     It must be remembered that there was no actual
                    discussion between Tarun and Mukesh as to the commission payable to Wajilam for
                    financing the <em>Marina I</em> shipment of PNG logs.
                    According to Wajilam’s pleaded case, it had contractual discretion to
                    decide on its own remuneration or commission. This <em>carte
                        blanche</em> authority was given at the First Transaction, and
                    repeated in subsequent shipments on the same basis. In the premises, for the
                    trade finance services provided to MGA for the purchase of the PNG logs, Wajilam
                    had deemed it fit to fix its remuneration at 50% of the net
                profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     I will first decide whether the discretionary
                    commission term was allegedly agreed orally in the First Transaction.
                    Consideration of Wajilam’s case as to incorporation which rests on a prior
                    course of dealing only arises if there is a finding that there was an agreement
                    on discretionary commission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I begin with Wajilam’s pleaded case. The
                    plea in the Defence (Amendment No 1) is that the discretion on remuneration
                    or commission was agreed between Tarun and Mukesh when they discussed the First
                    Transaction in June 2006. The relevant part of paragraph 4 of the Defence
                    (Amendment No 1) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <em>In or about June 2006, Mukesh approached Tarun and
                            orally requested the Defendant’s assistance to open a letter of
                            credit in the Defendant’s name under its own bank lines for the
                            Plaintiff’s purchase from its supplier, Barama Co Ltd of Guyana
                            round logs (“the First Transaction”) as it did not have
                            the financial ability to do so</em>. The Plaintiff informed the
                        Defendant that it had buyers, to whom the Plaintiff would be on-selling the
                        said cargo of logs at a higher price and that it would instruct the buyers
                        to open export letters of credit in favour of the Defendant if the Defendant
                        were to agree to the Plaintiff’s request. The Plaintiff also requested
                        the Defendant to pay freight charges, marine insurance premium and other
                        incidental expenses for the shipment, all of which including expenses
                        accrued in relation to the opening of the letter of credit such as bank
                        interest and bank charges would be covered by the sale vale of the cargo.
                        Further, <em>the Plaintiff’s Mukesh proposed to the
                            Defendant’s Tarun that the Defendant remunerate itself for its
                            services at such rate or amount as the Defendant deemed fit and/or
                            reasonable</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     On the question of remuneration, Tarun
                    recounted his June 2006 conversation with Mukesh in paragraph 15 of his
                    written testimony as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mukesh therefore told me that the Defendant could remunerate itself for
                        its services and/or financial assistance provided to the Plaintiff at such
                        rate or amount as I deemed fit and/or reasonable. For the First Transaction,
                        I thought it fit and/or reasonable for the Defendant to be remunerated at
                        US$5 per cubic metre of the logs and told Mukesh so at the meeting. He
                        accepted it. He left after thanking me for agreeing to help him out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In contrast, MGA’s case is that there
                    was some discussion on the amount of commission payable to Wajilam for providing
                    trade finance services in respect of the First Transaction but not in the way
                    recounted by Tarun. I interpret Mukesh’s evidence as denouncing as absurd
                    the grant of absolute discretion to Wajilam to decide on Wajilam’s
                    commission as it would be tantamount to giving Wajilam a blank cheque to fill in
                    whatever figure it wanted. He pointed out in his testimony that no businessman
                    would take an open position without first knowing the numbers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> In my judgment, Mukesh’s account of
                    the facts seemed more probable than Tarun’s version.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Mukesh explained the sequence of the
                    discussion as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I had, in the first instance, proposed that the commission to be based on
                        2% of the value of the purchase price from Barama Company Limited (inclusive
                        of freight charges). This was in line with the terms on which I had
                        previously engaged Trusha, Tat Hin, Batavai, Paragan and the defendant.
                        Mr Tarun Metha’s proposal, however was to base the commission on
                        the volume of cargo involved in the transaction. In this regard, he proposed
                        he proposed the figure of US$5 per cubic metre of timber.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Explaining further, Mukesh said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I agreed to the proposal for the defendant to charge US$5 per cubic metre
                        as their commission. I recall that I did my sums and came to the conclusion
                        that there was not much of a difference between the two bases for
                        calculating the commission payable to the defendant. Under the 2% basis of
                        calculation, the commission payable to the defendant would have been about
                        US$71,000. This is derived by aggregating the value of the purchase price
                        from Barama Company Limited of about USD2,010,000 and the approximate
                        freight charges of about USD1,533,000 and taking 2% of the result. Under the
                        USD5 per cubic metre basis of calculation, the commission payable to the
                        Defendant would have been USD83,000. This is derived by multiplying the
                        total volume of timber purchased from Barama Company Limited, which is
                        16,600 cubic metres, by USD5. Also, there were different types of timber in
                        Guyana which attracted different prices. Calculating the defendant’s
                        commission by volume of the cargo, instead of the price of the same, would
                        benefit the Plaintiff (in future transaction with the Defendant) if the
                        cargo comprised high quality timber which was very expensive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Ms Tan’s submissions focussed on
                    the manner in which the parties dealt with each other to support her contention
                    that it was not so commercially implausible to have given <em>carte blanche</em> authority to Wajilam to decide on its own
                    remuneration. She relied on Tarun’s evidence that (a) Tarun and Mukesh
                    were close friends and that Mukesh trusted Tarun to be fair and reasonable in
                    deciding Wajilam’s commission;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>
                    (b) MGA was in financial difficulties on account of two troublesome shipments
                    involving the vessels, <em>Annie Sierra</em> and <em>Trinity Serra</em> in June 2006. Against this factual matrix,
                    and being “cash strapped” as Tarun puts it in his written
                        testimony,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> MGA was in no position to dictate
                        terms.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Evidence of the state of MGA’s banking
                    facilities was put before the court. In addition, the pattern of past conduct
                    and previous course of dealings were said to bear out the existence of the oral
                    term on discretionary commission. Needless to say, Mukesh rejects the evidence
                    as completely untrue, and in any case maintained that the notion of
                    discretionary commission was commercially implausible and illogical. I will now
                    discuss the various arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Wajilam’s submission that MGA was in no
                    position to dictate terms and would have willingly agreed the term as to
                    discretionary commission in order to secure financial assistance for the First
                    Transaction breaks down at the outset. On Tarun’s testimony, the
                    discretionary commission was <em>not</em> a term that Tarun
                    had insisted on leaving Mukesh with no choice but to give in to Tarun. I refer
                    back to Mukesh’s explanation on why he was comfortable with the rate of
                    US$5 per cbm and he took it (see <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Wajilam’s claim that Mukesh and Tarun
                    were close friends was not borne out by the evidence before me. I was equally
                    not persuaded that the evidence bear out the degree or level of trust, or dire
                    financial dependence on Wajilam so that MGA was willing to grant Wajilam
                    absolute discretion to determine its own remuneration. There was no clear
                    evidence that MGA was entirely dependent on Wajilam financially. During the
                    opening stages of cross-examining of Mukesh, Ms Tan attempted to show that
                    MGA’s bank credit lines had been fully utilised around the period of
                    June 2006 so that MGA had no choice but to look to Wajilam for financial
                    assistance for its business operations. However, MGA was able to produce at the
                    trial, evidence that, at the relevant time, it still had access to its other
                    banks’ credit lines and log traders (like Tat Hin) to finance its
                    purchases from June 2006, and that it was not as financially dependent on
                    Wajilam as the latter wanted the court to believe.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Mukesh’s reason for obtaining financial
                    assistance from Wajilam was because MGA’s business was growing very fast,
                    and he had wanted to take advantage of the opportunities to do <em>more</em> business.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Whilst Tarun accepted that the rate of US$5
                    per cbm was raised by him and accepted by Mukesh, his spurious answer to
                    Mr Seow’s question as to how that particular rate was arrived at left
                    me with a negative impression that he was trying to preserve the myth of the
                    discretionary commission term. Tarun’s evidence was unsatisfactory as it
                    lacked business sense. To elaborate, Tarun said that the discretion did not
                    require him to justify the rate of US$5 per cbm. He claimed that the rate of
                    US$5 per cbm was an arbitrary figure that he had plucked out of the
                        air.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> His answer was the same when questioned
                    on the rate of US$3 per cbm for the Sarawak logs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Evidence of the sequence of the discussion may
                    plausibly be interpreted as negotiations towards an agreement: an offer from
                    Mukesh based on 2% of the purchase price of the quantity of the logs shipped
                    followed by Tarun’s counter offer of US$5 per cbm, and finally
                    Mukesh’s acceptance or acquiescence of the rate of US$5 per cbm.
                    Alternatively, even on Tarun’s testimony that it was he who had asked for
                    US$5 per cbm and Mukesh had not counter proposed anything, the fact of the
                    matter was that Mukesh did not reject the rate of US$5 per cbm for the reasons
                    explained in <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a>, and he quietly accepted
                    Tarun’s proposal. Mukesh’s evidence is that he found the rate
                    acceptable after doing some mental calculations. I prefer Mukesh’s
                    evidence as it was not improbable for a trader of his experience to know the
                    business, and to quickly make a business decision on whether the proposed rate
                    of US$5 per cbm was tolerable for him. Either analysis as explained yields the
                    same answer, and I so find, that a commission or remuneration at the rate of
                    US$5 per cbm was a term that was mutually agreed orally in June 2006 between
                    Tarun and Mukesh at the time of the agreement for the First
                Transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Ms Tan had relied on the subsequent
                    conduct of the parties after the First Transaction to further support her
                    contention that <em>carte blanche</em> authority was given
                    to Wajilam to decide on its own remuneration. Ms Tan pointed to several
                    examples to demonstrate the exercise of discretion. Broadly speaking,
                    Ms Tan maintained that in each and every finance transaction, Mukesh had
                    left the amount of remuneration to be determined by Tarun, and that pattern of
                    conduct was consistent with the existence of the oral term on discretionary
                    commission. Typically, the amount of the remuneration determined by Tarun was
                    made known in the transaction statement which Ms Tan claimed Mukesh had
                    accepted without question or discussion until the <em>Marina
                        I</em>. She also cited as examples the commission structure Wajilam
                    charged for the <em>Royal Crystal</em> shipment; the
                        <em>Dynasty</em> where commission was waived, and the
                    unilateral imposition of late payment interest by Wajilam. I will now comment on
                    the examples cited by Ms Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Ms Tan cited the <em>Royal
                        Crysta</em>l financial transaction as evidence to support
                    Wajilam’s contention. In that case, the commission was 50% of the profit
                    and MGA accepted it. Mukesh disagreed with the slant of Tarun’s evidence.
                    He said that the rate there was specifically agreed before shipment (see
                        <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above): it was agreed because Tarun
                    had secured the vessel at a freight rate lower than the prevailing market rate
                    and that enabled additional profits to be derived from the freight differential
                    (about US$3.80 per cbm). In the circumstances, Mukesh did not object to the
                    remuneration at 50% of the profit even though commission for Sarawak logs would
                    ordinarily be US$3 per cbm. In my judgment, the overall evidence point to Mukesh
                    agreeing to pay the extra remuneration. Even at 50% of the profit, which
                    translated to a rate of US$5.10 per cbm, Mukesh said he still enjoyed a savings
                    in freight albeit a smaller sum of about US$1.70 per cbm. That led to Wajilam
                    being remunerated differently from the other shipments of Sarawak logs. I refer
                    to my comments at <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> below which are
                    relevant to my finding in favour of Mukesh’s evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The other example relied upon by Ms Tan
                    as evidence of the existence of the discretionary commission was the <em>Dynasty</em> shipment where trade finance services were
                    similarly provided by Wajilam. The import letter of credit was for US$400,000.
                    As already mentioned at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above, MGA did
                    not earn any profits from the on-sale in India, and Wajilam did not charge
                    commission for the trade finance services provided. Mukesh confirmed that he was
                    alerted by Soham that Wajilam had not charged commission for the <em>Dynasty</em> transaction. He did not raise it with Tarun but
                    instead interpreted the omission as a gesture of goodwill in the interest of
                    future business seeing that the <em>Dynasty</em> was the
                    second deal, so to speak. It did not appear to me that Tarun’s decision to
                    forego remuneration was a point decidedly in favour of Wajilam’s
                    contention. I should mention that I agree with Mr Seow that it would have
                    been more probable that the parties would have discussed commission for this
                    second transaction as both parties conceded that the First Transaction was
                    one-off in that at that time no further or future transactions were contemplated
                    by the parties. Mukesh said that the parties agreed to the commission rate of
                    US$3 per cbm of the quantity of Sarawak logs shipped. Tarun’s version is
                    that there was no discussion on commission for the <em>Dynasty</em> transaction; commission was left to Wajilam to decide
                    and the rate of US$3 per cbm was an arbitrary figure he had plucked out of the
                    air (see <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Ms Tan also drew attention to the fact
                    that Wajilam had imposed interest on the outstanding balance in the running
                    account at 12% per annum and MGA had accepted it without objection thereby
                    demonstrating that MGA were willing to accept any term imposed by Wajilam.
                    According to Ms Tan, late payment interest of 12% per annum was first
                    imposed in November 2006. At that time, the balance due to Tarun was $1.6m from
                    the First Transaction. Mukesh’s evidence was that he had accepted the 12%
                    interest because it was a relatively small amount compared to the volume of
                    business that was coming in at that time.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> I
                    saw that as an example of another charge that was mutually acceptable to both
                    sides, and I do not accept the slant given to the evidence by
                Wajilam.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Ms Tan also suggested that the commission
                    stated in the transaction statements submitted to MGA were final and conclusive
                    so as to constitute evidence of Wajilam’s unfettered authority to charge
                    whatever commission it fancied. In my view, the contention is untenable.
                    Returning to the First Transaction, the commission there was discussed and
                    agreed by the parties. Mukesh said the same thing happened for the <em>Dynasty</em> and <em>Royal Crystal</em>
                    finance transactions but this was disputed by Tarun. Leaving aside for a moment
                    the First Transaction as well as the finance transactions involving the
                        <em>Dynasty</em> and the <em>Royal
                        Crystal</em>, it is common ground that for the other subsequent
                    transactions, commission was not discussed before the agreement to provide trade
                    finance services, but it was understood (and this is common ground) that
                    commission would be paid. For those transactions, typically, the commission or
                    remuneration would be stated on the transaction statement. However, MGA was not
                    bound by the transaction statement. MGA was entitled to review, verify and
                    revise the figures submitted in the transaction statement. It was not a case
                    where MGA was <em>not</em> entitled to open up or revise
                    the figures there. I find that the individual statements and consolidated
                    statements submitted to MGA were capable of verification and acceptance by MGA.
                    Indeed paragraph 1 of the 25 July letter is consistent with this finding.
                    It reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have prepared the accounts exactly as agreed between us. I will also
                        recap for you below, the broad basis on which the accounts are drawn up. If
                        you think there is an account that is made up differently from what was
                        originally discussed between us, you are welcome to point it out. <em>The amount as presented needs your perusal and confirmation by
                            the end of this month</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Of significance is paragraph 9 of
                    Wajilam’s 25 July letter that recapitulated the agreed rates for logs
                    from Sarawak and Guyana, and recognised, at the same time, that if Wajilam had
                    chartered the vessel as was the case for the <em>Royal
                        Crystal</em>, the commission rate of US$3 per cbm for Sarawak logs
                    would not apply. By implication, this meant that the rate would have to be
                    separately agreed and this point corroborates Mukesh’s evidence outlined
                    in <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above. The same rates of commission
                    contained in the 25 July letter were used for the <em>Barama</em> container shipment (completed after 25 July 2007)
                    and the <em>Oriental Glory</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Notably, by 25 July 2007, Wajilam had
                    financed a total of 17 shipments of logs originating from Sarawak and Guyana and
                    destined for India. The 17 shipments were financed over a period of 13 months
                    from June 2006 to July 2007 (including the Barama Container shipment). I am
                    satisfied that the letter of 25 July was written at a time when the trade
                    finance relationship had settled down and the parties were content with the
                    existing arrangements. In view of this, the alleged discretionary term, if it
                    ever existed, was supplanted by the 25 July letter. In addition, since PNG
                    logs had never been financed before the <em>Marina I</em>
                    shipment, the alleged discretionary term, if it existed since the First
                    Transaction, could not have been applicable to PNG logs. Quite naturally,
                    paragraph 9 of the 25 July letter did not mention PNG logs from the
                    commercial relationship recorded in the letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     I disbelieve Tarun’s evidence on the
                    discretionary commission term for another reason. It was quite clear that MGA
                    financed the purchase of the PNG logs by arranging with Wajilam to open the
                    import letters of credit using its banking facilities. Wajilam’s
                    expectation was to be repaid the value of the import letters of credit opened on
                    MGA’s behalf (“the principal sum”), expenses incurred by
                    Wajilam in relation to this advance, and late payment interest at the rate of
                    12% per annum. In addition to all that, MGA was expected to pay a commission to
                    Wajilam who assisted in the finance of the purchase of the PNG logs. Based on
                    the arrangement, Wajilam played the role of a financier, and not that of an
                    investor. However, Tarun used words like “invested” and
                    “equity participation” in cross-examination to explain why in his
                    discretion it was fit to charge 50% of the net profit for the <em>Marina I</em> finance transaction. It became obvious that the true
                    reason for Wajilam’s decision to charge 50% of the net profit as its
                    commission was that he had regarded Wajilam as being an <em>equal
                        equity partner</em> in the <em>Marina 1</em>
                    finance transaction and he had simply wanted a share in the profits for making
                    the transaction possible. The relevant portions of his oral evidence are set out

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In my judgment, there is no evidence that the
                    parties were to share equally in the profits. Tarun maintained without any basis
                    that what Wajilam did should be equated to having invested capital in the
                    business. As I said, this was not the arrangement. There was no agreement or
                    common understanding between Tarun and Mukesh to the effect that Wajilam and MGA
                    were equal parties in the <em>Marina I</em> venture.
                    Crucially, the charge of 50% of the net profit is plainly equivalent to a
                    payment on a participation basis. The discretionary commission as an implied
                    term argued for by Ms Tan seeks to give Wajilam a right to equal
                    participation when it was never agreed. The alleged implied term would have the
                    effect of making Wajilam equal parties in the venture and serve only to replace
                    Wajilam’s agreed role as financer (which was akin to a bank giving credit
                    facilities) with that of an investor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the opposing positions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In summary, the overall evidence do not bear
                    out Wajilam’s assertions that the trade finance services were consistently
                    provided by Wajliam based on a rate or amount of commission that was left to the
                    absolute discretion of Tarun. In my judgment, Wajilam’s assertion on
                    discretionary commission fails. Equally, the evidence militates against
                    MGA’s incorporated term that the rate of commission was US$5 per cbm of
                    the quantity of PNG logs shipped onboard the <em>Marina
                        I</em>. For the same reasons set out above, I find that there was no
                    agreed rate or amount of commission payable to Wajilam in respect of the trade
                    finance services provided to MGA for its purchase of PNG logs shipped onboard
                    the <em>Marina I</em>. In other words, there was no agreed
                    basis upon which Wajilam was to be paid commission on either of the opposing
                    views.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Now that the opposing views have been rejected
                    as completely untenable, the legal position on the facts in evidence is that the
                    court will imply a term that a reasonable sum is to be paid as commission. It is
                    not disputed that commission was payable by MGA to Wajilam. What was not
                    expressly mentioned was the rate or amount of the commission. In the
                    circumstances, the court will imply that a reasonable sum would be paid as
                    commission. I will be assessing the quantum of the commission in another part of
                    the Judgment (see [112 - 126]). In the meantime, I digress to
                    address, for completeness, two related sub-issues in Wajilam’s case on
                    contractual discretion. The sub-issues are: (a) incorporation by prior dealings,
                    and (b) unfettered discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Incorporation of an oral term by prior course of dealing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Wajilam’s case as to incorporation rests
                    on a prior course of dealing. The question is whether the discretionary
                    commission term (assuming it existed for the purpose of the discussion here) was
                    incorporated by a prior course of dealing into the <em>Marina
                        I</em> finance transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The cases on incorporation usually concern the
                    making of contracts and the incorporation of one party’s written terms of
                    business. There are cases where there was a course of dealing and the other
                    party knew that the plaintiff intended to deal on the terms of its delivery
                    notes or invoices with standard terms printed on the reverse side (<em>eg Circle Freight International Limited v Medeast Gulf Exports
                        Limited</em> [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 427
                        (“<em>Circle Freight</em>”). In other
                    words, prior course of dealing was relied upon as importing one party’s
                    standard terms and conditions into the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It is not controversial that incorporation of
                    terms by prior course of dealing is an objective one. The factors to consider
                    for incorporation of terms by prior dealing is succinctly summarised in the case
                    of <em>Capes (Hatherden) Ltd v Western Arable Services
                        Ltd</em> [2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 477 (“<em>Capes (Hatherden) Ltd v Western Arable Services
                    Ltd</em>”) at [35] in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Incorporation of terms by prior course of dealing is a question of fact
                        and degree. It depends on the number of previous contracts, how recent they
                        are, and their similarity in terms of subject-matter and the manner in which
                        they were concluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Similarly, E. Peel, <em>Treitel: The Law of Contract</em> (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        12<sup>th</sup> Ed., 2007) states the consideration as
                    follows (at p 244):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Of course the terms will not apply if the transaction in question was not
                        part of a <em>consistent</em> course of dealing; if the
                        transactions were spread over a long period of time and their number was so
                        small that they could not be said to give rise to a course of dealing; if
                        the steps necessary to incorporate the clause had never been taken at any
                        stage of the dealings between the parties or if the terms of each
                        transaction in the series had been separately negotiated and expressly
                        agreed between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In <em>Hollier v Rambler Motors
                        (AMC) Ltd</em> [1972] 2 QB 71, the plaintiff’s car was
                    repaired by the defendant on three or four occasions over a period of five
                    years. On two occasions, the plaintiff had been asked to sign a form excluding
                    liability for damage caused by fire to the customer’s car on the premises.
                    On the occasion which was the subject of claim, there had been an oral contract
                    to repair the car without being asked to sign a form excluding liability. The
                    Court of Appeal held that the exclusion of liability in the defendant’s
                    standard form was not incorporated into the oral contract. Salmon LJ held that
                    three or four transactions over five years were not a sufficient course of
                    dealing. One other ground that could have been relied upon (but was not) was the
                    fact that the pattern of previous dealing between the parties had not been
                    consistent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The course of dealing in the <em>Circle Freight</em> case consisted of 11 contracts in the
                    previous six months (between March and August 1983). On each occasion, the
                    contract had been made orally by telephone but the invoice for the carriage
                    charges sent at a later date had stated that all business was transacted by the
                    carrier under the conditions of the Institute of Freight Forwarders
                    (“ITF”). The Court of Appeal held that the ITF conditions were
                    incorporated into the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Returning to the pleaded case Wajilam states
                    at paragraph 7 of the Defence (Amendment No 1) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In addition to the First Transaction (which consisted of shipments onboard
                        two vessels, MV “Royal” and MV “Vinashin Sun”,
                        as stated in paragraph 6 of the Defence herein), there were altogether
                        a total of 17 other transactions and/or requests made by MGA of Wajilam. The
                        said transactions were effected pursuant to distinct and separate agreements
                        between the parties. It was a term of each agreement between the parties for
                        each of these 17 transactions that the remuneration to Wajilam would be at a
                        rate or amount as Wajilam deemed fit and/or reasonable. This term was
                        implied by conduct and/or implied so as to give effect to business efficacy
                        and/or intention of the parties. Further or alternatively, this term was
                        incorporated by a course of dealings between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The authorities above concern the
                    incorporation of written terms into the contract. On this occasion, Wajilam is
                    seeking to incorporate an oral term into an oral agreement. Ms Tan did not
                    refer me to any cases where the term to be incorporated into an oral agreement
                    was an oral term. Be that as it may, the test to be satisfied “is not
                    what the parties actually thought were their rights and liabilities but what
                    each by his words and conduct led the other party to believe were the
                    liabilities which he was accepting and the concomitant rights which he was
                    granting” (per HHJ Havelock-Allan QC, sitting as a High Court Judge in
                        <em>Capes (Hatherden) v Western Arable</em> at p 484).
                    In that regard, where there is a course of dealing between parties the court
                    must examine the whole of it to see what the position is. In this case, even if,
                    for the sake of argument, there was as pleaded such an oral term on
                    discretionary commission at the outset of the First Transaction, the discretion
                    on commission would have been supplanted by the 25 July letter which
                    negated any intention of incorporation in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     That is not all. To succeed, not only must the
                    pattern of previous dealing between the parties have to be consistent, there
                    must be evidence that MGA knew that whenever Wajilam provided trade finance
                    services, it would be on the basis of the discretionary commission. Apart from
                    the one occasion in June 2006 where it was alleged that Mukesh left it to the
                    discretion of Tarun to decide on its own remuneration (<em>ie</em>, the First Transaction), Tarun’s evidence, as I recall,
                    is that commission was never discussed in subsequent transactions. That brings
                    to focus the absence of continuous notice of such a term which is a factor
                    against incorporation. In addition, Wajilam had not financed PNG logs for MGA
                    before June 2007. In June 2006, at the time the First Transaction was discussed,
                    Tarun and Mukesh did not contemplate other future transactions. In the
                    circumstances, it is not reasonable to hold that when Wajilam agreed to open an
                    import letter of credit for MGA’s purchases in June 2006 (<em>ie</em>, the First Transaction), Wajilam had done so on the
                    basis that for future purchases (including PNG logs) its remuneration would be
                    left to Wajilam to decide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     On the related point as to whether there was a
                    consistent course of dealing, the evidence is conflicting on the aspect of
                    Wajilam’s role. For instance, in paragraph 9 of Mukesh’s
                    written testimony, he explained the role of the third party who made available
                    its letter of credit facilities to Mukesh as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the sake of good order, I should explain that even though I was using
                        the services of the three companies to procure the issuance of documentary
                        letters of credit to my suppliers in Malaysia, this was where their
                        involvement with my business started and ended. I had the sole
                        responsibility of sourcing for suppliers and buyers in Malaysia and India
                        respectively and negotiating the terms of the transaction with them. I also
                        bore the risk and losses (if any) for each of the transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In earlier transactions, Tarun accepted
                    Wajilam’s role as financer. However, when it came to the <em>Marina I</em>, Tarun claimed a bigger role which was not
                    discussed and agreed to in the <em>Marina I</em> finance
                    transaction (see <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a> - <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Mukesh and Tarun’s idea of
                    Wajilam’s role was quite different and, hence, there was no consistency in
                    their prior dealing and the <em>Marina I</em>. In the
                    circumstances, I am not persuaded by Wajilam’s plea that the discretion to
                    determine the rate or amount of commission was to be implied from the previous
                    course of dealing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A subsidiary point: unfettered discretion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I will briefly comment on
                    Ms Tan’s submission that Wajilam’s discretion was absolute and
                    there was no requirement for Wajilam to justify at all its decision to charge
                    50% of the net profit as its commission.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    A contractual discretion is not usually as
                    unfettered as Ms Tan would like this court to believe. The authorities on
                    contractual discretion recognise that there is a corresponding expectation that
                    the discretion would be exercised fairly and rationally. Guidance can be drawn
                    from <em>Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald International</em>
                    [2005] ICR 402 (“<em>Horkulak</em>”), an employment case, on the court’s approach
                    to contractual discretion at [30]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... while, in any such situation, the parties are likely to have
                        conflicting interests and the provisions of the contract effectively place
                        the resolution of that conflict in the hands of the party exercising the
                        discretion, it is presumed to be the reasonable expectation and therefore
                        the common intention of the parties that there should be a genuine and
                        rational, as opposed to an empty or irrational, exercise of discretion. Thus
                        the courts impose an implied term of the nature and to the extent
                        described.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Rix LJ in <em>Socimer Bank
                        Ltd v Standard Bank Ltd</em> [2008] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 558
                        (`“<em>Socimer</em>”) summarised the
                    position in relation to exercise of contractual discretion as follows (at
                    [66]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is plain from these authorities that a decision-maker’s
                        discretion will be limited, as a matter of necessary implication, by
                        concepts of honesty, good faith, and genuineness, and the need for the
                        absence of arbitrariness, capriciousness, perversity and irrationality. The
                        concern is that the discretion should not be abused. Reasonableness and
                        unreasonableness are also not concepts deployed in this context, but only in
                        a sense analogous to Wednesbury unreasonableness, not in the sense in which
                        that expression is used when speaking of the duty to take reasonable care,
                        or when otherwise deploying entirely objective criteria: as for instance
                        when there might be an implication of a term requiring the fixing of a
                        reasonable price, or a reasonable time. In the latter class of case, the
                        concept of reasonableness is intended to be entirely mutual and thus guided
                        by objective criteria.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In <em>JML Direct v Freesat
                        UK Ltd</em> [2009] EWHC 616, Blackburn J referred to
                        <em>Socimer</em> and <em>Horkulak</em> as authority for the proposition that discretion
                    conferred on one party by the other is not wholly unfettered contractual
                    discretion. As Rix LJ observed in <em>Socimer</em>, the
                    concern is that the discretion is not abused. Hence, the courts will impose an
                    implied term that the discretion should be exercised in good faith and not
                    arbitrarily, capriciously or irrationally. “Irrationally” in this
                    connection, (Blackburn J accepts the explanation in <em>Socimer</em>) is not an objective test of reasonableness but is used
                    in an analogous sense to the <em>Wednesbury</em>
                    unreasonableness (see <em>Socimer</em> at
                [66]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    The courts will not intervene so long as the
                    contractual “discretion is exercised honestly and in good faith for the
                    purposes for which it was conferred, and provided also that it was a true
                    exercise of discretion in the sense that it was not capricious or arbitrary or
                    so outrageous in its defiance of reason that it can be properly categorised as
                    perverse” (see <em>Ludgate Insurance Co Ltd v
                        Citibank</em> [1998] Lloyd’s Rep IP 221 at [35]
                    summarising the principles drawn from cases like <em>Weinberger v
                        Inglis</em> [1919] AC 606; <em>Dundee General
                        Hospitals Board of Management v Walker</em> [1952] 1 All

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    With these principles in mind, I turn to
                    Tarun’s evidence on this matter. Both sides have confirmed through counsel
                    that a commission of US$376,477.67 is equivalent to a rate of US$26.82 per cbm
                    of the quantity of logs shipped (<em>viz</em>, 14,034.038
                    cbm). This rate at US$26.82 per cbm was more than five times the highest rate of
                    US$5 per cbm that was experienced in their commercial relationship. Was
                    Wajilam’s decision to fix an amount that was five times more than what MGA
                    had previously paid as commission made honestly and in good faith such that it
                    can be said that the exercise of discretion was not capricious, arbitrary, or
                    irrational?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Wajilam’s case was that it was not
                    required to justify the exercise of its absolute discretion. Tarun nevertheless
                    gave the following reasons for charging 50% of the net profit as commission for
                    the <em>Marina 1</em> finance transaction:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_i"></a>(i)     Wajilam had effectively paid for
                        the freight as the cargo was purchased on CNF terms;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the total amount of the import
                        letters of credit was approximately US$5,832,000 ;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     the export letters of credit for
                        the Marina 1 transaction were usance letters of credit for 180 to 270
                        days, in contrast to the typical usance period for the Sarawak shipments of
                        90 to 120 days, and 120 to 180 days for the Guyana shipments;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_108-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     the running
                        account, at that time, showed that MGA owed Wajilam an amount somewhere
                        between US$741,739.44 and US$892,700.92 (see the third and fifth
                        consolidated statements at <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>-<a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> and <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    I did not believe that the matters listed
                    above contained the real reasons. First, the fact that Wajilam had financed the
                    purchase on CNF terms was in effect no different from other trade financing
                    where the freight component of the transaction was on, the facts, a common
                    feature of all the previous transactions, with the single exception of the
                        <em>Dynasty</em> transaction (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>-<a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>
                    above). Second, while Wajilam had asserted that factors (ii) and (iii) listed
                    above had increased the period of its financial exposure and, therefore,
                    justified an increased remuneration rate, this argument was simply not borne out
                    by the evidence: except for minor interest payments and charges, the <em>Marina 1</em> transaction, was completed within two
                    months after the import letters of credits were opened (when the last export
                    bill was discounted). It was one of the fastest transactions completed.
                    (Ms Tan confirmed in her closing submissions on 15 March 2010 at
                    p 8 that discounting of usance bills took place between 27 August 2007
                    to 11 September 2007.) Furthermore, the fact that the running account
                    balance was in favour of Wajilam did not in itself provide justification for
                    charging a rate of more than five times the usual rates, especially when Wajilam
                    was <em>already</em> charging interest at 12% per annum for
                    late payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Simply put and adopting Mukesh’s
                    expression, MGA earned “handsome” profits from the <em>Marina I</em> shipment and Wajilam wanted a share of the
                    profits. I repeat the two separate occasions during cross-examination which gave
                    an insight into Tarun’s reasons for charging such a high commission: (a)
                    Wajilam was an <em>equal equity partner</em> in the
                        <em>Marina 1</em> finance transaction and (b) it
                    was Wajilam’s financial support which was the single contribution that
                    made the transaction possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    At the risk of repetition, Wajilam was never
                    an equity partner as that was not the arrangement. In my view, and I find that
                    it was on account of this desire to share the “handsome” profits
                    that that the discretionary commission was invented. MGA made substantial
                    profits for the <em>Marina I</em> shipment and the Barama
                    container shipment. The receipts from both transactions were sufficient to clear
                    the deficit in the running account as well as pay Wajilam 50% of the profit as
                    commission for the <em>Marina I</em> finance transaction.
                    Wajilam was unilaterally cast as an equity party who had contributed financially
                    to make the transaction possible. However, this was clearly not permissible for
                    the reasons stated (see <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a> –
                    <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> above). There was no evidence that the
                    parties were to share equally in the profits from the <em>Marina
                        I</em> shipment. As a result of these findings, I concluded that
                    Wajilam was not entitled to charge the remuneration sum of US$376,477.67 for the
                        <em>Marina 1</em> shipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Contractual Quantum Meruit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Wajilam did not advance an alternative claim
                    for <em>quantum meruit</em>. However, MGA’s pleaded
                    case is that Wajilam was entitled to be paid a reasonable sum as commission
                    since it was envisaged that Wajilam would be paid for providing trade finance
                    services (<em>ie</em>, remunerated fairly).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    A <em>quantum
                        meruit</em> claim may be based in contract or in restitution (what the
                    older cases term as quasi-contract). In the High Court decision of <em>Rabiah Bee bte Mohamed Ibrahim v Salem Ibrahim</em>
                    [2007] 2 SLR(R) 655, Prakash J described the two types of
                    claims (at [123]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would be noted from the above that two types of <em>quantum meruit</em> exist <em>viz</em>
                        contractual <em>quantum meruit</em> and, secondly,
                        restitutionary <em>quantum meruit</em>. Where there is
                        an express or implied contract which is silent on the quantum of
                        remuneration or <em>where there is a contract which states
                            that there should be remuneration but does not fix the quantum, the
                            claim in quantum meruit will be contractual in nature</em>. Where,
                        however, the basis of the claim is to correct the otherwise unjust
                        enrichment of the defendant, it is restitutionary in nature. It is also
                        relevant that there cannot be a claim in <em>quantum
                            meruit</em> if there exists a contract for an agreed sum and there
                        cannot be a claim in restitution parallel to an inconsistent contractual
                        promise between the parties. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    After considering the evidence,
                    Prakash J went on to find that, despite the parties failure to specifically
                    discuss remuneration terms, there was an implied term, on the facts, that the
                    plaintiff would be remunerated at a reasonable sum for her management services
                    (at [125]-[126]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The oral agreement was rather general and vague. Besides agreeing on
                        the profit split, the remuneration for the work done was not specifically
                        discussed. The manner in which the defendant characterised the claim
                            <em>viz</em> the distribution of the profits was
                        unduly narrow as the two are not mutually exclusive. They are inversely
                        related. One decides the expenses prior to calculating the profit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">126 From the beginning of the venture, the defendant was riding on the
                        plaintiff's expertise in choosing suitable properties for investment,
                        purchasing and sprucing them up and sometimes engaging in their maintenance
                        and management. The venture was attractive to him because of this expertise
                        of the plaintiff and because he knew that she would be on the ground in
                        London to do all this work and it would not be left to a stranger. It should
                        also be remembered that the parties were contemplating acquiring a number of
                        properties not just one or two. The plaintiff asserted 50 whilst the
                        defendant maintained they were only thinking of 20. Even that latter number
                        is a big one, however, and sourcing, renovating and managing 20 properties
                        even if not all 20 needed to be worked on at the same time could reasonably
                        be envisaged to require a substantial amount of time and energy. When the
                        parties divided the responsibilities under the venture, they expressly
                        agreed that these duties would be carried out by the plaintiff. <em>It is not inconsistent with that term to imply a term that the
                            plaintiff should be remunerated for such work on a reasonable sum
                            basis</em>. If the parties had both carried out this portion of
                        the venture or some of it through a stranger, they would definitely have had
                        to pay fees and those fees would have been chargeable as part of the
                        expenses of the venture before the profit calculations took place. I
                        therefore find that there is a contractual basis in this case for a claim in
                            <em>quantum meruit</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Similarly, in <em>Gold Coin
                        Ltd v Tay Kim Wee</em> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 575
                        (“<em>Gold Coin Ltd</em>”) the Court of
                    Appeal upheld the lower judge’s finding that an implied promise to pay a
                    reasonable commission is to be treated as an implied term in contract
                    (at [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In considering this ground of appeal, it seems to us important to point
                        the exact nature of the claim to a <em>quantum
                            meruit</em> by Mr Tay. It is contractual in nature, in
                        contrast to another type of <em>quantum meruit</em>
                        claim which is quasi-contractual: for the distinctions, see <em>Halsbury's Laws of England</em>, vol 9 (Butterworths, 4th
                        Ed) para 692. The implied promise to pay a reasonable commission, as found
                        by the learned trial judge, is and should properly be treated in the same
                        way as other implied terms in the law of contract. We are satisfied that the
                        learned trial judge had, contrary to the submissions advanced on behalf of
                        the employers, properly applied the principles adumbrated in <em>Way v Latilla</em> [1937] 3 All ER 759.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    The question whether a court should imply a
                    term that a reasonable sum is to be paid, even though no price had been
                    specifically agreed, is a matter of construction and depends on the objective
                    intention of the parties (<em>British Steel Corporation v
                        Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co Ltd</em> [1984] 1 All
                    ER 504):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is plain from the familiar trilogy of cases which show that no hard
                        and fast rule can be laid down but that the question in each case is
                        whether, on a true construction of the relevant transaction, it was
                        consistent with the intention of the parties that even though no price had
                        been agreed a reasonable price should be paid (<em>May &amp;

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Since MGA’s pleaded case is that
                    Wajilam was entitled to commission as it was envisaged that Wajilam would be
                    paid for providing trade finance services (<em>ie</em>,
                    remunerated fairly), a term that Wajilam would be remunerated at a reasonable
                    sum is to be implied in fact into the <em>Marina I</em> arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    This leaves open for determination one
                    question: what is reasonable or fair remuneration for the trade finance services
                    provided by Wajilam for MGA’s purchase of PNG logs. The amount of
                    recompense depends on what Wajilam did and what is reasonable. Normally, it is
                    the claimant who has the burden of adducing evidence to support what is a
                    reasonable recompense. There is evidence of what Wajilam did but there is no
                    evidence from Wajilam as to what a reasonable fee would be for a transaction of
                    this sort. It can be argued that while in principle Wajilam might be entitled to
                    a reasonable remuneration, there was no evidence from Wajilam on which I can
                    determine what that remuneration is. Wajilam has not even as a precautionary
                    measure adduced any evidence to address, in the alternative, a <em>quantum meruit</em> payment. On the other hand, MGA tried to
                    lead evidence on what this reasonable remuneration might be to assess the amount
                    due to Wajilam by way of <em>quantum meruit</em> for the
                    trade finance services provided to MGA for the purchase of PNG
                logs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    MGA called as its witness Mr Ngui whom
                    MGA put forward as an “expert” witness. Mr Ngui gave
                    evidence, which I accept, that there is no known “market rate” in
                    business. There is no universal practice, nor any “market custom”
                    which would be adhered to where some matters had not been expressed between
                    parties dealing in log trade financing of the sort that took place. In the
                    circumstances, there was no place or need for so-called “expert”
                    evidence. However, from Mr Ngui’s own experience, it appears that
                    commissions for log trade financing are usually agreed and fact-sensitive
                    depending on the particular transaction. The rates are usually fairly low
                    because of the very thin profit margins in the log and timber trade. (In the
                    case of the <em>Marina I</em>, MGA was able to make
                    additional profits from the freight rates which were over and above its trading
                    profits.) It is quite clear that there is no practice that is applied invariably
                    if nothing is stipulated by the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    MGA has pleaded that Wajilam was entitled to
                    be remunerated at a reasonable rate in accordance with “market
                    rate”. In my view, the absence of a “market rate” is not
                    fatal so long as there is evidence before me on which I can determine what a
                    reasonable commission is.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    On the issue of what would be a reasonable
                    rate or amount of remuneration on a <em>quantum meruit</em>
                    basis for the trade finance services provided by Wajilam, I accept that that is
                    a question of fact but a decision as to a reasonable rate of remuneration
                    involves not merely fact but the application of judgment by the court in
                    determining reasonableness. I will now examine what evidence is available to
                    assist the court to arrive at a reasonable rate of commission or remuneration.
                    Wajilam led no evidence but that is not the end of the inquiry. I have to form
                    the best view I can on the best evidence available in the present
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Mr Seow has helpfully referred me to
                    the case of <em>Way v Latilla</em> [1937] 2 All
                    ER 759 for the approach that the court could take. For instance, the court
                    may look at evidence of the value each party placed on the relevant services as
                    observed by Lord Atkin (at 764):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But, if no trade usage assists the court as to the amount of the
                        commission, it appears to me clear that the court may take into account the
                        bargainings between the parties, not with a view to completing the bargain
                        for them, but as evidence of the value which each of them puts upon the
                        services. <em>If the discussion had ranged between 3 per cent
                            on the one side and 5 per cent on the other, all else being agreed, the
                            court would not be likely to depart from somewhere about those figures,
                            and would be wrong in ignoring them altogether and fixing remuneration
                            on an entirely different basis, upon which, possibly, the services would
                            never have been rendered at all. That, in fixing a salary basis, the
                            court may pay regard to the previous conversation of the parties was
                            decided by the Court of Exchequer in 1869, in Scarisbrick v Parkinson,
                            where the terms of an agreement, invalid under the Statute of Frauds,
                            were held to be admissible as evidence in a quantum meruit. This seems
                            to me to be good law, and to give effect to a principle which has been
                            adopted regularly by the courts not only in fixing remuneration for
                            services but also in fixing prices, sums due for use and occupation,
                            and, indeed, in all cases where the court has to determine what is a
                            reasonable reward for the consideration given by the
                        claimant</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Although it is not entirely clear from the
                    written judgment whether <em>Way v Latilla</em> was a case
                    where a term for reasonable remuneration was implied into an employment contract
                    (contractual <em>quantum meruit</em>) or a case where no
                    contract came into existence because the arrangement between the parties was too
                    uncertain (restitutionary <em>quantum meruit</em>), the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Gold Coin Ltd</em> seemed to prefer
                    the view that <em>Way v Latilla</em> was a case of
                    contractual <em>quantum meruit</em> and was thus applicable
                    to the appeal before it (see <a href="#p1_116">[116]</a> above).
                    The Court of Appeal went on to determine that the assessment of reasonable
                    commission for the respondent’s services was to be calculated at the
                    commission rate at which the appellant itself would have paid its other salesmen
                    (at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We now turn to the appeal against the learned trial judge's assessment of
                        $80,000 and the imposition of interest at $20,000. It is clear to us that
                        the parties had agreed to give Mr Tay an incentive for his
                        contributions to the profitability of the Hatchery Division which over the
                        six years totalled $1.4m after tax. Mr Tay's role in the performance
                        was crucial. The salesmen of the employers used to get commission which, for
                        example, for 1981 was $13,000. Mr Arnet thought that $4,000 per year as
                        the commission or incentive was reasonable, which would have amounted to
                        $24,000 over the six years. On the other hand, Mr Tay had claimed
                        $162,369.10 on the basis of the number of chicks sold at two-cents-per-chick
                        commission. Half of this claim based on one-cent-per-chick commission
                            <em>which was paid to the salesmen of the
                            employers</em> would throw up the figure of some $81,000. We would
                        ourselves therefore agree that $80,000 is a reasonable assessment in all the
                        circumstances. We also think that the $20,000 interest is also fair.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    MGA subpoenaed one Dolly Ng Lay Kuan, an
                    employee of Tat Hin, to testify on the trade finance that Tat Hin had provided
                    to MGA for its purchase of PNG logs. She confirmed that MGA had to pay as
                    commission the rate of 1.5% of the CNF value of the logs from PNG in the year
                    2004 (“the Tat Hin transaction”). In monetary terms, the
                    commission there was US$23,879.32 (equivalent to the rate of 1.5% of the CNF
                    value). Mr Seow submitted that, based on the quantity of logs actually
                    shipped for that transaction, the figure of US$23,879.32 can be translated into
                    a remuneration rate of around US$5.10 per cbm. Ms Tan pointed out that the
                    logs from PNG were transhipped at Port Klang and the witness was not asked
                    whether the freight component in the Tat Hin transaction was only for freight
                    from Port Klang to India, or whether it included freight from PNG to Port Klang.
                    As the witness was not asked to clarify her evidence, Ms Tan submitted that
                    her testimony was unreliable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    The Tat Hin transaction was in 2004 and MGA
                    had paid commission based on 1.5% of the CNF value. There is evidence that in
                    June 2006, MGA had placed a value on Wajilam’s services, based on
                    Mukesh’s own testimony, at 2% of the CNF value which he claimed was in
                    line with his own experience with Trusha, Tat Hin, Batavai, Paragan and even
                    Wajilam (see his explanation at <a href="#p1_72">[72]</a> above).
                    That is all the best evidence available before me to help arrive at a reasonable
                    rate of remuneration or commission for financing a shipment of PNG logs to
                    India. As already mentioned by Mukesh, the use of the price of the quantity
                    shipped as a method to calculate commission would benefit Wajilam if the logs
                    were of a better quality (see <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> above),
                    which would be the case for PNG logs (Ms Tan confirmed in her closing
                    submissions that PNG logs have a relatively high value). In the circumstances,
                    the best view is to take the rate at the highest possible end of the bracket.
                    Wajilam can scarcely complain having not adduced any evidence on the
                    matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    I, therefore, find that a reasonable
                    commission for Wajilam’s services for the <em>Marina
                        I</em> is 2% of the CNF value of the PNG logs shipped. However, I have
                    difficulty in determining the CNF value as there is no documented evidence as to
                    who paid the US$400,000 as freight (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>
                    above). Hence, I will adopt the undisputed figure of US$5,832,000 (being the CNF
                    letter of credit value) as the CNF value of the PNG logs shipped. Accordingly,
                    Wajilam is to refund the over deduction with interest thereon at the agreed rate
                    of 12% per annum from 5 June 2008 (the day immediately after expiry of the
                    e-mail demand of 4 June 2008) to the date of payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Miscellaneous matters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    An issue that arose at the trial concerned a
                    payment which Wajilam made to MGA’s buyers in India, K R Patel. The
                    complaint was that MGA was not told about the buyer’s dispute, and as such
                    the purported payment to K R Patel was unauthorised. This complaint was not part
                    of MGA’s pleaded case, and leave to amend the pleadings was not sought in
                    order to introduce and give particulars of this additional dispute. Besides,
                    there is no evidence before the court to explain the K R Patel matter. In
                    the circumstances, I need not deal with this matter, and say no more about
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In the result:-</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The remuneration due to Wajilam for the <em>Marina I</em> transaction is US$116,646.00 being 2%

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">MGA is entitled to the repayment of US$259,837.67
