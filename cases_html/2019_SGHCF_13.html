</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">The $300,000 contributed by the Husband’s mother</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 I will first deal with the $300,000 contributed by the Husband’s mother. A presumption of resulting trust arose in favour of the Husband’s mother since equity presumes that when one party makes a voluntary payment towards a property, he or she did not intend to benefit the other through a gift (<span class="font-italic">Shi Fang v Koh Pee Huat</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 906 at [11]). This presumption of resulting trust, however, is displaced by a presumption of advancement that operates within a parent-child relationship by presuming that when the Husband’s mother contributed $300,000 towards the purchase of the Pasir Panjang Property, it was intended to be a gift to her son, the Husband (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 at [56] – [59], [67] and [77]). To rebut this presumption of advancement, the Husband must produce evidence that the $300,000 from his mother was not intended to be a gift, but a loan. This he has not done. The Husband failed to produce any documentary evidence evidencing a loan, whether to him or to Parties jointly, nor was there any affidavit from the Husband’s mother that could have supported his claim. Further, there was no attempt by the Husband’s mother to claim any beneficial interest in the Pasir Panjang Property. For the reasons above, I am satisfied that the $300,000 contributed by the Husband’s mother is a gift to the Husband. It is therefore to be taken as the Husband’s direct contribution towards the Pasir Panjang Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 For completeness, I note that there is a presumption that a parent’s contribution towards the purchase of his or her child’s matrimonial home is presumed to be a gift for the benefit of both the husband and wife (<span class="font-italic">A</span><span class="font-italic">ng Teng Siong v Lee Su Min</span> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 908 at [28]). This presumption, however, is not applicable to this case as the Pasir Panjang Property is not a matrimonial home, but an investment property: see for example, <span class="font-italic">Beh Chin Joo and another v Chu K</span><span class="font-italic">ar Hwa Leonard </span>[2018] SGHC 17 at [99].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">The $35,000 contributed by the children</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Parties have agreed that the $35,000 contributed by the Children is a loan from the Children to the Wife. Unlike bank loans, this is a liability that is borne by the Wife alone. It should therefore not be deducted from the gross value of the Pasir Panjang Property when determining the net value of the property. Similar to the treatment of the $300,000 gift from the Husband’s mother to him as his direct contribution, the $35,000 loan from the Children to the Wife is also to be taken as her direct contribution towards the Pasir Panjang Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) UOB SRS Fixed Deposit Account</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The Parties’ difference in valuation of the Husband’s UOB SRS Fixed Deposit Account arose from the fact that the Husband used the amount as at 30 November 2016, while the Wife used the amount as at 31 December 2016.

</div> In support of her submission, the Wife relied on <span class="font-italic">ARL v ARM </span>[2015] SGHC 61, where the High Court held at [41] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In order to arrive at a just and equitable division in the present case, it is appropriate to take into account the Defendant’s direct financial contribution of $55,890 … made up to the point of the hearing. This approach is also consistent with the wording of s112(2) of the WC … Nothing in s 112 of the WC dictates that only contributions up to the date of the grant of interim judgment can be taken into account …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I accept the Wife’s submission despite the position taken by her earlier. The court can deviate from the general position that the cut-off date for direct contributions is the hearing date of the ancillary matters if it is necessary to achieve a just and equitable division. However, I am not satisfied that the Husband’s contribution of approximately $333,372 towards the two matrimonial properties, which were for payments of mortgages and expenses connected with these properties, justifies a deviation from this general position. I therefore adopt the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters as the cut-off date.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The Husband had submitted that the $300,000 contributed towards the Pasir Panjang Property by his mother was a loan and is hence not part of his direct financial contributions.

</div> I have dealt with this at [17] above, and found that the $300,000 was a gift to the Husband that is taken to be his direct financial contribution towards the Pasir Panjang Property. Even if the $300,000 is a loan to the Husband, it is still to be taken to be his direct financial contribution.

This is a dual-income marriage that lasted 31 years and, even though the Wife had the assistance of a domestic helper, the Husband did not allege that the Wife delegated all the household responsibilities to the domestic helper. Nevertheless, the engagement of a domestic helper did reduce the burden of the Parties’ homemaking and caregiving responsibilities (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [27]).

</div> and these would have affected the amount of time that he could otherwise devote to his family.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Assessing the evidence, I find that the ratio proposed by the Wife to be overly generous, and I am of the view that an indirect contribution ratio of 70.0:30.0 between the Wife and the Husband would be just and equitable. I am guided by the following dual-income long marriage cases:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">TPY v TPZ and another appeal </span>[2017] SGHCF 2 (“<span class="font-italic">TPY v TPZ</span>”), the parties were married for about 13 years, worked full-time and relied on a domestic helper substantially for homemaking and caregiving. The wife was the main supervisor of the domestic helper. The court found the ratio of indirect contributions to be 60:40 in favour of the wife.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">UTJ v UTK</span> [2019] SGHCF 6 (“<span class="font-italic">UTJ v UTK</span>”), the parties were married for 41 years, worked full-time and relied on a domestic helper who was supervised by the wife. The wife retired in 2004, and parties divorced on May 2015. The Husband contributed to the bulk of the family expenses. The court found the ratio of indirect contributions to be 60:40 in favour of the wife.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">UNE v UNF</span> [2018] SGHCF 12 (“<span class="font-italic">UNE v UNF</span>”), the parties were married for 29 years, have two adult children and worked full-time. The wife worked full-time for around 19 years of the marriage before assuming the role of a homemaker for the final 10 years. The wife was the main caregiver. The court found the ratio of indirect contributions to be 75:25 in favour of the wife.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The ratio of 70.0:30.0 is in line with the cases above. I have awarded the Wife a higher indirect contribution ratio of 70% as compared to the 60% found in both <span class="font-italic">TPY v TPZ </span>and <span class="font-italic">UTJ v UTK</span> because the Wife made a more significant indirect contribution by single-handedly caring for the Children (including the twins) while the Husband pursued his master’s degree abroad in 1995. In <span class="font-italic">UNE v UNF</span>, the court awarded an indirect contribution ratio of 75% to the wife because she took unpaid leave and relocated with the husband to Canada for a year for his employment, and also assumed the role of a homemaker for the last ten years of their marriage (<span class="font-italic">UNE v UNF</span> at [75] and [79]). Since the Wife in the present case has continued working full-time throughout, it would be inappropriate to adopt the higher ratio used in <span class="font-italic">UNE v UNF</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Step 3: Average ratio</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Based on the circumstances of the case, the average ratio of contributions may be adjusted by giving different weights to direct and indirect contributions (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [27]). Factors affecting the weightage include the length of the marriage, the size of the matrimonial assets and its constituents, and the extent and nature of the indirect contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Wife submitted that in the light of the fact that Parties were married for 31 years with three adult children, and that she had supported the Husband while he was pursuing his master’s degree abroad, the court should give more weight towards the Parties’ indirect contributions.

I accept the Wife’s submission that in a long marriage of 31 years with three adult children, the indirect contributions made by the Parties would have been more pronounced.

She is also currently working full-time, and earns a monthly salary of $5,697.20. I note though that she is already 59 years old this year.

In so deciding, I have taken into consideration that this was a 31-year old marriage, the role of the Wife in bringing up the Children, the number of working years left before she reaches retirement age, and the four times greater earning power of the Husband. The maintenance will be for a period of five years. And while the Husband used to contribute $2,350 per month towards household expenses, it included payments for the upkeep of the Bishan Property,
