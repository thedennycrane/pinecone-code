<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the sentence imposed
                    by a Senior District Judge ("the SDJ") in <em>PP v Syamsul
                        </em><em>Hilal bin Ismail</em>
                    [2011] SGDC 147 ("the GD"), where the Respondent pleaded guilty to 18
                    charges. Fifteen of those charges were for cheating offences (punishable under
                    s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“PC”)) and the remaining three involved criminal breach of trust
                    (“CBT”) (punishable under s 406 of the PC). The cheating
                    offences related, <em>inter alia</em>, to a car rental scam
                    (“the car rental scam offences”) and a loan scam (“the loan
                    scam offences”), while the three CBT offences involved the
                    misappropriation of school laptops (“the laptop CBT offences”).
                    Another 72 charges were admitted and taken into consideration for the purpose of
                        sentencing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Respondent was sentenced to two
                    months’ imprisonment for each car rental scam offence, three months’
                    imprisonment for each laptop CBT offence and five months’ imprisonment for
                    each loan scam offence. One imprisonment term from each set of offences was
                    ordered to run consecutively, making a total of 10 months’ imprisonment.
                    The prosecution appealed on the ground that the overall sentence imposed by the
                    SDJ was manifestly inadequate. I allowed the prosecution’s appeal and
                    enhanced the total sentence to 15 months’ imprisonment by ordering one
                    additional five month imprisonment term (for a loan scam offence) to run
                    consecutively. I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondent committed four broad categories
                    of offences. He admitted to the Statement of Facts (which pertained to the first
                    three categories only) without qualification. The four categories are briefly
                    described below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(a)   Car rental scam offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In July 2010, the Respondent posted online
                    advertisements on websites such as www.gumtree.sg and www.cars.sg-rentals.com
                    named “Hari Raya Cars 2010 Specials (Last Minute Cars)”, offering
                    car rental deals. From mid-August 2010, he met interested parties and entered
                    into rental agreements with them which he signed using a fictitious name. He
                    even gave one complainant a test drive.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The victims handed deposits, ranging
                    from $50<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> to $550<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, over to him. He later became
                    uncontactable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(b)   Laptop CBT offences</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Between April and June 2010, the Respondent
                    misappropriated 14 Temasek Junior College (“TJC”) laptops which
                    were entrusted to him as a technical assistant attached to the school. He sold
                    them to pay off his debts. Earlier in March 2010, the Respondent had also
                    misappropriated a laptop from Jurong Secondary School. The 15 laptops were
                    individually valued at between $1,504 to $2,201.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(c)   Loan Scam offences committed while on bail</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Respondent was charged in court on
                    13 September 2010 pursuant to complaints relating to the car rental scam
                    offences. While on bail between December 2010 and February 2011, he committed
                    the loan scam offences. These offences largely involved advertisements on online
                    fora such as www.gumtree.com.sg and flashloan.sgpsg.com where he purportedly
                    offered to arrange loans (expressly including loans to low-income
                        earners).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> To add credibility to his
                    ruse, the Respondent also created an online form for the victims to fill
                        up.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The victims were asked to make advance
                    payments ranging from $40 to $2,000 to the Respondent. Again, he later became
                    uncontactable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(d)   Remaining offences committed while on bail</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In the same period in which he committed the
                    loan scam offences, the Respondent also committed what I will refer to as the
                    “employment scam” and the “Paypal credits scam”
                    offences. The charges pertaining to these offences were not proceeded with but
                    were admitted by the Respondent to be taken into consideration. The Statement of
                    Facts did not elaborate on these charges. Briefly, from the charge
                        sheets,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> the employment scam saw the
                    Respondent pretending to offer his victims employment as Information Technology
                    store assistants or technicians. He then dishonestly induced his victims to pay
                    sums of between $50 to $70 to him as deposit payments for uniforms. As for the
                    Paypal credits scam, the two relevant charge sheets<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> stated that the Respondent
                    deceived his victims into believing he was able to offer them Paypal credits. He
                    then dishonestly induced his victims to pay him $234 and $354 (on the two
                    charges respectively) as payment for the Paypal credits which he could not
                    provide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The amounts involved in each set of the offences

                    punishable under s 420 of the PC. For ease of reference, I set out the
                    salient portions of ss 415 and 420 of the PC here:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The laptop CBT offences were punishable under
                    s 406 of the PC. Accordingly, I likewise set out the salient portions of ss

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Therefore, the maximum custodial sentence
                    which could be imposed for each of the car rental scam and the loan scam
                    offences was 10 years’ imprisonment; and the maximum custodial sentence
                    which could be imposed for each of the laptop CBT offences was 7 years’
                    imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Senior District Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The SDJ noted that the key aggravating factors
                    were that the Respondent had reoffended (<em>ie</em>,
                    referring to the loan scam offences) soon after being charged in court, the
                    large number of offences and victims and the premeditation and planning involved
                    (GD at [21]). While the SDJ did not
                    accord the Respondent’s unrelated antecedents (pertaining to traffic
                    offences) any weight (GD at [20]), he
                    gave the Respondent’s plea of guilt minimal credit since the Respondent
                    made no restitution and had reoffended while on bail (GD at [16]). Nevertheless, it would appear that he
                    did accord a small measure of credit to the Respondent’s plea of guilt for
                    the resources and inconveniences which that plea had saved (GD at [31]). The SDJ also found it immaterial
                    whether the Respondent’s offences were motivated by his desire to clear
                    his debts (GD at [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Although the SDJ accepted that it was relevant
                    to consider the fact that the Respondent targeted low-income earners in the loan
                    scam, he rejected the Deputy Public Prosecutor’s (“the
                    DPP’s”) submission that the victims of the loan scam were
                    “in debt and in genuine need of help”, which assertion was not
                    reflected in the Statement of Facts (GD at [19]). As for the fact that the car rental and loan scams
                    involved Internet advertisement postings, the SDJ found that fact
                    “neither here nor there” (GD at [32]) since the same scams could have been perpetrated through
                    other channels such as traditional print media.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Moving on to sentencing precedents, the SDJ
                    considered <em>Choong Swee Foong v PP</em> (MA 152/94/01
                    – unreported, cited in <em>Sentencing Practice in the
                        Subordinate Courts</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) ("<em>Sentencing Practice</em>") at p 424) as relevant to the
                    laptop CBT offences (GD at [24]); and
                        <em>Goh Siew Buay v PP</em> (MA 54/99/01 –
                    unreported, cited in <em>Sentencing Practice</em> at
                    pp 477 – 478) in relation to the cheating offences. As <em>Goh Siew Buay</em> involved a sum of $200,000 and the total
                    amount obtained by the Respondent was only $38,000, the SDJ took one-fifth of
                    the sentence in <em>Goh Siew Buay</em> (28 months’
                    imprisonment) as the starting point for determining the appropriate sentence for
                    the Respondent which meant four to five months’ imprisonment<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> (GD at [24] to [27]). It seemed
                    to me that here the SDJ had made an arithmetic mistake as one-fifth of 28
                    months’ imprisonment would be between five to six months’
                    imprisonment and not four to five months.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The SDJ noted, quite rightly, that an
                    aggregate sentence of four to five months’ imprisonment was manifestly
                    inadequate and that he was minded to scale up the sentences. He then, having
                    stated that his provisional view was that the total sentence range would have to
                    be closer to nine to 10 months’ imprisonment (GD at [28]), went on to determine the sentences for
                    the individual charges. In determining the sentences for the loan scam charges,
                    the SDJ considered that they merited a higher sentence as they were committed
                    while the Respondent was on bail (GD at [30]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Finally, I noted that at [8] of the GD, the SDJ stated that
                    “[f]ourteen victims fell prey to the loan scam and they were cheated of
                    $6,609 in all.” I should, however, point out that that was inaccurate as
                    the schedule of offences and charge sheets show that there were only eight
                    charges in respect of the loan scam. Of the six charges remaining, four were in
                    respect of the employment scam and two related to the Paypal credits scam. In
                    any case, nothing turned on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appellant's case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     First, Deputy Public Prosecutor Leong Wing
                    Tuck (“DPP Leong”) submitted that the Respondent’s use of
                    the Internet in relation to the car rental scam and the loan scam was an
                    aggravating factor and that the SDJ was mistaken in failing to consider it as
                    such. Second, he argued that the SDJ gave insufficient consideration to the
                    extent of pre-meditation involved. In relation to the car rental scam, the
                    Respondent had gone so far as to set up a test drive and to use fictitious names
                    and addresses in rental agreements which he entered into with the victims.
                    Third, DPP Leong averred that the SDJ had erred in failing to consider as
                    aggravating the fact that the Respondent had specifically targeted persons
                    celebrating Hari Raya. The impact of the offences on the victims and their
                    families went beyond the mere loss of their rental deposits and included the
                    severe disruption of familial arrangements and expectations. Fourth, regarding
                    the laptop CBT offences, DPP Leong submitted that the SDJ had failed to
                    sufficiently consider the number of the laptops misappropriated and the ensuing
                    consequences for the relevant schools and their students. Fifth, DPP Leong
                    contended that the SDJ had failed to sufficiently consider the magnitude and
                    aggravated impact the loan scam would have on the low income victims whom the
                    Respondent had specifically targeted. Finally, he emphasised that the SDJ, in
                    determining the aggregate sentence, had failed to sufficiently consider the
                    aggravating factors, <em>ie</em>, the large number of
                    victims and the sentencing objectives of deterrence and
                retribution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In this regard, DPP Leong clarified that in
                    making the aforesaid submissions the prosecution was not taking issue with the
                    sentences passed for each of the individual offences. What the prosecution
                    sought was that more of the sentences passed should have been ordered to run
                    consecutively so that a longer aggregate custodial sentence would be imposed
                    having regard to the total culpability of the Respondent for the charges
                    proceeded against him as well as those taken into account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As an illustration, DPP Leong pointed out that
                    had the prosecution proceeded only on the three charges for the loan scam
                    offences, the Respondent would also have received an imprisonment sentence of 10
                    months. This is because s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 states
                    that at least two of the Respondent’s imprisonment sentences for those
                    offences would have to run consecutively. DPP Leong also highlighted the
                    trajectory of the Respondent’s criminal conduct. Although his <em>modus operandi</em> for the car rental scam involved him
                    meeting his victims, his <em>modus</em> for some of the
                    loan scam offences which he committed while on bail did not require him to meet
                    the victims at all and allowed him to cheat the victims under the cloak of
                    anonymity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In summation, DPP Leong submitted that given
                    the aggravating factors, the aggregate sentence should have been in the region
                    of 18 months’ imprisonment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> He also highlighted the fact that there was an
                    apparent dearth of appellate court authority on cases involving the cheating of
                    relatively modest amounts of money from a large number of victims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> He asked that guidance be given to the lower
                    courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Counsel for the Respondent,
                    Mr Sathinathan, submitted that the SDJ had sufficiently considered all the
                    factors and points raised by the prosecution, including the extent of
                    premeditation involved and the large number of victims. In respect of the car
                    rental scam, Mr Sathinathan argued that the Internet advertisements only
                    served as a lure for the victims. It was the Respondent’s persuasiveness
                    at his meetings with the victims that caused them to part with their monies and
                    it was at these meetings that the “actual cheating”
                    occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mr Sathinathan also emphasised that no
                    special computer background was required to adopt the Respondent’s
                        <em>modus operandi</em> of posting Internet
                    advertisements and online forms to lure victims. In addition, he pointed out
                    that the first of the loan scam offences in fact arose from an Internet
                    advertisement placed by the victim (and not the Respondent) who was looking for
                    a loan. This was what alerted the Respondent to the presence of such loan
                    seekers on the Internet and led him to put up fake Internet advertisements and
                    online forms to take advantage of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Principles governing appellate intervention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It is trite law that an appellate court should
                    only intervene in the sentence imposed by a lower court where (i) the judge
                    below erred with respect to the proper factual basis for sentencing; (ii) the
                    judge below failed to appreciate the materials placed before him; (iii) the
                    sentence was wrong in principle; or (iv) the sentence was manifestly excessive
                    or manifestly inadequate, as the case may be: <em>PP v
                        UI</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>. As will be made clear below, factors (iii) and (iv) were
                    particularly germane for this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The SDJ’s approach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Before I move on to explain my perception as
                    to the appropriate sentence for the offences in question, some observations
                    should be made of the SDJ’s sentencing approach. It was apparent from the
                    GD that the SDJ first took the provisional view that a global sentence of around
                    nine to 10 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for all the offences
                    which the Respondent had committed and on that basis worked backwards to
                    determine the sentence per charge for each of the three categories of offences
                    proceeded on (see [28]–[30] and [34] of the GD). Undoubtedly, his provisional view on the global
                    sentence to be imposed on the Respondent had directly influenced his
                    determination of the appropriate sentence for each of the individual
                    offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In my view, the better and more logical
                    approach would have been to first determine the sentences for the individual
                    offences by having regard to the respective sentencing precedents, before
                    stepping back for a holistic perspective in order to determine which sentences
                    should be ordered to run consecutively to make for an appropriate global
                    sentence. This two-stage approach was alluded to by V K Rajah JA in
                        <em>ADF v PP and another appeal</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 874 (“<em>ADF v PP</em>”) at
                    [92]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Where multiple distinct offences have been committed, sentencing is a
                        two-stage process. First, the sentence for each individual offence had to be
                        determined. Second, the court has to determine whether the sentences for
                        these multiple offences ought to run concurrently or consecutively and
                        if consecutively, which combination of sentences ought to be made and
                        whether the overall sentence properly comprehends the criminality of the
                        multiple offender ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Keeping the two stages distinct would allow
                    for a more principled approach in determining the appropriate sentence to be
                    imposed for each individual offence than if the court were to determine the same
                    by working backwards from a pre-conceived global sentence. This is because a
                    court would generally not be able to properly comprehend the overall criminality
                    of the multiple offender (so as to determine an appropriate global sentence)
                    unless it first comes to grips with the individual offences by going through the
                    exercise of determining the appropriate sentence for each offence (in this case,
                    due to the large number of charges, beginning by determining an appropriate
                    sentence per charge for each of the categories of offences would have been
                    acceptable), having regard to the applicable sentencing precedents. To begin by
                    first considering and determining the appropriate global sentence would be like
                    putting the cart before the horse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In any case, as stated above at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>, the prosecution did not challenge the
                    adequacy of the individual sentences passed for each of the charges proceeded
                    with. However, it challenged the global sentence of ten months’
                    imprisonment imposed by the SDJ. It is to this challenge that I now
                turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Determination of the number of sentences to run
                consecutively</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Having distinguished between the first and
                    second stages of the sentencing process for an offender who has committed
                    multiple distinct offences (see above at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>), the court in <em>ADF v PP</em> went
                    on to distinguish “sentence specific aggravating factors” and
                    “cumulative aggravating features” (also at [92]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... If sentence specific aggravating factors are present, the sentence for
                        each particular offence should be appropriately enhanced. <em>Cumulative aggravating features, on the other hand, are features that
                            ordinarily have primary relevance at the second stage of sentencing,
                            particularly as regards to the issue of whether the global sentence
                            should be enhanced by consecutive sentencing, when multiple distinct
                            offences have been committed.</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, cumulative aggravating factors are key considerations for
                    the second stage, when the court has to determine how many of the sentences
                    imposed for the individual offences should be ordered to run
                    consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     This is an appropriate juncture to refer to
                    s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“the old CPC”), which states that where at least three
                    imprisonment sentences are imposed for distinct offences, at least two of those
                    imprisonment sentences must run consecutively:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Consecutive sentences in certain
                            cases.</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18. Where at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment
                        for at least 3 distinct offences, the court before which he is convicted
                        shall order that the sentences for at least two of those offences shall run
                        consecutively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This provision of the old CPC applied for charges proffered before
                    2 January 2011 (see r 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Transitional
                    Provisions – Further Proceedings and Joint Trials) Regulations 2011). For
                    charges proffered on or after 2 January 2011, the equivalent provision is
                    at s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (as stated above at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>) which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Consecutive sentences in certain
                            cases</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">307. —(1)   Subject to subsection (2), if at one
                        trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least
                        3 distinct offences, the court before which he is convicted must order
                        the sentences for at least 2 of those offences to run
                        consecutively. </p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would be seen that, in substance, there is no real difference
                    between what was provided in the earlier s 18 and the current
                    s 307(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Therefore the court has the discretion, where
                    at a trial a person is sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct
                    offences, to order that more than two imprisonment sentences should run
                    consecutively. In <em>ADF v PP</em>, the court discussed
                    some cumulative aggravating factors and how they should guide the exercise of
                    this discretion (at [146]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... A decision to impose more than two consecutive sentences
                        ought not to be lightly made and, indeed, should usually only be imposed in
                        compelling circumstances. ... Multiple wrongdoing by a multiple wrongdoer as
                        a general rule must be viewed more severely than single offending involving
                        similar offences. The community (and the victim(s)) have suffered more
                        because of the greater harm done. Often the exercise of this discretion will
                        involve intuitive (and not mathematical) considerations and calibration that
                        takes into account the totality of the criminal behaviour. There is no rigid
                        linear relationship between the severity of the offending and the length of
                        the cumulative sentence. In my view, an order for <em>more than</em> two sentences to run consecutively ought to
                        be given serious consideration in dealing with distinct offences when one or
                        more of the following circumstances are present, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)     dealing with persistent or habitual

                        reiterate that the above circumstances are non-exhaustive and should not be
                        taken as rigid guidelines to constrain or shackle a sentencing court's
                        powers. Beyond this, I do not think that it will be helpful to spell out how
                        this discretion must be exercised. Myriad permutations of offending can take
                        place and too dogmatic or structured an approach would constrain effective
                        sentencing. <b><em>In the ultimate analysis, the court has to

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The large number of victims</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The third cumulative aggravating circumstance
                    identified in <em>ADF v PP</em> was that of multiple
                    victims. As this case involved a large number of victims, it was not surprising
                    that the SDJ imposed three consecutive sentences. The question which the
                    prosecution raised, however, was whether, even though three sentences were
                    ordered to run consecutively, the total sentence so imposed was adequate
                    punishment for the overall criminality of the Respondent’s conduct so as
                    to reflect society’s abhorrence of the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In support of his submission that the
                    foregoing question should be answered in the negative, DPP Leong cited the case
                    of <em>PP v Fernando Payagala </em><em>Waduge </em><em>Malitha Kumar</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 334 (“<em>Fernando</em>”),
                    which involved credit card fraud. In that case, Rajah JA set out various factors
                    to be considered in the sentencing of credit card offences (see [38]–[54] of <em>Fernando</em>). One of these factors was the number of offences
                    committed, which the court elaborated on at [46]-[48]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46     As both a matter of common sense and
                        general principle, it can be said that the larger the number of offences
                        committed, the longer the custodial sentence. The application of this
                        principle in credit card offences is amply illustrated by <em>Mihaly </em><em>Magashazie</em> (<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> <em>supra</em>), where the court concluded that the
                        numerous fraudulent purchases made by the accused justified the imposition
                        of longer custodial sentences. The massive number of charges in <em>Rohaazman bin Ali</em> (<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> <em>supra</em>) also proved to be a relevant
                        consideration for the court in sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48     The nexus between the number
                        of offences and quantum involved was also discussed in the <em>Law Gazette Article</em>. Lee Teck Leng observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[T]he total sentence imposed on an offender convicted of multiple
                            charges would still bear some semblance to the sentence that may be
                            passed in a case where an offender is convicted of a <em>single</em> cheating offence involving the same sum of money.
                            This is due to the fact that from the victim's view point, the sentences
                            to be imposed should not, logically speaking, depend greatly on whether
                            the victim was cheated a hundred times amounting to a total of $250,000
                            or cheated once to the tune of $250,000. Having said that, it is also
                            quite clear that an offender who has cheated a victim of small amounts a
                            hundred times over is a serial offender and he would rightly be regarded
                            as being more culpable than an offender who cheated only once, albeit of
                            a large sum. <b><em>Amalgamating both perspectives, it
                                would appear that the total sentence imposed on the serial cheat
                                would probably be slightly higher than the sentence imposed on an
                                offender convicted of a single cheating offence, if the total
                                quantum is identical in both instances</em></b>. [emphasis added
                            in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To this, I would add that sentences meted out in serial cheating cases
                        should not be only "slightly higher" as compared to that assigned to a
                        single offender for the same quantum. The sentence could in the appropriate
                        circumstances be <em>significantly</em> higher.
                            <em>A serial offender would be hard put to credibly
                            submit that his conduct was the result of a momentary
                            indiscretion</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I agreed with the prosecution that those statements were equally
                    applicable in the present case even though it did not involve credit card fraud.
                    In the circumstances of this case, the Respondent had demonstrated himself to be
                    a serial cheat by resorting to the car rental and loan scams. It stands to
                    reason that his sentence should be significantly higher than if he were
                    convicted of only a single cheating offence, albeit that the total amounts
                    involved in both scenarios are the same or similar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the present case, there was a total of 75
                    charges brought against the Respondent for cheating. Notwithstanding that some
                    of those 75 charges were for offences which involved the same victim, the fact
                    remained that the Respondent had cheated and caused much distress and
                    inconvenience to some 70 people. While I appreciate that determining a
                    proportionate punishment for a crime involved an exercise of discretion by the
                    lower court which the appellate court should not lightly interfere with, it
                    seemed to me that the SDJ did not focus sufficiently on the total criminality of
                    the Respondent. As stated above at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>, the
                    prosecution had quite rightly pointed out that had the prosecution proceeded
                    only on the three charges for the single category of the loan scam offences, the
                    Respondent would already have received an imprisonment sentence of 10 months. In
                    my view, this was a clear indicator that the number of consecutive sentences
                    imposed by the SDJ was not adequate to encompass the overall culpability of the
                    Respondent’s conduct (see <em>ADF v PP</em> at [146],
                        <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> <em>supra</em>). In <em>PP v Tan Fook
                        Sum</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022 at [16], Yong Pung How CJ (“Yong
                    CJ”) held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The essence of the retributive principle, then, is that the offender
                        must pay for what he has done. The idea is that punishment restores the just
                        order of society which has been disrupted by his crime. It follows that the
                        punishment must reflect and befit the seriousness of the crime. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">To my mind, the global sentence imposed by the SDJ was clearly
                    insufficient to address the harm caused to the Respondent’s various
                    victims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The use of the Internet</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I should now turn to address the significance
                    of the Respondent’s use of the Internet to perpetrate his crimes. In this
                    regard, the prosecution submitted the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The learned SDJ had erred in law and in fact, in failing to consider as an
                        aggravating factor, the fact that by posting the rental and loan
                        advertisements on the internet websites and forums, the Respondent was able
                        to reach a much wider pool of potential victims.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>ADF v PP</em>,
                    another identified cumulative circumstance which militates for the imposition of
                    more than two consecutive sentences is a pressing public interest in
                    discouraging the type of criminal conduct being punished (see <em>ADF v PP</em> at [146], <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> <em>supra</em>). I also note that in <em>PP
                        v Huang Hong Si</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 57 (“<em>Huang Hong Si</em>”), Choo Han Teck J stated (at
                        [11]) that the public interest was
                    one of the four major distinctive aspects of the degree of seriousness of a
                    crime. In relation to the prosecution’s submission, I accept that the use
                    of the Internet is a relevant sentencing consideration in that there is a strong
                    public interest to deter potential offenders from using that medium to reach a
                    larger number of potential victims. In <em>PP v Law Aik
                        </em><em>Meng</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 814,
                    Rajah JA held at [27]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27     <em>General deterrence is

                            In <em>Angliss</em> ([16] <em>supra</em>), I had specified that public interest in sentencing
                        is tantamount to the court's view of how public security can be enhanced by
                        imposing an appropriate sentence. <em>A sentencing judge
                            should apply his mind to whether the sentence is necessary and justified

                            offenders.</em> For example, given the current climate where
                        international and domestic terrorist security threats are more prevalent
                        than before, bomb hoaxers must inexorably be visited with draconian
                        sentences. (See <em>PP v Mohammad Farhan bin Moh
                            Mustafa</em> District Arrest Case No 1808 of 2004 where the
                        accused was sentenced to three and a half years' imprisonment for a bomb
                        hoax; the senior district judge correctly declared at [14] that "it [was] clear that the
                        sentencing of [such] offences ... must be treated seriously and that a
                        strong deterrent be sent to those whose idle minds might otherwise turn to
                        creating false alarms".) Such offences are easy to commit and difficult to
                        detect and could become rampant if not firmly dealt with. <em>A clear signal must be unequivocally sent by the sentencing court,
                            through an appropriate sentence, that such behaviour will be perennially
                            viewed with grave and unrelenting disapprobation.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In my view, insufficient consideration was
                    given by the SDJ in respect of the public interest element which was that
                    like-minded potential offenders should be deterred from following the
                    Respondent’s footsteps in using the Internet to prey on a large pool of
                    potential scam victims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In this regard, I must deal with the case of
                        <em>Rupchand Bhojwani Sunil v PP</em> [2004]
                    1 SLR(R) 596 (“<em>Rupchand </em><em>Bhojwani</em>”), which was helpfully highlighted to me
                    by Mr Sathinathan. In that case, Yong CJ reduced the offender’s
                    sentence for cheating (punishable under s 417 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed)) from 12 months’ imprisonment to six
                    months’ imprisonment for the reason, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the district judge had over-emphasised the fact of
                    Internet misuse. There, the offender had intercepted an Internet order for
                    certain products and proceeded to collect US$42,000 <em>via</em> telegraphic transfer from the person who made the order. He
                    did not deliver the products and eventually pleaded guilty to
                cheating.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In sentencing the offender to 12 months’
                    imprisonment, which was the maximum sentence at the time, the district judge
                    relied on dicta from <em>Tay Kim Kuan v PP</em> [2001]
                    2 SLR(R) 876 and <em>PP v Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal
                        </em><em>Luddin</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 653. However, Yong CJ held that the reasoning in those two
                    cases was not applicable to the case of <em>Rupchand
                        Bhojwani</em>. Regarding the former case, the reasoning behind the
                    deterrent sentence was the protection of the young and gullible from the sexual
                    perils of the Internet (at [22] of
                        <em>Rupchand Bhojwani</em>). As for the latter case, it
                    was distinguished on the basis that it involved pure Internet misuse, as opposed
                    to a cheating offence as was the case in <em>Rupchand
                        Bhojwani</em> (at [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Significantly, Yong CJ held (at [23] of <em>Rupchand
                        Bhojwani</em>) that the court’s stance against Internet abuse
                    should not be applied <em>carte blanche</em> whenever an
                    Internet or computer resource is misused; rather, the court must look at the
                    role of such misuse in the commission of the offence. In Yong CJ’s view,
                    the role of Internet misuse in <em>Rupchand Bhojwani</em>
                    was “peripheral” (see <em>Rupchand
                        Bhojwani</em> at [23]) and he
                    said at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25     As such, I found that the district judge,
                        although not wrong in emphasising the need to control Internet misuse by
                        imposing deterrent sentences in the appropriate cases, had over-emphasised
                        the fact of Internet misuse in this instance. Therefore, the reasoning
                        process towards her decision adopted conclusions and considerations from
                        cases that were not directly applicable here. <em>As a
                            result, her decision did not take into account the fact that this was a
                            case of pure cheating, with the slight involvement of Internet misuse
                            along the way.</em> As such, I found that although the district
                        judge was correct in convicting Sunil on the charge, she had imposed a
                        sentence that was manifestly excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the question which arose in the present case was whether, in
                    relation to the numerous offences of cheating committed by the Respondent, was
                    the use of the Internet likewise nothing more than
                    “peripheral”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     When the Respondent’s individual
                    offences are viewed in isolation, the Internet misuse in this case might seem
                    “peripheral” because they could have been committed even without
                    the medium of the Internet (<em>eg</em>, by traditional
                    print media, as the SDJ noted at [32] of
                    the GD). However, it becomes clear that Internet misuse was not merely
                    “peripheral” in this case when one views the Respondent’s
                    numerous offences in their totality. Indeed, the most significant aggravating
                    circumstance in this case was the large number of offences committed, which was
                    largely facilitated by the Respondent’s use of the Internet to effectively
                    publicise his scams. As the prosecution submitted, the geographical reach of his
                    criminal enterprise was remarkable.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Respondent collected monies from victims of
                    his car rental scam in car parks and void decks all over Singapore – from
                    Pasir Ris, to Jurong West and to Woodlands. He might have been able to achieve a
                    similar reach with an advertisement in the newspapers, but it was unlikely that
                    that would have been as cost-effective. I should also state my disagreement with
                    Mr Sathinathan’s submission that the Internet advertisements served
                    only as lures and for most of the offences, the “actual cheating”
                    occurred when the Respondent successfully persuaded his victims to part with
                    their monies (see above at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>). To my
                    mind, the “actual cheating” began with the Respondent’s
                    Internet advertisements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Returning to the facts of <em>Rupchand Bhojwani</em>, it must be recognised that that case involved
                    only one cheating offence through the use of the Internet and that occurred when
                    the offender intercepted an Internet order. He did not use the Internet, as the
                    Respondent did here, to publicise a scam with a view to reaching out to a large
                    number of potential victims. That explains the court’s view that the role
                    of Internet misuse in that case was nothing more than peripheral. In
                    juxtaposition, the present case involved 75 cheating offences, most of which
                    arose from the Respondent’s Internet advertisements which were calculated
                    precisely to cheat many people of small sums of money. Leaving aside the laptop
                    CBT offences, it seemed to me that the Respondent had gone on a cheating spree
                    using the medium of the Internet. As I have stated above (at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>–<a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>), would-be criminals should be deterred from using the
                    Internet as a cheap, convenient and effective publicity platform to reach large
                    numbers of potential victims in a targeted manner as the Respondent did.
                    Therefore, in determining an appropriate overall sentence for this case, I took
                    the Respondent’s misuse of the Internet (which led to a large number of
                    victims being cheated) into account as a circumstance which warranted the
                    imposition of a deterrent sentence. One of the four established principles for
                    sentencing is deterrence: R <em>v James Henry
                        Sargeant</em> (1974) 60 Cr App R 74 at 77.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In my view, the sentence passed by the lower
                    court was wrong in principle as it did not give sufficient weight to the
                    aggravating circumstance of the large number of people who fell victim to his
                    scams. Further, I considered that the SDJ should also have taken into account
                    the Respondent’s use of the Internet to prey on a large pool of potential
                    scam victims as a circumstance warranting, in the public interest, the
                    imposition of a deterrent sentence. There was a need to prevent copycats.
                    Therefore, I held that the overall sentence passed by the SDJ was manifestly
                    inadequate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In the result, bearing in mind the numerous
                    cheating charges which the Respondent had pleaded guilty to and admitted to be
                    taken into consideration, I was of the view that a total sentence of 15
                    months’ imprisonment was called for. Accordingly, I allowed the
                    prosecution’s appeal and enhanced the Respondent’s total sentence
                    from 10 months to 15 months. To give effect to that, I ordered that an
                    additional five-month imprisonment sentence for a loan scam offence (DAC
                    8580/2011, which involved a loan scam victim who was cheated of $2,000) be
                    ordered to run consecutively with the sentences originally ordered by the SDJ to
                    run consecutively.</p>
