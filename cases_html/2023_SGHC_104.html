</div> Home Depot’s purchase orders to Hotel Emporium mirrored the eight purchase orders that Hotel Emporium had issued to the plaintiff. The two sets of purchase orders were on a back-to-back basis.  Home Depot is the US’s largest home improvement retailer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Home Depot’s purchase orders showed it paid to Hotel Emporium US$9.70 per box of gloves. The plaintiff’s invoice (at [16] above) stated that its purchase price from Ikarl was US$6.65 per box. The difference was therefore US$3.05 per box. In Hotel Emporium’s purchase orders to the plaintiff, no price was stated for the Gloves but under the column <span class="font-weight-bold">TERMS,</span> the words <span class="font-weight-bold">50/50 profit</span> appeared. That was the basis for the plaintiff’s claim for loss of profits (see [46] above) which Kadosh said during cross-examination was US$1.25 per box. Even based on US$1.25 per box, the plaintiff’s computation of US$650,000 is incorrect. At US$1.25 per box for the plaintiff’s order, the gross loss of profits should only be US$625,000 not US$650,000 (taking 500,000 boxes x US$1.25). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 During his cross-examination of Kadosh, counsel for the defendant had pointed out that the plaintiff’s claim for loss of profits of US$650,000 lacked supporting evidence.

The US$997,500 was only a small fraction of the requisite 30% amount.  The court accepts Dan’s testimony as it was corroborated by the terms of the Faylez Agreement. The law does not allow the plaintiff to recover the US$997,500 because it was paid on behalf of Faylez pursuant to the Fayez Agreement with the defendant (see <span class="font-italic">Alwie Handoyo</span> at [104]). It is of no concern to Dan that a third party namely the plaintiff made the payment rather than Faylez. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 As the Court of Appeal said in <span class="font-italic">Esben Financ</span><span class="font-italic">e </span>(at [250]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">250 … Permitting a claim in unjust enrichment would ‘undermine the contract and the contractual allocation of risk between the plaintiff and the third party’ … – the existence of an existing <span class="font-italic">legal</span> basis for the transfer to the third party ... <span class="font-italic">precludes </span>a claim in <span class="font-italic">unjust enrichment</span> to reverse the transfer. This must be correct in principle; it is obvious that if a transfer is <span class="font-italic">legally valid</span> there can be <span class="font-italic">no question</span> of it having been unjust so as to justify a reversal of said transfer by way of a claim in unjust enrichment. This principle applies with equal force to situations where the defendant has a <span class="font-italic">legal right</span> to <span class="font-italic">retain </span>the property sought to be recovered … It logically follows that if the defendant is, pursuant to those areas of law, <span class="font-italic">legally entitled</span> to the property or value … there is nothing unjust in the defendant’s retention of said property or value. [emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The plaintiff cannot therefore (as the defendant submitted) sidestep its contract with Ikarl and claim against the defendant in unjust enrichment. It was absurd of the plaintiff’s counsel to complain

</div> that a company with this type of earnings could not have entered into the Faylez Agreement worth $986 million with the defendant and alleged the contract must be fake and made up by the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The court wonders why the plaintiff would ascertain Faylez’s financial health well <span class="font-italic">after</span> the claim arose when it was too late. Why did the plaintiff not conduct the SSM searches at the material time (July 2020)? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 It is the court’s view that the plaintiff could or should have been more circumspect, before it made the remittance to the defendant’s SCB account. Had the plaintiff been more vigilant, it would have or should have noticed that Ikarl’s invoice was not even an acceptable commercial document. It is surprising that an experienced sourcing agent like Mckelvey or for that matter a businessman like Kadosh could accept an invoice in the manner prepared by Ikarl. The document contained the figure “5,00,000” as the quantity instead of 500,000 boxes and the total price was stated as 33,25,000 without even a currency denominated.  Furthermore, the invoice contained clear and obvious spelling and grammatical mistakes, most egregiously of Ikarl’s own name. The court sets out a few examples below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… OUT OF THIS 20% AMOUNT US$413,392.00, WILL BE PAIED BY IKRAL GLOBAL SDN BHD. ON SINGING OF (ICPO) DT …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">for IKRAL GLOBAL SDN BHD., Malaysia</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Such an amateurish or badly drafted document should have put the plaintiff on guard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Instead, the plaintiff threw discretion to the winds in its eagerness to secure a supply of the Gloves to fulfil the eight purchase orders it secured from Hotel Emporium and for Hotel Emporium in turn to perform the eight back-to-back purchase orders of Home Depot. It seems to the court that the plaintiff was the author of its own misfortune and loss. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In regard to costs, the defendant had written a <span class="font-italic">Calderbank </span>letter (see <span class="font-italic">Calderbank v Calderbank </span>[1975] 3 All ER 333) to the plaintiff on 16 June 2021 offering to accept a sum of $60,000 from the plaintiff in exchange for discontinuance of this Suit with each party bearing its own costs.  According to the exchange of correspondence between the parties that the court has seen, the <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> offer was rejected by the plaintiff on 6 July 2021; it counter-proposed mediation instead. The plaintiff’s counter-proposal was rejected by the defendant on 14 June 2021 (the date is an obvious mistake and should be 14 July 2021 instead). On 28 July 2021, the plaintiff’s solicitors <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> wrote to the defendant’s solicitors as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Our client is willing to explore settlement on condition that your client accepts liability of US$997,500.00 and their payment of freight charges of US$10,154.09. Further, parties negotiate the payment of damages to our client for the losses they suffered in this matter and for the legal costs they have incurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The above proposal was most absurd – it meant that the defendant was being asked to admit liability for the plaintiff’s claim and to consent to judgment on the same on top of which the defendant had to pay damages and legal costs. What room was there for the defendant to negotiate? It was an unreasonable and unacceptable proposal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 It was a most unreasonable proposal because the defendant had in the <span class="font-italic">Calderbank</span> letter referred to this court’s decision on 27 May 2021 when, in dismissing the plaintiff’s injunction application, the court informed parties that the plaintiff had sued the wrong party (see [41] above). This is also the basis for the dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim here. Further. in Dan’s AEIC,
