In paragraph 14 of his affidavit dated 21 September 2018, the defendant has now stated that the understandings pleaded in the defence were express understandings or an express agreement. The fact that they were express understandings reached orally means that the defendant can properly be asked for particulars of “between whom the oral communication was made and the names of those persons as well as the date on which and the time and place at which the said communication was made”. Those matters have been dealt with in the answers already given to the Requests and no issue has been raised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The issue is whether I should order the defendant to provide answers to the plaintiffs’ requests for particulars of what was stated by the relevant parties in giving rise to the alleged understandings or agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Whilst the <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2018</span> states that in giving particulars “[t]he precise words used in the making of an oral agreement need not be stated”, in my judgment, the emphasis is on the word “precise”. The precise words need not be stated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 As the plaintiffs point out, O 18 r 7(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) provides: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts, not evidence, to be pleaded (O. 18, r. 7)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) … the purport of any conversation referred to in the pleading must, if material, be briefly stated, and the precise words of the…conversation shall not be stated, except in so far as those words are themselves material.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 This follows O 18 r 7(1) which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts, not evidence, to be pleaded (O. 18, r. 7)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7.—(1) Subject to this Rule and Rules 10, 11 and 12, every pleading must contain, and contain only, a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved, and the statement must be as brief as the nature of the case admits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 I consider that, as the defendant relies upon an express understanding or agreement, the defendant must provide particulars of the gist of what was stated as this is material to the allegation. As Thesiger LJ said in <span class="font-italic">Turquand v Fearon</span> (1879) 40 LT 543, the case cited in the <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2018</span>, in relation to the equivalent of O 18 r 7(1):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The matter becomes clear when<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>that 4th rule [of Order XIX] is looked at, which states that "every<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>pleading shall contain, as concisely as may be, a statement of the material facts on which the party pleading relies, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved," &amp;c. Now, an agreement is not, strictly speaking, a fact; it is an inference of law from facts. What the rule requires to be stated are the "material facts”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The gist of what was said contains the material facts from which an understanding or agreement, being an inference from those facts, can be derived. It is necessary for the plaintiffs to know sufficient about the relevant material facts on which the oral understanding or agreement is based, to be able to put forward any evidence to dispute such an understanding or agreement. That is not a request for evidence but a request for facts and matters which are necessary for a proper pleading. For instance, it is important to know the gist of what one person said to see whether the terms of the understanding or agreement are made out, as a matter of inference of law from those facts. That will only be apparent from particulars of the gist of what was said.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 I therefore order that particulars should be given of the gist of what was stated by the relevant persons in giving rise to the understanding or the agreement. Such particulars are necessary so that, in particular, the plaintiffs know what case they have to meet when they come to prepare their affidavits of evidence-in-chief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The defendant shall give the following further and better particulars of the defence on or before 26 November 2018:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-underline">Under paragraph 8(b) of the defence</span></div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">Of the allegation that “[b]ased on a plain reading of Clause 2.1.1 of the alleged Agreement and the understanding between the 2nd Plaintiff and the Defendant, the costs of the Vinmar Guarantee and the Bank Guarantee would refer to administrative charges for opening and maintaining the Vinmar Guarantee and the Bank Guarantee”, </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">the defendant shall state the gist of what was stated by the relevant parties in giving rise to the alleged “understanding”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-underline">Under paragraph 8(f) of the defence</span></div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">Of the allegation that “[b]ased on a plain reading of Clause 3.1.1 of the alleged Agreement and the understanding between the 2nd Plaintiff and the Defendant, the "costs for the EDBI Put and Call Option Shares" would refer to the costs of EDBI's shares in JAC at the time of the exercise of the Put Option or the Call Option, as defined in the Amended PCOA”,</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">the defendant shall state the gist of what was stated by the relevant parties in giving rise to the alleged “understanding”.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-underline">Under paragraph 17 of the defence</span></div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">Of the allegation that “in return for the financial commitments which Shefford, the Defendant and the Plaintiffs made to EDBI pursuant to the Initial PCOA, it was understood that they or their nominees would be allocated certain volumes of various offtake products from JAC once production began (the “Multi-Products Offtake Volumes”).

<p><font face="Calibri">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Decision of Vivian Ramsey IJ</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>SICC orders the defendant to provide particulars on the gist of what was stated by the relevant persons in giving rise to the understandings or agreement pleaded in the defence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">1          This was an application by the plaintiffs for further and better particulars on certain understandings and an agreement pleaded by the defendant. The plaintiffs sought particulars on the manner in which those understandings or agreement arose, and if orally, for the defendant to state what was stated by the relevant parties in giving rise to the understandings or agreement.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2          The parties agreed on the principles to be applied: where a term is oral, a party may ask for particulars as to the circumstances in which the verbal communication was made and the persons between whom the contract was made. Particulars will be ordered whenever the court is satisfied that without them the applicant cannot tell what is going to be proved against him at the trial. However, the court will not allow this procedure to be used to obtain evidence (at <strong>[3]</strong>). Further, O 18 r 7(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) provides that “the purport of any conversation referred to in the pleading must, if material, be briefly stated” (at <strong>[8]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">3          The court considered that, as the defendant relied upon an express understanding or agreement in his case, he must provide particulars of the gist of what was stated as this would be material to the allegation.</span><font face="Calibri"> </font><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The gist of what was said would contain the material facts from which an understanding or agreement, being an inference from those facts, could be derived. It was necessary for the plaintiffs to know sufficient about the relevant material facts on which the oral understanding or agreement was based, to be able to put forward any evidence to dispute such an understanding or agreement. That was not a request for evidence but a request for facts and matters which were necessary for a proper pleading (at <strong>[10]–[11]</strong>).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">4          The court therefore ordered that particulars be given of the gist of what was stated by the relevant persons in giving rise to the understandings or the agreement (at <strong>[12]–[13]</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span></em></p>
