<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was a matter involving 5 young offenders
                    (collectively “the Offenders”) who had each pleaded guilty to a
                    reduced charge of aggravated outrage of modesty (“the Offence”)
                    under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)
                    (“Penal Code”). I sentenced the Offenders to imprisonment terms
                    between 3½ and 5 years with caning ranging from 5 to 8 strokes and I now
                    set out my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On the night of 25 December 2008, the First
                    Offender (“Shafie”) invited the Second to Fifth Offenders
                    (“Sadruddin”, “Lim”, “Rishi” and
                    “Firdaus” respectively) and one Taufik to Shafie’s flat
                    (“the Flat”) to spend Christmas night together. Shafie’s
                    parents had then gone abroad and were not expected to return to the Flat until
                    the following day. Sometime after they arrived at the Flat, the Offenders became
                    bored and wanted to have female company in the Flat. Lim then called the Victim
                    on her handphone. It was not clear how Lim obtained the Victim’s handphone
                    number but suffice to mention that the Victim and the Fourth Offender, Rishi,
                    were former schoolmates. During the telephone conversation with the Victim, Lim
                    identified himself as one “Jonathan” who was an ITE student
                    studying in the class next to the Victim’s and arranged with the Victim to
                    have supper at Woodlands. The Victim agreed and Rishi eventually picked her up
                    in a taxi at a taxi-stand at Woodlands Bus Interchange. At that point in time,
                    Rishi told the Victim that they would be going for supper at Woodlands Market.
                    En route, however, Rishi brought the Victim to the Flat instead, explaining that
                    he wanted to look for his friends at the Flat first before having supper. At
                    around 1.00am on 26 December 2008 upon arrival at the Flat, Rishi invited
                    the Victim into the Flat on the assurance that his friends would not bother her
                    and the Victim obliged. It was then that the Victim was introduced to Lim,
                    Shafie, Firdaus, Sadruddin and Taufik.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the Flat, the Victim played drinking games
                    with the company she found herself with until about 3.00am to 4.00am. There was
                    no dispute that Lim had told Shafie and Sadruddin shortly after the
                    Victim’s arrival to buy liquor as he planned for the Victim to drink
                    alcohol that night. There was also no dispute that the Victim had joined in the
                    drinking games because she was feeling festive as it was the Christmas season
                    and the school holidays. Taufik did not join in the drinking games and was
                    playing a PSP game console in the Flat. Firdaus also did not join in the
                    drinking games as he had left the Flat temporarily after the Victim’s
                    arrival. In the course of the drinking games, the Victim drank more than 5
                    disposable plastic cups of vodka cocktail. As a result, she felt
                dizzy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Sometime later that night, the Victim had
                    consensual sexual intercourse with Lim after he made sexual advances towards the
                    Victim privately in Shafie’s bedroom. After sexual intercourse, the Victim
                    then returned to the living room to rest as she was still feeling dizzy from the
                    alcohol she had earlier consumed. The Victim subsequently ended up resting on a
                    chair in Shafie’s bedroom in the presence of all the Offenders. At this
                    point in time, Lim attempted to pull her from the chair for her to lie down with
                    him on the mattress in the bedroom, to which she responded by replying in
                    Mandarin “<em>bu yao</em>” (“I
                    don’t want to”). The Victim eventually lost her balance and landed
                    on the mattress. In the presence of the other Offenders, Lim then crossed his
                    leg over the Victim’s legs, laid beside and started kissing her. The
                    Victim tried unsuccessfully to push Lim’s leg away. At that point, one of
                    the Offenders told the rest, “Let’s start”, and Lim starting
                    removing the Victim’s shorts. The Victim was eventually stripped naked by
                    the Offenders who took turns to sexually assault the Victim by penetrating her
                    mouth and her vagina concurrently with their penises without her consent between
                    4.00am to 6.00am, in the course of which there was also digital penetration of
                    the Victim’s vagina committed by the Fourth and Fifth Offenders. All this
                    while, Taufik remained in the living room watching television. The Victim
                    suffered bleeding from her vagina during the sexual assault.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Offenders were originally variously charged
                    under sections 375(1)(a), 376(1)(a) and 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code for rape and
                    sexual assault by penetration of the Victim who was then 17 years old at the
                    material time. The charges were later reduced to outraging modesty under section
                    354A(1) of the Penal Code with some other charges taken into consideration after
                    19 days of trial, by which time the Victim had already undergone several days of
                    cross-examination. The table below sets out in detail the reduced charges
                    against the Offenders.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Offenders pleaded guilty upon the reduction
                    of the original charges of rape and sexual assault by penetration. All the
                    Offenders were between 17 to19 years old at the time the Offence was
                    committed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Sentencing benchmark</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The sentence for an offence under section
                    354A(1) of the Penal Code is provided for in the same section which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whoever, in order to commit or to facilitate the commission of an offence
                        against any person under section 354, voluntarily causes or attempts to
                        cause to that person death, or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or fear of
                        instant death, instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint, shall be punished
                        with imprisonment for a term of not less than 2 years and not more than 10
                        years and with caning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sub-section 354(1) of the Penal Code in turn
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending to
                        outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty
                        of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may
                        extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of
                        such punishments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Both the Prosecution and Defence referred to the
                    case of <em>Seow Fook Thiam v PP</em> [1997]
                    2 SLR(R) 887 at [36] (“<em>Seow Fook
                        Thiam</em>”) where it was held by the High Court that the norm
                    for offences committed under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code is 30
                    months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. It appeared to have been
                    accepted by the Prosecution that the sentencing norm laid down in <em>Seow Fook Thiam</em> was an appropriate starting point
                    against which the Offenders’ culpable conduct was to be calibrated for the
                    purposes of sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The difficulty of the matter, however, was
                    that there was no direct sentencing precedent insofar as the factual
                    circumstances of the present case were brought within the charge of aggravated
                    outrage of modesty under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code. In <em>Seow Fook Thiam</em>, the accused person had hugged the
                    complainant from behind and used both of his hands to squeeze her breasts at a
                    staircase in her block of flats. Such culpable conduct in <em>Seow Fook Thiam</em> clearly differed by a huge margin from the
                    conduct of the Offenders in the present case. Here, the Offenders had not merely
                    molested the Victim; they had collectively committed acts which, but for the
                    reduction of the original charges by the Prosecution, would have categorically
                    and factually also constituted gang rape and sexual assault by penetration based
                    on the same statement of facts admitted to without qualification by all the
                    Offenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In arriving at the appropriate sentence, I had
                    borne in mind the principles of ordinal proportionality and cardinal
                    proportionality so that crimes of varying degrees and culpability are redressed
                    proportionally and rationally. The principles of ordinal proportionality and
                    cardinal proportionality were recognised and adopted in <em>Xia
                        Qin Lai v Public Prosecutor</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 257 at [28]
                    where Yong Pung How CJ (as he was then) stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... I found recourse to the academic distinction between ordinal
                        proportionality and cardinal proportionality (see generally Ashworth,
                        Sentencing and Criminal Justice (2nd Ed, 1992), ch 3) helpful. Briefly,
                        ordinal proportionality measures the seriousness of the offence in question
                        against other offences, whereas cardinal proportionality involves the
                        question: "How serious is this particular offence of its type?"</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Applying these principles to the present case,
                    I was of the view that the circumstances surrounding the Offence warranted, as a
                    matter of starting point against which any mitigating factors would then
                    subsequently be considered for the purposes of arriving at an appropriate
                    sentence, a penalty that fell within the higher end of the statutory sentencing
                    regime under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code. In arriving at this view, I took
                    into account that there was factual rape and sexual assault by penetration in
                    the circumstances notwithstanding that the criminal acts committed were
                    eventually brought under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code. As such, I found
                    myself to be sufficiently justified in being guided analogously by the Court of
                    Appeal’s holding in <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton
                        Mohammed Syeed Mallik</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [93] which
                    stated non-exhaustively that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In so far as the aggravating factors which warrant an
                        increase from the benchmark sentences [for the offence of rape] are
                        concerned, it may also be helpful to refer to the case of Regina v Roberts
                        [1982] 1 WLR 133, in which the English Court of Appeal listed many
                        of the factors considered to aggravate the offence of rape as follows (at
                        135):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Some of the features which may aggravate the crime are as follows.
                            Where a gun or knife or some other weapon has been used to frighten or
                            injure the victim. Where the victim sustains serious injury, whether
                            that is mental or physical. Where violence is used over and above the
                            violence necessarily involved in the act itself. Where, there are
                            threats of a brutal kind. <em>Where the victim has been
                                subjected to further sexual indignities or perversions</em>.
                            Where the victim is very young or elderly. Where the offender is in a
                            position of trust. Where the offender has intruded into the victim's
                            home. Where the victim has been deprived of her liberty for a period of
                            time. <em>Where the rape, or succession of rapes, is
                                carried out by a group of men</em>. Where the offender has
                            committed a series of rapes on different women, or indeed on the same
                            woman.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the (also) English Court of Appeal decision of Regina v Millberry
                        [2003] 1 WLR 546 ("Millberry"), Lord Woolf CJ also identified (at [32]) a
                        list of nine aggravating factors that are often present in rape offences,
                        namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)     the use of violence over and above the
                        force necessary to commit the rape;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[...]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)     <em>further degradation of
                            the victim</em>, eg<em>, by forced oral
                            sex</em> or urination on the victim; ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the present case, the Offenders clearly had
                    a numerical advantage over the Victim who was only 17 years old and vulnerable
                    because she was under the influence of alcohol at the material time. In
                    committing an offence under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code, the Offenders
                    did, as a group, wrongfully restrain the Victim and carried out acts that were
                    factually identical to rape and sexual assault by penile penetration of the
                    Victim’s mouth and digital penetration of the Victim’s vagina. There
                    was also further degradation of the Victim by way of oral sex that was forced on
                    her while she was at the same time being vaginally penetrated by the
                    Offenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It is apposite at this juncture to pause and
                    consider the decision of <em>Sim Gek Yong v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 185 where it was held by the
                    High Court at [15] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The onus lies on the Prosecution in the first place to assess the
                        seriousness of an accused's conduct and to frame an appropriate charge in
                        the light of the evidence available. Once an accused has pleaded guilty to
                        (or been convicted of) a particular charge, it cannot be open to the court,
                        in sentencing him, to consider the possibility that an alternative - and
                        graver - charge might have been brought and to treat him as though he had
                        been found guilty of the graver charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In Kow Keng Siong, <em>Sentencing Principles in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2009) at
                    para 13.117, the view was similarly taken that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When referring to analogous cases, a court must, however be mindful ... to
                        only impose a punishment for an offence of which the accused had been
                        convicted. It is impermissible to consider the fact that a graver charge
                        might have been preferred against him in sentencing ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Let it be clear that in arriving at my
                    decision on sentencing in the present case, my taking of cognizance that there
                    was factual rape and sexual assault by penetration was not an exercise in
                    consideration of the possibility that an alternative and graver charge of rape
                    or sexual assault by penetration might have been preferred against the
                    Offenders, much less to treat them as though they had been legally found guilty
                    of the charge of rape or sexual assault by penetration (for which the prescribed
                    maximum sentence of imprisonment of 20 years is twice that for the reduced
                    charge of aggravated outrage of modesty proceeded with by the Prosecution
                    against each of the Offenders). Instead, what this exercise really entailed was
                    to recognise that the precise nature of the criminal acts carried out by the
                    Offenders against the Victim – being factually identical to acts
                    constituting rape and sexual assault by penetration – effectively brought
                    the Offenders’ conduct within the more if not most serious category of
                    cases under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code, which warranted a substantial
                    sentence within the legislatively prescribed range of not less than 2 years and
                    not more than 10 years of imprisonment with caning. To this end, it is fruitful
                    to note that in the recent High Court decision of <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Firdaus bin Abdullah</em> [2010] 3 SLR 225,
                    Chan Sek Keong CJ explained as a matter of general principle at [17]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle for imposing the maximum prescribed punishment
                        for any offence is clear. It is only warranted when the particular crime
                        belongs to the most serious category of cases under that offence, although
                        it need not be restricted to the "worst case imaginable": see <em>Sim
                            Gek Yong v PP</em> [1995] 1 SLR(R) 185 at [13] and
                            <em>Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP</em> [2006]
                        4 SLR(R) 653 where the court stated at [84]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">By imposing a sentence close to or fixed at the statutory maximum, a
                            court calibrates the offender's conduct as among the worst conceivable
                            for that offence. In other words, when Parliament sets a statutory
                            maximum, it signals the gravity with which the public, through
                            Parliament, views that particular offence: <em>Cheong Siat Fong v
                                PP</em> [2005] SGHC 176   at [23]; R v H
                            (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 65. Therefore, it stands to reason that
                            sentencing judges must take note of the maximum penalty and then apply
                            their minds to determine precisely where the offender's conduct falls
                            within the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore, even if the conduct in a particular case could have been
                        exacerbated in some way, the maximum penalty is still appropriate where the
                        conduct could be objectively characterised as belonging to the worst end of
                        the scale when comparing instances of that offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     For the reasons stated above, it was therefore
                    tenuous to think that the criminal conduct of the Offenders did not warrant a
                    substantial sentence under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Mitigating factors</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The key mitigating factors under contention in
                    the present case were, first, the Offenders’ pleas of guilt to the reduced
                    charges under section 354A(1) of the Penal Code and, second, the young age of
                    the Offenders at the time of the Offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     It is trite that a plea of guilt can be taken
                    into consideration in mitigation when it was motivated by genuine remorse,
                    contriteness or regret and/or a desire to facilitate the administration of
                    justice (see <em>Angliss Signapore Pte Ltd v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 at [77]). However, in
                    the present case, I concluded that the Offenders’ pleas of guilt carried
                    little weight because they were not made timeously enough to be sufficiently
                    indicative of genuine remorse (cf <em>Sinniah Pillay v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1991] 2 SLR(R) 704 at [27]; <em>Xia Qin Lai v Public Prosecutor</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 257 at [26]; <em>Chen Weixiong Jerriek v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 334 at [22]). Here,
                    the Offenders’ first and further joint representations to reduce the
                    original charges were only advanced to the Prosecution on the second and seventh
                    day of the Victim’s cross-examination respectively. This was unlike the
                    cases (to name just a few) of <em>Annis bin Abdullah v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 93, <em>Public Prosecutor v Liew Kok Meng @ Lai Meow Onn</em>
                    [1999] SGHC 128 and <em>Public Prosecutor v Koh Jin
                        Lie</em> [1998] SGHC 180 where the accused persons had
                    pleaded guilty early and saved their sexual victims the trauma of having to
                    testify in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Neither could it be said that the guilty pleas
                    were genuinely motivated by the Offenders’ desire to facilitate the
                    administration of justice as the trial hearing had already gone on for a
                    substantial period of 19 days by the time the guilty pleas were made.
                    Accordingly, the Offenders’ guilty pleas could not be taken to be a
                    significant mitigating factor in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I now turn to the young age of the Offenders
                    at the time of the Offence. The Defence had variously submitted that
                    rehabilitation should be the dominant consideration for the purposes of
                    sentencing in the present case because of the Offenders’ young adolescent
                    age and because the Offenders’ conduct during the commission of the
                    Offence was not particularly heinous. The Prosecution, on the other hand,
                    submitted that public interest required that deterrence be the dominant
                    consideration for sentencing in the present case because the Offence committed
                    was repugnant and one of the most aggravated forms of outrage of modesty
                    envisaged within section 354A(1) of the Penal Code.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I agreed that a sentence of probation or
                    reformative training would be excessively lenient in light of the serious nature
                    of the criminal acts visited upon the Victim by the Offenders in the present
                    case. Young age does not <em>per se</em> automatically
                    attract rehabilitation as the dominant sentencing consideration in all cases. In
                    this regard, it is useful to reproduce the relevant segment found in Kow Keng
                    Siong, <em>Sentencing Principles in Singapore</em> (Academy
                    Publishing, 2009) at para 22.008:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although rehabilitation is an important sentencing objective for young
                        offenders, it is not the sole or overriding consideration. Deterrence,
                        protection and retribution are still relevant considerations. This is clear
                        when the High Court reminded in <em>Public Prosecutor v Mok
                            Ping Wuen Maurice</em> [1999] 1 SLR 138 at [25] that
                        “[t]here is a need to strike a balance between public interest and
                        the interest of the offender”. Courts have the “responsibility
                        to safeguard the interests of the law-abiding general public and of applying
                        the law uniformly to all those who violate it”: <em>Fay v Public Prosecutor</em> [1994] 2 SLR 154 at [17].
                        Thus, where the offence is so serious and the actions of the offender so
                        “contemptible” and committed with “shocking
                        audacity”, the rehabilitative principle should be subordinated to the
                        other sentencing principles. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It cannot be accepted that the
                    Offenders’ conduct during the commission of the Offence was not
                    particularly heinous. The factors considered at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above speak for themselves in this regard. The absence of
                    any specific use of violent force against a victim in any given criminal offence
                    does not necessarily preclude the offence committed from being characterised as
                    a heinous crime. There can be no one formula for ascertaining the gravity and
                    reprehensibility of an offence and every offence must be considered in light of
                    its own circumstances. Needless to say, it follows that absence of physical
                    violence cannot by itself be the controlling factor for the purpose of
                    determining that a particular offence is not heinous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On the foregoing bases, the dominant
                    consideration for sentencing in the present case should, as the Prosecution
                    rightly pointed out,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> therefore be
                    deterrence in order for the public interest to be properly served by
                    communicating society’s aversion to the grave criminal acts committed by
                    the Offenders despite their young age.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     A substantial sentence under section 354A(1)
                    of the Penal Code would have been justified in the circumstances of this present
                    case. Indeed, if not for the young age of the Offenders, I would have meted out
                    an imprisonment sentence closer to the maximum of 10 years under section 354A(1)
                    of the Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Having said that, it should however be noted
                    that in the course of the Prosecution’s submissions, the Prosecution had
                    very generously indicated a sentence of between 3 to 5 years’ imprisonment
                    with caning when I asked for its opinion on what would be an appropriate
                    sentence for the Offenders in the present case. It was principally a result of
                    what the Prosecution had submitted that I was more lenient with the Offenders
                    than I would otherwise have been. The Offenders should therefore count
                    themselves very lucky on account of the Prosecution’s generosity in the
                    present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     For all the reasons stated above and having
                    regard to the varying degrees of culpability among the Offenders themselves and
                    the charges which were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing,
                    I therefore sentenced the Offenders respectively as follows:</p>

                            time of the Offence;</div>

                            strokes of the cane. He was 18 years and 8 months old at the time of the
