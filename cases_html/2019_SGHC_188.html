Hence, the Plaintiff has clearly waived its right to object to the VOs on the basis that they fell outside of its Contract with the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Patent error</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 However, this does not end the inquiry. As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management Pte Ltd v OGSP Engineering Pte Ltd </span>[2018] 1 SLR 979 (“<span class="font-italic">Comfort </span><span class="font-italic">Management</span>”) at [34], “regardless of whether any payment response has been filed, an adjudicator has an <span class="font-italic">independent duty </span>to address his mind to and consider the true merits of a payment claim” [emphasis added]; where a payment response has not been filed, the main contractor is “permitted to challenge the payment claim before the adjudicator by highlighting <span class="font-italic">only </span>patent errors in the material properly before the adjudicator.” [emphasis in original] The same sentiments were echoed in<span class="font-italic"> Far East Square Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Yau Lee Construction (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2019] SGCA 36 at [72], where it was reiterated that “a respondent who has not filed a payment response remains entitled to raise patent errors in the material properly before the adjudicator”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 A patent error “is an error that is obvious, manifest or otherwise easily recognisable”, and it must be “an error that is in the<span class="font-italic"> material </span>that is properly before the adjudicator for the purpose of  his  adjudication” [emphasis in original]. Importantly, “[i]t is … strictly not an error that is <span class="font-italic">committed </span>by an adjudicator” [emphasis in original]: <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [22]. Examples of what constitutes a patent error for the purposes of adjudication were considered in <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [23]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">An example of a patent error might be <span class="font-weight-bold">[1]</span> where the contract adduced by the claimant in support of the payment claim is not even the contract between the parties. <span class="font-weight-bold">[2]</span> Another example … is where “the documentary evidence submitted by the claimant plainly contradict[s] the claimed amount”. <span class="font-weight-bold">[3]</span> Yet another example might be where no supporting material or explanation whatsoever is adduced to support the payment claim. While in principle these are <span class="font-italic">not exhaustive examples of patent error, it is difficult to conceive of other forms of error that may properly be regarded as patent</span>. Ultimately, whether an error is properly characterised as patent will depend on the facts. But the point to be made here is that patent errors constitute by definition an <span class="font-italic">exceptional and extremely narrow category of errors</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 This duty to consider patent errors flows independently from the adjudicator’s duty to adjudicate, and “he must have at least some <span class="font-italic">positive </span>basis for his determination, and not simply lack a reason not to allow the claim” [emphasis in original] (<span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [56]). As s 2 of SOPA provides, a payment claim is a claim for “progress payment”, which is defined as “a payment to which a person is entitled for the carrying out of construction work … <span class="font-italic">under a contract</span>” [emphasis added]. As a result, even if the Plaintiff may have waived its right to object to the VOs on the basis that they fell outside of its Contract with the Defendant, that does not entitle the Adjudicator to allow the sums claimed for the VOs as of right. The Adjudicator must independently assess whether the Defendant was entitled to payment for the VOs, insofar as there was no patent errors in the payment claim and its supporting materials.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 When a patent error is allegedly overlooked by the adjudicator, the “central task of a respondent who seeks to set aside an adjudication determination … is to show the court that there are patent errors in the material properly before the adjudicator that the adjudicator failed to recognise”. For example, if the adjudicator allowed a payment claim for which there is absolutely no supporting material, the court will not hesitate to conclude that the adjudicator was merely rubber-stamping the claim, and had failed to recognise the patent error in the payment claim: <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [81]. In this regard, the court’s task is restricted to considering whether the adjudicator had failed to recognise a patent error in allowing a payment claim; the court cannot review the adjudicator’s decision on its merits: <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [94].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 By way of example, in <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management</span>, OGSP claimed payment from Comfort for, among others, works done pursuant to Variation Order No 2. The adjudicator allowed OGSP’s claim with respect to Variation Order No 2. Comfort argued that in so doing, the adjudicator had failed to take into account clause 11 of the parties’ contract, which stipulated that OGSP had to first serve a written notice for variation works to be undertaken, and to seek Comfort’s approval in writing to carry out such works <span class="font-italic">before </span>they could claim for additional payment. Comfort alleged that if the adjudicator had considered clause 11, it would have realised that OGSP had produced no evidence that the variation works were ordered by Comfort. However, the adjudicator had remarked explicitly that he had examined the documents in the adjudication application, and this meant that it could not be said that he did not have regard to the parties’ contract. Thus, “the true substance of Comfort’s argument was that OGSP produced <span class="font-italic">insufficient </span>documentation to support its claim on [Variation Order No 2], and that the adjudicator erred in nevertheless allowing the claim” [emphasis in original]. This, however, was insufficient to set aside the adjudicator’s determination, as “to set aside the adjudicator’s determination for that error is tantamount to asking the court to review his decision on the merits. This, the court cannot do”: <span class="font-italic">Comfort Management </span>at [94].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Similarly, in this case, the Adjudicator clearly considered that the quotations and approvals for the VOs had not been copied to the Plaintiff. In fact, the Adjudicator noted that the “[Defendant] should also take some responsibilities for this miscommunication. The [Plaintiff] is the pay master for the [Defendant] in this sub-contract. All quotations made by the [Defendant] to architect/consulting engineers should have been copied to the [Plaintiff].”

</div> Nonetheless, the Adjudicator allowed the Defendant’s claim for the VOs as he found that the matter of the VOs had been drawn to the Plaintiff’s attention from as early as when the Plaintiff received the 12 July 2018 letter, but the Plaintiff “did not seek to clarify whether these works were outside the scope of the [Contract]”.

</div> Furthermore, the Adjudicator considered EWC’s instructions for the VOs, which were clearly marked as “variation orders”. This, according to the Adjudicator, implied that they were intended as variations to the Contract, and that they were not intended to have been carried out in a separate contract, as alleged by the Plaintiff. Patently, the Adjudicator had considered the material before him in relation to the Plaintiff’s allegation that the VOs fell outside of the Contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The materials that were considered by the Adjudicator are now before me. In substance, the Plaintiff is now seeking to re-adjudicate the Adjudicator’s finding that the VOs formed part of the Contract. This is beyond the scope of the court’s remit, and is properly to be considered by way of final determination of the dispute(s) between the parties, either (a) by a court or tribunal or some other dispute resolution body, or (b) by way of a settlement agreement between the parties: <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 3 SLR 380<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [13] and [71]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The limited scope of the court’s powers of review of ADs, as the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span>, is “in keeping with the purpose of the [SOPA], which was to provide a fast and low-cost adjudication process to ensure that a contractor’s cash flow was not disrupted by disputes arising from or relating to construction contracts” (at [13]). To allow a re-assessment of the merits of the Adjudicator’s determination would unnecessarily prolong the adjudication process, thereby hampering the spirit and purpose of the SOPA regime.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><div class="font-weight-bold"><br/><br/></div><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 For these reasons, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s application to set aside the AD. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I will now hear parties on the question of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Vincent Hoong  <br>Judicial Commissioner </br></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Choa Sn-Yien Brendon and Zachariah Chow Jie Rui (ACIES Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;<br>Chong Kuan Keong, Sia Ernest and Gan Siu Min Cheryl (Chong Chia &amp; Lim LLC) for the defendant. </br></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
