It asserted that the plaintiff had claimed in PC 24 that the “final quantity of disposal as of 16 December 2018” was 175,978 m3.  However, according to information that had been provided by the plaintiff to the LTA in an email dated 8 January 2019, the first defendant did some calculations and determined that the “final quantity of disposal” was only 136,462 m3.

For example, it was assumed that one could derive the <span class="font-italic">volume</span> of the disposed quantity from the <span class="font-italic">weight</span> figure used in the email to the LTA by using the conversion rate of “2000 kg/m3”.  Hence, 226,875,130 kg of material which was stated by the plaintiff in its email to the LTA as having been sent from the site to the TOL treatment area as of 16 December 2018 was calculated to be equal to 113,438 m3 of material.  For quantities that had been transported from the site to the plaintiff’s dumping ground and the MESG, the first defendant calculated the volume of the quantities disposed of by reference to the lorry loads and an assumption that each lorry load carried 8 m3 of material.

</div>  Finally, the first defendant argues that the terms of the Subcontract entitle it to call on the PB to recover any alleged overpayments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issue before the court</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The substantive issue before the court is whether the first defendant’s call on the bond was unconscionable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 It is settled law in Singapore that, apart from fraud, unconscionability is a ground which would warrant the court granting an injunction to restrain a beneficiary of a performance bond from calling on it: <span class="font-italic">BS Mount Sophia Pte Ltd v Join-Aim Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 3 SLR 352 (“<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia</span>”) at [18] and <span class="font-italic">JBE Properties Pte Ltd v Gammon Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 2 SLR 47 (“<span class="font-italic">JBE Properties</span>”) at [6].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Where unconscionability is alleged, the court will consider the parties’ conduct leading up to the call on the performance bond in the entire context of the case.  For injunctive relief to be granted, the burden is on the plaintiff to satisfy the court that there is a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability on the beneficiary’s part in calling on the bond: <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [21].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 However, unconscionability does not lend itself to a precise definition.  Thus, as the Court of Appeal recognised in <span class="font-italic">Eltraco </span><span class="font-italic">International Pte Ltd v CGH Development Pte Ltd </span>[2000] 3 SLR(R) 198 at [31]: “[i]n determining whether a call on a bond is unconscionable, <span class="font-italic">the entire picture </span>must be viewed, taking into account all the relevant factors” [emphasis added].  Hence, it is inappropriate to look simply for a “smoking gun” that would show unconscionability on the beneficiary’s part.  Ultimately, the relevant facts must be assessed against the entire context of the case (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [45]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a finding of unconscionability is a conclusion applied to conduct which the court finds to be so lacking in <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span> such that an injunction restraining the beneficiary’s substantive rights is warranted. Sufficient reasons must be given to the court to enable it to come to such a conclusion, and it is necessary that these reasons are drawn from a thorough consideration of the relevant facts as viewed in the entire context of the case, taking into account the parties’ conduct leading up to the call on the bond. This should not be confused with a consideration of the merits of the case, for the inquiry here is concerned with breadth rather than depth and remains a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> inquiry. With all that said, we reiterate that it is very difficult for a single piece of evidence, read without the benefit of the context surrounding its making, to be definitive proof of a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case of unconscionability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The importance of considering the entire context is demonstrated by the facts of <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>itself.  There, the appellant developer was the beneficiary of an on-demand performance bond that had been provided by the respondent contractor to secure the performance of the respondent’s obligations under the building contract between the parties.  Contractual disputes arose at about the time for completion and it was alleged that the respondent had to pay the appellant liquidated damages as a result of the delay in completion.  Before parties could refer the dispute to arbitration pursuant to the contract, the appellant called on the bond, allegedly because it believed that it was entitled to the liquidated damages.  The judge allowed the respondent’s application for injunctive relief, reasoning that an email from the architect of the project dated 4 October 2010 suggested that there had been an understanding between the appellant and the architect to manipulate the contractual completion date from 19 July 2010 to 4 April 2010, thus increasing the amount of liquidated damages payable by the respondent (“the 4 October 2010 email”).  According to the judge, this constituted a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability which justified the grant of an injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Court of Appeal upheld the judge’s decision to grant an injunction, but cautioned that the overall tenor and entire context of the conduct of the parties had to be considered.  In this respect, the 4 October 2010 email, while certainly probative, was insufficient by itself to demonstrate a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability.  Other factors that fed into the context of the appellant’s call on the bond had to be evaluated.  In this respect, the court considered first that there existed a serious question as to whether the delay was occasioned by the respondent, or whether it had been caused by the appellant.  From the evidence of the case, it appeared that the appellant did not genuinely believe that the respondent was responsible for the delay.  Another curious event was that the architect had issued directions to the respondent requiring it to extend the validity of the bond, failing which the appellant would call on the bond.  The court considered that it did not seem proper for the appellant to threaten to call on the bond in order to get the respondent to extend the bond, especially since such an instruction came by way of an architect’s direction (see <span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [47]–[53]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Viewing the circumstances in <span class="font-italic">totality</span>, the court concluded that there was a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability justifying the continuance of the injunction restraining the appellant’s call on the bond pending arbitration.  In coming to its conclusion, the court emphasised that “no single factor was conclusive.  It was the entire chronology of the case, viewed in relation to all the relevant factors … that convinced us that a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability had been established” (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The same approach was adopted in <span class="font-italic">JBE Properties</span>.  There, the developer awarded a construction contract to the contractor.  A performance bond for S$1.1515m was furnished for the developer’s benefit pursuant to the contract.  When the cladding of the building turned out to be defective, the developer solicited bids from other contractors before the contractor could rectify the defects.  The developer received four bids ranging from S$2.165m to S$2.741m to rectify the defects.  The developer accepted a bid for S$2.2m from one WTC, and called on the performance bond in full on that basis.  The contractor applied to restrain the call on the bond for being unconscionable.  The judge granted the injunction, holding that the call on the bond was “clearly unconscionable, abusive and bordered on being fraudulent”.  The main reasons for his decision were: (a) the letter of award issued by the developer to WTC was a one-page document devoid of any details as to WTC’s scope of “rectification works”; (b) WTC did not appear to have the relevant expertise to carry out the rectification works; (c) WTC’s quoted price was “a hefty six times more” than the S$371,665 which the subcontractor originally appointed by the contractor was charging for the cladding works that were the main subject of the rectification works; (d) the Superintending Officer had issued a completion certificate for the project which was priced at S$11.515m, and it would have been most surprising for him to have done so if rectification works costing S$2.2m (as the developer contended) remained outstanding; and (e) the highest quotation obtained by the contractor for the rectification works was only S$560,000, suggesting that WTC’s quoted price was “grossly inflated”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Court of Appeal upheld the judge’s decision to restrain the call on the bond on account of its unconscionability, adding only that on a proper interpretation of the bond, it appeared to be a true indemnity performance bond such that it was limited to indemnifying the developer against <span class="font-italic">actual </span>losses that it sustained due to the contractor’s breach of the construction contract.  The nature of the bond, coupled with the fact that the developer had not proven that it had suffered actual loss arising from the contractor’s breach of the construction contract, bolstered the finding that the call on the bond was unconscionable (<span class="font-italic">JBE Properties </span>at [19] and [30]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 With the foregoing principles in mind, I turn to consider whether the relevant facts as viewed in the entire context of the case support the plaintiff’s contention that the first defendant’s call on the PB was unconscionable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was the call on the PB unconscionable?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In considering the relevant facts of the case, I first deal with the question of the timing of the call on the PB.  Then, I will consider the arguments that the call on the PB was motivated by improper purposes, as well as the related question about the temporary finality of 1AD.  Finally, I will consider the provisions of the Subcontract as to when there can be recourse to the PB.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Timing of the call on the PB</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The first category of submissions which the plaintiff relies on to assert that the call on the bond was unconscionable relates to the timing of the call.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It is argued that the matter of the fraudulent claims was in issue before the adjudicator in SOP 98/2019.

</div>  That is because the first defendant had not in its adjudication response asserted that there should be a refund of the overpaid amount.  The issue of fraud was raised as a preliminary point to “invalidate” the entire adjudication application on the basis that it was unsafe to entertain the claims in PC 25 since the first defendant could show that PC 24 included fraudulent over-claims.

</div>  In short, PC 25 had been tainted by fraud.  Since the adjudicator in SOP 98/2019 would not decide whether the first defendant would be entitled to a refund from the plaintiff for the fraudulent over-claims, there was no need for the first defendant to wait until the determination is issued before calling on the PB.

</div>  The first defendant did not seek a return of the alleged over-claimed amount of approximately S$2m by way of a set-off in its payment response to PC 25.  Instead, what was argued by the first defendant in those adjudication proceedings was that PC 25 was tainted by fraud because the previous payment claim (<span class="font-italic">ie,</span> PC 24) was fraudulent in nature.  This in turn was because it had incorporated the amounts already claimed and adjudicated upon in SOP 372/2018, in relation to PC 20, which included deliberate over-claims.  The general submission made by the first defendant was that a party cannot make a further payment claim if a previous payment claim was shown to be fraudulent.  As such, the first defendant contended that the adjudicator should completely reject PC 25 as being tainted by fraud, and should not have to deal with or consider the “merits” of PC 25.

In fact, as correctly put by the first defendant, the adjudicator would not have been in a position to decide on the amount of the alleged over-claim because there was no attempt by the first defendant to set-off the alleged over-claim amount against the amount claimed by the plaintiff in PC 25.  Instead, the only amount that the first defendant sought to set-off from the plaintiff’s claim in PC 25 related to backcharges in the sum of S$497,989.77, which sum did not include the alleged over-claim amount.

One major point was how the work done by the plaintiff should be measured.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The plaintiff argued that the measurement should be by reference to the actual quantities of work done.  The plaintiff relied primarily on drawings issued by the LTA to the first defendant, and by site measurement drawings which had been signed off by both the plaintiff and first defendant.  For certain specific items of work, the plaintiff relied on the number of lorry loads, as it argued that this method of measurement was specified by the bill of quantities in the Subcontract.

The evidence before the adjudicator showed that the plaintiff had been specifically instructed to segregate the slime from the hardcore materials, such that the slime had to be transported to the TOL treatment area before being sent to MESG, the LTA Staging Ground.  Hence, the adjudicator found that it was incorrect to apply the unit rate applicable for item D1, which did not relate to slime.

</div> and as can be seen from 1AD, it is clear that parties had agreed to different methods of measurement for different kinds of work and different types of materials disposed of.  For example, the same quantity of materials may be subjected to different types of charges depending on what kind of work is done by the plaintiff on those materials.  Given this, I cannot agree with the first defendant that there is an over-claim <span class="font-italic">merely</span> by referring to its calculation of the final disposal quantity and comparing it with the sum of the quantities in PC 24, <span class="font-italic">without</span> taking into account which portions of the quantities claimed in PC 24 were subject to which of the many different charges for different work done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The allegation concerning the over-claim for hardcore disposal suffers from a different difficulty in that the bill of quantities in the Subcontract, as recognised by the adjudicator in 1AD, measures some of the quantities of hardcore disposal claimable by the plaintiff in terms of lorry loads <span class="font-italic">and</span> some by the “as built drawings”.  Thus, in some cases, the <span class="font-italic">actual</span> quantities of hardcore materials transported by the plaintiff may be irrelevant because the measurement proceeds <span class="font-italic">on the basis of the number of lorry loads involved</span>.  If so, the mere fact that there is a difference in the volume of hardcore material claimed in PC 24 and the first defendant’s own calculation does not tell us whether there has in fact been an over-claim under the terms of the Subcontract.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Further, and more fundamentally, I disagree that it was possible for the first defendant to ascertain a figure of final disposal quantity from the weight figures found in the plaintiff’s emails in January 2019 to the LTA.  The single conversion formula used by the first defendant to convert weight to volume does not take into account the different types of material disposed of, such as slime, sludge, hardcore, soil, <span class="font-italic">etc</span>, which densities will vary widely.  It cannot properly and sensibly be a basis to assert that the volume of material disposed of is different from what is stated in PC 24.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The difficulties with the first defendant’s position is perhaps best demonstrated by its quantification of the amount of the alleged over-claim of S$2,057,944.79.

</div>  However, these items of work were allowed by the adjudicator for disposal for slime and sludge, and also for work done by the plaintiff in segregating the slime and sludge from the hardcore material.  There was no explanation by the first defendant in its submissions or its affidavits before me as to how claims for these types of work correlated to the over-claims on the final disposal quantity or the hardcore disposal.  I am left to conclude that this again is simply the first defendant’s disagreement with the determination of the adjudicator rather than any genuine grievance about an over-claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Perhaps the clearest illustrations that the first defendant has been unable to quantify the alleged over-claims in the amount of S$2,057,944.79 in relation to the final disposal quantity and the hardcore disposal are items I2 and I7.

</div>
</div>
</div>  However, it must not be forgotten that the first defendant had asserted in PR 20 that the method of measurement of quantities is by reference to design or construction drawings, a position that the adjudicator in 1AD had rejected.  That being the case, the onus is on the first defendant to show the amounts of the over-claim by reference to the newly uncovered evidence, not just by restating figures in PR 20 which were calculated on a different basis altogether.  But, there has been no real explanation or justification of these figures by the first defendant, just simply an assertion that these figures represent the over-claim amounts.  This is quite fatal, in my judgment, because this reveals that the first defendant’s “call on the bond [was] motivated by [the] improper purpose” (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [37]) of seeking to overturn parts of the adjudicator’s findings in SOP 372/2018.  This was done by way of a purported reliance on the alleged newfound discoveries of fraudulent over-claims on the plaintiff’s part.  In fact, the above discussion reveals that the differences between the amounts awarded by the adjudicator in 1AD and the figures in PR 20 form the true basis of its call on the PB, and that the alleged overclaims which were supposedly only uncovered after SOP 372/2018 has been raised as a façade to justify the first defendant’s call on the PB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 It bears emphasis that I make no findings about whether the plaintiff had or had not made any fraudulent over-claims.  In evaluating whether the call on the bond was unconscionable, the court does not consider the “substantive entitlements of the parties”.  This is because, during the interlocutory proceedings for an injunction, the court is not in a position to determine the “reliability and probative value” of the evidence, and the key consideration in an injunction application is simply whether the “overall tenor and entire context of the conduct of the parties support a strong <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of unconscionability” (<span class="font-italic">Mount Sophia </span>at [40]).  My findings relate solely to the circumstances surrounding the call on the PB.  Given that the figures claimed to support the call on the PB are but a restatement of the figures in PR 20, I am inclined to agree with the plaintiff that the call on the PB was motivated by the improper purpose of clawing back some of the sums paid under 1AD, on the pretext of alleged newly discovered fraudulent over-claims that had been made by the plaintiff or because that there has been some kind of re-measurement done by the first defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Therefore, in my judgment, the S$2,057,944.79 that the first defendant claims as being overpaid, and which formed the basis for its call on the PB, quite clearly just stemmed from its disagreement with the adjudicator’s determination on various items of work in 1AD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Given my conclusion above that the first defendant was simply dissatisfied with the adjudication determination in 1AD and looking to claw back some portion of it by calling on the PB, the related question is whether this would offend the principle that the determination enjoys temporary finality.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Temporary finality of 1AD</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Under s 21 of SOPA, an adjudication determination binds the parties until three situations arise.  First, when leave of court to enforce the adjudication determination is refused pursuant to s 27 of SOPA (s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of SOPA).  Second, when the dispute between the parties is full and finally settled, whether by arbitration, court proceedings or otherwise (s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of SOPA).  Third, when the dispute is settled by agreement of the parties (s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of SOPA).  Until any of these three situations arise, the parties must comply with and respect that determination.  In that sense, there is a limited form of issue estoppel that binds the parties in relation to the items of work and amounts payable as determined by the adjudicator.  In my judgment, it would offend the temporary finality of an adjudication determination if a party is permitted to effectively “re-open” that decision by calling on a performance bond to claim amounts that were disallowed by the adjudicator in his determination, or to recover amounts that were allowed by the adjudicator in his determination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The first defendant submits that the temporary finality of 1AD is not being challenged.  It has made payment in full under that determination.  It respects and has complied with that determination.

There, the contractor sought to restrain the developer from receiving payments under an on-demand performance bond until the final determination of the intended arbitration between the parties.  In the entirety of the circumstances, the district judge concluded that, while the bond was called a mere ten days after the developer had paid out on an adjudication determination, this was insufficient to show that the call on the performance bond was unconscionable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 In my view, the SOPA regime exists in large separately and independently from the contractual arrangements between the parties as to security.  Ultimately, whether and when a bond may be called depends on the contractual arrangements between the parties.  However, a call on a bond may in certain circumstances be regarded as unconscionable and/or in bad faith, and thus should be enjoined, if the beneficiary attempts to justify its call based on arguments that have already been decided (and dismissed) in an adjudication determination.  I accept the plaintiff’s counsel’s submissions that, if a call made in such circumstances is permitted, the temporary finality of the adjudication determination may be undermined.

</div>  This is because, on the one hand, the sub-contractor receives a sum pursuant to the adjudication determination, but, on the other hand, it might then have to use some part of that sum to reimburse its bank because the main contractor has called for payment under the bond for matters already decided by the adjudicator in the sub-contractor’s favour.  This would contradict the stated purpose of SOPA, which is to facilitate cash flow in the building and construction industry, in particular for sub-contractors: see <span class="font-italic">W</span><span class="font-italic"> Y Steel </span>at [18].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It seems to me that the first defendant appears to accept this proposition as correct because it does not put forward its case as one where it simply disagrees with the determination of the adjudicator in 1AD <span class="font-italic">per se </span>and hence is entitled to re-assert its position in those adjudication proceedings as the basis upon which to call on the PB.  Rather, the first defendant based its call on the PB as one which was based on <span class="font-italic">new</span> evidence discovered <span class="font-italic">after</span> the adjudication proceedings in 1AD were completed.  However, as already explained, I do not accept that this was a genuine reason because the first defendant was wholly unable to justify the amount of its claim for overpayments by reference to any new evidence.  Furthermore, by its attempt to resurrect the amounts that it had relied on in PR 20, the first defendant has revealed that its true grievance is not because of any newly discovered evidence of over-claims, whether fraudulent or otherwise, or any genuine re-measurement that it conducted, but a simple refusal to accept that it is bound by the adjudicator’s determination in 1AD at this time.  Herein lies the fundamental difference between the present case and <span class="font-italic">AM Construction</span>.  While in <span class="font-italic">AM Construction</span>, the developer had called on the performance bond based on genuine disputes that had <span class="font-italic">not</span> been the subject of the adjudication determination (<span class="font-italic">AM Construction </span>at [55] and [75]), the first defendant here is seeking to call on the performance bond precisely to undermine 1AD, by masking its call as one based on <span class="font-italic">new </span>evidence when a proper analysis shows that this is not the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For the same reason, <span class="font-italic">AES Façade </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Wyse Pte Ltd and another </span>[2018] SGHC 163 also does not assist the first defendant.  In that case, the subcontractor sought to restrain its main contractor from calling on the full guaranteed sum under the performance bond.  The subcontractor argued that the call was an “unfair attempt to ‘claw back’ the monies paid out following the adjudication determination”, which had been decided in the subcontractor’s favour.  Lee Seiu Kin J did not accept the subcontractor’s argument as the issue of liquidated damages for delay, on which the main contractor justified its call on the bond, had consistently been relied on by the main contractor.  The main contractor had been unable to raise the issue of liquidated damages during the adjudication as its payment response had been served out of time and thus could not be considered by the adjudicator.  Hence, it could not be said that the call was a retaliatory attempt to claw back some of the amount paid under the adjudication determination since the basis of the call, being the liquidated damages, was not even in issue in the adjudication.  That case is thus different from the present one.  Here, the first defendant is in fact trying to claw back some of the sums paid out under 1AD, based on issues that had been ventilated during the adjudication proceedings in SOP 372/2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 A question may arise as to whether Singapore courts ought nonetheless to grant the same amount of latitude to parties to call on their contractual entitlement to security as in the Australian cases cited in <span class="font-italic">AM Construction</span>.  Of the two cases cited therein, <span class="font-italic">Patterson Building Group Pty Ltd v Holroyd City Council </span>[2013] NSWSC 1484 (“<span class="font-italic">Patterson</span>”) is more analogous to our present situation.  There, the contractor sought to restrain the employer from calling on two guarantees which it had obtained in favour of the employer.  A question was raised as to whether the employer was entitled to have recourse to the security to recover amounts paid pursuant to an adjudicator’s determination.  In particular, the issue was whether allowing such a call would “have the effect of excluding, modifying, or restricting the operation of the” Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999 (New South Wales) (“NSW SOPA”) (<span class="font-italic">Patterson</span> at [59]).  That provision is s 34 of the NSW SOPA, which has its counterpart in s 36 of our SOPA.  White J held that there was nothing inconsistent with allowing the employer to exercise its security by calling on the bond.  This was because the adjudicator’s determination had already achieved its desired effect of requiring the employer to make payment to the contractor when it otherwise would not have been obliged to make such payment prior to the final determination of the parties’ contractual rights.  According to the judge, the contractor had voluntarily assumed the risks associated with obtaining the performance bond, and it would “substantially weaken” the purpose of granting such bonds if a call could be restrained simply because it would cause hardship or damage the contractor’s reputation (<span class="font-italic">Patterson </span>at [70]–[75] and [79]).  Thus, the contractor’s application to restrain the call on the guarantees was dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The district judge in <span class="font-italic">AM Construction </span>considered the decision of <span class="font-italic">Patterson</span>, and relied on it as a basis to conclude that “the [contractor] would not be worse off by the call on the Performance Bond than if it did not have the benefit of the adjudication determination.  On the flip side, the [developer] should not be made worse off by the adjudication determination such that he is being deprived from exercising his contractual right as agreed upon by parties” (<span class="font-italic">AM Construction </span>at [74]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 However, the status of an adjudication determination appears to differ in Singapore and New South Wales, Australia.  Section 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the NSW SOPA provides that “nothing in this Part affects any right that a party to a construction contract: (a) may have under the contract …”.  In accordance with that provision, a “determination is not a determination of the parties’ contractual rights and obligations.  The adjudication determines, on an interim basis, an amount to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff in respect of its claim for a progress payment, but, otherwise, and subject to s 34 of the [NSW SOPA], the adjudication does not affect the parties’ rights under the contract” [emphasis in original removed] (<span class="font-italic">Patterson </span>at [22]).  Therefore, under the NSW SOPA, an adjudication determination in New South Wales appears to be a simple means of obtaining “prompt interim progress payment”.  This is made clear by the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">John Holland Pty Ltd v Roads and Traffic Authority</span><span class="font-italic"> of New South Wales </span>[2007] NSWCA 140 at [62]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is not correct that retention of security “undoes” an adjudicator’s determination … The adjudicator’s determination remains, and brings payment of the adjudicated amount, but that is interim and subject to a different position being established in relation to payment for the relevant work or related goods and services, contractually or in proceedings. If in civil proceedings it is decided that the contractor was entitled to $10 or $30, rather than the $20 determined by the adjudicator, that does not undo the adjudicator’s determination. It has done its work in <span class="font-weight-bold">ensuring “prompt interim progress payment on account, pending final determination of all disputes” </span>(per Ipp JA in <span class="font-italic">Brewarrina Shire Council v Beckhaus Civil Pty Ltd</span> …) [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In contrast, s 21 of our SOPA, which has no equivalent in the NSW SOPA, has been interpreted as according an adjudication determination the status of temporary finality.  This is to be distinguished from the interim status accorded to adjudication determinations under the NSW SOPA.  As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel </span>at [18], s 21 of SOPA “creates an intervening, provisional process of adjudication which, although provisional in nature, is <span class="font-italic">final and binding on the parties to the adjudication until their differences are ultimately and conclusively determined or resolved</span>” [emphasis added].  Hence, the temporary finality accorded to adjudication determinations in Singapore operates as a limited form of issue estoppel on the disputes raised before the adjudicator, in the sense that the adjudicator’s determination of such issues are “final and binding” <span class="font-italic">unless and until </span>it is overcome by one of the three circumstances highlighted in s 21 of the SOPA, such as where the dispute is finally determined by a court or tribunal (s 21(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) SOPA).  Hence, insofar as the judge in <span class="font-italic">AM Construction </span>concluded at [74] that the beneficiary of a bond ought not to be made worse off by an adjudication determination such that he is being deprived of his contractual right to call on said bond, I will add the following caveat – in calling on the bond, the beneficiary cannot rely on contentions and claims that were disposed of by an adjudicator against the beneficiary, and whose determination remains binding on the beneficiary.  Otherwise, the beneficiary would be contravening the principle of temporary finality (guaranteed by s 21 of SOPA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 On the facts, I am of the view that the first defendant’s statements and conduct belie its true motives behind the call on the PB, which is not a proper one since it seeks to undermine the temporary finality of 1AD.  In my judgment, this shows unconscionability affecting the call on the PB.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The provisions in the Subcontract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Finally, the plaintiff submits that the call on the PB is inconsistent with the terms of the Subcontract, thus bolstering a finding that the call was made unconscionably.  The terms of the Subcontract are relevant because it shows the agreement between the parties as to the purpose of the PB.  If the call on the PB is not one that is contemplated by the terms of the Subcontract, this would constitute further evidence of unconscionability, as the first defendant would stand to gain more than what it bargained for under the Subcontract (see <span class="font-italic">JBE Properties </span>at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Min Thai Holdings Pte Ltd v Sunlabel Pte Ltd </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 961, the defendant-buyer was restrained from calling on the performance guarantee as the non-delivery of rice was due to floods caused by a typhoon, and there was a “<span class="font-italic">force majeure</span>” clause in the contract.  In the circumstances, the court felt that it was unconscionable for the defendant to receive payment under the performance guarantee.  The decision was recognised as an example when it would be unconscionable to call on a performance bond or guarantee in the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Dauphin Offshore Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 117 at [46].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Also, in <span class="font-italic">Ryobi Tactics Pte Ltd v UES Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another matter </span>[2019] 4 SLR 1324 (“<span class="font-italic">Ryobi Tactics</span>”), the subcontractor was engaged by the main contractor for three different construction projects, namely the Changi, the Jurong, and the Chestnut projects.  A total of four subcontracts were entered into.  Under each subcontract, the subcontractor was to furnish the main contractor with a performance bond.  When disputes arose in relation to the Chestnut project <span class="font-italic">only</span>, the main contractor called on the full value of all four performance bonds.  Kannan Ramesh J held that on the face of the performance bonds, the main contractor was not entitled to call on the three performance bonds that related to the Changi and Jurong projects for losses which it allegedly suffered in relation to the Chestnut project.  Thus, on an application of contractual principles, the calls on those three performance bonds ought to be restrained.  In any case, the calls on the performance bonds were unconscionable because clause 5.6(b) of the subcontracts indicated that the parties intended the performance bonds to be called only when the main contractor had reason to believe that the corresponding subcontract had been breached.  To allow the calls on the performance bonds in circumstances when the corresponding subcontract had not been breached would be to condone the breach of the relevant subcontract (<span class="font-italic">Ryobi </span><span class="font-italic">Tactics </span>at [36]).  Consequently, it was held that the calls on the performance bonds that related to the Changi and Jurong projects would be restrained as they were unconscionable for going beyond the terms of the underlying subcontracts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In this case, clause 2.2.1 of the Subcontract provides that the plaintiff must provide to the first defendant an “irrevocable, unconditional and payable on-demand performance security” in a form set out in the appendix to the Subcontract.

I do not think that the words “performance security” as used in the Subcontract when referring to the PB can be read as expansively as the plaintiff contends.

In any event, it was not correct that the termination of the Subcontract meant the cessation of all of the plaintiff’s duties and obligations.  In fact, clause 2.2.3 of the Subcontract provides that the PB “shall be valid until the completion of the Subcontractor’s responsibilities and obligations for the remedy of defects in the Subcontract Works”.
