</div> The Appellant claimed that he was entitled to do so because according to him, he had been dealing with Mr Toh See Leong for “more than ten years”, and had noted that the latter would deal with him using both SHB Motoring and the 1st Respondent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The 1st and 2nd Respondents asserted that the Appellant had no right under the Hire Purchase Agreement to use monies paid to settle the outstanding hire purchase loan for the set-off of debts owed by SHB Motoring. Further, having wrongfully applied the sum of $13,301 towards partial set-off of debts owed by SHB Motoring, the Appellant had failed to take steps to lodge the HPFLAS Form B with LTA to confirm that the Vehicle was no longer under financing. This meant that the HPFLAS Form A – which indicated that the Vehicle was under financing – remained in LTA’s records. The 1st and 2nd Respondents took the position that the Appellant’s failure to lodge Form B effectively prevented the transfer of the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent in LTA’s records.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In considering the issue of a third party’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to appeal directly a decision on the action between the plaintiff and the defendant, I start with the provisions of O 16 r 7 ROC, which are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Judgment between defendant and third party (O. 16, r. 7)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">7.</span> – (1) Where in any action a defendant has served a third party notice, the Court may at or after the trial of the action, or, if the action is decided otherwise than by trial, on an application by summons, order such judgment as the nature of the case may require to be entered for the defendant against the third party or for the third party against the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Where in an action judgment is given against a defendant and judgment is given for the defendant against a third party, execution shall not issue against the third party without the leave of the Court until the judgment against the defendant has been satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 On the face of it, O 16 r 7 ROC simply provides for the relationship between the defendant and the third party – without saying anything about the relationship between the plaintiff and the third party. However, the relevant extract from the <span class="font-italic">White Book</span> suggests that notwithstanding the absence of any express provision in O 16 r 7 ROC, the third party may in certain situations appeal against a judgment for the plaintiff:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16/7/6 <span class="font-weight-bold">Appeal </span>–<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>Appeal lies from any judgment between the defendant and the third party as in ordinary actions. The right of the third party to appeal from a judgment for plaintiff depends upon whether the third party is directed to be bound by the order made under r.4. See <span class="font-italic">The Millwall </span>[1905] P. 155.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I address in subsequent paragraphs the case of <span class="font-italic">The Millwall</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>which is cited by the authors of the <span class="font-italic">White Book</span>. For completeness, I add that I have also referred to O 16 r 4 ROC. The authors of the <span class="font-italic">White Book</span> cited this provision (at para 16/7/6) in relation to the proposition that a third party may appeal an order in favour of the plaintiff when it has been directed to be bound by the order made. I reproduce O 16 r 4 below for ease of reference:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> <span class="font-weight-bold">Third party directions (O.16, r.4)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4. </span>– (1) The defendant who issued a third party notice must, by summons in Form 20 to be served on all the other parties to the action, apply to the Court for directions, except that where the action was begun by writ, such application shall not be made before the third party enters an appearance in Form 10.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) If no summons is served on the third party under paragraph (1), the third party may – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (a) in an action begun by writ, not earlier than 7 days after entering an appearance; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (b) in an action begun by originating summons, not earlier than 14 days after service of the notice on him,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">by summons in Form 20 to be served on all the other parties to the action, apply to the Court for directions or for an order to set aside the third party notice.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) On an application for directions under this Rule, the Court may – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (a) if the liability of the third party to the defendant who issued the third party notice is established on the hearing, order such judgment as the nature of the case may require to be entered against the third party in favour of the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (b) order any claim, question or issue stated in the third party notice to be tried in such manner as the Court may direct; or </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (c) dismiss the application and terminate the proceedings on the third party notice; and may do so either before or after any judgment in the action has been signed by the plaintiff against the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) On an application for directions under this Rule, the Court may give the third party leave to defend the action, either alone or jointly with any defendant, upon such terms as may be just, or to appear at the trial or hearing and to take such part therein as may be just, and generally may make such orders and give such directions as appear to the Court proper for having the rights and liabilities of the parties most conveniently determined and enforced and as to the extent to which the third party is to be bound by any judgment or decision in the action. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) Any order made or direction given under this Rule must be in Form 21 and may be varied or rescinded by the Court at any time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 O 16 r 4(4) ROC allows a Court to order that a third party be bound by “any judgment or decision in the action”. However, the rule is silent on whether such a third party may appeal a judgment or decision given in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 For completeness, I add that neither the Appellant nor the 3rd Respondent pointed me to any local caselaw on the issue of a third party’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to appeal a judgment in favour of the plaintiff. Although the 3rd Respondent has cited the case of <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte Ltd and others </span>[2012] 2 SLR 549 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Juay Pah</span>”), I do not find it to be relevant to this specific issue. In <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Juay Pah</span>, the plaintiff Kimly was the main contractor for a project where a tower crane had collapsed onsite. Kimly sued its sub-contractor Rango, who brought in the appellant TJP as third party, claiming that TJP was obliged to indemnify Rango in the event it was found liable to Kimly. At trial, the trial judge granted Kimly judgment in its claim against Rango. TJP failed in his submission of “no case to answer” vis-à-vis Rango’s claim for an indemnity from him, with the result that Rango succeeded in its claim against him. Rango did not appeal the trial judge’s decision that it was liable to Kimly, but TJP appealed the entirety of the trial judge’s decision. On appeal, the Court of Appeal (“CA”) held that since TJP had submitted “no case to answer” vis-à-vis Rango in the court below, the determinative issue was whether Rango had established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>legal basis for TJP to indemnify it in respect of its liability to Kimly. The CA ruled that even if all the evidential issues were resolved in Rango’s favour, Rango’s case against TJP would still fail as it could not establish a legal basis for TJP to indemnify it in respect of its liability to Kimly. In short, therefore, the issue of a third party’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to appeal a judgment in favour of the plaintiff was not before the CA in <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Juay Pah</span>. I will, however, refer to this case in the later part of this judgment, in relation to a different issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">English Position</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I next examine the English authorities which have dealt with the issue of a third party’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to appeal a judgment in favour of the plaintiff. I start with the case of <span class="font-italic">The Millwall</span>, which was cited by the authors of the <span class="font-italic">White Book.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In <span class="font-italic">The Millwall</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the plaintiffs were cargo owners whose goods were damaged when the barge in which they were being conveyed met with a collision. The barge-owners had, on the plaintiffs’ instructions, employed a tug; and the collision had been caused by the negligent navigation of the tug-owners’ servants. The plaintiffs brought an action for damages against the barge-owners and the tug-owners as co-defendants. The barge-owners were dismissed from the suit with costs to be paid by the plaintiffs, while the tug-owners were held liable with costs for the damage sustained by the plaintiffs, together with the costs to be paid by the plaintiffs to the barge-owners. The tug-owners served on the barge-owners, by a third-party notice, a claim for an indemnity arising from a contract of indemnity between the tug-owners (as service provider) and the barge-owners (as customer). On the issue raised by the third-party notice, the barge-owners were adjudged responsible for the amount of the damage for which the tug-owners had been held liable, together with the two sets of costs. Both the barge-owners and the tug-owners filed appeals, but the latter subsequently withdrew its appeal.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In dismissing the barge-owners’ appeal, the English CA held that the barge-owners could not appeal in respect of the decision in favour of the plaintiffs against the tug-owners, because they were not parties to that judgment. Further, not having paid the amount adjudged to be due by the tug-owners to the plaintiffs, they were not subrogated to their rights; and even if subrogated, they could not avail themselves of an appeal which the tug-owners had abandoned. Nor could the barge-owners avail themselves of the third-party procedure under the Judicature Act: although the court would have had power under the said Act to put the barge-owners into the shoes of the tug-owners for the purpose of questioning the decision of the court below as between the plaintiffs and the tug-owners, the court had not been invited to do so. Consequently, in the words of Collins MR (at 164): </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…no order has been made determining that the third parties [the barge-owners]… were bound by the judgment in the action, and therefore…there is nothing binding the barge-owners by the result of the judgment between the plaintiffs and the tug-owners.  There is no provision whereby the owners of the barge have been substituted as defendants, giving them all the rights in the conduct of the trial, with the right to appeal in their own name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In <span class="font-italic">Asphalt</span>, the plaintiffs employed A Ltd to do work for them and the defendants gave a bond to guarantee A Ltd’s due performance of the contract. Four individuals, including one C, then gave an undertaking to the defendants that A Ltd would perform the terms of the contract and that if any claim was made against the defendants on the bond, they would pay the claim amount with costs and expenses. When A Ltd failed to fulfil the contract, the plaintiffs sued the defendants on the bond. In turn, the latter claimed indemnity from the four individuals and served third party notices on all four of them. Directions were given that the question of liability between the third parties and the defendants be determined at the trial, and that the third parties might then appear and oppose the plaintiffs’ claim so far as they might be affected thereby.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 At trial, of the third parties, only C appeared. Judgment was given for the plaintiffs against the defendants and for the defendants against the third parties. C served notice of appeal on the defendants, who themselves served notice of appeal on the plaintiffs. The English CA was asked to rule on the question of whether C was entitled to appeal against the judgment given in favour of the plaintiffs and whether the defendants were necessary parties to any appeal against that judgment. The court ruled that the third parties could not appeal directly against the plaintiffs except by leave of the court and that leave would not be given in the present case. In his judgment (at 971H-972D), Lord Denning MR noted the observations by the court in <span class="font-italic">The Millwall </span>that if a third party was substituted as a defendant, or an order had been made binding him as against the plaintiff, then he might be allowed to appeal direct against the plaintiff. Lord Denning MR went on to hold as follows:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">But, there being no such order in that case [<span class="font-italic">The Millwall</span>], the third party there was not allowed to appeal direct. <span class="font-weight-bold">It remains for us then to say when a third party can appeal directly against the plaintiff.  In my opinion a third party cannot do so except by leave of this court: but the court can give leave whenever it thinks it just and convenient to do so</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my view this is not a case for leave to be given. The plaintiffs ought not to be burdened by a direct appeal by [C]. He is impecunious. They have had no relations with him. Their contract was only with [A Ltd]; and they relied on the bond given by [the defendants]. In the court below they sued only [the defendants] because that was the only company who had the money to pay the claim or the costs. In this situation, I think the plaintiffs are entitled, on any appeal, to look to the defendants to pay the costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We will direct, therefore, that the third parties can appeal and give notice of appeal as against the defendants; and the defendants in turn can give a notice of appeal as against the plaintiffs; but that the third parties cannot directly appeal against the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Agreeing with Lord Denning MR, Edmund Davies LJ also pointed out (at 973) that the third party was not bound by the judgment awarded in the plaintiff’s favour and that he was never substituted as a defendant. As he noted, it “is… not right to say that in every case where a third party has been given leave to defend he is thereby ipso facto entitled to appeal directly against a judgment awarded in the plaintiffs’ favour”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 From the English authorities, it would appear that the following principles may be distilled:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When an order has been made determining that the third party in an action is bound by a judgment given in favour of the plaintiff, the third party will generally have a right to appeal directly against that judgment;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the absence of such an order, a third party will ordinarily not be able to appeal directly against a judgment given in favour of the plaintiff, unless leave is obtained from the court for the third party to do so;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The court has a discretion to grant the third party leave to appeal against a plaintiff directly whenever the court thinks it just and convenient to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Australian Position</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I next consider the Australian authorities on this issue, starting with the case of <span class="font-italic">Dooley</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> The case arose from a baseball game in which the first defendant (one of the players) had collided with the plaintiff (another player) who was injured. The plaintiff sued the first defendant and the League (the second defendant) in charge of the conduct of these baseball tournaments, claiming damages for negligence. The second defendant joined the appellant – the Insurance Exchange of Australasia – as a third party, claiming indemnity under its policy with the appellant. The first defendant also filed a cross-claim against the appellant to seek indemnity under the policy. The trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiff against both defendants, and for both defendants against the appellant insurer. The appellant then applied for leave to appeal against the judgment given against it in favour of the defendants as well as the judgment given in favour of the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Before the New South Wales (NSW) CA, the plaintiff argued that the appellant had no standing to attack the judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants. In rejecting this argument, the court held (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Handley JA, at [9]):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The question of standing in a case such as this depends on the effect of a judgment in favour of a plaintiff on the liability of a third party to the defendant. If a judgment in favour of the plaintiff binds the third party as a <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, one would think, on first principles, that the third party would have the normal right of a litigant to be heard before that judgment was given, and to appeal against it should it be adverse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Having considered the procedural framework in the District Court Rules 1973 (Australia) (“DCR”) which governed the joinder of a third party and the conduct of third party proceedings (Pt 21 rr 4 and 5), Handley JA opined (at [12]) that the object of the third party procedure was “to get the third party bound by the decision between the plaintiff and the defendant” (citing <span class="font-italic">Barclays Bank v Tom </span>[1923] 1 KB 221 at 224), that is “to make that decision a <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>as between the defendant and the third party”. In particular, the applicable rules made the third party “a party to the action”. In the circumstances, a litigant who was a party to proceedings, and bound by a judgment which was adverse to his interests “must, in principle, have the necessary standing to appeal” (at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Handley JA also observed (at [28]-[29]) that under the DCR, Pt 20 provided that a claim on any cause of action on which the defendant might have brought an action in court could be pleaded as a cross-claim. Pursuant to DCR Pt 20 rule 4 (b) to (d), the court could, at any stage of an action, make orders giving a defendant to a cross-claim leave to defend the claim on the statement of claim, to appear at the trial of the claim on the statement of claim, and to take such part in the trial as the court thought fit; and the court could also determine the extent to which the cross-claimant and a defendant to the cross-claim should be bound as between themselves by a judgment on the claim in the statement of claim. In <span class="font-italic">Dooley </span>itself, the trial had proceeded without any such orders being made, but Handley JA pointed out that the trial had been conducted on the basis that the appellant insurer had full rights of defence in respect of the plaintiff’s claims against both defendants; and counsel for the appellant insurer had cross-examined the plaintiff without objection. Citing the Australian High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Helicopter Sales</span>, Handley JA opined (at [32]) that the NSW Supreme Court should apply the dicta of Barwick CJ and Mason J in that case that in a situation where a third party had defended the action against the defendants without any order having been made under DCR Pt 20 rule 4 (b) to (d), the third party would nonetheless have standing to appeal against a judgment entered for the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Noting that there were statements in <span class="font-italic">The Millwall </span>which suggested a contrary result, Handley JA disagreed with the reasoning of the CA in that case. Although Collins MR in <span class="font-italic">The Millwall </span>had found that the barge-owners were not parties to the decision against the tug-owners, Handley JA criticized the reasoning in that case as being unsatisfactory. In his view (at [36]-[37]), since the barge-owners and the tug-owners were both defendants in the action, a decision that one of them was liable to the plaintiff – and the other was not – bound the defendants not only against the plaintiff but also as between themselves: the barge-owners who were held not liable to the plaintiff were bound by the decision that the tug-owners were liable, quite apart from the effect of the third party proceedings. He opined (at [42]) that –</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">If the result of the rules of court, or directions given under them, is that a third party is not bound by the decision as between the plaintiff and the defendant, the third party would lack the standing to appeal against that decision. However in that event the defendant would have to prove his liability to the plaintiff all over against as against the third party. This would defeat the purpose of the third party procedure which is to make a judgment as between plaintiff and defendant binding on the third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As noted earlier, Handley JA cited the Australian High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Helicopter Sales</span> in <span class="font-italic">Dooley</span> for the purpose of applying the dicta of Barwick CJ and Mason J. It should be pointed out, though, that on the specific issue for which Handley JA cited <span class="font-italic">Helicopter Sales</span>, the views of the High Court coram were not uniform.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In <span class="font-italic">Helicopter Sales</span>, the plaintiff’s helicopter failed, resulting in the helicopter being lost and its occupants killed. The failure was due to a machining defect in the bolt which had occurred in its manufacture. The defendant (a wholly owned subsidiary of the plaintiff) had, under contract to the plaintiff, undertaken the servicing of the helicopter, and had fitted the defective bolt in the course of regular servicing. The defendant joined as third party the Australian distributor of helicopter parts from which it had purchased the bolt. The third party was given leave to defend and did in fact defend the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff against the defendant and for the defendant against the third party. The third party appealed not only against the judgment given against it in the defendant’s favour but also against the judgment given against the defendant in the plaintiff’s favour. No appeal was brought by the defendant. It was not disputed that there were no issues as to the defendant’s judgment against the third party: it would stand or fail with the plaintiff’s judgment against the defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Stephen J, with whose judgment Menzies J agreed, observed at [28] that an order by way of pre-trial third-party directions gave the third party leave “to defend the plaintiff’s action” but said nothing about “the extent to which the third party is to be bound by any judgment or decision in this action”. Stephen J also noted that the relevant civil procedure rules (Supreme Court Rules (Q.) O 17 r 4(4)) did not provide that a third party who entered an appearance would be bound by the result of the trial. He opined that “in the absence of a court order it is at least doubtful whether the third party would be bound by or be competent to appeal against the judgment in favour of the plaintiff”. However, in the <span class="font-italic">Helicopter Sales </span>appeal, no attack had been made upon the competency of the third party’s appeal against the judgment in favour of the plaintiff; and in fact, only the third party’s appeal against the judgment in favour of the plaintiff was argued, with its outcome being treated as decisive of the fate of the other appeal. In the light of these circumstances, Stephen J held that despite the absence of any order binding the third party under O 17 r 4(4), the appropriate course was to treat the matter as the parties themselves had chosen to – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>to deal with both of the third party’s appeals as if an order had been made binding it by the result of the trial of the issues between plaintiff and defendant. In coming to this conclusion, Stephen J cited <span class="font-italic">Asphalt</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>noting in addition that: </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…to do otherwise, allowing only the appeal against the defendant’s judgment and that only to the extent of the damages awarded, the defendant remaining entitled to nominal damages for breach of contract, appears to be a wholly unsatisfactory alternative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Mason J took a different view from Stephen J and Menzies J, opining that there was no difficulty in dealing with both of the third party’s appeals. At [2], Mason J observed that although no order had been made expressly binding the third party to the result of the trial of the issues between the plaintiff and the defendant, the third party had defended the plaintiff’s claim pursuant to an order giving it leave to do so. In his view, these circumstances sufficed to entitle the third party to appeal against the judgment given in the plaintiff’s favour. Mason J also indicated that he would have taken the same view even if the third party had defended the plaintiff’s action without the benefit of an order giving it leave to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Like Mason J, Barwick CJ took a different view from Stephen J and Menzies J (at [3]). He was of the view that a third party who was given leave to defend a plaintiff’s action, and who did so, was bound by the result of the issues which that third party contested. He was also of the view that the result of the third party contesting issues in the action did not depend on the making of an order determining the extent to which the third party should be bound but upon the making of an order giving the third party leave to defend the plaintiff’s action. Like Mason J, Barwick CJ took the position that where a third-party contested an action without leave to defend having been given, it “may well be proper to deal with the case as if an order giving leave had been made”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The fifth member of the coram, Jacobs J, did not express any views on the issue of the third party’s standing to appeal the judgment given in favour of the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I next consider the decision of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in <span class="font-italic">Gracechurch</span>, a case decided after <span class="font-italic">Helicopter Sales </span>but before <span class="font-italic">Dooley. </span>In <span class="font-italic">Gracechurch</span>, the appellant leased certain premises to a company. The first respondent (Mr Breeze) and the second respondent (Mrs Breeze) were directors of the company, who guaranteed the company’s liabilities under the lease. The appellant brought two separate actions against Mr and Mrs Breeze respectively, as guarantors, for recovery of monies owing under the lease. Mr Breeze disputed the amount owing. Mrs Breeze did not, but denied liability as a guarantor on the basis of an estoppel. Mrs Breeze issued third party proceedings against Mr Breeze founded on an indemnity given to her by Mr Breeze in respect of her liability under the guarantee. This indemnity had been provided during the course of matrimonial proceedings between Mr Breeze and Mrs Breeze. At trial, Mr Breeze was not able to be present by reason of illness, for which medical certificates were tendered. The magistrate hearing the matter proceeded with the trial and entered judgment for the appellant against Mr Breeze. The magistrate also entered judgment for the appellant against Mrs Breeze as well as judgment for Mrs Breeze against Mr Breeze. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Mr Breeze successfully applied to set aside both the default judgments against him and also successfully appealed to the District Court for the judgment against Mrs Breeze to be set aside. The appellant in turn appealed against the District Court’s decision, contending that the court was wrong to have found Mr Breeze prejudiced by the action against Mrs Breeze proceeding in his absence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In allowing the appeal and setting aside the District Court’s decision, the appellate court ruled that Mr Breeze did not have standing as a third party to appeal to the District Court against the judgment awarded in the appellant’s favour against the defendant Mrs Breeze. Citing <span class="font-italic">Asphalt </span>and <span class="font-italic">The Millwall</span>, Ipp J (with whom Seaman J and Pidgeon J agreed) held (at p 4):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The general rule is that there is no right of appeal by a third party against a judgment in favour of the plaintiff... This rule is, however, subject to certain exceptions.  A third party may appeal against the principal judgment if he is directed to be bound thereby… In this case no such order was given and indeed it appears that no third-party directions were ever given.  Nevertheless, notwithstanding the absence of third party directions, leave will be given to a third party to appeal directly against the plaintiff whenever it is just and convenient to do so…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the course of arguments on appeal, it was accepted that the question of Mr Breeze’s standing to appeal the judgment against Mrs Breeze depended on whether the former had been prejudiced by the judgment against the latter: if prejudice existed, he was rightly afforded standing; if there was no prejudice, he should not have been given leave to appeal. Mr Breeze had argued that he was prejudiced by the judgment against Mrs Breeze because that judgment would result in his having to spend more time in defending the litigation and would cause him to incur further costs. This argument was rejected by the appellate court. Ipp J pointed out (at p 6) that the additional time Mr Breeze would have had to spend did not, in law, amount to prejudice of the kind that should result in the setting aside of the magistrate’s judgment. The spending of time and the enduring of inconvenience were “inevitable burdens brought about by becoming involved in litigation”. As for the incurring of extra costs, any prejudice that might arise therefrom could be substantially cured by an appropriate costs award in favour of Mr Breeze, should it be held that he was so entitled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In addition, the District Court had taken the view that because the case against Mr Breeze was determined separately, the magistrate did not hear evidence about the amount owing, this being an issue disputed by Mr Breeze but conceded by Mrs Breeze. The District Court considered that this constituted detriment to Mr Breeze. The appellate court disagreed (at pp 13-14), holding that the judgment given against Mrs Breeze would be inadmissible in the third party proceedings and that accordingly, Mr Breeze did not suffer prejudice when the magistrate proceeded, in his absence, with the trial between the appellant and Mrs Breeze.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 <span class="font-italic">Hadley and anor v Hazian Pty Ltd and ors</span>,<span class="font-italic"> BDO v Hadley and </span><span class="font-italic">ors </span>BC9504075 (“<span class="font-italic">Hadley</span>”) was another case which came before the Supreme Court of Western Australia. In <span class="font-italic">Hadley</span>, the plaintiff Hazian had sued the defendants Hadley, Coffey and a company called Westprime Pty Ltd (“the Company”), on the basis of a Deed of Release by which it was alleged that Hadley and Coffey had agreed to purchase Hazian’s shares in the Company in accordance with the terms of the Deed. Hadley and Coffey joined as third party Nelson Parkville BDO, one of the accountants who had carried out the valuation of the shares, claiming that they had failed to value the shares in accordance with the provisions of the Deed and otherwise attacking the valuation on other grounds. The third party was given leave to appear and to be heard at the trial of the action, to take such part as the trial judge directed and to be bound by the result of the trial. A trial was ordered of a preliminary issue as to which (if any) of the defendants were liable to acquire the plaintiff’s shares in the Company and upon what basis. The Commissioner hearing the matter at first instance decided that Hadley and Coffey were each liable to purchase the plaintiff’s shares. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Western Australia had to decide <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>whether it was necessary for the third party to be granted leave to appeal the judgment. Malcolm CJ, with whom Pidgeon J and Franklyn J agreed, cited <span class="font-italic">Gracechurch</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Millwall</span>, <span class="font-italic">Asphalt </span>and <span class="font-italic">Helicopter Sales </span>in holding (at pp 6-7, [18]-[19]) that –</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">As a general rule, a third party to a proceeding has no standing to appeal against a judgment or order as between a plaintiff and a defendant or any other party: <span class="font-italic">Gracechurch Holdings </span><span class="font-italic">Oty Ltd v Breeze </span>[1992] 7 WAR 518. The reason why the third party has no standing is that a judgment cannot bind a person who is not a party to the principal proceedings in which it was granted, unless that party was directed to be bound by it: <span class="font-italic">Gracechurch Holdings Pty Ltd v Breeze, </span>above, and see <span class="font-italic">King v Norman </span>[1847] 4 CB 884; <span class="font-italic">The Millwall </span>[1905] P 156.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…(I)n the present case directions were given by an order made on 2 May 1991, which included an order that “The Third Party be at liberty to appear at the trial of this action and take such part as the Judge shall direct and be bound by the result of the trial.”  By the later order dated 23 March 1993 Nelson Parkhill BDO were given leave to be heard on the trial of the preliminary issue. In my opinion, the effect of these directions was that Nelson Parkhill BDO were bound by the result of the trial of the preliminary issue and, consequently, were entitled to appeal against the decision as of right. In any event, leave may be granted to a third party to appeal whenever the Court considers it just and convenient to do so. Leave is typically granted where the third party is prejudiced in some way by the terms of the judgment or order: <span class="font-italic">Gracechurch Holdings Pty Ltd v Breeze, </span>above; and see <span class="font-italic">Asphalt and Public Works Ltd v Indemnity Guarantee Trust Ltd </span>[1969] 1 QB 465; and <span class="font-italic">Helicopter Sales (A</span><span class="font-italic">ustralia) Pty Ltd v Rotor-Work Pty Ltd </span>[1974] 132 CLR 1.  Nelson Parkhill BDO were clearly prejudiced by the result of the trial of the preliminary issue as the finding of a liability on the part of Hadley and Coffey was a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of their claim in the third party proceedings. It was for that reason that I was prepared to join in granting leave to appeal, if it was necessary. In the result, however, I am satisfied that it was not necessary. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 From the above review of the Australian authorities, it would appear that they did not always speak with one voice. In the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Helicopter Sales</span>, two of the five judges (Stephen J and Menzies J) opined that “in the absence of a court order it would at least be doubtful whether the third party would be bound by or be competent to appeal against the judgment in favour of the plaintiff.” Another two judges (Barwick CJ and Mason J), on the other hand, opined that a third party did not even need an order giving it leave to defend an action in order for it to have standing to appeal any judgment given in favour of the plaintiff. In <span class="font-italic">Dooley</span>, Handley JA opted to apply the dicta of Barwick CJ and Mason J, while criticizing the decision in <span class="font-italic">The Millwall </span>as being unsatisfactory: in his view, since both the barge-owners and the tug-owners in <span class="font-italic">The Millwall </span>were defendants in the action, where either one or both of them might be liable to the plaintiff, there was also an issue between the defendants; and “a decision that one defendant is liable and the other is not binds the defendants not only against the plaintiff but as between themselves”. In <span class="font-italic">Gracechurch </span>and <span class="font-italic">Hadley</span>, on the other hand, the Supreme Court of Western Australia cited the principles elucidated in both <span class="font-italic">The Millwall</span> and <span class="font-italic">Asphalt</span>, and had no difficulty applying those principles.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">My decision on the approach to be adopted in the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Having considered the English and Australian positions, I am of the view that the English approach should be adopted in the present case. I find the English approach is conducive to clarity and consistency. Insofar as Barwick CJ and Mason J in <span class="font-italic">Helicopter Sales </span>were prepared to hold that a third party would not require permission to appeal a judgment in favour of a plaintiff even in the absence of any order giving it leave to defend the main proceedings, it must be pointed out that these views were expressed <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, since no objections were actually raised before the High Court to the competency of the third party’s appeal against the judgment in favour of the plaintiff in that case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Further, insofar as the court in <span class="font-italic">Dooley </span>endorsed the dicta of Barwick CJ and Mason J and sought to cast doubt on the approach taken by the court in <span class="font-italic">The Millwall</span>, I do not find <span class="font-italic">Dooley</span> to be strictly relevant to the present case. I am persuaded by the 3rd Respondent’s submissions distinguishing the case of <span class="font-italic">Dooley</span>. In gist, the 3rd Respondent pointed out that in <span class="font-italic">Dooley</span>, the third party had the benefit of the Australian DCR, Pt 21, r 4(1) and 4(2) which enabled the third party – as a cross-defendant – to contest the defendant’s liability to the plaintiff. In contrast, the procedural framework governing the conduct of third-party proceedings in Singapore is different from that in the Australian DCR:

In respect of findings of fact made by a trial judge, appellate intervention is generally only warranted when the trial judge’s assessment is plainly wrong or manifestly against the weight of the evidence (<span class="font-italic">Nambu PVD Pte Ltd v UBTS Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2022] 1 SLR 391<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [8]; <span class="font-italic">Tat Seng Machine Movers Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Orix Leasing Singapore Ltd </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101 (“<span class="font-italic">Tat Seng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [41]; <span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Toh Yew Keat and another </span>[2021] 1 SLR 231 at [19]; <span class="font-italic">North Star (S) Capital Pte Ltd v Yip Fook Meng </span>[2022] 1 SLR 677 at [21]). This is because the trial judge is generally better placed to assess the credibility of witnesses, especially where oral evidence is concerned. The CA in <span class="font-italic">Tat Seng </span>(at [41]) has also clarified that where a finding of fact is not based on the veracity or credibility of the witness, but is instead based on an inference drawn from the facts or from an evaluation of the facts, the appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to undertake the exercise. This involves the appellate court evaluating the cogency of the evidence given by the witnesses by testing it against inherent probabilities or uncontroverted facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In respect of errors of law, the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ng Eng Ghee and others v Mamata </span><span class="font-italic">Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners (Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 (at [90]), citing <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of England</span> vol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 1989) at para 70) listed the various types of errors of law which would warrant appellate intervention (see also <span class="font-italic">Mu Qi and another v Management Corporation Strata Plan No 1849 </span>[2021] 5 SLR 1401 at [34]; <span class="font-italic">Wu Chiu Lin v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2874 </span>[2018] 4 SLR 966 at [31]; <span class="font-italic">Axis Law Corp v Intellectual Property Office of Singapore </span>[2016] 4 SLR 554 at [61]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Errors of law include </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">misinterpretation of a statute</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> or any other legal document </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">or a rule of common law</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">; </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">asking oneself and answering the wrong question</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, taking irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant considerations into account when purporting to apply the law to the facts; admitting inadmissible evidence or </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">rejecting admissible and relevant evidence</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">; exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal principles; </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> or which are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">misdirecting oneself as to the burden of proof</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.

The underlying consideration of the law of pleadings is to prevent surprises arising at trial: see <span class="font-italic">SIC College of Business and </span><span class="font-italic">Technology Pte Ltd v Yeo Poh Siah and others </span>[2016] 2 SLR 118 (“<span class="font-italic">SIC College</span>”) at [46].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Having considered the parties’ submissions, I reject the Appellant’s submission regarding the alleged fatal flaws in the 3rd Respondent’s pleadings. My reasons are as follows. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I should start by stating that I found the Appellant’s arguments about the 3rd Respondent’s alleged failure to plead the implied term in question to be somewhat beside the point. Although the DJ did not explicitly make a finding of a “term implied in law”, it is plain that a term requiring the 1st and 2nd Respondents to procure and/or transfer legal ownership and title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent free from encumbrances would constitute a “term implied in law”. This is because such a term would be a statutorily implied term: see s 12(2) read with s 2(1) of the Sales of Goods Act (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed). <span class="font-italic">Andrew Phang</span> <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>, vol.1, Academy Publishing (“<span class="font-italic">Phang on Contract vol.1</span>”) explains that if a statutory provision “states expressly that a particular term is to be implied, then effect must, of course, be given by the court to that provision”. On the facts, given that there was an agreement for the sale and purchase of the Vehicle as between the 3rd Respondent on the one hand and the 1st and 2nd Respondents on the other, s 12(2) Sales of Goods Act provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) In a contract of sale, other than one to which subsection (3) applies, there is also an implied warranty that – </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the goods are free, and will remain free until the time when the property is to pass, from any charge or encumbrance not disclosed or known to the buyer before the contract is made; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the buyer will enjoy quiet possession of the goods except so far as it may be disturbed by the owner or other person entitled to the benefit of any charge or encumbrance so disclosed or known. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I note parenthetically that s 12(3) has no application in the present case as there is nothing in the Sales Agreement which states or suggests that the parties’ intention was for the 2nd Respondent to “transfer only such title as he or a third person may have”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 <span class="font-italic">Per </span>s 12(2) Sales of Goods Act, therefore, there was an implied warranty on the part of the seller of the Vehicle that the Vehicle “[was] free and [would] remain free until the time when the property [was] to pass, from any charge or encumbrance not disclosed or known to the buyer before the contract is made”. It was common ground that no “charge or encumbrance” over the Vehicle was made known to the 3rd Respondent prior to the Sales Agreement being entered into. Further, the absence of any express reference to such an implied term in the 3rd Respondent’s pleadings would not preclude this point being raised. In <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 769, the CA was faced with an argument that the issue of a “term implied in law” had not been pleaded. In rejecting the argument, the CA held (at [93]) that “given the <span class="font-italic">very nature </span>of such a category of implied terms…it ought to be recognized by the court <span class="font-italic">as a matter of law</span>”. In other words, even if the issue of a “term implied in law” is not pleaded, the court should still recognize such implied terms a matter of law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The above should suffice to dismiss the Appellant’s arguments on Issue 2. However, in the interests of completeness, since the Appellant has put forward arguments premised on the implied term being a term implied in <span class="font-italic">fact</span>, I address below the arguments made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In <span class="font-italic">MK (Project Management) Ltd v Baker Marine Energy Pte Ltd </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 823<span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">MK (Project Management</span><span class="font-italic">)</span>”, at [26]), the CA made it clear that if a legal result was being relied on, the legal result did not have to be specifically pleaded, provided the pleadings disclosed at the very least the material facts which would support the cause of action relied on and gave the opponent fair notice of the substance of such a claim. In <span class="font-italic">MK (Project Management</span><span class="font-italic">)</span>, the appellants relied on an oral agreement which they claimed had varied the project agreement vis-à-vis the quantum of their commission. The trial judge held that the appellants had failed to plead any consideration for this oral agreement. On appeal, the CA reversed the trial judge’s decision. The CA held that the appellants had sufficiently set out their allegation of fact that the quantum of commission had been varied by agreement from that provided in the project agreement to an amount of US$750,000. In the CA’s view, although the appellants had not gone on to explicitly characterize this as consideration for the variation, it was clear that such explicit characterization was unnecessary. In so holding, the CA (at [26]) cited the judgment of Lord Denning MR in <span class="font-italic">In re </span><span class="font-italic">Vandervell’s Trusts (No 2), White v Vandervell Trustees Ltd </span>[1974] Ch 269 at 321H:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is sufficient for the pleader to state the material facts.  He need not state the legal result.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In <span class="font-italic">Tian Kong Buddhist Temple v Tuan Kong </span><span class="font-italic">Beo (Teochew) Temple </span>[2021] 4 SLR 286 (“<span class="font-italic">Tian Kong Buddhist Temple</span>”) at [10], Choo J highlighted that there was a difference between pleading law and raising a point of law in a pleading. Choo J observed that a party need not explicitly plead the legal conclusions which a party sought to persuade the court to draw from the facts. However, if a party intended to raise a particular point of law on the facts as pleaded, he ought to plead such a point expressly, or at the very least, give the opponent fair notice of the substance of his claim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In <span class="font-italic">Tian Kong Buddhist Temple </span>(at [14]-[15]), the appellant claimed that the individual who had purportedly signed the 2011 Agreement on its behalf (one Chin) did not have the actual authority to enter into the said agreement on its behalf. At first instance, the district judge made no findings on the issue of actual authority, but found that the appellant was bound by the 2011 Agreement by virtue of the doctrine of ostensible authority. On appeal, the appellant contended that the district judge had erred in making this finding because the respondent had not pleaded a claim of ostensible authority, nor had it pleaded the facts material to such a claim. In allowing the appeal, Choo J held (at [14]) that the words “ostensible authority” or “apparent authority” did not have to be specifically pleaded by the respondent so long as the latter’s pleadings as a whole disclosed the material facts which would have supported such a claim. In its reply, in responding to the appellant’s assertions in its pleadings about Chin’s lack of authority, the respondent had merely stated that it did not plead to the relevant paragraphs in the appellant’s defence and that it put the appellant “to strict proof thereof”. Having regard to the state of the respondent’s pleadings, Choo J held (at [15]) that the respondent had failed to plead any facts or particulars showing that the elements of the doctrine of ostensible authority were satisfied. Choo J further found (at [16]) that the respondent’s failure to plead its case had caused irreparable prejudice to the appellant because the appellant had been deprived of the opportunity to adduce or to challenge evidence which might have been relevant to the issue of ostensible authority, and was thus unable on appeal to mount a substantive response to the respondent’s arguments on this issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Applying the principles set out in the above authorities, I am satisfied that contrary to the Appellant’s contention, the matters pleaded by the 3rd Respondent provided sufficient basis for the DJ’s finding that an implied term in the Sales Agreement required the 1st and 2nd Respondents to procure and/or transfer legal ownership and title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent free from encumbrances.

It was sufficient that the 3rd Respondent gave fair notice of the substance of his claim. The 3rd Respondent did so by pleading the facts material to such a claim.

Second, if a term were to be implied on a “broader” basis “in law” (as opposed to on a “narrower” basis “in fact”), it would follow <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>that “such a term would not have been in the contemplation of the parties”, since a term implied “in law” – unlike a term implied “in fact” – “is not premised on the presumed intention of the contracting parties”. Third, a term cannot be implied if it is inconsistent with an express term of the contract concerned. Finally, the CA also observed (citing <span class="font-italic">Exxonmobil</span><span class="font-italic"> Sales and Supply Corp v Texaco Ltd </span>[2004] 1 All ER (Comm) 435 at [27]) that it could be argued that “where it is necessary to imply a term in order to make the express terms work, such an implied term may not be excluded by [an] entire agreement clause <span class="font-italic">because </span>it could be said that such a term is to be found in the document or documents forming part of the contract”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The CA in <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon </span>clarified (at [32]) that it was not prepared to say “that an entire agreement clause can <span class="font-italic">never</span> exclude the implication of terms into a contract”. However, in order for an entire agreement clause to have this effect, “it would need to <span class="font-italic">express</span> such effect in <span class="font-italic">clear and unambiguous language</span>”. Further, if the effect of the language used rendered an entire agreement clause, in substance, an exception clause, the clause “would be subject to both the relevant common law constraints on exclusion clauses as well as the UCTA [the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed)]”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In this connection, it may be helpful to examine local authorities dealing with the effects of an entire agreement clause. In <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon</span>, the entire agreement clause reads as follows (at [29]-[30]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Agreement embodies the entire understanding of the parties and there are no provisions, terms, conditions or obligations, oral or written, expressed <span class="font-italic">or implied</span>, other than those contained herein.

Having reviewed <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon </span>as well as the English case of <span class="font-italic">Axa</span><span class="font-italic"> Sun Life Services Plc v Campbell Martin Ltd </span>[2011] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 1 (cited by the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon</span><span class="font-italic">), </span>Pang JC distilled the following principles from these two cases (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association </span>at [140]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Terms implied in order to give business efficacy to an agreement are intrinsic to the agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) They would therefore not be precluded by an entire agreement clause which merely excludes matters extrinsic to the written agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c)   Nevertheless, since the effect of an entire agreement clause ultimately turns on the proper construction of the actual words used in the clause, it may still be possible for intrinsic implied terms to be excluded if there are clear and unambiguous words which expressly and specifically exclude such implied terms.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span>, the defendant Singapore Shooting Association (“SSA”) had a counterclaim against the plaintiff Singapore Rifle Association (“SRA”) for an indemnity in respect of the cost incurred by SSA in demolishing a structure which it described as having been illegally built by SRA at the National Shooting Centre. SRA resisted SSA’s counterclaim on the basis that the cost of demolition had resulted from SSA’s own breach of an implied term in the agreement between the two entities. Pang JC concluded that a term should be implied into the agreement to the effect that SSA would use reasonable efforts to assist SRA in obtaining any necessary regulatory approval at any stage of the construction of the disputed structure. In coming to this conclusion, Pang JC had to consider SSA’s argument that no terms should be implied because of an entire agreement clause in the agreement which read as follows (at [132]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the matters dealt with in this Agreement and supersedes and cancels in all respects all previous agreements and undertakings, if any, between the Parties, whether written or oral.

The phrase “terms implied by statute or by common law” in the entire agreement clause did not clearly and unambiguously refer to terms implied based on business efficacy as a specific category of terms to be excluded. In the circumstances, Pang JC held that the implied term was not precluded by the entire agreement clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In <span class="font-italic">Tonny</span><span class="font-italic"> Permana v One Tree Capital Management Pte Ltd and another </span>[2021] 5 SLR 477 (“<span class="font-italic">Tonny</span><span class="font-italic"> Permana</span>”) at [160], Chan Seng Onn J (as he then was) was concerned <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>with the implication of terms into an agreement between the plaintiff investor and the defendant fund managers. In gist, Chan J found that the terms to be implied in law into the agreement concerned obligations of reasonable skill, care and diligence that the defendants had to observe in dispensing advice and providing timely updates to the plaintiff (at [155] and [158]-[159]). In coming to this conclusion, Chan J had to consider whether the following entire agreement clause precluded the implication of terms (at [120] and [160]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.2 The Agent and the Security Trustee shall be entitled to:-</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Agent and Security Trustee shall:- </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iv) have only those duties, obligations and responsibilities expressly specified in the Agreement…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Applying the principles articulated by Pang JC in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span>, Chan J (at [164]) found that the entire agreement clause only excluded terms extrinsic to the contract, but did not contain express and specific language precluding the implication of terms necessary for business efficacy, which were intrinsic to the contract. In his view (at [164]): </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…cl 4.2(d)(iv) of the [agreement] states that the defendants “have only those duties, obligations and responsibilities expressly specified in the Agreement”… (O)n one interpretation, this is to the exclusion of <span class="font-italic">all </span>other duties.  However, I echo Pang JC’s sentiments in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rife Association</span>, and the Court of Appeal’s views in <span class="font-italic">Ng Giap Hon</span>: in particular, the duty of reasonable skill, care and diligence is a term implied in <span class="font-italic">law</span>. In my view, there are countervailing considerations when considering terms to be implied in law, which militate against a strict and inflexible operation of the foundational principle of consent in contract law.  These terms are implied to provide essential and necessary appendages to contracts that do not expressly contain them. Accordingly, absent very <span class="font-italic">specific</span> and <span class="font-italic">unambiguous</span> language that <span class="font-italic">expressly</span> excludes terms implied in law as a category, I do not accept that such terms are excluded by cl 4.2(d)(iv) [the entire agreement clause]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In the present case, the entire agreement clause in the Sales Agreement read as follows:

I find no such language in the above clause. The sentence “this agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter addressed in the agreement” does not suffice to exclude matters intrinsic to the agreement. It only excludes matters extrinsic to the written agreement. The words used also do not exclude “terms implied in law” – unlike the entire agreement clause in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Rifle Association</span> which stated that “all conditions, warranties or other terms implied by statute or common law are hereby excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 For the reasons given above, I find that the entire agreement clause in the Sales Agreement does not preclude the implication of a term obliging the 1st and 2nd Respondents to procure and/or transfer legal ownership and title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent free from encumbrances.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Whether the DJ was correct in making the following findings as to liability: (i) that the 1st and 2nd Respondents breached their contractual obligations in failing to cause the 3rd Respondent to be registered as the owner of the Vehicle; (ii) that the cause of the failed attempts to register the 3rd Respondent as owner was the continued existence of Form A in respect of the Vehicle due to the Appellant’s wrongful failure to lodge a Form B</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Having found that the implied term in the Sales Agreement obliged the 1st and 2nd Respondents to procure and/or transfer legal ownership and title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent free from encumbrances, I turn next to Issue 4, which concerns the issue of the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ liability to the 3rd Respondent for the breach of this implied term. In the course of the trial, it was not disputed that in deciding as between these two sets of parties, a key factual issue which the DJ had to determine was the reason for the 3rd Respondent’s unsuccessful attempts to register the transfer of ownership following his purchase of the Vehicle. If the evidence showed that the reason for the failure of the transfer was the 3rd Respondent’s own acts or omissions, then the 3rd Respondent could not blame the 1st and 2nd Respondents. However, if the evidence showed that the failure of the transfer was not due to the 3rd Respondent’s own doing, it would follow that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had failed to meet their obligation to procure and/or transfer legal ownership and title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent free from encumbrances.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In this connection, the DJ had to consider whether the failed transfer was caused by the continued existence of Form A in the HPFLAS system due to the Appellant’s wrongful failure to lodge a Form B (as the 3rd Respondent alleged) – or whether it was caused by the 3rd Respondent’s own acts or omissions (as the 1st and 2nd Respondents alleged) or whether it was caused by all three Respondents’ own acts or omissions (as the Appellant alleged).

</div> It will be remembered that the DJ decided that the failed transfer was caused by the former, and that it was not in any way due to any acts or omissions on the 3rd Respondent’s part. The DJ observed that it was unlikely for the 3rd Respondent – who was in the business <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>of leasing out cars and who had paid good money for the Vehicle – to have omitted to take proper steps to register the transfer.

</div> In the DJ’s view, this observation was supported by evidence of the active steps taken by the 3rd Respondent in his attempts to effect the transfer of ownership: these active steps include lodging a police report and seeking LTA assistance to transfer ownership of the Vehicle.

</div> Notwithstanding the active steps taken by the 3rd Respondent, the transfer of ownership in LTA’s records had failed; and the DJ found that this was because of the existence of the Form A which indicated a pre-existing encumbrance over the Vehicle. Given these findings, the DJ held that the 1st and 2nd Respondents must be said to have breached the implied term in the Sales Agreement which required the transfer of full ownership and title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent without any encumbrance.

According to the Appellant, the contents of the report constituted inadmissible hearsay evidence because the exchanges between the 3rd Respondent and the LTA contained information about attempts allegedly made by the 3rd Respondent to transfer the Vehicle, when in fact it was the 3rd Respondent’s staff who made the purported attempts and informed him they were unsuccessful.

In <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin </span><span class="font-italic">Kuning</span>, the appellants sued the respondents for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The respondents denied that there was any false arrest or that the prosecution had been initiated and conducted without reasonable and probable cause. The first respondent was the police officer in charge of the investigations against the appellants. He filed an affidavit in the proceedings in which he annexed copies of statements made to the police by one Abdul Hannan, a suspect whose statements had led <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>to the identification and arrest of one of the appellants. The appellants had applied at trial for Abdul Hannan’s statements to be expunged from the first respondent’s affidavit on the basis that they were hearsay and not admissible in evidence. Their application was rejected by the trial judge. On appeal, the CA held that the trial judge was right in not expunging the statements because these statements “were not tendered by the respondents as part of the first respondent’s evidence for the truth of their contents, but for the fact that they had been made to the first respondent and therefore in this respect they were not hearsay evidence” (at [35]). The “making of these statements formed the occasion or cause for the investigations and hence they are relevant under s 7 of the Evidence Act”. Alternatively, “as they show[ed] motive or preparation, they would be relevant under s 8 (of the Evidence Act)”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 As another example: in <span class="font-italic">Subramaniam</span>, the appellant was found in a wounded condition by security forces operating against terrorists. He was tried on a charge of being in unlawful possession of ammunition. His defence was that he had been captured by terrorists and that at all material times he was acting under duress. At trial he sought to give evidence of what the terrorists had said to him, but this evidence was disallowed by the trial judge on the basis that it formed inadmissible hearsay. On appeal, the Privy Council held that the trial judge was wrong to have ruled out evidence of statements made by the terrorists to the appellant. As the Privy Council explained (at p 970):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement. It is not hearsay and is admissible when it is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the statement, but the fact that it was made. The fact that the statements were made, quite apart from its truth, is frequently relevant in considering the mental state and conduct thereafter of the witness or of some other person in whose presence the statement was made. In the case before their Lordships statements would have been made to the appellant by the terrorists, which, whether true or not, if they had been believed by the appellant, might reasonably have induced in him an apprehension of instant death if h failed to conform to their wishes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In considering parties’ submissions in the present case, there are several things that should be highlighted at the outset. First, the 3rd Respondent does not actually dispute that the police report should not be relied on as evidence of statements made by its staff about the failed transfer, and in particular, about the cause of the failed transfer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Second, insofar as the fact that the 3rd Respondent’s attempt to register transfer of the vehicle was concerned, it is plain to me that even without the police report, it was not seriously disputed by anyone in the trial below that the attempted transfer had indeed failed. The dispute was over the cause of the failure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In this connection, it is also plain to me that all the parties were agreed that the police report could not be relied on to prove that the LTA had told the 3rd Respondent the cause of his failed transfer was the Appellant’s non-lodgement of Form B. In his grounds of decision, the DJ was clear about this as well.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The question, then, is whether the DJ was entitled to rely on the police report as evidence that the 3rd Respondent had taken positive steps to do all he reasonably could to procure the transfer of the Vehicle.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Record of Appeal at p50 Para 50.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This brings me to my third point: even without considering the substantive contents of the police report, the report itself was undeniably evidence of the fact that <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">3rd Respondent had taken the step of escalating the matter to the police</span>. This was thus one piece of evidence which went towards showing that he had taken positive actions to try to surmount the obstacles he was facing in procuring the transfer of the Vehicle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The DJ also relied on the police report as evidence showing that the 3rd Respondent had “made repeated calls to LTA to seek assistance”. It is true that strictly speaking, if the police report was adduced as proof that the 3rd Respondent had made various calls to the LTA, it would be hearsay evidence. However, the fact that the 3rd Respondent was in court to give evidence made all the difference: in this context, the police report was not in my view relied on as hearsay evidence, but as corroboration – pursuant to s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) – of his testimony at trial that he did make numerous calls to LTA. For ease of reference, I set out below s 159:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 That a witness’ former statements may be proved at trial to corroborate the witness’ statements at trial on the same fact has been recognized in a number of local High Court decisions: see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the judgment of Tan Lee Meng J in <span class="font-italic">Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Weipin and another v Lim Boh Chuan and others</span> [2010] 3 SLR 423 at [61] (although in that case, Tan J held that the disputed evidence did not qualify as a “former statement”, having been prepared by the witness and produced in his AEIC for the sole purpose of supporting his claim at trial).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Finally, the DJ relied on the police report as evidence showing that the 3rd Respondent had “sent lawyers’ letters” to the 1st and 2nd Respondents. Again, it is true that if the police report were adduced as proof that the 3rd Respondent had “sent lawyers’ letters” to the 1st and 2nd Respondents, it would be hearsay evidence. However, as I noted above, the 3rd Respondent was present to give his testimony at trial: I consider, therefore, that the statements in his police report about having “looked for the lawyer firm” and sent “summon letter to [the 1st and 2nd Respondents]” were simply corroboration of his testimony in court about having sought lawyers’ assistance to advance his claim for the transfer of the Vehicle. In other words, the DJ’s reliance on these statements did not amount to reliance on inadmissible hearsay evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 I add that in any event, it was common ground that by 28 August 2018, the 3rd Respondent had issued writ of summons against the 2nd Respondent: the Appellant’s Mr Lim himself acknowledged this fact in his AEIC.

</div>
</div> It is reasonable to infer that “lawyers’ letters” would have preceded or accompanied the issuance of such writ of summons. In other words, it was not even necessary for the DJ to rely on the police report as evidence corroborating the 3rd Respondent’s testimony about the steps taken through his lawyers to procure the transfer of the Vehicle.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 For the reasons stated above, I am satisfied that the DJ did not rely on inadmissible hearsay evidence in finding that the 3rd Respondent had taken positive steps to procure the transfer of the Vehicle.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the DJ was correct to find that the 3rd Respondent had done all he reasonably could to procure the transfer of the Vehicle </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I am further satisfied that based on the evidence available, the DJ was justified in concluding that the 3rd Respondent had done all he reasonably could to procure the transfer of the Vehicle.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 First, as a matter of logic and common sense, I agree that as the 3rd Respondent was in the business of leasing out cars and had made full payment for the Vehicle, it was rather improbable that he would have failed to take the requisite steps to effect registration of the transfer of ownership.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Second, the 3rd Respondent gave clear testimony about the steps he took to procure the transfer of the Vehicle after the failed attempt to register the transfer of ownership with the LTA. The 3rd Respondent testified that he called the LTA several times, went down to the LTA office three times to speak to different LTA officers, made a police report and took legal action through his lawyers. At one point, he even resorted to going to his Member of Parliament about the matter.

</div> The Appellant gave the following three reasons for this proposition:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) First, the Appellant reprised the argument that the HPFLAS COC only provided for a temporary five-day suspension of any transfer in the event of non-lodgement of Form B. According to the Appellant, the presence of Form A lodged on the HPFLAS would not prevent a vehicle from being transferred on LTA’s register.

</div> In this connection, the Appellant claimed that the DJ had erred in his understanding of the HPFLAS COC and that the DJ had wrongly “conflated the working of the HPFLAS with the transfer of registered ownership under the LTA”.

</div> Clause 7.5 of the HPFLAS COC expressly acknowledges that the COC does not impose any obligation on the LTA to accept or reject any transfer, nor does it in any way fetter the LTA in the exercise of any of its powers under the Road Traffic Act. It is clearly beyond doubt, therefore, that regardless of whatever the HPFLAS may say, the LTA retains sole and absolute discretion to decide whether to accept or reject any transfer. In other words, without a Form B being lodged, the LTA might still reject a transfer of ownership even after the expiration of the five-day suspension period provided by the HPFLAS COC. There is no basis, therefore, for the Appellant to claim that the Vehicle in this case could and would have been successfully transferred to the 3rd Respondent after only a “temporary” five-day suspension.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Fourth, Mr Lim himself conceded in cross-examination that notwithstanding the HPFLAS COC, if he did not lodge a Form B, the HPFLAS system would still indicate that the Vehicle was under financing;

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In this connection, I should add that given the LTA’s clear discretion to decide whether to accept any transfer, the Appellant’s insistence that Mr Lim’s testimony should be disregarded in the court’s determination as to the actual workings of the vehicle transfer system was wholly self-serving and devoid of merit. Since the LTA clearly retained the sole discretion as to whether to approve a transfer, it was relevant for the DJ to consider evidence of the LTA’s actual practice in a situation where a vehicle was shown to be still under financing. In the absence of any witnesses from the LTA or HPFLAS, and given Mr Lim’s experience as the Appellant’s director, the DJ was plainly justified in taking into consideration Mr Lim’s evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Fifth, I also reject the Appellant’s submission that the DJ wrongly placed the evidential burden on the Appellant to show that registration would have taken place even if Form A were not discharged. By the close of the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ case below, having heard evidence from all three Respondents, the DJ had before him evidence, firstly, that the outstanding hire-purchase loan on the Vehicle had been fully paid off (a fact acknowledged by the Appellant itself in its official receipt);

</div> secondly, that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had given the 3rd Respondent the relevant M01 application form and transaction PIN necessary for effecting the transfer of ownership in the LTA records; thirdly, that the 3rd Respondent’s attempt to effect the transfer had nevertheless failed; fourthly, that the 3rd Respondent had taken all the steps he reasonably could to effect the transfer; fifthly, that no Form B had been lodged in the HPFLAS system by the Appellant to lift its “charge” over the Vehicle despite the hire-purchase loan having been paid off. In light of this evidence, and in the absence of evidence from witnesses from LTA and HPFLAS, I find the DJ was justified in inferring at the close of the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ case that there was some (not inherently incredible) evidence that the Appellant’s refusal to lodge the Form B had caused the failed transfer. The evidential burden then shifted to the Appellant to adduce some evidence to show that notwithstanding the non-lodgement of the Form B with HPFLAS, the transfer of the vehicle would still have been accepted by the LTA after a temporary five-day suspension – <span class="font-italic">per </span>the provisions of the HPFLAS COC. I understand this to be what the DJ meant when he said (at [62] of his grounds of decision):</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Given the Third Party [the Appellant] was relying on the HPFLAS Code in support of its defence that the transfer would have gone through notwithstanding the failure to lodge a Form B, the burden was on the Third Party to call the relevant operators of the systems to substantiate this fact.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Britestone</span>”) at [58]-[60]. As it turned out, not only did the Appellant fail to call any witness from the LTA and/or HPFLAS, its director Mr Lim made several material concessions during cross-examination which supported the Respondents’ assertion about the non-lodgement of Form B being the cause of the failed transfer.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Sixth, although the Appellant has sought to rely on the statement in the 3rd Respondent’s AEIC that he had been “advised by an Electronic Service Agent” that the vehicle “could be transferred after five (5) days”,

</div> I did not find this statement to be in any way helpful to the Appellant’s case. To begin with, as the Appellant itself was at pains to point out, the 3rd Respondent had clarified in cross-examination that it was his staff – and not him – who had done the online transfer application; and he had no idea what an “Electronic Service Agent” was. No evidence was adduced by any party as to what an “Electronic Service Agent” was and/or how it functioned. There was no basis, therefore, for thinking that any response given by an “Electronic Service Agent” to an online transfer application constituted some sort of official promise or guarantee from the LTA. Indisputably, as it turned out, whatever might have been indicated by the so-called “Electronic Service Agent” at the time the 3rd Respondent’s transfer application was filed, that transfer application did not succeed in effecting transfer of ownership of the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 Finally, the Appellant also sought to rely on the 3rd Respondent’s statement in his police report about LTA officers having told him that they would call the Appellant to lodge the Form B, failing which they would let the 3rd Respondent transfer.

The benchmark rates were therefore an acceptable guideline in the present case.

</div> Clearly, therefore, the DJ did not reject the other parts of Mr Lee’s affidavit evidence; and specifically, he did not reject that part of Mr Lee’s affidavit in relation to the market rental value of a Toyota Harrier Premium 2.0 CVT.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Second, there is ample case law which establishes that the lack of credibility in respect of one area of a witness’ testimony does not necessarily preclude the court from accepting the witness’ testimony in another area (<span class="font-italic">Sumoi</span><span class="font-italic"> Paramesvaeri v Fleury, Jeffrey Gerard and another </span>[2016] 5 SLR 302 (“<span class="font-italic">Sumoi</span>”) at [57]; <span class="font-italic">Sundara Moorthy </span><span class="font-italic">Lankatharan v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 253 at [43]-[44]; <span class="font-italic">Teo </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Fong v Lim Eng Hock </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 957 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo </span><span class="font-italic">Geok Fong</span>”) at [42]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 In <span class="font-italic">Sumoi</span>, for example, the plaintiff held a 10% legal interest in a property known as the Jansen Road property while the defendants (her daughter and son-in-law) were the other registered co-owners. The plaintiff sought a declaration for a 10% share in the property, if not more, reflecting her financial contributions. The defendants contended that the plaintiff had made a promise or representation that her 10% legal interest was to go to the second defendant (her daughter), or to the second defendant ad her children. This was denied by the plaintiff. In assessing the parties’ competing claims, Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) noted that the plaintiff had made several claims about forgery of her signature on various conveyancing documents which he found “surprising” and “doubtful” (at [54]-[57]). However, Abdullah JC held that:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[L]ack of credibility in respect of one area of a witness’s testimony does not necessarily doom their testimony with respect to other areas: <span class="font-italic">Sundara Moorthy </span><span class="font-italic">Lankatharan v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 253 at [43]-[44]. Although the Plaintiff’s seemingly baseless accusations regarding the signing of documents were serious ones, they ultimately do not relate to the main factual dispute in this case, which concerns the existence and content of the Plaintiff’s alleged promise or representation.  As far as those key matters were concerned, I found the Plaintiff to be generally consistent and believable. Her testimony that she had not made the representation as claimed by the Defendants was believable because it was consistent with the probabilities of the situation… I found nothing that put her evidence in this specific area in doubt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162  Applying the above principles to the present case, I am satisfied that the DJ was entitled to rely on Mr Lee’s affidavit evidence about the market rental value of a Toyota Harrier Premium 2.0 CVT being $1,800 per month. I agree with the DJ that Mr Lee’s evidence on this point was reliable and credible: Mr Lee was able to produce an actual invoice of a Toyota Harrier Premium 2.0 CVT being rented out by his car dealership

To recapitulate: the DJ found that for the purposes of mitigating its losses, there were two options, either of which the 3rd Respondent could and should have taken. The DJ opined that the 3rd Respondent could have sought the 1st Respondent’s help to lease out the Vehicle while the Vehicle remained registered to the 1st Respondent, and that any attendant expenses could have been recovered at a later stage from the 1st and 2nd Respondents. Alternatively, the DJ opined that the 3rd Respondent could have first paid the Appellant an additional sum of $13,301 to cover the balance allegedly still owing under the Hire-Purchase Agreement. The DJ reasoned that this would have allowed the 3rd Respondent to recover the vehicle first, before subsequently seeking to recover from the 1st and 2nd Respondents the monies paid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 I disagree with the DJ’s findings as to how the 3rd Respondent should have mitigated his loss. My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 It is trite that the reasonableness of a claimant’s attempts to mitigate its loss is a question of fact (Andrew Phang <span class="font-italic">et al</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span>, vol.2, Academy Publishing (“<span class="font-italic">Phang on Contract</span><span class="font-italic"> vol.2</span>”) at para 22.143), and that the burden of proof is on the promisor-in-breach to show that the claimant’s post-breach actions or inaction were or was unreasonable (<span class="font-italic">Phang on Contract</span> at [22.144]). In this respect, the standard of proof required of the promisor-in-breach is rather high (<span class="font-italic">Phang on Contract </span>at [22.145]): in <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [24]), the CA stressed that this burden “is ordinarily one which is not easily discharged”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 In <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span>, in a passage cited by the DJ in his grounds of decision, the CA also held (at [47]) that in terms of action taken in mitigation, an aggrieved party should not be expected to incur great expense or to incur too great a risk of its money:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is, of course, axiomatic that the duty to mitigate has its limits. It cannot oblige an aggrieved party to incur great expense or put itself to great inconvenience in stemming the loss resulting from the defaulting party’s breach. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Lesters Leather &amp; Skin Company, Ltd v Home &amp; Overseas Brokers, Ltd</span> (1948) 82 Ll L Rep 202 at 205, Lord Goddard CJ observed that, where a contract for the sale of goods was breached by the seller failing to deliver the promised goods, the prospective purchaser was not:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… bound to go hunting [all over] the globe to find out where he can get [replacement goods] and then have them shipped, months after the contract time, so that they will arrive [at their intended destination] many months after the date [on] which, had they been shipped in accordance with the contract, they would have arrived.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that it is always a question of fact as to what amounts to too great an expense for the aggrieved party to incur or too great a risk of its money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Similar observations were made by Warren L H Khoo HJ in <span class="font-italic">Tan Soo </span><span class="font-italic">Leng David v Lim Thian Chai Charles</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 880 (at [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I need only make two observations. The rule of mitigation of damages does not require the innocent party to do more than is reasonably required to stem the loss. As it is the party in default who has brought about a situation which calls for measures to mitigate loss, he is in no position to be astute in criticising the adequacy of the mitigating steps taken by the innocent party. As Lord MacMillan said in <span class="font-italic">Banco de Portugal v </span><span class="font-italic">Waterlow and Sons, Limited </span>[1932] AC 452 at 506, the measures which the innocent party may be driven to adopt ought not to be weighed in nice scales at the instance of the defendant whose breach of contract has occasioned the difficulty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Having regard to the above principles, I am unable to agree with the DJ that it would have been reasonable for the 3rd Respondent to adopt either of the two mitigation strategies suggested by him. In respect of the first option suggested by the DJ (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the 3rd Respondent to seek the assistance of the 1st and/or 2nd Respondents to lease out the Vehicle before recovering any attendant expenses from the 1st and 2nd Respondents), this was far from being a straightforward process. This option would have entailed the 3rd Respondent putting in considerable effort as well as incurring the risks and the costs of seeking the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ assistance to lease out the Vehicle. This would have included incurring the costs and expenses of putting the Vehicle out in the market for leasing, bearing the risk of it not being leased out successfully, and bearing the risks and costs associated with any subsequent attempt to claim such costs and expenses from the 1st and 2nd Respondents. With respect, I do not see how it would have been reasonable for the 3rd Respondent to carry out all these steps for the purposes of mitigation. As Prakash J (as she then was) pointed out in the High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>[2009] SGHC 91 (at [65]), “mitigation principles do not require the injured party to incur extraordinary expenditure or act otherwise than in the ordinary course of business”. In my view, the 3rd Respondent could not and should not have been expected to take the above steps in the ordinary course of business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 As for the second option suggested by the DJ (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>for the 3rd Respondent to pay an additional $13,301 to the Appellant first in order to get the charge over the Vehicle released and then subsequently to seek recovery of the money from the 1st and 2nd Respondents), I am also of the view that the 3rd Respondent could not and should not have been expected to take such steps in the ordinary course of business. Basically, this second option would have entailed the 3rd Respondent incurring too great a risk of its money, since it required him to be out of pocket for a further $13,301 – despite having paid the full purchase price of $52,200 for the Vehicle – and then to incur yet more costs by undertaking the risky process of claiming the money back from the 1st and 2nd Respondents. As the 3rd Respondent pointed out,

</div> if the risk of losing the lawsuit materialised and the 3rd Respondent failed to recover the additional $13,301 paid out, “he would have paid a lot more for the Vehicle than he should [have], which does not make any sense, let alone business sense”. The 3rd Respondent’s point is all the more forceful when one considers that the sum of $13,301, which the DJ suggested the 3rd Respondent should pay first, would have constituted a significant portion of the entire purchase price of $52,200 – about a quarter of that price, in fact.

The relevant powers and jurisdiction of the CA are that the CA may give any judgment, and make any order which ought to have been given or made – <span class="font-italic">notwithstanding </span><span class="font-italic">that the respondents or parties have not appealed from or complained of the decision</span>. Accordingly, notwithstanding the 3rd Respondent’s failure to file a cross-appeal on the issue of quantum of damages, this court has the power and jurisdiction to consider the issue and to make a decision to adjust the quantum in the 3rd Respondent’s favour – should the merits of the case warrant such a decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">189 A reading of O 55D r 11(2) and (3) ROC leads to the same conclusion. Reading O 55D r 11(2) and (3) together, it is clear that the High Court has the power to give any judgment and make such further or other order as the case requires – <span class="font-italic">notwithstanding that no notice of appeal has been given in respect of any particular part of the decision of the court below or by any particular party to the proceedings in that the court below</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The authorities in this area bear out the above interpretation. In <span class="font-italic">Hoban Steven Maurice Dixon and another v Scanlon Graeme John and others </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 770 (“<span class="font-italic">Hoban</span>”), the CA was concerned with the application of O 57 r 13(3) and (4) ROC – which are a mirror of the provisions in O 55D r 11(2) and (3), save that O 57 r 13(3) and (4) relate to the CA instead of the High Court. In <span class="font-italic">Hoban</span>, the CA held (at [30]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…Neither side appears to have appreciated the implication of a positive answer to our question, which would be that the June 2004 Order would not take effect, with the result that the parties would be restored to the status quo ante and the appellants would be free to litigate the issue of oppression. If they did, they have not articulated it. That would explain why the appellants continued to argue that the trial judge was wrong in not adjusting the nil valuation and that this court should do so, and the First and Second Respondents continued to argue that the trial judge was correct in not adjusting the nil valuation, and it would be a great injustice to them if this court were to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 As the CA went on to find that the June 2004 Order could not be implemented according to its terms, it had to consider whether the court had the power to make an appropriate consequential order. Citing an older version of the SCJA and ROC which were <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia </span>with the present versions (at [186]-[187]), the CA held noted (at [45]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In view of our finding that the June 2004 Order cannot be implemented according to its terms, we need to consider how we can give effect to it, and whether we have the power to make an appropriate consequential order. In our view, we have the power to do so pursuant to ss 37(5) and 37(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) and O 57 rr 13(3) and 13(4) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). Sections 37(5) and 37(6) of the SCJA provide as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5)    The Court of Appeal may draw inferences of facts, and give any judgment, and make any order which ought to have been given or made, and make such further or other orders as the case requires.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6)    The powers in this section may be exercised notwithstanding that the notice of appeal relates only to part of the decision, and such powers may also be exercised in favour of all or any of the respondents or parties, although the respondents or parties have not appealed from or complained of the decision.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Order 57 rr 13(3) and 13(4) of the ROC further provide that the power to “make such further or other orders as the case requires” may be exercised even though no notice of appeal has been given in respect of any particular part of the decision of the court below or by any particular party to the proceedings in that court, or no ground for allowing the appeal or for affirming or varying the decision of that court is specified in any of the Cases filed pursuant to O 57 r 9A or r 10 of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 Following from its reasoning, the CA declared the June 2004 Order inoperative – notwithstanding that neither party had made submissions on the order becoming inoperative. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 For the reasons explained above, therefore, I am satisfied that it is open to me to consider the issue of quantum of damages and to decide this issue in the 3rd Respondent’s favour – should the merits of the case warrant such a decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Power of appellate court to alter the amount of damages awarded by the judge below</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 In considering this issue, I note that an appellate court may vary the quantum of damages awarded by the judge only if it is shown that the latter: (a) acted on the wrong principles; (b) misapprehended the facts; or (c) had for these or other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages (<span class="font-italic">Minichit</span><span class="font-italic"> Bunhom v Jazali bin Kastari and another </span>[2018] 1 SLR 1037 at [28]; <span class="font-italic">Tan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng David </span>[2013] SGCA 48 at [7]; <span class="font-italic">Singapore Airlines Ltd v Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Leng </span>[2001] 3 SLR(R) 439 at [11]-[13]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 While the cases cited were decisions by the CA, these principles similarly apply to an appeal from the State Courts to the High Court. As I pointed out earlier (at [186]), s 22 SCJA makes it clear that in appeals heard by the High Court in exercise of its appellate civil jurisdiction, the High Court shall have like powers and jurisdiction that the CA has on hearing appeals from the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Whether the DJ’s decision on quantum of damages should be varied</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 I am of the view that the quantum of damages awarded by the DJ should be varied. My reasons are as follows. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 First, it appears to me the DJ based his inquiry into the issue of mitigation on the wrong principles. The DJ appears to have focused his inquiry on whether <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">3rd Respondent</span> was able to show that he had carried out reasonable mitigation. For ease of reference, I reproduce below the pertinent passages from the DJ’s grounds of decision:

Though the standard required of the innocent party in discharging its duty of mitigation was not high and would not be weighed on fine scales, this standard would be higher where the innocent party chose a path of inaction – see <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span> [2010] 2 SLR 1154 at [45].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75 On our facts, while the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report suggested that the Plaintiff took active steps to procure the transfer of the title of the Vehicle to itself up to September 2018, there was very little evidence before me to suggest that the Plaintiff was equally proactive in seeking to effect the transfer of the vehicle <span class="font-underline">after</span> the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report of 24 September 2018 was filed. In the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report, Plaintiff stated that he was informed by LTA that if the Form B were not released by 25 September 2018, LTA would proceed to release the Vehicle to him. The reason why the Vehicle was not released on 25 September 2018, and indeed by end September 2018, was never properly explained. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">76 Further, what the Plaintiff did by way of mitigation post 25 September 2018, when the Form A was supposed to be released by LTA, was also not apparent from the evidence. Based on the documentary evidence, there appeared to be <span class="font-italic">general inaction</span> on the Plaintiff’s part after 25 September 2018, except for the commencement of various lawsuits – namely (i) MC 13861/2018 against the Plaintiff on 5 March 2019 and (ii) DC/OSS 38/2019 against Auto Lease on 5 March 2019 – which Plaintiff never followed through until the present writ action was filed in March 2020.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">77 Further, in my mind, <span class="font-italic">if the Plaintiff were really minded to lease out the Vehicle against the backdrop of a ready rental market for the Vehicle, various steps could have been taken by the Plaintiff to mitigate its losses arising from its inability to transfer the Vehicle to his own name in LTA’s records</span>…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">79 <span class="font-italic">There was also no documentary evidence to suggest that Plaintiff continued to proactively follow up with </span><span class="font-italic">LTA to resolve the transfer issue post September 2018.

With respect, this is the wrong approach in principle. The burden of proof is always on the promisor-in-breach – in this case, the 1st and 2nd Respondents – to satisfy the court that the claimant’s post-breach actions or inaction were or was unreasonable and worsened the claimant’s losses (<span class="font-italic">Phang on Contract</span> at para 22.144; <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span> at [24]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 I am also of the view that the DJ appears to have misapprehended the facts. In his grounds of decision, the DJ found that there “appeared to be general inaction on the Plaintiff’s part after 25 September 2018”. Although the DJ qualified this finding with a reference to “the commencement of various lawsuits – namely (i) MC 13861/2018 against the Plaintiff on 5 March 2019 and (ii) DC/OSS 38/2019 against Auto Lease on 5 March 2019”, he nevertheless took the view that there was general inaction by the 3rd Respondent post 25 September 2018 because there was no follow-through in respect of these earlier suits. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 It should be noted that the timeline of the relevant events was as follows. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 On 15 March 2018, the Appellant received payment for the Vehicle and issued an official receipt dated that very day.

</div>
</div> This was why, in the next six months between late August 2018 and early March 2019, lawsuits were commenced against the 2nd Respondent and the Appellant. In my view, given the lack of any tangible results from his attempts to pursue the transfer matter with the first two Respondents, the Appellant and even the authorities, there was nothing at all unreasonable about the 3rd Respondent subsequently adopting a strategy of resorting to legal action through his lawyers. Further, once the 3rd Respondent had appointed lawyers and handed over the matter to them, it was not unreasonable for him to refrain from pursuing the other three parties personally and/or continuing to complain to the authorities. It must be remembered, after all, that “the question which the principle of mitigation requires the court to determine is whether the mitigation measures taken by the aggrieved party were reasonable, and not whether the aggrieved party took the best possible measures to reduce its loss.” (<span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span> at [44]).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 What I do find unreasonable, however, is that after directions were given on 24 May 2019 for the conversion of the originating summons against the Appellant to a writ action, the 3rd Respondent failed to comply with the court’s directions – or for that matter, to take any further substantive steps in the lawsuits commenced on his behalf. This period of apparent stasis persisted until the filing of the present suit (DC/DC 679/2020) on 9 March 2020 – more than ten months after the filing of the originating summons. The 3rd Respondent has not ventured any explanation on record for this lengthy period of apparent inaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 For the reasons set out above, I find that the 3rd Respondent should be awarded damages for loss of rental on the Vehicle for the period between 15 March 2018 and 24 May 2019, and then from 9 March 2020 to 20 November 2020 (when the 3rd Respondent finally acquired title to the Vehicle).

I am of the view that it was reasonable for him to do so. I have already found that he was justified in accepting Mr Lee’s evidence about the monthly rental value of $1,800 a month in respect of the Toyota Harrier Premium 2.0 CVT. As the DJ pointed out, the Toyota Harrier Premium 2.0 CVT has smaller seating capacity than the Vehicle, since it is only a five-seater, whereas the Vehicle is a seven-seater. Given the larger seating capacity of the Vehicle, it was reasonable for the DJ to apply an uplift to the $1,800 figure. The $2,200 figure which he estimated was in my view not overly generous, as it was lower than the figure which would have been obtained by an application of the “loss of use” benchmark rates in Appendix F of the State Courts Practice Directions (which apply at the rate of $100-$120 a day in motor accident cases involving a claim for damages, for cost of rental of a replacement vehicle and/or loss of use). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 Factoring in a monthly rental value of the vehicle of $2,200, the breakdown of the rent during the relevant period is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) 22 months of rent at $2,200/month is $48,400;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) 20 days of rent at $2,200/month is 20/30 x $2,200 – equalling to $1,467 (rounded up to the nearest dollar);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Adding (a) and (b), the total amount is $48,400 + $1,467= $49,867.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 In sum, a total amount of $49,867 should be awarded to the 3rd Respondent as damages for loss of rental.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(5) The Appellant’s additional argument on mitigation by the 1st and 2nd Respondents</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 Before I leave Issue 6, I note in the interests of completeness that the Appellant has argued that Doris’s evidence showed a lack of any attempts by the 1st Respondent – as the registered owner of the Vehicle – to transfer the Vehicle on the LTA system after changes were made to the system in November 2018, which (purportedly) allowed a registered owner to effect transfer even when a vehicle was still under financing. The only attempt Doris made on 20 November 2020 resulted in the successful transfer of the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent.

</div> As such, there was no basis for the Appellant to set off the $13,301 against any amounts owed by SHB Motoring, which was an entirely separate entity and whose debts to the Appellant arose from an entirely separate contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 The DJ also observed that the Appellant’s director Mr Lim had conceded at trial that the 1st Respondent and SHB Motoring were not identical nor related entities, and that there was no basis to appropriate monies paid under the Hire-Purchase Agreement with the 1st Respondent in order to pay off SHB Motoring’s debts. In exercising a right of set-off without any basis and failing to lodge a Form B despite having received full payment of the hire-purchase loan, the Appellant had caused the 1st and 2nd Respondents to be unable to effect transfer of full title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent – resulting in the 1st and 2nd Respondents breaching the Sales Agreement with the 3rd Respondent.

My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">223 First, the Appellant’s argument that monies were outstanding from the 1st and 2nd Respondents to the Appellant is specious. Insofar as the Hire Purchase Agreement was concerned, following the 3rd Respondent’s payment of the sum of $49,200.86, the Appellant itself had confirmed full settlement of the hire-purchase loan for the Vehicle by issuing an official receipt dated 15 March 2018.

</div> The only reason Mr Lim had for subsequently claiming that the hire-purchase loan had not been fully paid was his own action in appropriating a sum of $13,301 from the 3rd Respondent’s payment and using this sum to partially set off debts from SHB Motoring. He had no right to do this. At trial, he admitted in cross-examination that he acted as he did in order to put the 1st and 2nd Respondents in a difficult position.

</div> The SHB Motoring debt was a debt owing from a separate entity under a separate contract: the set-off clause in the Hire Purchase Agreement did not permit the Appellant to set off any part of the $49,200.86 payment against debts owing from entities other than the 1st Respondent.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">224 Second, the Appellant has also sought to rely on the DJ’s suggestion that as a mitigation strategy, the 3rd Respondent should have paid the outstanding debt of $13,301 to the Appellant and claimed this amount in turn from the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The Appellant argued that this suggestion somehow gave it a legitimate basis for holding back the filing of a Form B so long as the $13,301 was not paid. I have explained earlier (at [174]-[180] above) why I rejected the DJ’s suggestion about the mitigation strategies which the 3rd Respondent should have adopted. There is therefore no basis for the Appellant to claim that the DJ’s suggestion provided some sort of basis for its refusal to file a Form B after being paid the outstanding hire-purchase loan amount.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 I add that it is wrong for the Appellant to say that the DJ did not find its claim of a debt owed by the 1st and 2nd Respondents to be frivolous.  Such an argument ignores the DJ’s clear findings that the Appellant had received full payment under the Hire Purchase Agreement

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 Ultimately, as between the Appellant and the 1st and 2nd Respondents, the issue in contention in the third-party proceedings was whether the 1st and 2nd Respondents had any basis for claiming from the Appellant all sums payable by them to the 3rd Respondent. To reiterate: at trial, it was firmly established that the Appellant had received the sum of $49,200.86 outstanding under the Hire Purchase Agreement; that it had no right under the said agreement to appropriate any part of that payment towards setting off SHB Motoring’s debt; and that having received the sum of $49,200.86, it had no legitimate reason to refuse to file the Form B that would have released its charge over the Vehicle. Given these facts, the Appellant – as the “Owner” under the Hire Purchase Agreement – was clearly in breach of its contractual obligation to the 1st Respondent (the “Hirer”) to “assign and make over” to the Hirer all its “right title and interest” in the Vehicle once full payment had been made of the hire-purchase loan (Clause 13 of the Hire Purchase Agreement).

</div> The damage resulting from the Appellant’s breach clearly included the judgment sum and costs which the 1st and 2nd Respondents were ordered to pay the 3rd Respondent for their failure to transfer to it full title in the Vehicle free from any encumbrance under the Sales Agreement.
