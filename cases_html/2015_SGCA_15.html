        Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the
judgment of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These
two appeals concern a businessman who bought a shophouse (“the Shophouse”)
in his wife’s and son’s names, thinking that it had a remaining
lease of 62 years. Some weeks after the sale and purchase of the property
had been completed, he discovered that there were only 17 years left
on the lease. The businessman and his family then sued their conveyancing
solicitor in negligence for the reduced value of the Shophouse.
They say that their solicitor failed to inform them of the length of
the remaining lease. The solicitor in turn pinned the blame on the
seller who misrepresented the position; the family’s property agent
who passed on that misrepresentation and so misled the family; and
indeed on the businessman and his family for not having mentioned
at any time their understanding of the length of the remaining lease
or that such a representation as to the length of the remaining
lease had been made to them and was being relied on by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The
background facts are set out in full in the High Court judge’s (“the
Judge”) judgment in <em>Su Ah Tee and others v
Allister Lim and Thrumurgan (sued as a firm) and another (William
Cheng and others, third parties)</em> [2014] SGHC 159 (“the
Judgment”). We do not propose to repeat them in their entirety,
but will highlight the salient facts that are germane to these appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Mr
Su Ah Tee (“Su”), a businessman, paid $900,000 for the Shophouse,
which was located at Block 63 Kallang Bahru #01-423 Singapore 330063.
The seller of the Shophouse was Mr William Cheng (“Cheng”). Su’s
conveyancing solicitor was Mr Allister Lim (“Lim”) of M/s Allister
Lim &amp; Thrumurgan (“ALT”). Lim qualified as a solicitor in 1999 and
has practised conveyancing law since 2004. He had acted for Su from time
to time from December 2010 in the purchase of some other shophouses.
Su’s property agent, Ng Sing (“Ng”) and Cheng’s property agent,
Mr Sam Oh Seng Lee (“Sam”) jointly brokered the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After
the sale of the Shophouse was completed, Su realised that the Shophouse
had a remaining lease of just 17 years. He, his wife and their son (“the
Plaintiffs”) filed a professional negligence suit (“the Main Action”) against
Lim and ALT (“the Defendants”) in the High Court. The Defendants
then brought third party proceedings against Cheng, Ng and Ng’s
alleged employer SGR Property Pte Ltd (“SGR Property”) (collectively “the
Third Parties”), seeking a contribution of damages payable under
s 15(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”), which
reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Entitlement
to contribution</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>15.</b>—(1) … [A]ny person liable
in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover
contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same
damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The
Judge entered judgment in default against SGR Property for failing
to enter appearance (the Judgment at [225]–[227]). She also ruled against
the Defendants, Cheng and Ng (the Judgment at [115]–[116], [194]–[195]
and [220]–[223]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
Judge found that Cheng made a fraudulent misrepresentation to both
Sam and Ng that the Shophouse had a remaining lease of 62 years, who
then repeated this misrepresentation to Su. At trial, Cheng argued
that he did not make any misrepresentation, and that he in fact
handed Ng an option to purchase that stated that the Shophouse had
a remaining lease of 17 years. The Judge found that this option
to purchase was in fact a forgery and accordingly rejected this
argument (the Judgment at [43]–[46] and [192]–[196]). Ng was also
found liable for negligent misrepresentation (the Judgment at [220]–[223]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
Judge also held the Defendants liable for negligence in failing
to inform Su that the Shophouse had a remaining lease of only 17
years (the Judgment at [69(f)], [91]–[100]). Lim did two title searches
on the Shophouse, which showed that the Shophouse had a remaining
lease of only 17 years (the Judgment at [69(f)] and [92]–[93]).
But he did not give Su either of these title searches (the Judgment
at [93]). The Judge also found that Su never informed the Defendants
that he had been told by the vendor through Ng and Sam that he was
purchasing a shophouse with 62 years remaining on its lease (the
Judgment at [69(d)]). Even so, the Judge held that in property transactions,
the duration of the term of the lease was of such vital importance
that conveyancing solicitors were expected to keep their clients
informed of such information as the number of years left on the
lease (the Judgment at [98]–[100]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Having
found the Defendants as well as the Third Parties variously liable,
the Judge proceeded to apportion liability between them. She ordered Cheng
to bear 50% of the overall liability for damages, the Defendants
to bear 45%, and Ng to bear the remaining 5% (the Judgment at [233]).
She also ordered full costs in the Main Action in the Plaintiffs’
favour (the Judgment at [234]) and full costs in the third party
proceedings in the Defendants’ favour (the Judgment at [235]–[236]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Dissatisfied,
both Cheng and the Defendants appealed. Cheng filed Civil Appeal
No 148 of 2014 on 8 September 2014 (“CA 148/2014”). The Defendants
filed Civil Appeal No 152 of 2014 on 10 September 2014 (“CA 152/2014”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On
appeal, both Cheng and the Defendants argue that they are not liable
and, in any event, that the respective proportions of the damages awarded
against them are excessive. In CA 152/2014, the Defendants also take
issue with the order on costs. The Defendants say that they should
not be made to bear the Plaintiffs’ costs in the Main Action on
their own as they had succeeded in the third party proceedings;
the Third Parties ought therefore to contribute towards these costs.
The Defendants also say that the Judge should have ordered SGR Property
to indemnify the Defendants at least in relation to Ng’s portion
of damages payable on the basis that SGR Property is Ng’s employer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Ng
appeared in person. He accepts the Judge’s finding that he is liable for
negligent misrepresentation, but wishes to pay no more than 5% of
the damages. SGR Property did not appear in the appeal and has not
applied to set aside the judgment in default that was entered against
it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     We
do not accept the arguments made by Cheng and the Defendants that
they are not liable for fraudulent misrepresentation and negligence respectively.
In our judgment, the Judge rightly held them liable and we generally
agree with the detailed reasons she gave in the Judgment, in which she
painstakingly analysed the evidence and the law. We agree with much of
what she said and, to that extent, we do not repeat the basis or
the reasons set out in the Judgment. However, we respectfully disagree
with three aspects of her decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     First,
the Judge made no finding of contributory negligence on Su’s part.
In our judgment, such a finding should have been made having regard
to the evidence, the facts that were found, and the pleadings. Su’s
case was that a fraudulent representation – that the Shophouse had
a remaining lease of 62 years – was made to him and he then acted
upon it. An essential element of such a case is reliance – that
the representee had taken a certain course of action <em>because</em> the representation had been made
to him and he believed it to be true. However, the Judge eventually
found that Su had never informed either Lim or ALT of the fact of
this representation that he said he had (and indeed was found to
have) relied on. Given these three factors – the legal significance
of the element of reliance in an action for misrepresentation and
the two factual aspects, namely, Su’s awareness of the importance
of the representation, as well as his failure to inform the Defendants
about it – we find he should be held contributorily negligent;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
we consider that the Judge’s apportionment of liability between
Cheng, the Defendants, and Ng should be adjusted to reflect the
greater degree of culpability on Cheng’s part in making a <em>fraudulent</em> misrepresentation; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
we have also found it necessary to revise aspects of the Judge’s
order on costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In this judgment, we confine
ourselves to these points.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Contributory negligence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">General principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Contributory
negligence is a partial defence that reduces the quantum of damages
payable to plaintiffs if they fail to safeguard their own interests (<em>Froom v Butcher</em> [1976] QB 286 at 291,
approved in <em>Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
3 SLR(R) 377 (“<em>Parno</em>”) at [59]; <em>Astley v Austrust Ltd</em> (1999) 197 CLR 1
at [30], approved in <em>PlanAssure PAC (formerly
known as Patrick Lee PAC) v Gaelic Inns Pte Ltd</em> [2007]
4 SLR 513 at [119]). It is regarded as a salutary power to register
disapproval of the plaintiffs’ conduct by a reduction of damages
(Glanville Williams, <em>Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence</em> (Stevens
&amp; Sons Ltd, 1951) (“<em>Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence</em>”)
at p 353). It used to be the case at common law that contributory
negligence operated as a complete defence against a claim in damages, <em>ie</em> if the damage suffered by the plaintiffs
was partly due to the plaintiffs’ failure to take reasonable care,
the plaintiffs could not recover any damages at all from the defendant
(<em>Butterfield v Forrester</em> (1809)
11 East 60, <em>per</em> Ellenborough CJ; <em>Davies v Mann</em> (1842) 10 M &amp; W 546).
This is no longer so following statutory intervention – England
passed the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 (c 28)
and Singapore followed suit by enacting the Contributory Negligence
and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed) (“Contributory Negligence
Act”). The relevant provision in the Contributory Negligence Act
is s 3, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Apportionment
of liability in case of contributory negligence</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>3.</b>—(1) Where any person suffers
damage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault
of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage
shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering
the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall
be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable
having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for
the damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Subsection (1)
shall not operate to defeat any defence arising under a contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    Where any contract or written law
providing for the limitation of liability is applicable to the claim,
the amount of damages recoverable by the claimant under subsection (1)
shall not exceed the maximum limit so applicable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As
is apparent from s 3(1), both the fault of the claimant and the
fault of the defendant are relevant. The term “fault” is defined
under s 2 of the Contributory Negligence Act as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“fault” means negligence, breach of statutory
duty or other act or omission which gives rise to a liability in
tort or would, apart from this Act, give rise to the defence of
contributory negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It
is clear from this that the definition of “fault” is a broad one,
and that it is not just an “act” that is caught; an omission also
would fall within the ambit of “fault”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The
defence of contributory negligence must be specifically pleaded under
Order 18 r 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed).
As with virtually all pleading requirements, the underlying purpose
of this requirement is to ensure that the other side is not taken
by surprise (<em>Rajendran a/l Palany v Dril-Quip
Asia Pacific Pte Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 887 at [17]–[19],
approving <em>Fookes v Slaytor</em> [1979]
1 All ER 137).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Can a failure on a client’s
part to inform his solicitor of information amount to contributory
negligence?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In
our judgment, a client <em>can</em> be held
contributorily negligent for omitting to inform his solicitor of
material information and that such an omission can fall within the
ambit of “fault” under the Contributory Negligence Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     We
recognise that a solicitor is under a duty to elicit information
from a client before acting and that there are concerns that a finding
of contributory negligence may derogate from this duty on the part
of solicitor (Richard Scott Novak, “Attorney Malpractice: Restricting
the Availability of the Client Contributory Negligence Defense”
(1979) 59 BULR 950). Indeed, there are authorities which suggest
that courts should be slow in finding contributory negligence on
the part of a solicitor’s client. One such authority is Rimer J’s
pronouncement in <em>Football League Ltd v Edge
Ellison</em> [2006] EWHC 1462 (at [330]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is only in rare cases that a solicitor
is able to advance a plea of contributory negligence with any real
prospect of success, and for obvious reasons. This is because his
breach of duty will usually be in relation to a matter within his special
expertise as a solicitor, being a duty which is not usually one
relating to a purely commercial matter of judgment falling squarely
within the client’s own competence. It will usually relate to a
matter upon which the client is depending upon the solicitors’ own
special expertise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Similarly,
the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in <em>Hondon Development Ltd
and another v Powerise Investments Ltd and another</em> [2005]
3 HKLR 605 (“<em>Hondon</em>”) at [36] held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As a solicitor is remunerated for his services
and it is his duty to advise his lay client and protect his interest,
public policy requires that such a professional’s claim of contributory
negligence by the client may only be successfully raised in very
limited circumstances …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It
is not difficult to appreciate why this is the case. As the authors
of <em>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional Liability</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
7th Ed, 2012) (“<em>Jackson &amp; Powell</em>”)
state at para 5-146:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the context of professional negligence
a successful plea of contributory negligence by the defendant is
less common than in other areas of negligence. This is because the
parties often do not stand on an equal footing (as they do in, say,
claims arising from road traffic accidents). If the defendant makes
a mistake, it may be difficult to say that the client was negligent
not to spot it or correct its effect, unless the client is expected
to be wiser than his own professional advisers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     But
there are exceptions to this general observation. <em>Jackson
&amp; Powell</em> goes on to note this in the next paragraph
(para 5-147):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are, of course, exceptions to the
very general statements made in the previous paragraph. First, the
claimant may be particularly well placed to spot or correct the
defendant’s mistake. Secondly, the claimant may do something quite
separate which aggravates the consequences of the defendant’s breach
of duty. … [Thirdly,] [w]here a relevant fact is not communicated
by the client to his professional advisers, the question commonly
arises whether the client was negligent to withhold it or the defendant
was negligent not to elicit it. If the client is an experienced businessman,
the court is more likely to treat his omission as amounting at least
to contributory negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     This
categorisation of the exceptions to the general rule may be useful for
analytical purposes but we do not regard it as necessarily exhaustive. The
court in <em>Hondon</em> cited the first
two exceptions (citing an earlier edition of <em>Jackson
&amp; Powell</em>) with approval (at [36]). The first category
of cases includes claims made by mortgage lenders (such as banks)
against solicitors for the latter’s failure to draw the lender’s
attention to particular problems such as the creditworthiness of
the borrower, which, had it been brought to the lender’s knowledge,
would have caused the lender to withdraw the mortgage offer or reduce
the amount of the advance (see <em>eg</em>: <em>Birmingham Midshires Mortgage Services Ltd v David
Parry &amp; Co</em> [1998] PNLR 249; <em>Omega
Trust Co Ltd and another v Wright Son &amp; Pepper and another (No
2)</em> [1998] PNLR 337). Lenders are particularly well-placed
to spot these problems as they have the resources and means for
this (Hugh Evans, <em>Lawyer’s Liabilities</em> (Sweet
&amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2002) at para 8-04) and indeed the motivation
to do so since this goes to the core of their own business decision. <em>Jackson &amp; Powell</em> states that <em>Crossman v Stewart</em> (1977) 5 CCLT 45 (“<em>Crossman</em>”) is an example of the second
category. In <em>Crossman</em>, a patient
was held liable in contributory negligence for taking larger doses of
a negligently prescribed drug. As the present case does not fall
within the first two categories, we say no more about them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As
to the third category, we agree with <em>Jackson
&amp; Powell</em> that a client can <em>in
principle</em> be held liable for failing to communicate information
to a professional. In our judgment, a client who omits to reveal
information that the solicitor would be expected to need in order
to properly carry out that which is within his special expertise,
can be said to have failed to take steps to protect himself. If
a client neglects to inform his solicitor of such information, the
solicitor might not fully appreciate the client’s concerns and interests
and might not therefore be sufficiently alive to the risk of harm
to the client. There are three cases that illustrate this:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     First,
in <em>Carradine Properties Ltd v D J Freeman &amp;
Co</em> (1989) 5 Const LJ 267, the claimant’s managing director,
an experienced property developer, hired a demolition contractor
to demolish the upper floors of a freehold property. In the process
of the demolition, the contractors damaged the ground floor of the
property, which was owned by a third party. As a result, the claimant
was liable in damages to the third party. The claimant instructed
its solicitors to sue the contractor, but the contractor turned
out to be worthless. The claimant then brought a claim under its
insurance policy but was refused cover because it had made the claim
too late. The claimant subsequently commenced proceedings against
its solicitors. It alleged that its solicitors failed to safeguard
its interests as they did not remind it to make a claim under its
insurance policy. It asserted that this resulted in its claim being
impermissibly late. The claimant was not awarded any damages and
its claim failed in its entirety. The court held that the solicitors
were not to blame as the claimant had not informed them that it
had an insurance policy to begin with.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second,
in <em>Fong Maun Yee and another v Yoong Weng Ho Robert</em> [1997]
1 SLR(R) 751 (“<em>Fong Maun Yee</em>”),
a decision of this court, a businessman wishing to purchase property
from a company gave his property agent a deposit. The agent later
absconded with the money, and it turned out that the owner of the
property in question (the company) never had any intention to sell
the property. The businessman’s solicitor was given a copy of the
option to purchase purportedly signed by the managing director of
the company and a company resolution stating that the board approved
the sale. These documents turned out to be forgeries. The solicitor
was held liable in negligence for failing to confirm the position
with the company directly. He had only carried out a company search
to confirm that the persons who had purportedly signed the resolution
and the option were named as the company’s directors. Nonetheless,
the court held that the businessman client was contributorily negligent
for having failed to tell his solicitor that he suspected that something
was amiss. The businessman admitted that he thought that things
were not right because of the notably low price at which the purported
seller was prepared to sell the property. The court held that had
the businessman told the solicitor that he (the businessman) suspected that
matters were amiss, the solicitor would have been put on guard, and
would hence have been able to better protect his client’s interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third,
in <em>Edwards v Lee</em> [1991] 141 NLJ
1517 (“<em>Edwards</em>”), the sellers of
an expensive car were approached by a rogue who offered to buy it.
A third party later telephoned the sellers saying that the rogue had
tried to sell him their car at a large discount. At this point,
the sellers telephoned the rogue’s solicitors for a reference but
omitted to tell them of the call that had been made to them. The
rogue’s solicitors provided a clean reference even though they knew
that their client was on bail and faced 13 charges for fraud. The
solicitors were found liable in negligence but the claimants’ damages
were reduced by 50% because of their failure to mention the telephone
conversation that would have alerted them (the solicitors) that
the sellers were <em>themselves</em> about
to become victims of a fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Advice
by solicitors will generally only be as good as the facts on which
it is based (John Murdoch, “Client negligence: A lost cause” (2004) 20(2)
PN 97 at p 100). Indeed, the courts have also recognised that there
is a reciprocal duty on the part of a client to communicate relevant
information to his solicitor. Richardson J in the decision of the
New Zealand Court of Appeal in <em>Mouat v Clark
Boyce</em> [1992] 2 NZLR 559 (reversed on appeal to the Privy
Council on an unrelated point) said at 572:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In conducting business affairs, as in other
areas of life, <em>failure to provide adequate
information</em> to the professional adviser and inflexibility
in responding to advice received <em>may be one
of the causes of the damage</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     A
client must also be candid and disclose information notwithstanding
that this may be detrimental to the possibility of a successful
claim. In <em>Dawe v Brown</em> (1995) 130
Nfld &amp; PEIR 281 (“<em>Dawe</em>”), the
Newfoundland Supreme Court found that a client had not been candid with
his solicitor in disclosing information that was detrimental to
the possibility of a successful claim. There, a seller sold fish
to a buyer but did not receive full payment. The seller retained
a solicitor to recover the monies to which he thought he was entitled.
However, the seller failed to mention to the solicitor that some
of the fish sold to the buyer was not fresh and the buyer had withheld
full payment because of this. Schwartz J made the following observations
at [45]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A problem is not simply left at the hands
of a lawyer with the sole expectation of a satisfactory resolution.
It is incumbent on the client to explain the problem fully, provide
all facts pertaining to the matter <em>including
anything which might be detrimental to the possibility of a successful
claim</em>, and to give the lawyer instructions on proceeding
after being fully advised. It is only then that a solicitor can
act properly on behalf of the client. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     To
ensure that a solicitor’s duty to elicit information from his client before
acting is not derogated from, the quantum of reduction in damages payable
should generally be modest to reflect a solicitor’s primary responsibility
in safeguarding his client’s interest. <em>Fong
Maun Yee</em> provides a useful illustration. There, although
we reduced damages payable by the solicitor to the claimant, the
reduction was a modest one of 25%. This was because the solicitor
must assume the primary responsibility as a professional (at [63],
approving <em>Banque Bruxelles Lambert SA v Eagle
Star Insurance Co Ltd</em> [1995] 2 All ER 769).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Application of law to the present
case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In
the present case, as we have noted above, an essential element of Su’s
case is that he in fact acted on the misrepresentation. At trial,
Su strenuously asserted that he had conveyed the fact of the representation
to ALT but the Judge did not accept this. Before us, faced with
this finding, Su’s counsel, Mr Thomas Lei, contended that Su had
not mentioned the representation at all because he was not placed
on inquiry as the information that was conveyed to him was routine
and consistent with what he knew about the leasehold durations of
properties in the vicinity. Indeed, the Judge noted at [26] of the
Judgment that the Shophouse was the only lot in that location with
a 30-year leasehold. The neighbouring shophouses had 78-year leaseholds.
In these circumstances, Mr Lei suggested that it would be wrong
to hold that Su was at “fault” in not informing ALT or Lim of the
impression he had or of the representation that had been made to
him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In
our judgment, it was not open to Mr Lei to make this argument. This
is for two reasons. First, to stretch this argument too far would
risk running afoul of Su’s basic position that he was the victim
of a fraudulent misrepresentation, which was a finding of fact made
by the Judge. If the representation was such a routine piece of
information, then did he even rely on it? Second, it was also inconsistent
with the affirmative position he had taken in the trial where, as
we have already noted, his evidence was that he had told ALT of
this fact. The point ultimately is that the representation was a
significant piece of information as far as Su was concerned and
he had relied on it in entering into the sale. In these circumstances,
we are unable to see how Su can avoid all responsibility for having
failed to convey this to his solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This
point was first raised by the Plaintiffs in para 6 of their Statement of
Claim (Amendment No 1) (“SOC”), which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On or about 23.3.2001, [Su] instructed
and retained the [Defendants] to conduct the legal conveyance of
the property at 63 Kallang Bahru #01-423 which he told them had
a remaining 60 plus years’ leasehold from the HDB, to be conveyed
to the names of [Su’s son] and [Su’s wife] as [Su’s] nominees. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     This
was categorically denied by the Defendants. At paras 7 and 16 of their
Defence (Amendment No 1), the Defendants averred that Su did not tell
them or instruct them to check that the Shophouse had a remaining lease
of “more than 60 years”; he only gave instructions to “proceed”
with the purchase of the Shophouse. The Defendants repeated this
averment at para 42 of their opening statement. The Plaintiffs were
clearly aware that this was part of the defence mounted, as evinced
by para 33(2) of their opening statement where they stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">33. The defences that can be gleaned from
the pleadings in brief are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(2) … Su did not expressly request or instruct
the Defendants to ensure that the property has a leasehold of more
than 60 years …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Moreover,
the Defendants squarely raised Su’s failure to mention his expectation
that the remaining leasehold of the property was 62 years as contributory
negligence in their closing submissions. The Plaintiffs were not
caught off guard by this. In fact, they had fought strenuously at
trial to convince the Judge that Su did in fact inform the Defendants
that the Shophouse had a remaining lease of 62 years (the Judgment
at [14] and [58]–[62]). The Judge concluded that Su did not (the
Judgment at [59]). Given this finding, the remaining issue was whether
Su <em>ought</em> to have informed his solicitors.
This is a point of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In
our judgment, Su’s failure in these circumstances does come within the
ambit of “fault” in s 2 of the Contributory Negligence Act. It is
an “omission” and, as we have stated above, a client can be held
liable in contributory negligence for failing to communicate information
to his solicitor. To some degree, Su was an author of his own misfortune
in failing to communicate a piece of information <em>that
he appreciated was important</em>, namely, his belief that
the Shophouse had a remaining leasehold of 62 years. The damages
payable to Su should therefore be reduced to take into account such
contributory negligence on his part.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In
the circumstances, we reduce the damages by 15% which, in our judgment,
is a just and equitable reduction having regard to Su’s responsibility
for his loss pursuant to s 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence Act.
This reduction is less than the 25% applied in <em>Fong
Maun Yee</em> because, unlike the position in <em>Fong
Maun Yee</em>, it does not appear that Su suspected that Cheng
was acting fraudulently. Where a client’s suspicions have been aroused
in a material way and he nonetheless fails to mention the relevant facts
and circumstances to his solicitor then it would generally warrant
a larger reduction in the damages recoverable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Apportionment of liability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     We
also consider that the Judge ought to have ordered Cheng to pay more
than 50% of the damages to reflect his culpability in having made
a fraudulent misrepresentation. In deciding the contribution that
should be made by each third party under s 15 of the CLA, the court
must have regard to the extent of the third party’s responsibility
for the damage. This is made clear by s 16(1) of the CLA, which
reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1"><b>Assessment of contribution   </b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>16.</b>—(1) Subject to subsection
(3), in any proceedings for contribution under section 15, the amount
of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as
may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard
to the extent of that person’s responsibility for the damage in
question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Counsel
for Cheng, Mr Melvin Chan, argues that the Judge placed undue weight
on Cheng’s moral blameworthiness and that insufficient attention
was given to the actual wording of s 16(1) of the CLA. In this regard,
Mr Chan relies especially on two cases, <em>Downs
and another v Chappell and another</em> [1997] 1 WLR 426 (“<em>Down</em>s”) and <em>Collins
v Hertfordshire County Council and another</em> [1947] 1 KB
598 (“<em>Collins</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>Downs</em>, the claimants sued the seller of
a property for fraudulent misrepresentation and the seller’s accountant
for negligent misrepresentation. The seller misrepresented the value
of the property by inflating its worth and the seller’s accountant
repeated that misrepresentation in a letter addressed to the claimants.
The English Court of Appeal found in favour of the claimants but
apportioned damages equally between the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In <em>Collin</em>s, Hilbery J followed his earlier
decision in <em>Smith v Bray (Wickham, third party)</em> (1939)
56 TLR 200 (“<em>Smith</em>”) in holding
the following in relation to s 6(2) of UK’s Law Reform (Married
Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935 (c 30) (“Law Reform (Married Women
and Tortfeasors) Act 1935”), a provision that is worded similarly
to s 16(1) of the CLA and apportioning liability equally between
the defendants (at 624):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the wording of that sub-section had
stopped at the word “equitable” and the semi-colon had occurred
there, I should have thought that what was plainly intended was
that the court was to have the fullest discretion and to distribute
the contribution to the damages between persons whose several acts
had brought about the damage according to what the court thought
were their degrees of culpability. But the sub-section does not
stop at the words “just and equitable” but continues with the governing
words “having regard to the extent of that person's responsibility
for the damage.” … The words “having regard to the extent of that
person's responsibility for the damage,” certainly seem to indicate
that the extent of the responsibility for the damage is to be the
guiding principle of the assessment. <em>It is
difficult to conceive how anything other than causal acts resulting
in the damage can show the extent of a person’s responsibility for
the damage.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     With
respect, we are unable to accept Mr Chan’s submission. First, <em>Downs</em> does not stand for the <em>general</em> proposition that the court should
not take into account moral blameworthiness. On the contrary, Hobhouse
LJ (as he then was) (with whom Roch and Butler-Sloss LJJ agreed)
in <em>Downs</em> held that both moral blameworthiness
and causative responsibility are important considerations in deciding
a just and equitable apportionment of damages (at 445) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The extent of a person’s responsibility
involves both the degree of his fault and the degree to which it
contributed to the damage in question. It is just and equitable
to take into account both the seriousness of the respective parties’
faults and their causative relevance. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In
our judgment, the court in <em>Downs</em> could
well have held the seller responsible for a higher percentage of
the damages as he had misrepresented the position <em>fraudulently</em> and
we respectfully disagree with Hobhouse LJ’s reasons in apportioning
liability equally between the fraudulent seller and the negligent
accountant. Hobhouse LJ held that even though a fraudulent party
should be made to bear a greater proportion of the damages to take
into account his moral blameworthiness in the normal case, the facts
of <em>Downs</em> warranted a different treatment.
On the facts of <em>Downs</em>, the claimants
relied on the accountants’ letter <em>instead</em> of
the fraudulent misrepresentation made by the seller in deciding
to purchase the property. On this basis, Hobhouse LJ held that the
accountants’ letter had a greater “causative impact” than the fraudulent
misrepresentation made by the seller in inducing the claimants to
purchase the property. Therefore, both the seller and the accountant
bore equal overall responsibility for the claimants’ loss (at 445).
We respectfully disagree with this reasoning because it seems to
us to be artificial to say that the buyer in <em>Downs</em> did
not rely on the seller’s fraudulent misrepresentation when the accountant’s letter
repeated that <em>same</em> misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Similarly,
the view expressed in the passage from <em>Collins</em> that
we have extracted above is too restrictive a reading of the equivalent
provision in the UK of s 16(1) of the CLA as it places too much
emphasis on a person’s causative responsibility and neglects the
need for the court to apportion liability in a “just and equitable”
manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Indeed, <em>Smith</em>, the decision relied on in <em>Collins</em>, and <em>Collins</em> itself,
have both been subject to trenchant criticism. For ease of reference,
we refer to the approach taken in <em>Smith</em> and <em>Collins</em> as the “causative test”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     J
P Lawton in his article “Vicarious Liability of Hospital Authorities” (1947)
10(4) Mod LR 425 at pp 427–428 argues that the causative test gives the
equivalent provision in the UK of s 16(1) of the CLA a “strained
and impracticable” interpretation, and if Parliament had intended
the provision to be read restrictively, it would have used a more
neutral phrase such as “the extent to which the person <em>caused</em> the damage”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Similarly,
both Professor Glanville Williams in “The Law Reform (Contributory
Negligence) Act 1945” (1946) 9(2) Mod LR 105 at pp 131–132 and Stephen
Chapman in “Apportionment of liability between tortfeasors” (1948)
64 LQR 26 at pp 27–28 have argued that the causative test is too
restrictive and may cause injustice. Williams and Chapman argue that
the causative test – in focusing <em>only</em> on
causation in apportioning liability – is very likely to result in
an equal apportionment of damages among parties without having regard
to the parties’ respective degrees of blame in many cases, especially
those involving successive tortfeasors, because it will often be
impossible in such cases to say that one was more the cause of the
damage than the other. Each tortfeasor’s causal responsibility will
commonly be the same because each of their acts/omissions will be
equally important forming one part of a continuous causal link resulting
in the eventual loss. Williams and Chapman further argue that this
cannot have been the intended result given that the statute does
not direct the courts to apportion damages equally among defendants, but
rather affords a wide discretion in deciding a just and equitable apportionment
of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     
          <em>Collins</em> in fact illustrates the potential
for injustice. There, a final year surgical student was asked by
her supervisor (a fully qualified surgeon) to prepare anaesthesia
for a surgery. Instead of mixing procaine with adrenalin, she mixed
cocaine with adrenalin. The anaesthesia was administered by the
surgeon, and the patient died as a result. The widow of the patient
sued, and an issue of apportionment of liability between the surgeon
and student arose. Hilbery J rejected an argument made by counsel for
the student that the surgeon, who failed to supervise her, was more blameworthy,
holding that the wording of s 6(1) of the Law Reform (Married Women
and Tortfeasors) Act 1935 directed him to apply the causative test
alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As
mentioned above, we disagree with the approach in <em>Collins</em>.
In determining each party’s contribution, both causative responsibility
and blameworthiness have to be considered (see <em>eg</em>: <em>Randolph v Tuck</em> [1962] 1 QB 175 at 185; <em>Acrecrest Ltd v Hattrell &amp; Partners</em> (1982)
252 EG 1107 at 1113; <em>Madden v Quirke</em> [1989]
1 WLR 702). In this regard, we approve of the following passage
in para 4-018 of <em>Jackson &amp; Powell</em>,
which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court should have regard to both the
culpability of the various parties and to the extent to which each
party’s conduct “caused” the damage in question. … <em>The
“just and equitable” criterion is wide enough to enable the apportionment
take account of blameworthiness</em> as well as causative
potency, and even, to an extent, of non-causative matters. However,
the main factor to consider is each party’s responsibility for the
damage. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The
term “blameworthiness” is broad and it gives the court the flexibility
to take into account a wide range of conduct to arrive at a just
and equitable result in a myriad of situations (G H L Fridman, <em>Torts</em> (Waterlow Publishers, 1st Ed, 1990)
at para 13-40). This inevitably necessitates a value judgment and,
as rightly pointed out by the Judge, there are cases which demonstrate
that the courts will take fraud and dishonesty into account (<em>Nationwide Building Society v Dunlop Haywards Ltd</em> [2010]
1 WLR 258 (“<em>Nationwide Building Society</em>”)
and <em>Clydesdale Bank Plc v Workman</em> [2014]
PNLR 18 (“<em>Clydesdale Bank</em>”), both
discussed in the Judgment at [230]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In
passing, we note that it is a well-established principle in contributory
negligence that blameworthiness is a relevant consideration in the
reduction of damages (<em>Stapley v Gypsum Mines
Ltd</em> [1953] AC 663 at 682, <em>per</em> Lord
Reid and <em>Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) Ltd</em> [1949]
2 KB 291 at 326, <em>per</em> Denning LJ,
both approved in <em>Parno</em> (see above
at [13])). We see no reason why blameworthiness should not be a
relevant consideration under s 16 of the CLA as well when it is
accepted as a relevant consideration in contributory negligence.
Indeed, s 16 of the CLA and s 3 of the Contributory Negligence Act
are conceptually similar in that both direct the court to <em>apportion</em> damages between parties having
regard to their responsibility to reach a just and equitable result.
Of course, the two are concerned with different things. In contributory
negligence, damages are apportioned between claimant and defendant
having regard to the fault of the claimant, whereas under s 16 of
the CLA, the apportionment is between the defendant and third parties
having regard to their respective responsibility for the damage
in question (Douglas Payne, “Reduction of Damages for Contributory
Negligence” (1955) 18 Mod LR 344 at p 346; Spike Charlwood, “Contribution
and professionals: an overview of the 1978 Act, alternatives to
it, and its relationship with contributory negligence” (2007) 23(2)
PN 82 at p 83). A court should therefore first determine the extent
of the reduction in the damages to be awarded to the claimant by reference
to the claimant’s contributory fault and then apportion the liability
that is found among the defendant(s) and third parties (see <em>Fitzgerald v Lane and another</em> [1989] AC
328 at 339). We adopt that approach here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In
our judgment, the Judge ought to have ordered Cheng to bear a larger
share of the damages. We are conscious of the need to give due deference
to the Judge’s exercise of discretion in apportioning liability.
As we recently said in <em>Goh Sin Huat Electrical
Pte Ltd v Ho See Jui (trading as Xuanhua Art Gallery) and another</em> [2012]
3 SLR 1038, an appellate court should be slow to intervene in a
trial judge’s decision in apportioning liability, particularly where
“the apportionment decision of the trial judge was supported by
cogent reasons alluding to the interaction of the respective parties’
individual culpability in a myriad of identified causes from which
the damages flowed” (at [54]). It is clear from the Judgment that
the Judge did apply her mind to Cheng’s, the Defendants’ and Ng’s culpability
in apportioning liability (the Judgment at [228]–[233]). But an appellate
court is permitted to interfere with a trial judge’s decision in apportioning
liability if the trial judge erred in principle (<em>Capps
v Miller</em> [1989] 2 All ER 333; <em>Holland
Hannen and Cubitts (Northern) Ltd v Welsh Health Technical Services
Organisation</em> (1985) 35 BLR 1 at 18, <em>per</em> Lawton LJ).
We are satisfied that the Judge, with respect, erred in principle
here in apportioning liability equally between Cheng (who acted
fraudulently) on the one hand, and the Defendants and Ng (who acted
negligently) on the other hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In
this regard, we have considered the following two cases which demonstrate
that fraudulent parties should generally be made to bear more than
an equal share of the damages payable, both of which were mentioned in
the Judgment, though the Judge did not appear to pay heed to the percentage
of damages the fraudulent parties in those cases were made to bear
(the Judgment at [230]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     In <em>Nationwide Building Society</em> (see above
at [46]), the property was overvalued by a fraudulent employee of
the valuer. The plaintiff made two advances to a company based on
the valuation. The company later defaulted. The plaintiff sued the
valuer as well as the negligent solicitors who handled the advances.
The solicitors later brought a claim for contribution against the
valuer. Christopher Clarke J decided that it would be just and equitable
to apportion liability 80:20 to the valuer, since “the moral blameworthiness
of [the valuer] and the causative potency of the fraud of its [employee]”
were very much greater than that of the solicitors, whose “failing
was not to pick up on the fraudulent scheme rather than to play
any part in it” (at [77]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     Similarly
in <em>Clydesdale Bank</em> (see above at
[46]), Mr Mark Pelling QC (sitting as a Deputy Judge of the English
High Court) concluded that dishonesty was a relevant consideration
in deciding a “just and equitable” apportionment. He therefore ordered
that the dishonest party bear 65% of the damages, and the negligent
party, the remaining 35% (at [97]–[99]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In
our judgment, Cheng should bear 65% of the overall liability for the
damages for which the Defendants are found responsible. His moral blameworthiness
and the causative potency of his fraud were very much greater than
those of the Defendants and Ng, whose failing was in not picking
up on Cheng’s fraud, rather than playing any part in perpetrating
it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     As
between the Defendants and Ng, we are satisfied that the Defendants
should bear the bulk of the remaining damages payable and will therefore
not increase the proportion of damages payable by Ng. Lim is a solicitor
of close to 16 years’ standing, and has practised conveyancing law for
a considerable time. Yet, he fell well below the mark in discharging
his duties owed to the Plaintiffs. We do not propose to repeat the
multiple breaches of duty on his part as these have been dealt with
by the Judge (the Judgment at [106]–[115]). However, we do wish
to reiterate that the remaining leasehold on any property is a highly
important piece of information to purchasers in conveyancing transactions;
conveyancing solicitors are expected to keep their clients apprised
of such information even if not specifically asked. Furthermore,
in our judgment, when a solicitor is asked to represent the purchaser
in the sale and purchase of a property, there will be a duty in
general to take proper instructions as to what the purchaser’s understanding
of the deal that he wishes to enter into is. Had the question been
asked by Lim or ALT in this case, and had Su omitted to mention
the representation in the light of such a question, a different
result might well have ensued. However, those are not the facts before
us.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     We
therefore apportion liability in the following manner: Cheng (65%),
the Defendants (30%) and Ng (5%). These ratios should apply in relation
to the 85% liability that we have found having regard to Su’s contributory
negligence. The Judge valued Su’s loss in the sum of $308,436 (the
Judgment at [154]). 85% of that sum amounts to $262,170.60, which
is what Su and his family are entitled to. The sum of $262,170.60
shall be borne by the Defendants and the Third Parties in the following
manner: Cheng ($179,410.89), the Defendants ($78,651.18) and Ng
($13,108.53).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We
decline to order SGR Property to indemnify the Defendants in relation
to Ng’s portion of damages payable. The Judge found at [226] of the
Judgment that there was insufficient evidence to prove that SGR Property
is Ng’s employer and we are not minded to interfere with this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In
the light of the forgoing, we turn finally to the question of costs. We
deal with the costs of the matter below and the costs of these appeals
in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Costs of the matter below </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     There
are two aspects to the costs of the matter below. The first pertains
to the Main Action. The Judge ordered that the Defendants should pay
the Plaintiffs’ costs of the Main Action without any contribution
from the Third Parties. The Defendants take issue with this and
contend that the Third Parties ought to contribute to the Defendants
for a share of the costs payable by them to the Plaintiffs. We accept
the Defendants’ contention and order that the Third Parties should
contribute in the proportions in which we have apportioned the overall
liability. Hence, Cheng should contribute towards 65% of the Plaintiffs’
costs for which the Defendants are liable and Ng should contribute
towards 5% of such costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The
second aspect pertains to the third party proceedings. The Judge ordered
that the Defendants’ costs are to be paid in the proportionate share of
the contribution by Cheng and Ng. We generally agree with this approach,
but given our finding on what the respective contribution by each
of the Third Parties should be, we order that the Defendants’ costs
of the third party proceedings are to be borne by the Third Parties
on a standard basis in the proportion of 90% by Cheng and 10% by
Ng. For the avoidance of doubt, we do not disturb the Judge’s finding
in relation to costs for the counterclaim (the Judgment at [236]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Having
dealt with the apportionment, we come now to quantum. The Defendants
argued the amount of costs they should be paying to the Plaintiffs
for the Main Action ought to be reduced for two reasons. First, they
succeeded in their contention that the Plaintiffs’ entitlement to damages
should be reduced on account of contributory negligence. Second, a
large part of the trial below was taken up with such issues as Su’s contention
that he had conveyed the fact of the representation to ALT, on which
Su was ultimately unsuccessful. In our judgment, the Defendants’ contentions
are valid. Taking a broad view on costs, we order that the Plaintiffs
should only be entitled to two-thirds of their costs for the Main Action
on a standard basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Costs of the appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     We
turn finally to the costs of these appeals. In relation to CA 148/2014,
Cheng is to pay the Defendants’ costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In
relation to CA 152/2014, the Defendants who brought the appeal have
succeeded in part against the Plaintiffs (who were the first three respondents
in the appeal) on the issue of contributory negligence. They have
also succeeded against Cheng on the question of apportionment of damages.
However, they have not succeeded against Ng who appeared in person.
We accordingly hold that the Defendants are entitled to 50% of their
costs of the appeal, which shall be borne in equal shares as between
the Plaintiffs on the one hand and Cheng on the other hand. These
costs are to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     We
accordingly dismiss CA 148/2014 with the costs order noted above
and with the usual consequential orders. We allow CA 152/2014 in part
similarly with the costs order noted above and with the usual consequential
orders.</p>
