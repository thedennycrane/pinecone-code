<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this case pertaining to ancillary matters,
                    there are three outstanding issues to be resolved between the parties: (i)
                    division of matrimonial assets, (ii) maintenance for the wife and (iii)
                    maintenance for the children of the marriage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       [AQT] (“the Husband”) and [AQU]
                    (“the Wife”) were married on 5 June 1992. The Husband filed
                    for divorce on 22 December 2007. The divorce was contested. An interim
                    judgment of divorce was eventually granted on 20 January 2009 to the Wife
                    based on her counterclaim. The marriage lasted 17 years. The Husband is aged 50
                    and is currently the Head of e-FX Sales, South East Asia, at a foreign bank, [A]
                    Bank, in Singapore. The Wife is 48 years old and is a home-maker. There are
                    three children of the marriage <em>viz</em> 2 daughters
                    aged 15 and 9 and a son aged 13.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Wife and the children are currently residing
                    in the United Kingdom (“UK”) at a house in Chesham (“the
                    Matrimonial Home”). The Court granted leave on 18 July 2008 for the Wife
                    and the children to return to the UK. The Husband had to facilitate the
                    Wife’s relocation and pay for all of the children’s living and
                    school expenses in the UK. A further court order was made on 11 May 2009
                    for additional reimbursement to the Wife of relocation expenses and for the
                    Husband to pay £2,100 per month (£700 for each child) for the
                    children’s living expenses, exclusive of the children’s school fees
                    which were to be paid in addition to their living expenses. The Court also
                    ordered that the Husband provide a 7-seater car for the children which the Wife
                    purchased second hand a Vauxhall model, at £10,800.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 24 March 2010, the parties entered into a
                    consent order for the custody, care and control of the children. The parties
                    would have joint custody of the children with care and control to the Wife and
                    specific terms of access for the Husband. Between July and September 2010,
                    parties exchanged Offers to Settle but were unable to reach any agreement on the
                    outstanding ancillary issues. Both parties have since filed several affidavits
                    relating to the ancillaries – six by the Husband and five by the
                    Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Should the Bemali Trust be treated as a matrimonial asset?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Bemali Trust was established by the Husband
                    and was valued at £465,791.93 as at 17 May 2010. From the trust
                    documents, it was noted that the Husband had irrevocably transferred the
                    beneficial ownership of the Bemali Trust to his three children. The Wife argued
                    that the Bemali Trust should be treated as a matrimonial asset because the
                    Husband had unilaterally set it up using a substantial portion of their savings
                    (£480,000), which was meant for the family. The Bemali Trust was
                    established within the same week that the Husband said he wanted a divorce and
                    mere months before the Husband filed for divorce.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Husband contended that the funds used to set
                    up the Bemali Trust were wholly acquired and earned by him with no monetary
                    contribution from the Wife. However, the funds used to set it up were acquired
                    during the marriage. Therefore, while it is clear from the trust document that
                    the beneficial ownership of the Bemali Trust belongs neither to the Husband nor
                    to the Wife, technically the £480,000 used to set up the Bemali Trust was a
                    matrimonial asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       However, I will not notionally place the
                    £480,000 used in setting up the Bemali Trust into the pool of matrimonial
                    assets to be divided. It is within the Court’s just and equitable
                    discretion under s 112 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353,
                    2009 Rev Ed) (“the Charter”) to decide not to exercise its
                    discretion to order division of assets that are technically matrimonial assets.
                    In <em>Lim Ngeok Yuen v Lim Soon Heng Victor</em>
                    [2006] SGHC 83 at [45], the
                    Court held that while the wife’s interest in the Arcadia property was
                    technically a matrimonial asset, it would exercise its discretion to exempt it
                    from division as she had bought the property sometime after the parties
                    separated and the husband had ceased to make contributions to the family. In
                    this case, it is just and equitable to exempt the Bemali Trust from the pool of
                    matrimonial assets since the terms of the Bemali Trust showed that it was
                    intended for the children’s benefit, which is consistent with the aims of
                    the matrimonial partnership. This is also consonant with s 122(2)(c) of the
                    Charter, which states that one of the main considerations for division under s
                    122(2) is “the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage”.
                    The Bemali Trust also has the benefit of ringfencing the funds from inheritance
                    tax in the UK, which the Husband alleged would decrease the funds by
                    £200,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       I note that the Wife was not against the Bemali
                    Trust <em>per se</em> but was concerned that the Husband
                    would in the future renege on his intention that the children would be the
                    beneficiaries under the trust. I am satisfied from the Memorandum of
                    Settlor’s wishes that the Wife’s fears were unfounded. The Bemali
                    Trust is meant to safeguard the assets for the children and is not available to
                    the Husband or the Wife or their future spouses. The Bemali Trust will pay for
                    the schooling expenses of the three children until the completion of their first
                    degree. The Bemali Trust is also meant to provide both daughters with a capital
                    sum on their attaining 25 years of age. The Husband also foresaw that the son
                    (who has special needs as he suffers from Williams syndrome) will remain a
                    dependant of the Bemali Trust for much of his life (or possibly, his entire
                    lifetime) until he can support himself independently. The son’s capital
                    sum will remain in the trust and the Bemali Trust will continue to provide for
                    him. The wife, as the primary caretaker of the children, will benefit from the
                    Bemali Trust which provides certainty for the children’s long-term
                    financial needs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       If the Husband had (just before the divorce) set
                    up a trust for someone completely unrelated to his marriage, <em>eg</em>, his brother, it may then be just and equitable for the Court
                    to notionally place the £480,000 back into the pool of matrimonial assets.
                    In fact, s 132 of the Charter can be used to “claw-back” this
                    asset if the Husband had disposed of it with the object of reducing his means to
                    pay maintenance or depriving the Wife of any rights in relation to the property
                    (see <em>NI v NJ</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75).
                    However, the facts clearly do not fall within s 132 of the Charter because
                    the Husband did not have such a motive in setting up the Bemali Trust for his
                    children. Therefore, as I had informed the parties at the hearing, the Bemali
                    Trust will not be treated as part of the pool of matrimonial assets to be
                    divided.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Did the Husband make full and frank disclosure of his
                Assets?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Wife did not accept that the Husband had
                    disclosed all of his assets. The Wife made several allegations against the
                    Husband as the bases for drawing an adverse inference against the Husband. I
                    will consider each allegation in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i) Missing Documents in the Husband’s Discovery
                Affidavit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Wife alleged that the Husband did not
                    provide certain documents in his discovery affidavit that he indicated he would
                    provide:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Husband was supposed to provide
                        his monthly bank statements showing salary deposits, all other income
                        commissions and bonuses from January 2007 to date. However, he only provided
                        documents from May 2009 onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Husband was supposed to provide his P60sUk document
                        (evidencing amount of income tax paid in UK) from 2008 to date. He only
                        provided that for 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Husband was supposed to provide his bank statements
                        for DBS account no. 1 [xxx] from January 2007 to date. His statements for
                        June and July 2008 were missing.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Husband was supposed to provide his bank statements
                        for DBS account no. 2 [xxx] from January 2007 to date. He only provided
                        statements from May 2008 onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Wife also alleged
                    that the Husband did not provide the April 2000 credit card statement for Amex
                    account no [xxx] but this was not true.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Husband disagreed that he failed to
                    provide the documents required for breach (a). He stated that he provided all
                    his monthly bank statements showing salary deposits, all other income
                    commissions and bonuses from January 2007 as requested. The Husband admitted he
                    did not provide the monthly payslips for the years 2007 and 2008, but the Wife
                    was wrong to state he provided documents only from May 2009 onwards because he
                    provided the payslips for January to April 2009 (both months inclusive).
                    Furthermore, the Husband had already provided his Notice of Assessment for the
                    year 2007 and his income tax return for the year ended 31 December 2008 to
                    show his total income for those years. Therefore, I am satisfied that the
                    Husband was not hiding his income for the years 2007 to 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Regarding breach (b), I accept the
                    Husband’s explanation that he had already disclosed an email from his
                    accountants in the UK, Morgan Hamilton Inghams, dated 7 September 2009, in
                    response to his request for his P60sUK document for the year 2008. The response
                    was self-explanatory: “You would not have received a P60 as you left
                    during the year”. There is accordingly no breach of (b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Husband explained that for breach (c),
                    there were no statements for the months of June and July 2008 because another
                    DBS credit card account no. [xxx] was closed on 21 May 2008 and a new
                    credit card was issued under the DBS account no. 1 [xxx], which he only started
                    using in August 2008. Regarding breach (d), the Husband explained that he had
                    already disclosed all the bank statements in his possession. It is fair to state
                    that the credit card and bank statements already disclosed in the
                    Husband’s discovery affidavit were voluminous. I am satisfied that
                    breaches (c) and (d), if they can even be considered breaches, were minor and
                    not intentional on the Husband’s part to hide his assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Wife also submitted that the Husband only
                    disclosed the trust documents for the Bemali Trust in his second affidavit.
                    While this is true, I will not draw an adverse inference against the Husband
                    solely because of this since (i) the Husband disclosed the existence of the
                    Bemali Trust and its value in his first affidavit, (ii) he also disclosed the
                    trust documents when the Wife took out a discovery application for it and (iii)
                    he had a legitimate reason for not filing the documents the first time –
                    he did not think the Bemali Trust was a matrimonial asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii) Inconsistencies in the Husband’s Letter of Employment
                dated 16 March 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Wife alleged that the Letter of Employment
                    with [B] Pte Ltd first produced in the Husband’s first affidavit left out
                    a statement relating to a potential commission of S$320,000 if the sales target
                    was met (“Commission clause”). This Commission clause was present
                    in a <em>second</em> version of the Letter of Employment
                    produced in the Husband’s second affidavit. On the face of the documents,
                    it did suggest that the Husband was less than honest in his first affidavit, but
                    I note that this omission was readily rectified in his second affidavit and it
                    related to his income in his previous job in 2009. The Husband also explained
                    that the two versions were genuine and he did not doctor the Letter of
                    Employment in his first affidavit. The first employment contract did not include
                    the Commission clause which was verbally agreed and he requested for a fresh
                    employment contract with the clause. The use of the first employment contract in
                    his first affidavit was an error.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Although the Wife requested the Husband to
                    account for the S$320,000 commission, I note that the commission was not
                    guaranteed to the Husband and would only be given if he had met the sales
                    target. The Husband submitted that he did not earn this commission and his
                    actual earnings in 2009 were evidenced from the pay slips issued by [B] Pte Ltd
                    which he had already disclosed in his first affidavit. Therefore, unless there
                    were other clear instances of the Husband being dishonest, I would not draw an
                    adverse inference against the Husband that he hid the commission of S$320,000.
                    The evidence supports the fact that the Husband had made full and frank
                    disclosure of the income he gained from [B] Pte Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(iii) Husband estimating his assets to be worth S$6 million in an
                insurance policy questionnaire in 2008</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Wife believed that the Husband has other
                    assets he did not disclose because the Husband had in a Financial Questionnaire
                    for his Great Eastern insurance policy in 2008 estimated his assets to be worth
                    S$6m. I find the Husband’s explanation of this estimate reasonable –
                    he explained that the estimation was rough, was based on an exchange rate of
                    £1 = S$3 and did not take into account his liabilities. Furthermore, his
                    income for 2006 and 2007 was supplemented by large bonus payments for those
                    years and those large bonuses have since ceased. I do not find the estimate to
                    be strong enough evidence to support the adverse inference the Wife wanted the
                    Court to draw.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(iv) Undisclosed rental income from Phuket Condominium and lack of
                supporting documents to support the liability outstanding on Phuket
                Condominium</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Husband had two condominium units in
                    Phuket (“the Phuket Condominiums”). The Husband stated in his
                    sixth affidavit filed on 25 November 2010, that he recently sold his Phuket
                    Condominium, Unit No. A[X], Kata Noi Road, Kata Karon (“A[X]”),
                    The Height and bought a smaller unit, Unit No. B[X] (“B[X]”), in
                    the same development. He sold A[X] for THB34,900,000 and used the proceeds of
                    A[X] to purchase B[X] and make part payment of the outstanding loan. The Husband
                    alleged that B[X] is worth THB20,000,000 and has an outstanding liability of
                    £191,000. The Wife submitted during the ancillary hearing that there was no
                    document to support the Husband’s assertion that there was an outstanding
                    liability of £191,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is true that the Husband failed to provide
                    direct documentary evidence of the outstanding liability of £191,000.
                    However, in his first and sixth affidavit, the Husband provided documentary
                    evidence that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     his outstanding mortgage for A[X]
                        was THB22,597,269.04;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     he sold A[X] for THB34,900,000; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Sale and Purchase Agreement Statement (dated
                        22 November 2010) stated that the Husband received THB12,975,000 (after
                        purchasing B[X] for THB20,000,000 and deducting the Agent’s and
                        Lawyer’s fees).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, based on the documentary
                    evidence, the Husband explained that he used the proceeds of A[X] (THB
                    34,900,000) to purchase B[X] (THB 20,000,000) and was left with THB 12,975,000
                    (after deducting the Agent and Lawyer’s fees). The Husband then explained
                    at the hearing that he used the remaining proceeds of THB 12,975,000 to pay off
                    the outstanding mortgage on A[X] (THB 22,597,269.04), which would leave a
                    remaining outstanding mortgage of THB 9,622,269.04 (S$ 449,034.43). This amount
                    is larger than the £ 191,000 (S$ 391,500) the Husband claims to be now
                    outstanding, although the discrepancy differs according to the currency
                    conversion rate of the pound sterling against the Singapore dollar. I noted that
                    the currency of the outstanding liability changed from Thai baht to pound
                    sterling and the Husband did not produce any documents to show the link between
                    the outstanding mortgage of A[X] and B[X]. The Husband explained in his sixth
                    affidavit that he could not provide the documents, because the documents were
                    not available at that time. On the whole, I am satisfied from the
                    Husband’s disclosure of all his bank statements that the remaining
                    outstanding mortgage of THB 9,622,269.04 had not been paid off and it was
                    unlikely he could have paid off such a large and substantial amount of debt
                    since A[X] was sold and B[X] purchased in November 2010. I was satisfied that
                    regardless of whether the outstanding mortgage stems from A[X] or B[X], the
                    outstanding liability of £ 191,000 the Husband alleges does exist. The Wife
                    also made no objections to the Husband’s claim of the outstanding
                    liability, even in her reply affidavit filed in January 2011 after the Husband
                    filed his sixth affidavit regarding the purchase of B[X]; she only raised such
                    objections at the hearing itself. I will not draw the adverse inference that the
                    Wife seemed to implicitly alleged which was that the Husband had secretly paid
                    off the outstanding mortgage of his Phuket Condominiums and is trying to reduce
                    the pool of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     I also accept the Husband’s explanation
                    that there was no rental income left undisclosed because the tenancy agreement
                    was for A[X], which has been sold.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I am not satisfied that the transactions were
                    suspicious. I find the Husband’s explanations for all the withdrawals
                    reasonable. Regarding transaction (a), it is clear from the bank statement that
                    the Husband was making foreign exchange transactions (“forex
                    transactions”) based on the exchange rate of the pound. While there was a
                    debit of S$133,350.00 on 28 May 2008 (referred to as FX GBP 50,000.00 @
                    2.6670 in the bank statement), there was also a credit of S$138,015.00 on
                    28 May 2008 (referred to as FX GBP 50,000.00 @ 2.7603 in the bank
                    statement). Therefore, the Husband submitted the transfer was not a withdrawal
                    but a forex transaction with S$5,000 profit made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Regarding transaction (b), the Husband said
                    there was nothing suspicious about the transfer of £194,616.36, which was
                    made to his QROPS pension fund. As for transaction (c), the bank statements from
                    January 2007 to March 2009 (when it became nil value) showed series of debts and
                    credits into this account even before the parties separated on November 2007.
                    There was no evidence that the Husband deliberately removed funds from this
                    account. For a year and a half after the parties separated, the bank statements
                    showed a constant stream of withdrawals and credits which seemed to be
                    consistent with the Husband’s testimony that he used his forex trading
                    skills to increase the family’s assets. <em>Prima
                        facie</em>, there is insufficient evidence to support the Wife’s
                    contention that the Husband was deliberately removing funds from this bank
                    account. Transactions (e) and (f) were similar to transaction (c).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Regarding transaction (d), the Thai Bank
                    Account was only disclosed in the Husband’s third affidavit. The Husband
                    explained that he had made full disclosure of the Thai Bank Account. He had
                    misplaced the passbook and obtained copies of the same from the bank. The
                    Husband explained that there was nothing suspicious about the withdrawals which
                    were used in connection with the Thai property. All one can infer from the
                    passbook was that there was a continuous stream of withdrawals. <em>Prima facie</em>, it is difficult without more substantiating
                    evidence from the Wife, to say that those transactions were
                suspicious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(vii) Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I accept that the Husband made full and frank
                    disclosure of his assets and I decline to draw any adverse inference against

                            cases, should not be used as a mechanism to shore up glaring
                            deficiencies in the opposite party’s case, which on its own is
                            unable to meet up to the requisite burden of proof</em>. Rather,
                        the procedure exists in order to render the case of the party against whom
                        the inference is drawn weaker and thus less credible of belief.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In order to draw an adverse inference, there must at least be a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case against the
                Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is noted that allegations (iv) to (vi) were
                    only made by the Wife at the hearing itself. A critical gap in the Wife’s
                    submissions is that while she asked the Court to draw an adverse inference, she
                    failed to state <em>what kind</em> of adverse inference she
                    wanted the Court to draw based on the evidence she drew the Court’s
                    attention to. The Wife merely argued that the transactions were suspicious. This
                    is unhelpful – what kind of suspicions arose from the bank statements that
                    showed a series of withdrawals over a long period of time? The Wife did not
                    actually argue that the Husband was <em>actively
                        dissipating</em> his assets by diverting his funds to other bank
                    accounts that he did not disclose. Was the Court supposed to draw an adverse
                    inference that the Husband was dishonest and hiding his assets from <em>mere suspicions</em>? The series of withdrawals in the
                    Husband’s bank statements also did not <em>prima
                        facie</em> look suspicious. The Husband gave a reasonable explanation
                    that he has expertise in forex transactions and used his own funds and bank
                    accounts to engage in forex trading. The Court cannot and should not fill in the
                    gaps of the Wife’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is a fact that funds in bank accounts are
                    special matrimonial assets in the sense that they are <em>highly
                        liquid</em>. The Court would be sensitive to this fact and would claw
                    back funds in which it is clear that one party was actively transferring out
                    funds for the purpose of dissipating the matrimonial assets. However, this was
                    not a case where the Wife argued that the funds in the Bank account should be
                        <em>put back</em> or frozen <em>as of a
                        certain date</em> because large withdrawals were made that largely
                    diminished the funds in the Bank account. The Wife only asked the Court to look
                    at bank statements which presented a constant pattern of debits and credits
                    among the various bank accounts. The Court cannot fill in the gaps of the
                    Wife’s evidence and the bank statements <em>per
                        se</em> do not lead to an adverse inference that the Husband was
                    dissipating his funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Pool of Matrimonial Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Disputed Matrimonial Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I accept the Husband’s evidence that the
                    Great Eastern insurance policy No. [xxx] should not be included in the pool of
                    matrimonial assets. The Husband explained that this insurance policy was funded
                    by his employer at that time and ceased with his employment. There was no
                    surrender value to include in the pool of matrimonial assets. Similarly, I
                    accept the Wife’s evidence that her insurance policy Zurich Assurance Life
                    Policy No. [xxx] has no surrender value to be included in the pool of
                    matrimonial assets. I also accept the Husband’s evidence that the Royal
                    Skandia Account (unknown value), SGAVC Equitable Life (£9,750) and SGAVC
                    Norwich Union (£56,395) fell within the QROPS Pension Fund and I will not
                    include them in the pool of matrimonial assets so as to avoid
                    double-counting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Matrimonial Assets Exempted from Division</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As in <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above for the Bemali Trust, I exercise my discretion not to include the
                    Husband’s Phuket Furniture (£25,000), Singapore Furniture
                    (£10,000) and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) (S$67,817.72).
                    For the Wife, she can retain her jewellery (£2,845) and the furniture in
                    the Matrimonial Home (£60,000). In my opinion, it would be fair for the
                    Husband to retain his CPF savings (totalling S$67,817.67 as of 25 October
                    2010) and for the Wife, correspondingly, to retain her jewellery. There is
                    little point dividing the furniture in the parties’ respective homes since
                    the furniture would lose value on re-sale. Further, neither the Husband’s
                    CPF savings nor the Wife’s jewellery were so substantial as to warrant
                    putting them into the pool of matrimonial assets for division. I note too that
                    the furniture in the Matrimonial Home was worth more than the Husband’s
                    Phuket furniture (£25,000).</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(B) The Other Matrimonial Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I note that the hearing took place 2 years
                    after the interim judgment of divorce was given on 20 January 2009. In some
                    cases, a long delay before ancillaries are determined will give rise to an issue
                    of whether an asset acquired after the interim judgment should still be
                    considered as being acquired “within the marriage”, <em>ie</em>, as a matrimonial asset. The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Nancy Tay Ang Choo</em>
                    [2011] SGCA 8 (“<em>Yeo Chong
                    Lin</em>”) held that the operative date could be (i) the date the
                    writ of divorce is filed, (ii) the date the parties separated, (iii) the date of
                    interim judgment and (iv) the date of the hearing. The operative date depends on
                    what is just and equitable on the facts of the case and differing assets may
                    have different operative dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I note that two assets were acquired after the
                    interim judgment: (i) the Phuket Condominium, B[X], acquired in November 2010
                    and (ii) the Husband’s BMW acquired in March 2010. However, both parties
                    were in agreement before me that the Phuket Condominium, B[X], and the BMW are
                    matrimonial assets to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets to be
                    decided. Therefore, implicitly both parties applied the date of hearing as the
                    operative date. I accept that the date of hearing is the just and equitable
                    operative date in the circumstances of this case since the assets acquired after
                    the interim judgment were funded from the sale of undisputed matrimonial
                    assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Although the parties did not dispute that the
                    Wife’s legal fees to Charles Russell (£4,029.7 as at 2 July
                    2009) and Harry Elias Partnership (S$29,000 as at 1 July 2009) were
                    liabilities that can be deducted, I do not accept that the legal fees for Harry
                    Elias Partnership can be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets. The bill
                    from Charles Russell provided in the Wife’s affidavit did not state the
                    purpose for which the legal fees were incurred. As the Husband did not dispute
                    this, I will accept that the legal fees were not incurred for the purpose of
                    these matrimonial proceedings and it can be deducted as part of the Wife’s
                    liabilities. However, there were no documents provided in the Wife’s
                    affidavits regarding Harry Elias’ fees at all. I accept that it is likely
                    the fees were incurred in the course of Harry Elias Partnership representing the
                    Wife in these proceedings. It was highly unusual for the legal fees for
                        <em>these very matrimonial proceedings</em> to be
                    deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets. It would be an unwise precedent to
                    allow parties to deduct their hefty legal costs from the pool of matrimonial
                    assets. Whatever liability parties owe their solicitors for the matrimonial
                    proceedings should be settled from <em>their own share</em>
                    of the matrimonial assets after division. To deduct the legal fees from the
                        <em>joint</em> pool of matrimonial assets during the
                    proceedings would be to render any cost order the Court made in the judgment
                    largely nugatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Husband stated he paid for 3 paintings:
                    (i) Mother/Child by Kelyne, (ii) Miao Bride I by Xue Dai and (iii) The Alure of
                    Illumination by Tain Xu Tong (“the Paintings”) currently held by
                    the Wife and would like the Wife to return the Paintings to him. Although the
                    Wife stated that she was the owner of the paintings, she provided no evidence in
                    support. The Husband adduced an insurance policy on the Paintings taken out in
                    his name. On the evidence, I am satisfied that the Husband paid for the
                    Paintings and therefore order the Paintings to be returned to him as part of his
                    share of matrimonial assets. The Husband stated the value of the Paintings to be
                    S$44,000 while the Wife stated their values as S$37,200. Based on the
                    Husband’s insurance policy on the Paintings, I accept their values to be
                    S$40,000. Any cost incurred in returning the paintings to the Husband will come
                    out of the Husband’s share of the total matrimonial assets.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Division of Matrimonial Assets</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Parties’ Contributions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     It is not disputed that the Husband was the
                    sole breadwinner of the family and solely contributed to the acquisition of the
                    Matrimonial Home. The Wife admitted her claim is only based on her indirect
                    contributions to the marriage over the past 17 years. The Husband admitted that
                    the Wife was an excellent caregiver and homemaker. Similarly, the Wife should
                    not seek to diminish the Husband’s indirect contributions to the
                    household. While the Husband’s indirect contributions were not as
                    extensive as the Wife’s, the Husband was also a good and caring
                    father.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Wife asked for the full ownership of the
                    Matrimonial Home (50% as her rightful share of the Matrimonial Home and the
                    other 50% in lieu of her claim for maintenance). The Wife also asked for 50% of
                    the Other Matrimonial Assets. The Wife wanted full ownership of the Matrimonial
                    Home and was not agreeable to the Husband’s proposal to sell the
                    Matrimonial Home because she believed: (i) it is a good neighbourhood for a
                    single mother with 3 children, (ii) there was an existing support network of
                    friends and neighbours, (iii) it was important to provide continuity for the
                    children, (iv) the home is near the children’s schools, and (v) the Wife
                    was not in a financial position to purchase another property in the same area.
                    The Husband submitted that a just and equitable division of the <u>total</u> pool of matrimonial assets would be to give 65%
                    to the Husband and 35% to the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Court of Appeal in <em>NK v
                        NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743 held that both direct and
                    indirect contributions are equally important factors. Section 112(2) of the
                    Charter provides a non-exhaustive list of factors for the Court to consider in
                    determining how the matrimonial assets are to be divided. The Court is conferred
                    a wide discretion to apportion the matrimonial assets in a just and equitable
                    manner. I am satisfied that the Husband and Wife’s division of roles was
                    very much that of a traditional family – the Husband was the breadwinner
                    and the Wife was the homemaker. In such long marriages, where the wife is a full
                    time homemaker, the Courts have awarded normally 35% to 40% of the matrimonial
                    assets (see <em>Yeo Chong Lin</em> and <em>Lock Yeng Fun (mw) v. Chua Hock Chye</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 520).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     However, what the Wife is asking for is not a
                    just and equitable share of the total pool of matrimonial assets. While I agree
                    with the Wife that an important consideration in division would be the needs of
                    the children and their requirement of a home, it is not practical for the Wife
                    to retain the Matrimonial Home. It is expensive to maintain such a large house
                    and the Matrimonial Home has a substantial outstanding mortgage which the Wife
                    can no longer depend on the Husband to continue paying. It is more practical for
                    the Wife to purchase a comparable 4-5 bedroom property, fully paid up without a
                    mortgage, with her proceeds of the matrimonial assets. I accept the
                    Husband’s documentary evidence that comparable 4-5 bedroom properties in
                    Chesham, UK, will cost between £450,000 and £550,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Therefore, I am of the view that it would be
                    just and equitable to give 35% of the Other Matrimonial Assets <em>viz</em> S$361,817.10 (S$1,033,763.13 x 35%) and 45% of the
                    Matrimonial Home (S$599,806.14) to the Wife. I give the Wife a larger proportion
                    of the Matrimonial Home, which will be supplemented by her lump sum maintenance,
                    to enable her to purchase a comparable 4-5 bedroom property for herself and the
                    children (see further below at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>). I will
                    allow the Wife seven months up to 31 December 2011 to sell the house so as
                    not to disrupt the children’s schooling.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance for the Wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Both parties did not dispute the suitability
                    of having a lump sum order of maintenance for the Wife but disputed only on the
                    multiplicand and the multiplier. The Husband submitted that he was willing to
                    give the Wife lump sum maintenance of £1,200 monthly for a period of 5
                    years (£72,000). The Wife asked for £2,666.67 monthly for 10 years
                    (backdated from August 2008 when they relocated), which totals £320,000.40.
                    The Wife stated her monthly expenses to be £5,183.38, but she included
                    expenses for the children (which would be double-counting) and a number of
                    household expenses that would be unnecessary once the Matrimonial Home is sold
                    and replaced by a smaller and more practical house.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Under s 114 of the Charter, consideration must
                    be given to the earning capacity and financial resources of the Husband in the
                    foreseeable future as well. The Husband had done exceedingly well without a
                    university qualification and is currently earning S$28,333.34 per month.
                    However, I accept his submission that at 50 years of age in his industry, he is
                    past his peak earning power and his earning capacity is finite. In 2004, the
                    family moved to Singapore because the Husband’s ex-employer, [C] Bank,
                    offered him a choice of either taking up a new position in Asia or be demoted in
                    London because his job position in the UK had became redundant. The Husband was
                    retrenched in the year 2007 and is no longer employed in investment trading
                    which is considerably more lucrative than his current position in
                sales.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The Wife had maintained that she would be
                    unable to take up employment after being out of the workforce for so many years.
                    The Wife submitted that even part-time work would not be possible because of her
                    inability to get a caretaker for her children and the son’s requirement of
                    special attention. However, I am not satisfied that the Wife would be unable to
                    take up part-time work as her children get older and require less of her time. I
                    am satisfied that the Wife has the adequate skills to return to the workforce
                    – she used to work as a secretary, had worked for a period of the marriage
                    in [E] and in [F], and the Husband had also submitted that he had funded the
                    Wife’s enrolment in an interior design course in 2006 and a nail
                    technician’s course in 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It is important to keep in mind that the
                    underlying goal of s 114 of the Charter is financial preservation so far as
                    practicable and reasonable in the circumstances. The principles of s 114
                    were also succinctly cited by the Court of Appeal in <em>BG v
                        BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [74]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The High Court in <em>Wong Amy v Chua Seng Chuan</em>
                        [1992] 2 SLR(R) 142 made some crucial observations in relation to
                        these powers: (a) adequate provision must be made to ensure the support and
                        accommodation of the children of the marriage; (b) provision must be made to
                        meet the needs of each spouse; and (c) at the end of the day, it is the
                        court’s sense of justice which demands and obtains a just solution to
                        many a difficult issue: see also <em>Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim
                            Swee</em> [1995] SGHC 23.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is recognised that the Wife had been deprived of working capacity
                    during the marriage and maintenance is needed to ease her back into the
                    workforce and even out any economic prejudice she might have suffered during the
                    marriage. However, the Wife was expected to regain as much self-sufficiency as
                    possible (see <em>Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee</em>
                        (<em>alias Ho Kian Guan)</em>
                    [1995] SGHC 23).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Husband also submitted that the Wife would
                    receive a State Pension when she turns 65, which is presently £500 but is
                    index-linked. I am of the view that it would be fair and reasonable to give the
                    Wife £1,000 monthly for 17 years, which would total up to a lump sum
                    maintenance of £204,000 (or S$418,200).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Final Division between Husband and Wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In total, the Wife would receive 35% of the
                    Other Matrimonial Assets (S$361,817.10), 45% of the Matrimonial Home
                    (S$599,806.14) and a lump sum maintenance of £204,000 (S$418,200), which
                    totals up to S$<b>1,379,823.24</b> (£673,084.51).
                    This would be sufficient for the Wife to purchase a comparable 4-5 bedroom
                    property in Chesham (£450,000-£550,000) with a substantial amount
                    remaining for her future expenses. The Wife would receive her share of the total
                    matrimonial assets from the proceeds from the Matrimonial Home. Whatever remains
                    outstanding to the Wife (after deducting the proceeds when the Matrimonial Home
                    is sold and the value of her own assets) will be paid by the Husband directly to
                    her in cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Husband will receive 65% of the Other
                    Matrimonial Assets (S$671,946.03) and 55% of the Matrimonial Home
                    (S$733,096.40). After deducting the lump sum maintenance he must give the Wife,
                    the Husband’s share of the total matrimonial assets is <b>S$986,842.43</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Maintenance for the Children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The Wife wanted reimbursement of S$4,914.06
                    for the children’s expenses and requested that it be paid to her directly
                    from the Husband’s share of the assets. I am not satisfied, after looking
                    at the Wife’s receipts which were filed after the Wife’s final
                    substantive affidavit, that the Wife should be so reimbursed; there is no basis,
                    outside of the children’s maintenance and the Bemali Trust, for the
                    Husband to reimburse the Wife for such expenses. Therefore, I will not make such
                    an order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The Husband submitted that the Wife receives
                    Child Benefit, Disability Living Allowance (for the son) and Child Tax Credit
                    from the UK Government totalling £1,239.60 monthly. From the Wife’s
                    evidence, it appeared she received £9,931.65 worth of Child Tax Credit for
                    the period 6 April 2009 to 5 April 2010. The Wife also adduced a
                    letter dated 15 April 2009, from the UK Disability and Carers Service,
                    stating she will receive Disability Living Allowance (for the son) of
                    £65.75 weekly (£263 monthly) from 8 April 2009 onwards. According
                    to a letter dated 4 February 2009 from the UK HM Revenue &amp; Customs, the
                    Wife will be entitled to Child Benefit for all three children at £46.40
                    weekly (£185.60 monthly) from 5 January 2009 onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The interim maintenance for the children was
                    £700 each (a total of £2,100), not including the children’s
                    school fees and education-related expenses. The Husband is agreeable to continue
                    paying such an amount. I find the Wife’s claim of £1,500 for each
                    child (a total of £4,500) excessive. I am of the view that a fair and
                    reasonable sum of maintenance for each child will be £800 each (a total of
                    £2,400). This takes into consideration that the Wife receives UK subsidies
                    for the children and the £800 is not inclusive of the children’s
                    school fees and education-related expenses which are paid from the Bemali Trust.
                    Although the Husband is earning a reasonably high monthly salary, consideration
                    must also be given to his own expenses and liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Both parties wanted costs of the ancillary
                    proceedings. At the interim judgment stage, the Husband was ordered to pay the
                    Wife costs fixed at $1,800.00. The Wife argued costs of the ancillaries
                    proceedings should be awarded to the party awarded costs below unless the party
                    had acted unreasonably or for other good reasons, following the case of
                        <em>Tham Khai Meng v Nam Wen Jet Bernadette</em> [1997]
                    1 SLR(R) 336 at [50]
                        (“<em>Bernadette</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I am of the view that this is an appropriate
                    case with “good reasons” to differ from the norm in <em>Bernadette</em>. <em>Bernadette</em>
                    cited <em>Shi Fang v Koh Pee Huat</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 906 at [56]
                        (“<em>Shi Fang</em>”) for the proposition
                    that the hearing of the ancillary matters was a continuation of the hearing of
                    the petition. However, I note that the Court in <em>Shi
                        Fang</em> at [56] held that
                    “[i]mplicit in the grant of such decree to the wife was the finding of
                    the fault on the part of the husband as a cause for the divorce”. The
                    Court in ordering costs must be sensitive that the cost order does not run
                    contrary to the no-fault basis that underlies our jurisprudence on divorce. In
                    this case, the Husband actually filed the divorce petition first but he
                    submitted that he consented to interim judgment based on the wife’s
                    counterclaim to avoid unnecessarily protracting legal proceedings. I also note
                    that the Husband made several offers of maintenance to the Wife but the Wife
                    rather unreasonably repeatedly failed to give the Husband any figure. The
                    Husband also attempted unsuccessfully to discuss the Wife’s allegations of
                    non-disclosure and resolve the ancillary issues through discussions with the
                    Wife but she refused to negotiate. Therefore in the light of the facts of this
                    case, I order that each party bear his or her own costs for the ancillary
                    matters.</p>
