<p class="Judg-Author">
        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The Applicant is awaiting trial in respect of
                    eight charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“MDA”)
                    and three charges under the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 1985 Rev Ed.). He
                    was denied bail in the Subordinate Court on the ground that he was charged for
                    an offence punishable with a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, and that
                    the Subordinate Court has no jurisdiction to grant him bail by virtue of
                    s 95(1)(a) Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act No 15 of 2010)
                    (“CPC 2010”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the hearing of the criminal motion on
                    3 June 2011, I granted bail provisionally, pending further submissions by
                    the parties on whether the Subordinate Court possessed the requisite
                    jurisdiction to grant bail in this case. The main issue before me was the
                    interpretation of s 95(1)(a). Section 95(1)(a) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An accused shall not be released on bail or on personal bond if he is
                        charged for an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or
                        imprisonment for a term of 20 years or more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Mr Tiwary, counsel for the Applicant, argued that offences
                    punishable with “imprisonment for a term of 20 years or more”
                    should only mean offences where the minimum sentence is 20 years imprisonment or
                    more. Mr Kannan and Miss Sanjna Rai, the Deputy Public Prosecutors
                    (“DPP”) submitted that s 95(1)(a) encompasses offences with
                    maximum sentences of 20 years or more. The DPP also submitted that s 97(1)
                    of the CPC 2010 allows the High Court an over-riding discretion to grant
                    bail to the Applicant, as the High Court is not constrained by the limitations
                    in s 95(1)(a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       There are accordingly, two questions before
                    me:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the phrase “<em>imprisonment for a term of 20 years or more</em>” in
                            s 95(1)(a) of CPC 2010 refers to offences with a maximum
                            sentence of 20 years or more, or offences with a minimum sentence of 20
                            years or more.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the High Court has, under s 97(1) of
                            CPC 2010, the over-riding discretion to grant bail to the
                            Applicant, as it is not constrained by the limitations in
                            s 95(1)(a).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On the first question, I am of the view that the
                    phrase “<em>offences punishable with imprisonment for a
                        term of 20 years or more</em>” should be given its plain and
                    literal meaning and thus refer only to offences with a minimum sentence of 20
                    years or more. That is to say that the starting point, not the ending point, is
                    20 years. The contrary interpretation – that it encompasses offences with
                    a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment – offends a plain reading of
                    the phrase as these offences are not punishable with imprisonment for a term of
                    20 years or more. Offenders in such cases are just liable to imprisonment
                    for up to 20 years. I should reiterate the point here that bail has the role of
                    preserving the “golden thread” in criminal law that a person is
                    innocent until proven guilty, yet ensuring that the accused does not abscond
                    before trial (<em>Abul Khabir Uddin Tohron Nisa v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2006] SGHC 57 at [5]). It is not intended to be punitive and must not be
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As a general rule, the <b>CPC
                        2010</b> allows <b>bail</b> to be offered as
                    of right to the accused<b>. However, the discretion of the
                        Subordinate Court to grant bail is removed altogether for the offences
                        falling under s 95(1)(a). Only the High Court has the discretion to
                        grant bail in respect of offences under this provision. So what does the
                        phrase “</b><em>imprisonment for a term of 20
                        years or more”</em> mean? The DPP argued that to interpret
                        “<em>imprisonment for a term of 20 years or
                        more</em>” as referring only to offences where the minimum
                    sentence is 20 years or more renders the phrase nugatory. They submitted that
                    since a survey of our penal legislation reveals that currently all the offences
                    attracting minimum sentences of 20 years imprisonment or more are also
                    punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the phrase would be
                    devoid of meaning unless it was taken to refer to offences with maximum
                    sentences of 20 years or more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Although the parliamentary debates (when this
                    provision was amended) were not helpful on the interpretation of s 95(1)(a)
                    of the CPC 2010, s 52(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,
                    1985 Rev Ed) (“the old CPC”), the predecessor section, is of some
                    assistance. That section provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When any person accused of any non-bailable offence is arrested or
                        detained without a warrant by a police officer or appears or is brought
                        before a court, he may be released on bail by any police officer not below
                        the rank of sergeant or by that court, but <u>he shall not
                            be so released if there appears reasonable grounds for believing that he
                            has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for
                            life</u>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">While the section was limited to instances where there were reasonable
                    grounds for believing that an accused has been guilty of an offence punishable
                    with death or imprisonment for life [see <em>S Selvamsylvester v
                        PP</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 409 (“<em>Selvamsylvester</em>”)], the current version would require the
                    question of bail to be decided as soon as an accused is charged. The DPP’s
                    interpretation will lead to further expansion of s 95(1)(a) beyond the
                    intention of Parliament. The offences attracting a maximum sentence of 20 years
                    imprisonment or more cover a wide sentencing range. For instance, despite having
                    a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, the offence of cultivating
                    cannabis, opium or the coca plant under s 10 of the MDA has a minimum
                    sentence of a fine. It will also mean that a person who is charged with
                    cultivating a small amount of cannabis, and who may ultimately be sentenced to a
                    fine, may not apply for bail before a Subordinate Court. Further, I am of the
                    view that given that the other offences falling within s 95(1)(a) are those
                    punishable with death or imprisonment for life, it is more reasonable to read
                    that as referring only to offences where the minimum sentence is 20 years or
                    more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I now turn to the second question. A person
                    accused of a non-bailable offence may be released on bail in accordance with
                    s 93(1) of the CPC 2010:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to section 95(1), if any person accused of any non-bailable
                        offence is arrested or detained without warrant by a police officer, or
                        appears or is brought before a court, he may be released on bail by a police
                        officer of or above the rank of sergeant or by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 93(1) is expressly stated to be subject to s 95(1). In
                    contrast, s 97(1) of the CPC 2010, which sets out the High
                    Court’s powers to grant or vary bail, is not subject to s 95(1).
                    Section 97(1) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether there is an appeal against conviction or not, the High Court may
                        grant bail to any accused before it, release him on personal bond or vary
                        the amount or conditions of the bail or personal bond required by a police
                        officer or a Subordinate Court, and impose such other conditions for the
                        bail or personal bond as it thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus,the second question before this court was whether s 97(1) is
                    subject to s 95(1)(a) such that the High Court has no power to grant bail
                    to an accused that comes within s 95(1)(a), or whether s 97(1) is
                    outside s 95(1)(a) such that the High Court’s power to grant bail is
                    not restrained by s 95(1)(a). In <em>Selvamsylvester</em>, the High Court considered the relationship
                    between ss 352(1) and 354(1) of the old CPC, which are the predecessor
                    provisions to ss 93(1) and 95 of the CPC 2010, and s 97(1) of the
                    CPC 2010 respectively. Section 354(1) of the old CPC states
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The High Court may, in any case whether there is an appeal on conviction
                        or not, direct that any person shall be admitted to bail or that the bail
                        required by a police officer or Magistrate’s Court or District Court
                        shall be reduced or increased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Selvamsylvester</em>, Kan J expressed the
                    view that a harmonious reading of ss 352(1) and 354(1) dictated that the
                    latter should be read subject to the former, that is, s 352(1)
                    circumscribed both the High Court’s and the Subordinate Court’s
                    power to grant bail (at [8] and [9]). However, Kan J nonetheless held that the
                    relationship between ss 352(1) and 354 was not conclusively settled and
                    therefore dealt with the case on the assumption that the prohibition in
                    s 352(1) against releasing certain accused persons on bail did not extend
                    to the High Court (at [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In contrast, the position taken by the Malaysian
                    Courts is clear: the prohibition against granting bail in the Malaysian
                    equivalent of s 352(1) applies only to the Subordinate Court and not also
                    to the High Court (See <em>Re K S Menon</em> [1946]
                    1 MLJ 49; <em>PP v Shanmugam</em> [1971]
                    1 MLJ 283; <em>PP v Dato Balwant Singh</em>
                    [2002] 4 MLJ 427). The same position has been taken in India (See
                        <em>Nga San Htwa</em> (1927) I.L.R. 5 Ran 276;
                        <em>King Emperor v Joglekar</em> AIR 1931 All 504;
                        <em>Gurcharan Singh and others v State</em> [1978]
                    SCC 41). Further, in Tan Yock Lin, <em>Criminal
                        Procedure</em> (Butterworths, 2010), Chapter X, Professor Tan Yock Lin
                    argues that s 351 of the old CPC (the predecessor to s 92 of the
                    CPC 2010) and s 352 of the old CPC (the predecessor to ss 93 and
                    95 of the CPC 2010), dealing with bail in the case of bailable and
                    non-bailable offences respectively, should apply only to the Subordinate Court
                    and not to the High Court. He wrote that the consequences of construing these
                    provisions to apply to the High Court would be awkward, if not absurd, for two
                    reasons. First, (at para 602):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">section 352 imposes a general prohibition on granting bail where the
                        offence carries either the death penalty or life imprisonment. It would not
                        be right to impose any such prohibition on the High Court’s power to
                        grant bail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Second, (at para 603):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]he structure ... in which these bail provisions are found is further
                        argument that the High Court’s power to grant bail is outside these
                        sections. Thus, section 352(4) and section 354(2) cover essentially the same
                        ground. The former states that: ‘Any court may at any stage of any
                        proceeding under this Code cause any person who has been released under
                        [section 352] to be arrested and may commit him to custody.’ The
                        latter states that: ‘The High Court may at any stage of any proceeding
                        under this Code cause any person who has been released under
                        [section 354] to be arrested and may commit him to custody.’ If
                        section 352(4) included the High Court, section 354(2) would be somewhat
                        superfluous.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The language of ss 352(4) and 354(2) of the old CPC has largely
                    been preserved in ss 93(5) and 97(2) of the CPC 2010 respectively. In
                    support of Professor Tan’s position, Professor Chandra Mohan has argued
                    that the mention of the High Court in only s 354 and not ss 351 and
                    352 must be deliberate and hence subject to the <em>expressio
                        unius est exclusio alterius</em> rule of interpretation (Chandra
                    Mohan, “The High Court’s Latest Bail Decision: Overdue for 50
                    Years?” Law Gazette, May 2006(5)). I am in full agreement with these
                    views.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Apart from the above arguments against applying
                    s 352 of the old CPC to the High Court, there are further reasons for not
                    construing ss 93 and 95 of the CPC 2010 as applying to the High Court.
                    Under the old CPC, if s 352(1) applies to the High Court, then the
                    Subordinate Court and the High Court would not be able to grant bail only in the
                    limited instances where there appear reasonable grounds for believing that an
                    accused is guilty of an offence punishable with death or life imprisonment. The
                    courts would continue to retain some measure of discretion in the determination
                    of whether the “reasonable grounds” threshold is crossed. In
                    contrast, the newly worded s 95(1)(a) of the CPC 2010 is such that if
                    that provision also applies to the High Court, then bail would be totally
                    prohibited once the Prosecution decides to charge an accused with an offence
                    falling within s 95(1)(a), and the discretion of any court totally ousted.
                    That cannot be the intention of Parliament because such a drastic change in the
                    law will require clear and express Parliamentary language. Since s 93
                    provides that the court has power to grant bail save in the instances covered by
                    s 95(1), there would have been no need for s 97(1) if the High
                    Court’s powers are also subject to s 95(1). Section 97(1), which
                    states that “the High Court may grant bail to any accused before
                    it”, must mean what it says. It means that the High Court can grant bail
                    even to accused persons charged with offences falling within
                    s 95(1)(a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     For the above reasons, I am of the view that
                    ss 93 and 95 of the CPC 2010 apply only to the Subordinate Court but
                    not to the High Court. In the instant case, the learned DPP indicated that he
                    had no objection if the terms of the provisional bail are extended. I thus
                    ordered accordingly.</p>
