Having considered the parties’ closing submissions after the trial, I found Mr Lim guilty of the charge and convicted him accordingly. Having further considered the parties’ sentencing positions, I imposed on Mr Lim life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

</div> I shall discuss this in more detail later. For now, it suffices to state that the dispute related to Mr Lim’s claim (only raised during his testimony) that during the recording of Q28 of the statement, SSS Phang showed him the physical exhibits, including the Drug Exhibits. However, the Prosecution took the position that, based on the evidence of SSS Phang, only digital photographs of the exhibits, including digital photographs of the Drug Exhibits, had been shown to Mr Lim. In turn, this dispute went towards the issue of whether the chain of custody of the Drug Exhibits had been established by the Prosecution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Putting aside the dispute regarding Q28, in these 14 statements, Mr Lim consistently admitted that all the exhibits recovered from the black luggage bag in Room 603, including the Drug Exhibits, were in his possession. Mr Lim explained that he had an arrangement with one Malaysian, whom he referred to as “Boss”, to collect and deliver drugs for “Boss” and that he was waiting for instructions from “Boss” on who to pass the drugs to. “Boss” had offered him this arrangement to help clear an online betting debt of $50,000 owed by Mr Lim to “Boss”. More significantly, Mr Lim admitted that he knew that the Drug Exhibits contained “Ice” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the street name for methamphetamine), which he also referred to as “Cold” or “Leng”.

He contacted “Boss” through WeChat, with the number belonging to “Boss” saved as “boyboy7799”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Mr Lim’s main defence, however, was that he acted under duress. After working for “Boss” for about a month to pay off his gambling debt, Mr Lim no longer wanted to work for “Boss”. He felt that it was dangerous to do so. Also, at the time, Ms Chee found out she was pregnant with their child. On 7 August 2020, he decided to go into hiding with Ms Chee at the Hotel. He abandoned the Car (which was a rental car he had been using for drug collections and deliveries). He stopped replying to text messages from “Boss”, and stopped picking up calls from “Boss”. However, one packet of drugs belonging to “Boss”, either A1B1A <span class="font-italic">or </span>A1B1B, remained in the Car. Three other packets of drugs belonging to “Boss” remained with Mr Lim; these were either A1B1A <span class="font-italic">or</span> A1B1B, A1B2A and A1C1A.

The defence may suggest that at one or more stages, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the chain of custody may have been broken. If there is a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the drug exhibits, the Prosecution’s burden will not be discharged. That said, as pointed out by the Court of Appeal at [41] of <span class="font-italic">Affandi</span>, speculative arguments about the possibility of contamination are insufficient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Moving on, by s 94 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“Penal Code”), a general defence is accorded to a person compelled by threats to act.

I note that, in any event, on the basis that Mr Lim admitted to possession and knowledge of the Drugs, by s 17(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the MDA, Mr Lim, by being in possession of more than 25g of methamphetamine, is presumed to have had the Drug Exhibits in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.

Thereafter, none of those who were present with Insp Tay during various points within the Relevant Period recalled seeing Insp Tay carry the Black Duffle Bag, especially at the Store and at the Unit. To elaborate, Sgt Yogaraj was at the Hotel and the Store, but he said that after he passed the Black Duffle Bag to Insp Tay in Room 603, he did not see what Insp Tay did with it. He did not notice Insp Tay carrying it.

According to Mr Lim, Insp Tay was not carrying the Black Duffle Bag when they were in the lift to go up to the Store at Storhub. Also, he did not see the Black Duffle Bag in the lift on the way down. He did not see the Black Duffle Bag after he alighted the CNB car to go up the lift to the Unit, and when he went back down to the car. On all four occasions, he shared the lift with Insp Tay. Further, in the course of the recording of the third contemporaneous statement, as clearly recorded at Q28 and Q47, he was shown “the item[s]” by SSS Phang. This stood in sharp contrast with Q27, Q43 and Q48, where SSS Phang expressly recorded that Mr Lim was shown the “digital photo[s]”. Therefore, it was clear that Insp Tay was not in custody of the Drug Exhibits at all times during the Relevant Period.

At the outset, a very important point to be made is that despite all of Mr Lim’s contentions that Insp Tay was <span class="font-italic">not </span>in custody of the Black Duffle Bag throughout the Relevant Period, there was no suggestion whatsoever that the case exhibits, including the Drug Exhibits as analysed by HSA, were not those personally packed by Mr Lim into the black luggage bag prior to the arrest. In other words, as the Prosecution pointed out, the <span class="font-italic">identity </span>of the Drug Exhibits was simply not put in issue. When shown the photographs marked as P35 to P66 showing <span class="font-italic">all</span> the exhibits seized from Room 603, Mr Lim agreed that they belonged to him.

If someone had opened the car boot of the CNB car during the recording of the third contemporaneous statement by SSS Phang, Insp Tay said that he would have noticed it. In this regard, some support for his evidence is found by way of SSS Phang’s account; SSS Phang said that he only showed Mr Lim digital photographs of the Drug Exhibits, and not the physical exhibits. I shall return to this later. At this juncture, I should state that it was of some concern to me that Insp Tay did not set out the details of how he remained in custody of the Black Duffle Bag in his conditioned statement of 27 May 2022. Conditioned statements are prepared for the purpose of setting out a witness’ evidence for the trial. In relation to the chain of custody, the conditioned statements of the relevant CNB officers should provide <span class="font-italic">sufficient </span>details on the movement of drug exhibits. Instead, Insp Tay only stated how he took over custody of the Black Duffle Bag at 1.08am, and how he then relinquished control of it at 6.15am, leaving the details to be filled during his examination-in-chief. This was not entirely satisfactory. That said, the further details provided by Insp Tay during his examination-in-chief were <span class="font-italic">not </span>inconsistent with the contents of Insp Tay’s conditioned statement. Having weighed the whole of Insp Tay’s evidence, and having considered Mr Lim’s contentions, I accepted that Insp Tay’s account remained reliable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Turning to the evidence of the other CNB officers, the fact that they were unable to recall that Insp Tay was the one carrying the Black Duffle Bag, in my view, was neutral, and did not detract from the reliability of Insp Tay’s testimony. At different points during the operation, the CNB officers were assigned to different tasks and roles. I did not find it surprising that <span class="font-italic">none </span>of them were able to shed light on the movement of the Black Duffle Bag, save for Insp Tay, who was tasked to take custody of the seized exhibits. I was also mindful that, by the time of the trial, almost three years had passed since the events of that early morning. More importantly, as the Prosecution pertinently observed, it was significant that <span class="font-italic">none </span>of the other CNB officers claimed that it was <span class="font-italic">any</span> other CNB officer, and not Insp Tay, who was tasked with this aspect of the operation. Also, none of them observed any other CNB officer carrying the Black Duffle Bag.

</div> Such evidence, obviously, would have been detrimental to the Prosecution’s case. However, there was nothing to contradict Insp Tay’s account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Turning to Mr Lim’s evidence, I did not give much weight on his recollection of the events. The CNB officers did not draw Mr Lim’s attention to the Black Duffle Bag. In the main, Mr Lim stated that he did not know who was carrying the bag, and he did not recall seeing the bag at the various locations he was located to. In fact, initially, Mr Lim claimed that he saw the CNB officers packing the Drugs into a bag that did not look the same as the standard CNB black operations duffle bag shown to him in court. Later, he agreed that the drugs could have been packed into such a bag. In relation to the Black Duffle Bag, his testimony, in my view, was imprecise, and not entirely reliable. It also revealed that he could not have been paying much attention to these details of the operation that morning.

</div> More importantly, it seemed to me that, given the space constraints in the back seats of the CNB car, there was little reason for SSS Phang to choose to selectively show Mr Lim <span class="font-italic">some</span> physical exhibits (when the digital photographs of <span class="font-italic">all</span> physical exhibits were available to SSS Phang).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 This leaves me to deal with the testimonies of Mdm Cheng and Ms Lim. I did not consider their evidence to be accurate and was unable to accord much weight to the assertions. It was past 3.00am when Mr Lim was brought back to the Unit. Both of them were awoken from their sleep. As they conceded, they were worried. Understandably, they had a lot on their minds, having learnt that Mr Lim had been arrested by the CNB. It was also their first experience dealing with a team of CNB officers conducting a search of the premises. I accepted that they spoke to Insp Tay, and that if Insp Tay was carrying a black duffle bag, they <span class="font-italic">should</span> have been able to see it. However, their interactions with Insp Tay were brief, and there were other CNB officers moving around in their home at the time. Given their frames of mind, I did not consider it believable that either of them would have paid close attention to such a detail to be able testify, for certain, three years after that early morning, that Insp Tay was <span class="font-italic">not </span>carrying a black duffle bag while in the Unit.

To sum up, I was of the view that no doubt was raised as to the identity of any of the Drug Exhibits. Mr Lim’s challenges in relation to the custody of the Drug Exhibits at certain junctures during the Relevant Period were entirely speculative, and he failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Mr Lim was entitled to rely on the defence of duress </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I turn to the second issue. As summarised at [21] and [23] above, Mr Lim claimed that he wanted to stop working for “Boss”. On 10 August 2020, he came to know of certain threatening messages sent to him by “SoundsoFaiths Hurt”. On 8 and 9 August 2020, an unknown man also visited the Unit. Based on these, Mr Lim relied on s 94 of the Penal Code, claiming that he had acted under duress. The threats related to the burning down of the Unit (where Mdm Cheng and Ms Lim were residing), making Mr Lim “lie down” in hospital, and teaching Ms Lim a lesson for being “yaya” <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>arrogant.

The Prosecution submitted that the threatening messages only demanded that Mr Lim return the drugs and cash to “Boss”, <span class="font-italic">after </span>Mr Lim had gone missing and uncontactable without accounting for what belonged to “Boss”.

</div> In any event, it seemed illogical to me that, to account for the drugs, the only way Mr Lim could think of was to continue to deliver them. As the threats made related to the return of the drugs and moneys to “Boss”, I failed to see how Mr Lim could be entitled to rely on such threats for the <span class="font-italic">resumption</span> of drug collections and deliveries, and for taking possession of the Drug Exhibits for the purpose of trafficking. On this point, I also refer to my further discussion at [54] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Secondly, I deal with whether these were threats of instant death, or whether these were threats which would result in Mr Lim reasonably apprehending instant death to Mr Lim, Mdm Cheng or Ms Lim <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>see [29(c)]–[29(d)] above.

</div>
</div> In my view, the sixth message was neither a specific threat to cause anyone to suffer “instant death” nor was it one to cause Mr Lim to reasonably apprehend such harm befalling him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51  As for the fifth and seventh messages, they related to the burning of homes. “SoundsoFaiths Hurt” claimed that that he had experienced his “house” being “burnt” previously, and that it had caused his wife to leave him. While there was a reference to Mdm Cheng’s “house” being burnt, there was, however, no threat that someone would actually set the Unit on fire, or that such fire would be set under circumstances so as to cause “instant death” to Mr Lim, Mdm Cheng or Ms Lim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As for the eighth message, Mr Lim claimed that his understanding was that “SoundsoFaiths Hurt” had “nothing to lose”.

</div> However, there was really no threat that someone would kill Mr Lim. The references to “sit prison 17 yrs u think kena [s] 324” and “[o]nly 1 yr plus” pointed more towards acts of causing hurt or harm, rather than causing instant death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For completeness, I note that there were a number of messages referring to Ms Lim as “yaya” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>arrogant), and suggesting that she had to be taught a lesson.

</div>
</div> However, again, there was no specific threat giving rise to the level of a threat of instant death, or reasonably causing any apprehension of this. I should also add that <span class="font-italic">all</span> these threats were not “imminent, persistent and extreme” in nature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Thirdly, I deal with the question of whether Mr Lim had placed himself in that situation, so as to lose the right to invoke the defence (see [29(e)] above). As provided in Explanation 1 to s 94 of the Penal Code, an accused who, of his own accord, joins a criminal enterprise, is not entitled to the rely on the defence for criminal acts he is then compelled to do. Mr Lim admitted that when he started working for “Boss” sometime in the middle of July 2020, he did so willingly as he wanted to clear his gambling debt. He knew that “Boss” was involved in the drug trade, and previously, he had carried out drug deliveries for “Boss”. Based on the foregoing, I found that he was not entitled to rely on the defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Insofar as Mr Lim argued that he tried to leave the criminal enterprise, but that he was compelled to return to work for “Boss”, I had already stated my views that the threats made did not seek to coerce Mr Lim to continue working for “Boss”. They merely sought the return of items and cash belonging to “Boss”. Before Mr Lim collected the Drug Exhibits on 10 August 2020, so as to carry out further deliveries, there were no further threats for him to do so. Mr Lim’s explanation that he was bothered by the previous threats and thought the best way for him to account for the drugs to “Boss” did not make sense, and again, pointed towards a voluntary resumption of the activities (see [47] above). I explain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 When he resumed communications with “Boss” on 10 August 2020, Mr Lim did not tell “Boss” that he did not wish to continue working for him.

</div> By doing so, any reliance on the defence was precluded. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For all of the foregoing reasons, I found that Mr Lim was not able to avail himself of the defence of duress. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Verdict</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 To sum up, I found that the Prosecution had proved the charge against Mr Lim beyond a reasonable doubt.

Based on the evidence, I found that Mr Lim had proved on a balance of probabilities that his role in relation to the Drugs was that of a courier, in that he collected the Drugs and that he was merely waiting to deliver the Drugs on the instructions of “Boss”. In fact, this was also the Prosecution’s position.
