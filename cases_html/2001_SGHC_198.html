<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1 The issue in this appeal before me was whether the renewal and

service of an admiralty in rem writ should be allowed to stand when it is said that

certain background facts were reportedly not placed before the learned assistant registrar

when he granted the order to renew the said writ.

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2 The material facts as could be gathered from the affidavits filed in

this appeal and the chronology of events submitted by the parties’ respective counsel

can be summarised as follows.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3 The plaintiffs’ cargo, made up of about 996.736 metric tons of

RBD Palm Olein in bulk, shipped on board the defendants’ vessel M V Antares V was

reportedly damaged on 21 March 1997. Whatever claims the plaintiffs had against the

defendants arose on the same day and the limitation period under the applicable Hague

Rules being one year would have elapsed on 20 March 1998.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4 However, by agreement between parties the suit time was extended from

20 March 1998 to 20 June 1998. According to the defendants, the extension was granted on

the understanding that the plaintiffs would furnish them with certain documents which they

were then reportedly not in a position to provide.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5 The plaintiffs sought to obtain a further extension for the suit time

beyond 21 June 1998. Noting that the request contained in the plaintiffs’ letter

dated 9 June 1998 did not seem to have stirred any response, the plaintiffs wrote to the P

&amp; I Club on 15 June 1998 in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">We refer to our fax dated 9 June 1998. </p>
<p align="justify">We have not received your response. Our clients are left with no

  alternative but to commence proceedings against the carriers. This will include the arrest

  of the vessel to obtain security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6 Following the foregoing letter, on 19 June 1998 the plaintiffs’

solicitors wrote to the defendants advising them that they had appointed Mr Ajaib Haridass

of Messrs Haridass Ho &amp; Partners to be the arbitrator and asking the defendants

whether they were agreeable to the arbitrator nominated. The upshot was the

defendants’ P &amp; I Club replied on 22 June 1998 requesting the plaintiffs’

solicitors a copy of the contract which called for the appointment of a Singapore

arbitrator.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7 Insofar as is material, the said letter dated 22 June 1998 from P

&amp; I Club reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">We refer to previous exchanges of correspondence and have received from

  members a copy of your fax of 19 June 1998 wherein you advised that pursuant to the

  fixture note dated 1 March 1997, you have appointed Mr Ajaib Haridass of Haridass Ho &amp;

  Partners to be arbitrator.</p>
<p align="justify">Maybe you could forward to us a copy of the contract that called for

  the appointment of Singaporean arbitrator in order that we can consider whether one should

  be appointed on owner’s behalf (presumably sole arbitrator in the contract)?</p>
<p align="justify"><i>We are still interested in negotiating this claim with you, however,

  feel that the reports that you have sent to us and the documentation is inconclusive and,

  furthermore, the mathematics do not seem to agree.</i></p>
<p align="justify">We would like to see the full survey report to verify the exact

  amount of damaged cargo that was considered as total loss as there was a discrepancy

  between SGS figures and our own.</p>
<p align="justify">We would also be grateful to receive copies of the sale invoices that

  were sold down-graded. Even if the down-grading price is correct, your claim based on the

  difference between invoice value (US$647) and sale price (US$572) should equate to a loss

  based on 988 tons of US74,100.</p>
<p align="justify">Please could you provide these documents as soon as possible in order

  that we can consider this claim further.</p>
<p align="justify">[Highlight added.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8 In the meantime, having received no definite indication from the

defendants or the club on further extensions, the plaintiffs on 19 June 1998, a day before

the expiry of the deadline, caused to be issued a writ which their counsel characterized

as ‘protective’. The writ however was not served. The explanation provided by

the plaintiffs’ solicitors in this connection was that since the parties were intent

on proceeding with arbitration, the service of the writ was considered unnecessary. The

plaintiffs’ counsel averred in this regard (para 11 of the affidavit of D’Cruz

filed on 24 August 2000) that in view of the developments sketched out, they did not serve

the writ on the vessel although the said vessel called into Singapore on two occasions

after the writ was filed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9 In the following year ie, on 18 June 1999 the original writ of

summons expired and the plaintiffs then applied to court and obtained an order renewing

the writ for a further period of 12 months from 19 June 1999.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10 To complete the picture, I should add here that during the period

between 19 June 1998 and 16 June 2000, the plaintiffs’ solicitors had been

corresponding with the defendants’ P &amp; I Club on the issue of security, legal

proceedings and arbitration. In March 1999, the plaintiffs through their solicitors

broached the idea of utilising the court process rather than arbitration. In this regard,

the letter written by the plaintiffs’ solicitors dated 9 March 1999 bears

reproduction. It reads:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">We refer to our fax of 1 September 1998 and your fax of 3 September

  1998.</p>
<p align="justify">The matter has gone into sleep due to an oversight. We would appreciate

  if you could forward to us the letter of undertaking that you had agreed to put up. On

  another note, please confirm whether you wish to appoint solicitors to accept service of

  process in lieu of arbitration. Alternatively, you may wish to try to resolve our

  clients’ claim in order to save costs since the amount involved is modest.</p>
<p align="justify">We look forward to your response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11 The reply from the P &amp; I Club dated 11 March 1999 – on

which more will be heard later was not altogether negative and it reads thus:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Thank you for your fax message of 9 March 1999 and firstly wish to

  confirm that solicitors should be instructed on the Club and members’ behalf.</p>
<p align="justify">We firstly wish however to see copies of the claims documents as

  requested in our fax of 3 September 1998.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12 As the events progressed, the above letter was followed by a letter

of undertaking by the P &amp; I Club on 9 September 1999. Insofar as is material, the

following segments of the undertaking are of significance:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

  otherwise detaining any other ships belonging to her Owners of the said m.v. "ANTARES

<p align="justify">Dated this 9<sup>th</sup> day of September 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">[Highlight added.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13 Nearly nine months after the letter of undertaking was provided by

the defendants’ P &amp; I Club, the defendants’ solicitors entered the scene.

The upshot was that there was an application by the defendants on 20 July 2000, in the

main, to set aside the order of court dated 18 June 1999 which allowed the writ to be

renewed for a further period of 12 months from 19 June 1999 and for the return and

cancellation of the letter of undertaking issued by the P &amp; I Club on 9 September

1999.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14 The defendants prevailed in the first instance before the senior

assistant registrar based on the defendants’ arguments that the writ had not been

served on the defendants’ vessel during its initial validity period, although the

subject vessel called into Singapore on two occasions and that when the plaintiffs applied

to court for the renewal of the writ, plaintiffs’ counsel did not disclose to the

court that the vessel had in fact called into Singapore twice. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15 The plaintiffs appealed. The arguments advanced by the respective

counsel in the appeal before me can be summarised in the following terms.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Plaintiffs’/appellants’ arguments</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16 The plaintiffs caused to be issued the protective writ against the

defendants for two reasons: first to preserve their claim against the time-bar and

secondly to enable the plaintiffs to negotiate and obtain security. After issuing the writ

on 19 June 1998, the plaintiffs did not attempt to serve the writ since they had taken

steps to commence arbitration proceedings as they were entitled to, under the terms of the

charterparty.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17 Furthermore, during the interim period between 19 June 1998 and 16

June 2000, the plaintiffs’ solicitors had been corresponding with the

defendants’ P &amp; I Club on various issues including security, legal proceedings

and arbitration. On 11 March 1999, the defendants, through their P &amp; I Club, confirmed

that they would be appointing solicitors to accept service of process. The plaintiffs

therefore took the view, not unreasonably, that they need not serve the writ directly on

the vessel as this would negate the agreement reached with the defendants’ P &amp; I

Club. However, since the defendants had not appointed solicitors to accept service of the

writ even by 18 June 1999, it became necessary for them to renew the writ for a further

period.</p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Defendants’/respondents’ arguments</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18 The contentions of the defendants are best stated in their

counsel’s own words. Paragraphs 11 to 13 of his submission read as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">11. The Plaintiffs in any event failed to disclose in their affidavit

  for renewal of the Writ, anything about the arbitration proceedings or how it allegedly

  affected their judgment not to take steps to serve the Writ on the "ANTARES V".

  The Defendants maintain that this was non disclosure of a material fact in the ex-parte

  application to renew the Writ, if the Plaintiffs’ allegations were true, which is

  denied.</p>
<p align="justify">12. Further, the Plaintiffs had failed to disclose in their affidavit

  for the renewal of the Writ, the following material facts:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) The Plaintiffs’ claim would be time barred but for the renewal

    of the Writ.</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) That the Plaintiffs had not taken any steps to serve the Writ on

    the "ANTARES V" during the initial 12 months validity period of the Writ, and if

    they had done so, there were two occasions on which the vessel had called at Singapore

    during this period providing ample opportunity to serve the Writ.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">13. The law is well established that a Plaintiff should take steps to

  serve an admiralty writ by keeping a shipwatch on the Defendant vessel from the time of

  issuing the writ to effect service within the initial validity period of the writ and

  unless this was done and the Defendant vessels had not called within the jurisdiction,

  there is no good reason to renew the writ. The law is well established that a renewal of a

  writ would not normally be granted, if the effect of it would be to deprive the Defendant

  of suit time limitation.</p>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Findings and conclusion</p></b></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19 A preliminary aspect requires mention first. In order to parry a

criticism as to why the defendants took more than 9 months since the date of the letter of

undertaking, to take out the application to set aside the writ, the defendants’

counsel hastened to explain that although his firm’s name was mentioned in the letter

of undertaking given by the P &amp; I Club on 9 September 1999, his firm was in fact not

aware of it until the writ was served on them on 16 June 2000. This assertion, to use a

less formal expression, did not cut much ice with me. In my view, if what the counsel said

was correct, then it would appear that the Club themselves had been extremely leisurely

over the defendants’ legal rights leading me to infer that time element which they

were attempting to highlight in this appeal was the least of their concerns.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20 Reverting to the issues before me, I was mindful first of all, of

the principles enunciated by the House of Lords in <i><b>The "Myrto"</b></i>

[1987] AC 597 as to the manner in which courts ought to exercise their discretion when

deciding whether the validity of a writ should be extended. In short, the law as stated by

the law lords was that it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to serve the writ promptly;

there must be a good reason for the grant of an extension; and that a ‘good

reason’ cannot be defined and would depend on the circumstances of each case.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21 The local decision of <i><b>The Lircay</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10962&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1997] 2 SLR 669</a>

echoed the same principle. In <i><b>The Lircay</b></i>, the court further observed at page

674G-H:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In the end, it was the exercise of <i>discretion</i> by the court which

  determined whether the writ was to be extended. In the exercise of that <i>discretion</i>

  – <i>discretion</i> that was undefined – the judge was entitled to have regard

  to the balance of <i>hardship</i> between the parties as a relevant matter to be taken

  into account in extending the writ’s validity on an <i>ex parte</i> application and

  further that in doing so, the court may well need to consider whether allowing an

  extension will cause <i>prejudice</i> to the defendants in all the circumstances of the

  case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22 In <i><b>The Lircay</b></i> the court also dealt with the issue of

material non-disclosure in the affidavit supporting the application for renewal of the

writ. The Court observed that while a very stringent requirement for full disclosure had

been laid down by the courts over the years in relation to Anton Piller orders, this was

not the case for other ex-parte applications. And the Court went on to hold that the

claimants’ non-disclosure of an additional reason, i.e. the agreement to defer

service, was not fatal to the renewal of the writ in all the circumstances of the case.

The court also held in that case that since the claimants’ application for renewal of

the writ was commenced and granted before the expiry of the validity of the writ, although

after the period of limitation had expired, the defendants did not have any accrued right

of limitation.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23 Having reviewed the events chronicled in the parties’

submissions and affidavits, I came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs had justifiable

and good reasons for not serving the writ until they had received communication from the

defendants that their solicitors would accept service of process. One of the

defendants’ main contentions was that the plaintiffs’ failure to serve the writ

on the vessel when it called at Singapore on two occasions within the first period of its

validity (i.e. between 19 June 1998 and 18 June 1999), precluded them from seeking a

further renewal of the writ. In my determination, although the authorities lay stress on

the aspect that the plaintiffs should have taken steps to serve the writ by keeping a

shipwatch on the defendants’ vessel during the initial validity period of the writ,

the authorities referred to, equally emphasize that the overriding consideration for the

courts in determining issues of this nature must be the balance of justice between the

parties and that circumstances peculiar to each case must be taken into account as well.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24 In the case at hand, first of all when the plaintiffs suggested the

idea of arbitration, the defendants were not inimical to the proposal. Secondly, when the

plaintiffs suggested negotiated settlement or court process in lieu of arbitration, the

defendants again did not raise any objection. This was evident from the defendants’ P

&amp; I Club’s letter of 11 March 1999 – in reply to the plaintiffs’

solicitors’ letter of 9 March 1999 - where they said that solicitors should be

instructed on the defendants’ and the P &amp; I Club’s behalf although

regrettably such appointment did not take place for quite a while. The nomination of

solicitors was further expressly stated in the P &amp; I Club in their letter of

undertaking of 9 September 1999. From all the correspondence exchanged between the

parties, one feature was very clear, that was, that parties were earnestly engaged in

negotiations, albeit sporadically, during the material time. At any rate, in my view

inasmuch as the defendants’ P &amp; I Club had been demonstrably laid back in

relation to the time element, the defendants could not be said to have suffered prejudice

in respect of the benefit of the limitation period since (as was also the case in <i><b>The

Lircay</b></i>) no such benefit had yet accrued to the defendants, given that the

application to renew the validity of the writ was made before it expired. Another

inescapable aspect of the case was that the defendants’ P &amp; I Club could not have

been blind-sided to the fact that the writ must have been renewed beyond the extension

period granted by them. Had it not been for such an assumption and had it not been for the

P &amp; I Club’s desire to reach a negotiated settlement, the Club would not have

provided the letter of undertaking on 9 September 1999. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25 I was also mindful that before March 1999, the vessel had called

into Singapore twice. The body of learning referred to me, no doubt underscores the

principle that just because negotiations were afoot and in train, they by themselves,

would not constitute a good reason to extend the period of validity of a writ. In <i><b>Waddon

v Whitecroft-Scovill Ltd</b></i> [1988] 1 All ER 996, the House of Lords reiterated the

rule that the showing of a good reason for failure to serve the writ during its original

period of validity, was a necessary step for the grant of an extension. Although it has

been said that negotiations between the parties alone do not amount to good reason to

extend the period of validity of the writ and that the plaintiffs should protect his

position by issuing as well as serving the writ on the defendants, I do not think that

this is meant to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner. The fact is that an attempt

on the plaintiffs’ part to serve the writ would in all likelihood have ruined the

prospects of settlement, or at least would have been a set-back to negotiation process.

The court should therefore take into account all the circumstances which may alter the

complexion of each case. In <i><b>Kun Kay Hong v Tan Teo Huat</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=2410&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1985] 1 MLJ 404</a>,

the Singapore Court of Appeal held that the request by the solicitors’ underwriters

to the plaintiff’s solicitors to postpone service pending investigations did amount

to good reasons for not serving the writ during its validity period. The authorities also

indicate that the defendants’ conduct in causing or contributing to the delay may be

taken into account by the court in exercising its discretion in such cases. All said, at

the end of the day the overriding consideration for the courts, as mentioned by me earlier

must be the balance of justice between the parties. This point seems to have received

judicial approval in <i><b>Jones v Jones &amp; Anor </b></i>[1970] 2 QB 576 where Sachs LJ

at 587C commented that the climate of opinion is ‘moving more towards an

ascertainment of how lies the balance of justice between the parties’.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26 In the circumstances, having considered all the learning referred to

me by the defendants’ counsel including the principles articulated by the courts in <i><b>The

Berny</b></i> [1979] 1 QB 80, <i><b>The "Big Beacher"</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=2374&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1984] 2 MLJ 4</a>, <i><b>The

"Union Hodeidah"</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=3064&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1987] 2 MLJ 561</a>, <i><b>The Official Receiver,

Liquidator of Jason Textile Industries Pte Ltd v QBE Insurance (International) Ltd </b></i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=3329&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1989] 1 MLJ 1</a> and <i><b>Saris v Westminster Transports SA</b></i> <i><b>And</b></i> <i><b>Kestrel

Marine Ltd</b></i> [1994] 1 LLR 115, I concluded that the plaintiffs had amply satisfied

the court with sufficiently good reason for not serving the writ during its initial

validity. In my view, the fact of the negotiations between the parties and the way P &amp;

I Club conducted their correspondence most certainly swung the balance of justice in the

plaintiffs’ favour. Given the facts, the plaintiffs’ omission to state the

background facts in their affidavit in support of their application to renew the validity

of the writ, was not in my opinion fatal to their application. Next, their omission to

mention the aspect of the vessel calling into Singapore during the initial validity period

as well as their lapse in not making reference to the contemplated arbitral steps in their

affidavit for renewal, were not such as to warrant the setting aside of the renewal

granted. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27 Consequently, the plaintiffs’ appeal was allowed and the order

of court dated 13 October 2000 was set aside. The costs of the appeal and costs below was

fixed at $5,000 payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs.</p>
