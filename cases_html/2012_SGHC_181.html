<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the Public Prosecutor
                    against the sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment imposed on Terrance
                    Tan Khoon Shan (“the Respondent”) by the District Judge
                    (“the DJ”) for offences committed under s 41(<em>c</em>) of the Telecommunications Act (Cap 323, 2000 Rev Ed)
                    (“the TA”). The offences were punishable under s 65 of the
                    TA. The Respondent had pleaded guilty to and was convicted of 60 charges under
                        s 41(<em>c</em>) of the TA. Another 557 similar
                    charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (see
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Terrance Tan Khoon Shan</em>
                    [2012] SGDC 183). As of the time of the appeal, the Respondent was serving his
                    sentence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal,
                    I allowed the Public Prosecutor’s appeal and enhanced the imprisonment
                    term imposed on the Respondent to 30 months’ imprisonment. I now set out
                    the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       OpenNet Private Limited
                    (“OpenNet”), the victim in this case, was a provider of
                    telecommunications services. It was awarded a contract by the Infocomm
                    Development Authority of Singapore to build, manage and operate a nationwide
                    all-fibre platform to provide ultra-high speed internet access to end users
                    through a fibre optic platform. Pursuant to this, OpenNet engaged Singapore
                    Telecommunications Limited (“Singtel”) as a key contractor to lay
                    the fibre optic cables to Fibre Splicing Boxes (“FSBs”) located at
                    various locations within each block of Housing and Development Board
                    (“HDB”) flats in Singapore. The FSBs located at the telephone
                    risers were secured by a locking mechanism operated by a key. The keys were left
                    on top of the FSBs to facilitate the contractors’ works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Respondent was an ex-employee of Singtel. He
                    used to work at Singtel as an Engineering Officer in the “Fibre to the
                    Home” project, but his employment was terminated for poor work
                    performance on 21 September 2010 just over a year after he was employed.
                    Aggrieved by his dismissal, the Respondent decided to sabotage OpenNet’s
                    activities to cause trouble for his ex-supervisors at Singtel by damaging FSBs
                    so that they would have to attend to subscribers’ complaints for
                    consequential loss of internet access and disruption of
                connectivity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In early 2011, the Respondent found a set of
                    keys on top of a FSB inside a telephone riser in a block of HDB flats in
                        Clementi.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> From late March 2011, he began damaging FSBs
                    by using the keys to unlock each FSB and cutting the fibre optic cables inside
                    using a wire cutter. Disruption of service to all the subscribers of OpenNet was
                    caused to all the HDB flats that were served by that FSB. Over a period of
                    slightly more than a month, the Respondent damaged a total of 617 FSBs by
                    repeating these acts in 12 housing estates across Singapore, namely, Clementi,
                    Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh, Yishun, Sembawang, Bishan, Jurong, Sengkang, Toh Guan,
                    Compassvale, Serangoon Central and Hougang. The monetary damage suffered by
                    OpenNet as a result amounted to $185,820.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After hearing submissions on the aggravating
                    factors and proposed benchmark, the mitigation plea and conducting a Newton
                    hearing to ascertain the Respondent’s state of mind when he committed the
                    offences, the DJ sentenced the Respondent to three months’ imprisonment
                    for each of the charges proceeded with and ordered five sentences to run
                    consecutively. The Respondent was thus sentenced to a total of 15 months’
                    imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In her Grounds of Decision (“GD”),
                    the DJ explained that she preferred the diagnosis of Dr Jayaraman Hariram
                    (“Dr Hariram”), Consultant Psychiatrist with the Institute of
                    Mental Health, over that of Dr Lim Yun Chin (“Dr Lim”),
                    Consultant Psychiatrist with Raffles Hospital<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. Both Dr Hariram and Dr Lim
                    examined the Respondent. Dr Hariram found that the Respondent did not
                    suffer from depression but instead suffered from an adjustment disorder after
                    his dismissal from Singtel, and he found this to have been a contributing factor
                    for the Respondent’s state of mind and conduct when he was committing the
                    offences (see GD at [13] and [14]). Dr Hariram also noted that the
                    Respondent was motivated by revenge when he committed the offences (see GD at
                    [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The DJ, in sentencing the Respondent, noted the
                    Public Prosecutor’s call for a lengthy custodial term, and took into
                    consideration the following factors in deciding on the appropriate sentence to
                    be imposed: the Respondent’s early plea of guilt and cooperation with the
                    police, his guilt and remorse indicated by his admission that he would have
                    continued on his destructive path of revenge had he not been found out, his lack
                    of thought of the consequences of his offences given that his only intention was
                    to create more problems for his ex-supervisors, his lack of criminal mind, his
                    lack of financial benefit from his acts, the serious nature of his crime and
                    inconvenience and damage caused, his low probability of re-offending and that
                    the overall sentence imposed should not be crushing (see GD at [19] and
                    [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Public Prosecutor’s appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The arguments of the Public Prosecutor before
                    this court could be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     deterrence was the predominant
                        sentencing consideration in this case and insufficient weight had been given
                        to it;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     insufficient weight had been given to the aggravating factors such as the
                        fact that the offences were premeditated and motivated by revenge, the
                        serious nature of the offences and the substantial extent of damage caused,
                        the Respondent’s persistence in the destructive acts and the numerous
                        criminal acts committed;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     undue weight had been given to the mitigating factors such
                        as the lack of financial benefit to the Respondent, his remorse and low
                        probability of reoffending, the adjustment disorder affecting the
                        Respondent’s then mental condition and perceiving his acts as naive
                        and immature; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     the sentence imposed by the DJ was manifestly inadequate and did not
                        reflect the totality of the Respondent’s conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Public Prosecutor submitted that the
                    appropriate sentence should be seven to eight months’ imprisonment
                    per charge with five consecutive sentences amounting to a total of 35 to 40
                    months’ imprisonment. It argued that a higher imprisonment term per charge
                    would reflect the premeditated and wilful nature of the offence, the significant
                    financial loss caused and the need to protect the public interest in having a
                    sound and reliable telecommunications infrastructure free from deliberate
                    sabotage. In the alternative, it submitted that if the sentence of three
                    months’ imprisonment per charge was upheld, at least 12 sentences
                    should run consecutively. This would amount to a total of 36 months’
                    imprisonment for the Respondent which would be appropriate for the large number
                    of offences he had committed, given the cumulative aggravating circumstances
                    present and the serious nature of the offences committed threatening public
                    interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Respondent’s reply</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Counsel for the Respondent argued that the
                    sentence imposed by the DJ was not manifestly inadequate and that it should be
                    upheld. His arguments could be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Public Prosecutor’s
                        primary and alternative methods of calculating the appropriate sentence were
                        mechanistic;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Public Prosecutor’s submission that 12 sentences should run
                        consecutively was without legal basis; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Public Prosecutor’s proposed overall
                        sentence was crushing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Relevant sentencing principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Where offences committed are animated by a
                    desire to seek revenge, I was of the view that the proper principle of
                    punishment to apply is that of retribution and general deterrence. In this case,
                    the DJ neither discussed nor expressly identified any sentencing principle which
                    formed the basis of the sentence she imposed on the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The desire in a person to avenge a wrong is a
                    human failing that society must not encourage, as it would lead him to take the
                    law into his own hands. It can lead to vigilante justice and is inimical to the
                    maintenance of law and order, as such, it must be suppressed for the greater
                    good. In the present case, the Respondent’s acts were motivated by nothing
                    more than the desire to cause material damage to the operations of OpenNet,
                    without any concern for the consequences of his acts to the public. Criminal
                    acts animated by revenge are properly punished on the principle of retribution,
                    taking into account the actual harm caused to the victims, which in this case
                    would include the users of OpenNet’s high-speed cable
                network.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The nature of the offence also calls for
                    general deterrence. We now live in a digital age. High-speed internet access
                    using the medium of fibre optics is the preferred mode of internet communication
                    for all Singaporeans, whether it is for business, finance, investments,
                    entertainment or communications. OpenNet, the victim, has been charged to
                    provide this service to the public. There is therefore a strong public interest
                    in protecting the reliability and security of Singapore’s
                    telecommunications system, which is a public good. Any damage to the system
                    would not only cause material damage and inconvenience to OpenNet but may also
                    result in similar inconvenience and in some cases, material damage, to all the
                    affected subscribers and users of its cable network. OpenNet’s cable
                    network should be regarded as a public good, and any intentional damage to or
                    destruction of public goods is punishable above and beyond that for damaging or
                    destroying private property which has no impact on the larger public interest.
                    The courts must impose punishments to deter such criminal acts: see <em>Public Prosecutor v Law Aik </em><em>Meng</em> [2007] 2 SLR 814 at [24(d)]. The fibre optics network
                    installed here was commissioned by the Singapore government and is a key part of
                    the government’s initiative to enable all Singaporeans to connect,
                    transact and interact with each other, amongst others, in a wired nation. The
                    government’s policy to digitally enable the entire nation to facilitate
                    and support this has been severely hindered by the Respondent’s deliberate
                    vengeful actions in cutting the fibre optic cables. Of relevance is
                    Parliament’s expressed intention for s 41 of the TA to
                    “protect the … public telecommunication licensee [OpenNet here]
                    from damage if someone in the course of trying to intercept messages or to
                    commit mischief damages or tampers with the installation or plant”: see
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Reports</em> (23 November 2009) vol 71 at col 478 (Mr Yeo
                    Cheow Tong, Minister for Communications and Information Technology). The
                    seriousness of the deliberate intention to cause mischief and to wreak
                    destruction on the telecommunications system installed for the benefit of the
                    public warranted a deterrent sentence in the circumstances. Regard may also be
                    had to the fact that these offences were easily committed by simply using a wire
                    cutter, but were not easily detected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Additionally, the Respondent’s conduct
                    in this case was clearly planned and extremely reckless. He had committed his
                    string of destructive acts on 617 FSBs by methodically repeating the same act of
                    unlocking the FSBs and using a wire cutter to cut the fibre optic cables on 617
                    separate occasions, consequently inconveniencing numerous households in 12
                    housing estates over Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In the present case, the DJ was wrong to hold
                    that the mitigating factors prevailed against the aggravating factors. Apart
                    from the monetary damage of $185,820.00 and also reputational damage caused to
                    OpenNet, frustration and inconvenience would have been caused to the large
                    number of households spread across 12 housing estates which had found their
                    high-speed internet access disrupted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Given the huge number of offences of mischief,
                    617 in total, committed by the Respondent over a period of slightly more than a
                    month, from 31 March 2011 to 4 May 2011, the correct approach for the
                    court to adopt in sentencing the Respondent is not to consider the sentence for
                    each charge and then to multiply it with the number of charges on which he was
                    convicted. This approach is not appropriate as the totality of the sentence
                    would then depend on how many charges the Public Prosecutor decides to have
                    tried and the number to be taken into consideration for the purpose of
                    sentencing. There is nothing to commend such an approach. Instead, a more
                    suitable approach is for the court to determine on a global basis what the
                    totality of the sentence should be so as to avoid imposing a
                    “crushing” sentence on the offender.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I did not agree with the DJ that there were
                    any mitigating factors which outweighed the serious consequences of his criminal
                    acts, having regard to the motivation for committing the offences, the number of
                    offences and the harm done to OpenNet and its customers. The DJ gave weight,
                    erroneously, to an irrelevant factor in the present case, <em>ie</em>, the fact that the Respondent did not acquire any financial
                    benefit from his actions. Financial benefit was furthest from his mind. The
                    Respondent’s main aim was simply to wreak as much havoc to OpenNet’s
                    cable network, regardless of the consequences of his acts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     That said, the DJ rightly accorded some
                    mitigating weight to his early plea of guilt, his co-operation with police
                    investigations, and noted that he was willing to undergo a further psychiatric
                    examination upon the Public Prosecutor’s request. However, these factors
                    must be balanced by the fact that the Respondent confessed to his criminal acts
                    only after he was confronted by the police with the keys and wire cutter found
                    at his residence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appropriate sentence to be imposed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Section 65 of the TA provides that the
                    penalty for committing an offence under s 41(<em>c</em>) of the TA is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or an imprisonment
                    term not exceeding three years or both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Before me, the Public Prosecutor provided
                    details of three unreported Magistrate’s Court cases where offenders had
                    been convicted of similar offences under s 41(<em>c</em>) of the TA. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Yahya
                        Bin Ghani</em> (Magistrate Arrest Case No 2106 of 2000), the offender
                    had deliberately pulled and damaged the telephone wire outside his
                    girlfriend’s home after a quarrel with her. For his s 41(<em>c</em>) TA offence which was the only charge proceeded
                    against him eventually, he was convicted and fined $2,000 with two weeks’
                    imprisonment in default. In <em>Public Prosecutor v Rattan Singh
                        s/o Kernial Singh</em> (Magistrate Arrest Case No 3184 of 2000), the
                    offender had damaged the telephone line distribution box at the staircase
                    landing of the victim’s HDB block after setting fire to the victim’s
                    house. He had faced three charges, that of criminal intimidation, mischief with
                    damage of $25 caused, and a s 41(<em>c</em>) TA
                    charge. He had no related antecedents <em>vis-a-vis</em>
                    this last charge. For the s 41(<em>c</em>) TA offence,
                    he was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. In <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Paramjeet Singh s/o Dharam Singh</em> (Magistrate Arrest
                    Case No 4898 of 2002), the offender, an illegal immigrant, had tampered
                    with wires in the public telephone booth to illegally connect a phone for his
                    use there. He had faced two charges, one for illegally entering Singapore and
                    the s 41(<em>c</em>) TA charge. As regards the latter
                    charge, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three months’
                    imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Before the DJ, the Public Prosecutor had
                    submitted that the sentence should be three months’ imprisonment for each
                    offence with 12 sentences running consecutively. The DJ rejected this submission
                    and sentenced the Respondent to three months’ imprisonment for each
                    offence with five sentences running consecutively. Before me, the Public
                    Prosecutor submitted that I should not uphold the DJ’s sentence or her
                    method of computing the total sentence, but increase it to seven to eight
                    months’ imprisonment per charge with five sentences running consecutively,
                    giving the totality of between 35 and 40 months’ imprisonment. While the
                    cases (see [21] above) would be helpful to calibrate the appropriate sentence in
                    this case, and the Public Prosecutor is not bound by its submission before the
                    DJ, I was of the view that having regard to the nature of the offence, it was
                    not necessary to vary the three months’ imprisonment term imposed per
                    charge to seven to eight months’ imprisonment per charge. I was not
                    persuaded that if the Respondent had merely committed one offence, it would have
                    merited a seven to eight months’ imprisonment term.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Taking into account the reckless and vengeful
                    conduct of the Respondent in wantonly cutting the large number of fibre optic
                    cables in order to maximise the damage to OpenNet’s cable network to a
                    large number of flats in the 12 housing estates, I considered that the totality
                    of the punishment of 30 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for
                    such conduct. I accordingly ordered ten of the sentences of three months’
                    imprisonment each to run consecutively under MAC 4218/2011, MAC 4370/2011, MAC
                    4377/2011, MAC 4379/2011, MAC 4384/2011, MAC 4385/2011, MAC 4386/2011, MAC
                    4708/2011, MAC 4711/2011 and MAC 4713/2011.</p>
