<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><em><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Cur Adv Vult</strong></font></em>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">In this action the plaintiffs

("Nuplex"), a company incorporated in New Zealand engaged in the manufacture and

sale of chemical resins, are claiming against the defendants the sum of US$49,364.00 being

the value of 48x200 kg drums of Chemical resins code-named PANVL and 144x200 kg drums of

chemical resins code-named CHEMTEX which they had placed on quasi-bailment with the

defendants ("Panatron"), a company incorporated in Singapore engaged in the

manufacture and sale of chemical sealants and other coating products. Nuplex claim that

the said sum has become payable under the terms of their agreement with Panatron.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2 Panatron, who obtained a licence from

Chemtour, the sole-proprietorship of Eral Dettrick ("Dettrick") of Australia to

manufacture the chemical sealants, deny that they are liable to pay for the chemical

resins placed on quasi-bailment. They further assert that Nuplex had agreed to supply

chemical resins in perpetuity for as long as they wanted the resins. In relation to the

resins placed on quasi-bailment Panatron also claim that it was agreed that the agreement

implementing the quasi-bailment could only be terminated if both parties mutually agreed.

In other words, either party could under the alleged agreement keep the quasi-bailment

afoot for so long as they choose to do so. Panatron allege that Nuplex were in breach of

both agreements and they claim substantial damages against them.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3 By para 11 of their Re-Amended Defence

and Amended Counterclaim Panatron advance the allegation that Nuplex had colluded with

Dettrick to cause loss and damage to Panatron. They aver that Dettrick "had

pressurised or influenced (Nuplex) to wrongfully and/or recklessly terminate (the

agreement for) the supply of goods".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4 Panatron have also alleged civil

conspiracy against Dettrick and other parties in Suit 2061/1997. That suit and this action

were tried before me one and after another and it was agreed that evidence in one case may

be used in the other. I have set out in more details the parties and the material

background in a judgment in that action and issued on even date. Such parts as are

relevant for present purposes are incorporated into this judgment by reference. On the

evidence and for the reasons set out in that action, I rejected Panatron’s allegation

of a civil conspiracy committed by Dettrick and the defendants in the other suit. In this

action, I shall set out the evidence which bear on the allegation of a civil conspiracy

between Dettrick and Nuplex to injure Panatron and for the reasons hereinafter appearing I

find that the allegation is entirely without substance. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The facts</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 In late September 1995 Panatron entered

into a licence agreement with Chemtour, the sole-proprietorship of Dettrick, for Panatron

to manufacture and market waterproof paints and coatings in Singapore and the region. Such

paints and coatings use chemical sealants. Panatron were introduced to Nuplex by Dettrick.

Nuplex’s related company in Australia had been supplying the chemical resins,

chemically known as "Viscopol 140" (code-named PANVL) and "Texicryl

13031"( code-named CHEMTEX, to Dettrick’s companies.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 Panatron started production in early

January 1996. They also started to purchase the two chemical resins from Nuplex. Each

shipment was carried out in the following manner. Panatron’s plant manager or the

Senior Vice-President, Peter Yin ("Yin") who gave evidence in this case for

Nuplex and who was one of the conspirators named by Panatron in the other suit, would

complete a purchase requisition for the amount of resins needed. It was usually a full

container load ("FCL"). The President of Panatron, Phua Mong Seng

("Phua"), who gave evidence for Panatron, would approve and issue the purchase

order. The purchase order set out the terms of each purchase, stating the mode of payment

for the resins (which was usually by means of a letter of credit) at the prevailing quoted

price, and the estimated time of arrival of the resins. The purchase order would then be

faxed to Nuplex who indicated their agreement by signing at the indicated portion and

faxing it back to Panatron. Nuplex would then ship the goods to Panatron CIF Singapore. At

intervals of about every quarter, Nuplex would send to Panatron the revised prices for

their products. On the face of it, each sale and purchase of the chemical resins was

pursuant to a separate and discrete contract.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 On 6 August 1996 Yin met the Export

Manager of Nuplex, Tony Leggett ("Leggett") for the first time when the latter

visited them in Singapore. Yin was instructed by Phua to arrange for Nuplex to place a

"consignment" stock of the goods. The presence of such a stock of the resins

would prevent any disruption of the manufacturing process, quite apart from not having to

pay for them just yet. The terms of the agreement were indicated in a fax dated 7 August

1996 which Nuplex sent to Panatron. The Fax was in these terms:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"FURTHER TO YOUR DISCUSSION WITH MR

  LEGGETT HE HAS ADVISED THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO SEND 1 FCL TO YOU AS CONSIGNMENT STOCK.

  PLEASE BE ADVISED OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS FOR CONSIGNMENT STOCK;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">CONSIGNMENT STOCK WILL REMAIN THE PROPERTY

  OF NUPLEX INDUSTRIES LTD UNTIL SUCH TIME AS IT IS MUTUALLY AGREED TO TERMINATE THIS

  ARRANGEMENT. AT SUCH TIME PANATRON PTE LTD WILL PAY NUPLEX INDUSTRIES LTD FOR THIS STOCK

  AT THE MARKET PRICE PREVAILING AT THE TIME.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">CAN YOU PLEASE CONFIRM BY RETURN THAT YOU

  ARE AGREEABLE TO THE ABOVE TERMS…."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The fax then went on to discuss the

arrangements for the shipment of the next three full container loads under apparently 3

contracts for the sales of goods.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 By a letter transmitted on 9 August 1996

to Nuplex, Panatron referred to the fax and went on to state as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"I confirm the following

  understanding:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1. The 1 x FCL consignment stock will

  remain the property of Nuplex Industries Ltd.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2. Panatron Pte Ltd will pay for the

  consignment stock at the prevailing market price at the end of this arrangement.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">I will send you a P.O. for the

  abovementioned FCL and advise the desired shipment ETA date."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 By a Purchase Order of 14 August 1996

Panatron specified the details of the consignment stock required. They required 24x200kg

drums of PanVL (4.8 Mtons) and 72x200kg (14.4 Mtons). It noted as follows:

‘CONSIGNMENT STOCK’ and the further notation was: "No value or price

attached as this shipment is for consignment only." Under the Terms and Conditions,

the following were agreed:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Prices : CIF Singapore, based on

  prevailing product prices at the time of the termination of the consignment agreement.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Terms : L/C 60 days from the consignment

  agreement termination date.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">ETA

          : Singapore 20 September 1996"</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 By early September 1996 it became

apparent that the 1 full container loan of chemical resins, which could meet

Panatron’s manufacturing needs for about a month, was insufficient. Phua then

instructed Yin to obtain from Nuplex a second FCL buffer stock. Yin obtained

Leggett’s agreement and the second buffer 1 FCL buffer stock was sent. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 On 23 August 1997 Dettrick terminated

the Licence Agreement with Panatron for the reasons mentioned in the other judgment. After

the cancellation of the licence Panatron were no longer authorised to manufacture the

Chemtour products of Dettrick. Panatron therefore no longer had any need to use PANVL or

CHEMTEX. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 By a letter of 10 September 1997 signed

by Yin, Panatron informed Nuplex of the amount of resins still held by the defendants and

inquiring whether Nuplex wished to invoice Panatron for the amount of the buffer stock

used to date. As for the balance of the stock, Yin asked whether he wanted to invoice

Panatron for the balance, nominate a third party and assign them the rights to the stock,

or dispose of it in any other way. He concluded by stating: "As the stock with

Panatron rightfully belongs to and is the property of Nuplex, I await your feedback on how

you (as the owner’s representative) wish to proceed…" Yin explained in

evidence that he wrote in this way, although Panatron was obliged to pay, because he was

hoping that Nuplex would pick one of the other options he suggested. Nuplex’s

response was to request for the payment of US$12,468 for the stock used. As for the

balance of the unused stock, Nuplex said they would revert after they had found a

warehouse. No payment was made by Panatron.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The factual issues</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 Phua in his evidence claims that the

introduction of Nuplex to Panatron in August/September 1995 to supply of the unique

chemicals was "part of the technology transfer" by Dettrick under the Licence

Agreement for Panatron’s manufacture of the products known as NewFlex, NewFlex R100,

Flexicote, BlockFlex, Primer and Tuffcote. He further alleges that Nuplex (without naming

anybody from Nuplex) and Dettrick "represented to Panatron at the time of the

introduction that the chemicals were vital resin for Panatron’s manufacture of the

products "and also stated that (Nuplex) shall supply on a long term basis."

Phua, as if to fortify his assertions, claims that the chemical resins "are unique in

nature and substance" which Panatron would need on a long term basis to enable them

to manufacture the products.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14 Both Dettrick and Yin gave evidence

which contradicted Phua’s version. Leggett in his evidence said that the 2 resins are

not unique in nature and substance. In the manufacture of paints, coatings and similar

products the practice of the industry is to have alternative raw materials of all

components. This is a prudent measure to prevent disruptions or to prevent exploitation.

He points out that similar resins are available from 9 other suppliers worldwide,

including Hoechst AG, Eternal Chemicals, Taipei and so on. Yin confirmed that Panatron was

free to source for the resins from other suppliers, after obtaining the approval of

Dettrick who put in this contractual requirement to ensure that quality control of the

Chemtour products was maintained.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 I come now to the circumstances

surrounding the cessation of supply by Nuplex. In early September, 1997, according to

Dettrick, he received a telephone call from Leggett. Leggett informed him that he had

received an inquiry from a certain David Kinsman for Nuplex products. That was the first

time Dettrick had spoken to any employee of Nuplex. Other than this, Dettrick had never

maintained any contact with any employee of Nuplex. It was also during this telephone

conversation that Dettrick informed Leggett of the termination of the Licence Agreement

with Panatron. Leggett confirmed this evidence. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 As between Nuplex and Panatron, the

payment for the consignment stock became a bone of contention between the two parties.

Panatron, through Phua, declined to pay. He also declined to release the balance of the

unused buffer stock of the two resins. On 20 October 1997 Nuplex through their solicitors

terminated the ‘consignment’ arrangements and demanded the return of the

remaining unused stock from both Panatron and their warehouse keeper, Messrs KNT Transport

Services. Panatron refused to pay for the portion used and declined to release the

remaining buffer stock, alleging that Nuplex had agreed to the long term supply of the two

resins and that the consignment arrangement was not terminable except with the consent of

both parties. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">My decisions</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 I turn to the first question: did

Nuplex agree to supply the two resins in perpetuity for so long as Panatron wanted, as

asserted by Panatron in paras 1, 2, 3 and 5 of their Re-Amended Defence and Amended

Counterclaim? In evaluating the evidence, I am struck by the tenuous and tentative nature

of Phua’s evidence. He was unable to give direct evidence. Much of his evidence is

without basis. He is wrong to assert that the two resins are unique in substance and in

nature. He is wrong to say that they can only be obtained from Nuplex. While I appreciate

that sometimes facts are stranger than fiction, I must say that in this instance, Phua has

not convinced me that there are any convincing circumstances which make it likely that

Nuplex would agree to what is, on the face of it, a rather burdensome obligation in

perpetuity. I am driven to reject his evidence. Leggett, Dettrick and Yin are far more

credible witnesses in contrast to Phua.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 The next issue is a matter of

construction of the two ‘contractual’ letters and turns on the circumstances, if

at all, under which the ‘consignment’ agreement could be terminated. Panatron

assert that it is terminable only and only if both parties agree. This is another way of

saying that this was an agreement which could not be terminated without the consent of

Panatron. This contention calls to mind the pragmatically wise dictum of Lord Reid in <i>Wickman

Tools v Schuler AG</i> [1994] AC 235 at p 251 E: "The fact that a particular

construction leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration. The

more unreasonable the result the more unlikely it is that the parties can have intended

it, and if they do intend it the more necessary it is that they shall make that intention

abundantly clear." Reading the two letters between Nuplex and Panatron and evaluating

the conflicting oral evidence, there is, in my view, no justification to place too literal

a meaning to the phrase "mutually agreed" in Nuplex’s letter. That was an

offer of a term which was left unanswered by Yin in his reply. The single phrase is far

too narrow, and is certainly inapt, to express with sufficient clarity if the mutual

intention was that the buffer stock agreement was to be terminable only with the consent

of both parties. In my view, a reasonable construction is to imply the term that the

agreement was terminable on reasonable notice. What is reasonable notice is in every case

a question of fact. Panatron also fail on this part of their claim.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19 Finally, I will deal with Phua’s

allegation that Nuplex had colluded and committed civil conspiracy with Dettrick to injure

the interest of Panatron. The allegation against Nuplex in the context of this case is so

far fetched that I am driven to remark that this notion is a figment of Phua’s

fevered imagination. Dettrick was never in contact with anybody of any authority in Nuplex

before the termination of his Licence Agreement with Panatron on 23 August 1997. There was

no combination at all because the alleged civil conspirators had never been in touch in

any way at all material times. The supply of the 2 chemical resins are easily available

from many suppliers the world over and there was no basis or motivation for any sort of

conspiracy. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><b> </b></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Conclusions</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20 Accordingly, there must be judgment

with costs on the High Court scale for Nuplex in the sum of US$49,364.00 together with

interest thereon at 6% p.a. calculated from 28 November 1997, the date Nuplex commenced

their suit in the Subordinate Court. Panatron’s counterclaims are dismissed with

costs. </font></p>
