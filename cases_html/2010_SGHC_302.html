        Philip Pillai J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application by the first defendant
                    (“Astrata”) for leave to appeal under s 34(2) of the Supreme
                    Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”)
                    against the judgment in Originating Summons No 690 of 2010 (“OS
                    690”) of 26 August 2010 declaring that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     The conditions set out in the Escrow
                        Agreement dated 23 October 2007 (in particular, clauses 7(i)(c) and
                        7(ii)(b)) have been satisfied and the second defendant
                        (“Tridex”) is entitled to demand the release of:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_1-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       the Comprehensive Source
                            Code underlying the system supplied to Tridex; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_1-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the Comprehensive
                            Engineering Diagrams as defined in the Escrow Agreement (collectively,
                            “the Escrow Documents”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Plaintiff (“the Escrow
                        Agent”) is entitled to recover its costs of its application from the
                        defendants to be agreed or taxed (“the
                    Declaration”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The grounds for this application for leave to
                    appeal upon which Astrata relies are as stated in <em>Lee Kuan
                        Yew v Tang Liang Hong and another</em> [1997] 2 SLR(R) 862
                    at [16]: (a) <em>prima facie</em> case of error; (b) a
                    question of general principle decided for the first time; and (c) a question of
                    importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would
                    be to the public advantage. The three grounds in <em>Lee Kuan Yew
                        v Tang Liang Hong</em> were affirmed by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Singapore Land
                        Authority and another application</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 558
                    at [32].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The three parties had under a consent order
                    agreed that, notwithstanding the Declaration, Tridex would not demand or call
                    for the release of the Escrow Documents and the Escrow Agent would not release
                    the same pending the final disposal of the related judgments under appeal. The
                    upshot of this consent order is that there would be no risk of the release of
                    the Escrow Documents until after the final disposal of these appeals by the
                    Court of Appeal. Astrata’s counsel explained the objective of this
                    particular leave application as being to protect Astrata’s interests in
                    the event those appeals were unsuccessful. In the event those appeals were
                    successful, an injunction would be in place and/or the related litigation would
                    be stayed pending arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The pivotal question resulting in the
                    Declaration turned on the construction under Singapore law, of a standard form
                    precedent contractual clause, and in particular the word
                    “reconstruction” in a trilateral Escrow Agreement which operated
                    as a trigger event to entitle the customer to obtain delivery of the Escrow
                    Documents from the Escrow Agent. Astrata’s written submission at
                    para 12 sets out seven arguments which it submits reveal <em>prima facie</em> cases of errors by the Court in granting the
                    Declaration. Apart from reciting these seven arguments, all of which were fully
                    raised, argued and considered by the Court, Astrata has furnished no arguments
                    before me as to why any of these arguments disclosed any <em>prima facie</em> case of error. Astrata explained that it had merely
                    recited the arguments in this leave application before me, in order to preserve
                    their ability to persuade the Court of Appeal that these reveal <em>prima facie</em> case(s) of error, should I not grant them
                    leave to appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       I turn to the next ground of “a question
                    of general principle decided for the first time”. Astrata argues that the
                    critical clauses 7(i)(c) and 7(ii)(b) of the Escrow Agreement are commonly used
                    standard form precedents. Astrata argues that they have found no reported cases
                    in Singapore, Malaysia, England, Australia and Canada on the meaning of
                    “reconstruction” within such escrow agreements. Accordingly, it
                    argues that this is a question of general principle decided for the first time.
                    They argue that the tax and stamp duty cases referred to in the original
                    decision are not analogous to this particular Escrow Agreement where the
                    identity of the shareholders in the reconstructed companies, it says, is less
                    significant especially when Astrata Group, Inc (“AGI”) was
                    formerly a publicly listed company. Astrata insists that in the Supply Agreement
                    between Astrata and Tridex (which is not before me, as the parties thereto have
                    agreed is to be governed by English law and disputes thereunder to be resolved
                    by arbitration) it may not matter to this customer (<em>ie</em> Tridex) whether or not private equity investors of the
                    supplier (<em>ie</em> Astrata) have changed. Even if the
                    clause has been triggered by AGI’s Chapter 11, were Tridex not to be
                    concerned about a change of shareholders, commercially, Tridex is at liberty to
                    waive its rights under the Escrow Agreement by notice to all parties. The fact
                    that Tridex has invoked but not enforced its Escrow rights is a contraindication
                    that the change of controlling shareholders of the counterparty, on the
                    contrary, does matter to Tridex. The crucial question in these proceedings has
                    turned on a construction under Singapore law of the meaning and scope of
                    “reconstruction”. Whilst indeed many of the cases on the meaning
                    and scope of “reconstruction” cited were tax and stamp duty cases,
                    the case of <em>In re South African Supply and Cold Storage
                        Company</em> [1904] 2 Ch 268 which was cited and referred to
                    in the original Declaration decision (at [33]), turned on the common law meaning
                    and scope of “reconstruction” in a contractual context. The
                    meaning and scope of “reconstruction” has been long determined at
                    common law for about a century and consistently applied in Singapore. There are
                    no conflicting judicial authorities on the Singapore and common law meaning and
                    scope of “reconstruction”. Standard form precedent or model
                    provisions which adopt expressions like “reconstruction” as
                    trigger events leading to prescribed outcomes, are designed and used in light of
                    the established common law and cases which have defined its meaning and scope.
                    This provides commercial clarity, certainty and allocates risk as agreed by all
                    parties, particularly in escrow agreements in which precision and clarity are
                    commercially vital. In these premises, I can find no principle of law that was
                    being decided for the first time in the original Declaration
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       I turn to the final ground that “this is
                    a question of importance upon which further argument and a decision of a higher
                    tribunal would be to the public advantage”. The same arguments raised in
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above pertain equally in support of
                    this ground as indeed the settled meaning and scope of
                    “reconstruction” under the case law is of standard market usage.
                    Astrata further argues that the question whether or not
                    “reconstruction” in an escrow agreement should be construed as
                    requiring substantially the same shareholders would be one upon which further
                    argument and a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.
                    It seems clear that the question of importance is to be determined not merely by
                    the importance one party may place on the question but rather upon whether
                    objectively the question has such importance that a higher tribunal’s
                    decision on this question would be to the public advantage. It was submitted
                    without elaboration that it would be to the public advantage if further argument
                    and a decision of a higher tribunal could be received upon this question. It
                    would be too far to suggest that every time a word is used in a particular
                    contract, and its meaning, scope and application to the particular facts at hand
                    render it to be of such importance to one party, that that would <em>ipso facto</em>, render it to be to the public advantage for
                    further argument and a decision of a higher tribunal to be secured. I do not
                    think that whether or not the turn of events resulting in AGI’s Chapter 11
                    was within Astrata’s subjective intention as being within the meaning of
                    “reconstruction” in clauses 7(i)(c) and 7(ii)(b) of the Escrow
                    Agreement is a question of such importance that further argument and a decision
                    of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       For completeness I will deal with two remaining
                    submissions raised by Astrata to support its application for leave. First, it
                    was suggested by Astrata, in reliance of passing comments at [23] by Kan Ting
                    Chiu J in <em>Essar Steel Ltd v Bayerische Landesbank and
                        others</em> [2004] 3 SLR(R) 25, that the value of the
                    transaction could be an independent ground for leave to appeal. No compelling
                    authorities were cited in support of this comment. Second, Astrata pointed out
                    that should the Escrow Documents be released to Tridex, it would lose all
                    practical hope for continuing the performance of its bilateral Supply Agreement
                    with Tridex. Astrata observed that there was little value in the arbitration
                    proceedings it had commenced against Tridex under the Supply Agreement because
                    Tridex is a $2 company and further that if the Escrow Documents are released and
                    copied, irreparable damage may be done. All these are business risk matters
                    which were known to all parties when the Escrow Agreement between Astrata,
                    Tridex and the Escrow agent was negotiated and the business risks were
                    contractually allocated. It is undoubted that the risk that has materialised
                    through AGI’s Chapter 11 turned out to be highly commercially hazardous
                    for Astrata. The nexus, however, between this materialised commercial hazard and
                    the legal grounds for leave to appeal remains elusive.</p>
