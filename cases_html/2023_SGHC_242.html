Abcom’s principal ground as it appeared in the supporting affidavit for the application was that as a result of the communications in the second half of 2022 concerning the moratorium the shortfall of payments made during that six-month period was not due and payable. In the written submissions two other grounds were raised, one that there had been “frustrating events” and the other that TransAsia Capital was an illegal moneylender. Neither of these additional grounds was seriously pursued before me.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicable law </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 It is settled law that the court will at the instance of the company enjoin a person from bringing a winding up application where the debt claimed by that person against the company is disputed in good faith and on substantial grounds: see the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 268, at [62]. Where a debt is disputed in good faith and on substantial grounds, the person relying on that debt lacks standing to bring the winding up application as a creditor of the company under s 125 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (2020 Rev Ed) (“IRDA”). Both parties accepted that this was the position in law, such that Abcom’s burden in this matter was to show triable issues concerning the debt. Put simply, this approach strikes the balance between ensuring that companies that are unable to pay their debts do not continue to trade and preventing the threat of winding up proceedings being used as a tactic to pressure companies into settling genuinely disputed debts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 In support of its argument that the defendants could not resile from the position that they had allowed Abcom, without dispute, to hold back payment on the basis of a moratorium, Abcom invoked three doctrines, namely waiver by election, waiver by estoppel, and approbation and reprobation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Waiver by election stops a person from going back on a decision to exercise one of two inconsistent rights, and treats the right not exercised as having been abandoned.

Abcom’s argument was that notwithstanding that it is a corporation, there was a personal guarantee provided by its director under which the director was to be liable “as sole or principal debtor” and consequently, as the guarantee and loan facility were all part of the same transaction, the loan was to be treated as being made to an individual. It then followed that the lender could not be said to lend solely to corporations, was thus not an excluded moneylender, and hence there was an infringement of the Moneylenders Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Finally, COVID-19 and the London Metal Exchange were relied on as frustrating events.

</div> This defence was not elaborated on.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reasons for my decision </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 I dealt with the defences in the order of frustration, illegal moneylending, and moratorium.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The defence of frustration was plainly misconceived. Without even considering the nature of the events relied on and their impact on performance, the doctrine of frustration where successfully invoked discharges the contract and so relieves both parties from contract performance for the future entirely. It is not a doctrine that may be invoked to excuse a period of non-payment or reduced payment of loan instalments while leaving the loan contract in force. A second and separate point is that a loan contract is not frustrated by the borrower’s economic circumstances changing even when the result of events beyond its control such that it becomes unable to repay the loan. The loan contract had in fact been performed by the lender, only leaving the borrower’s obligation to repay. Absent a term of the loan contract, the occurrence of adverse events is simply the borrower’s risk. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The defence of illegal moneylending was equally misconceived. Abcom is a corporation. The loan was in connection with Abcom’s business of commodity trading. There was no suggestion that Abcom was a sham set up to evade the operation of the Moneylenders Act. The fact that there was a guarantee in respect of the loan given by an individual (even with a principal debtor clause) did not make the loan to an individual or mean that TransAsia Capital was not lending solely to corporations. There was no evidence that TransAsia Capital does not lend solely to corporations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Turning to the defences arising from the alleged moratorium, I did not accept that any of them had the effect contended for. I assumed in favour of Abcom that the defendants did in fact agree to the six-month moratorium requested, notwithstanding that the correspondence did not fully support such an assumption. This only meant however that there was forbearance during the period of the moratorium. Abcom’s position was that there was no agreement about how to treat the resulting shortfall once the moratorium came to an end. The difficulty for Abcom was that absent such further agreement, the position was that it had to pay the deferred payments (or shortfall) once the period of forbearance ended. The natural meaning of the word “moratorium” is that it is a temporary postponement of repayments. The temporary period that Abcom requested was six months. That is now in the past.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Turning to the three doctrines invoked in turn, there was not and could not be any suggestion on the evidence that there was an election not to require the payments to be made once the moratorium ended or to be deferred to the end of the loan period, nor any representation to that effect, nor any approbation of such continued non-payment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I also noted that as of the date of the statutory demand, there was an earlier shortfall in instalments pre-dating the six-month moratorium.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20  For these reasons, it was clear that Abcom could not raise triable issues concerning the timing of the repayment of the debt once the six-month period of forbearance, or moratorium, ended. It simply could not be said that Abcom genuinely disputed the debt in good faith. Accordingly, I declined to grant to Abcom the injunction it sought.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"><br/></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Liew Teck Huat (Niru &amp; Co LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chan Cong Yen, Lionel (Chen Congren) and Chang Guo En Nicholas Winarta Chandra (Oon &amp; Bazul LLP) for the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
