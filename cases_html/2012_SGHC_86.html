<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In short, the first two
                    charges relate to the Respondent depositing the two sums
                    received from one Mr Teo Yeow Hock (“the
                    Complainant”) into his office account in breach of
                    Rule 3(1) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’

                    (“the SA Rules”). The third charge is for
                    failing to adequately inform the Complainant of the basis on
                    which his professional fees would be charged, in breach of
                    Rule 35(<em>a</em>) of the Legal
                    Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161,
                    R 1, 1990 Rev Ed) (“the PC

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At all material times, the
                    Respondent was the sole proprietor of the law firm of Messrs
                    John Tay &amp; Co. He was called to the Singapore Bar on
                    12 May 1982, an Advocate and Solicitor of 26
                    years’ standing at the time of the alleged
                    misconduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At around the end of
                    February 2009, the Complainant engaged the Respondent to act
                    for him in respect of ancillary matters in D4476/2008/S (a
                    divorce proceedings between the Complainant and his wife)
                    (“the Divorce Ancillaries”) and MSS 941/2009
                    (an application by the Complainant’s wife for
                    maintenance) (“the Maintenance
                    Summons”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It is not disputed that the
                    complainant was a client of another advocate and solicitor,
                    Mr Tan Ee Bin (“Mr Tan”), who handled the
                    Complainant’s divorce proceedings. However, as Mr Tan
                    did not normally handle contentious divorce ancillaries
                    matters, Mr Tan recommended the Respondent to the
                    Complainant and they met at Mr Tan’s office on
                    27 February 2009. The Respondent said that at that
                    meeting he had informed the Complainant that his fees would
                    be as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     Upfront initial
                        fee or advanced payment of $3,000 for handling the
                        Divorce Ancillaries (“the Divorce Ancillaries
                        Initial Upfront Fee”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Additional fees
                        would be payable and such fees would be discussed if the
                        matter went for trial;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     There would be a contingency fee of $3,000 in the
                        event that the ancillary matters were transferred to the
                        High Court (“the Divorce Ancillaries Contingency
                        Fee”) if the estimated matrimonial assets
                        exceeded $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The following day, on
                    28 February 2009, the Complainant came to the
                    Respondent’s office in the morning when the latter was
                    about to leave for a court hearing. The Complainant informed
                    the Respondent that he had been served with the Maintenance
                    Summons, and that he would also like the Respondent to
                    handle that matter. The Complainant had brought with him
                    $2,000 in cash and a POSB cheque for $3,000, both of which
                    he handed to the Respondent. The Respondent said that he
                    told the Complainant that the $2,000 cash would be treated
                    as part payment towards the Divorce Ancillaries Initial
                    Upfront Fee and the cheque for $3,000 as the upfront fee for
                    handling the Maintenance Summons. Their conversation lasted
                    for only five minutes as the Respondent was in a hurry to
                    attend court on another client’s matter. A receipt was
                    issued by the Respondent’s firm in respect of the
                    $2,000 cash payment. We would note that the receipt stated
                    that the $2,000 cash payment was “initial payment for
                    MSS941/2009”, the Maintenance Summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Subsequently, the
                    Complainant decided to appoint another set of solicitors to
                    take over the conduct of both the Divorce Ancillaries and
                    the Maintenance Summons. On 3 September 2009, the
                    Complainant wrote to the Respondent asking for a refund of
                    the $3,000 paid as the Divorce Ancillaries Contingency Fee.
                    Initially, the Respondent did not agree to make any refund
                    as he had done work for both the Divorce Ancillaries and the
                    Maintenance Summons. Eventually, the Respondent agreed to
                    refund $1,500, although this refund of $1,500 was never
                    effected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 1 February 2010, the
                    Complainant filed a complaint with the Law Society. After
                    investigation, the Law Society preferred the three charges
                    against the Respondent (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At the hearing before the
                    DT, as against the first two charges, the Respondent raised
                    the defence that the Complainant and Respondent had agreed
                    that the $2,000 cash and the cheque for $3,000 were the
                    Respondent’s fees and therefore did not constitute
                    “client’s money” under
                        r 2(<em>b</em>) of the SA
                        Rules.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Respondent argued
                    therefore that he was not obliged to deposit them into a
                    client account (as set out and further discussed in
                        <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> to <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision Below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The DT, after due hearing,
                    found pursuant to s 93(1)(<em>c</em>)
                    of the LPA that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary
                    action existed under s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the LPA and ordered the Respondent to pay
                    costs. In reaching this decision, the DT made the following
                    findings of fact:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The $3,000 by
                        way of a POSB cheque (“the $3,000”) and
                        $2,000 cash were paid into the Respondent’s office
                            account;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     There was no
                        agreement on account of an agreed fee between the
                        Respondent and the Complainant because, <em>inter alia</em>:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The

                            cross-examination corroborated the
                            Complainant’s evidence that the payments made
                            were only part of the Respondent’s
                            professional fees;</p>

                            state that it was an agreed fee. It stated that it
                            was “initial payment for

                            no agreement was made to convert the $3,000 to

                        for a refund of $3,000. Instead, the Respondent:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       Issued

<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_11-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Did not explain the basis

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The DT also found as a
                    matter of law that an “agreed fee” was not
                    valid unless it was evidenced in writing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As seen from the above,
                    the critical question in relation to the first and second
                    charges is whether there was an agreement on fees between
                    the Complaint and the Respondent. The DT found that there
                    was in fact no such agreement. The DT also decided that in
                    law, there could not, in any event, have been an
                    “agreed fee” because the alleged agreements
                    were not evidenced in writing signed by the client. Thus, on
                    this matter there are really five issues which this court
                    must address and we will deal with them in the following
                    order:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether or not
                        an “agreed fee” under r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii) of the SA Rules must be
                        in writing;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether or not an “agreed
                        fee” must be for the entire
                    transaction;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether or not the totality of the
                        evidence demands that this Court should overturn the
                        DT’s findings of fact, <em>ie</em>, that there was no agreed fee, in
                        relation to the first two charges;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether there is
                        sufficient basis for the DT to find the Respondent
                        guilty of the third charge; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>(e)     The appropriate
                        sanction in the event this court should find the
                        Respondent guilty of any of the three
                    charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 1: Whether or not an “agreed
                fee” must be in writing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     This is a threshold issue.
                    If this Court is to find that an “agreed fee”
                    must be in writing to come into being, then as the alleged
                    agreements here were not reduced to writing, the Respondent
                    automatically fails to make out the defence of an
                    “agreed fee” under r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii) of the SA Rules. This answer will
                    effectively resolve all the other issues relating to the
                    three charges and what remains for this Court would be to
                    determine the appropriate sanction which ought to be imposed
                    on the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     As a general proposition,
                    the formation and validity of an agreement on professional
                    fees between a solicitor and his or her client (“fee
                    agreement”) is, like any other contract, governed by
                    the common law. Such an agreement could be oral or in
                    writing. This is, of course, subject to any relevant
                    contrary provisions set out in the LPA and/or its attendant
                    subsidiary legislation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The DT seemed to think
                    that for a valid “fee agreement” to exist, the
                    agreement must be in writing. The DT stated (at [20] of its
                    Report):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rule 9(2)(c)(ii) of the SA Rules is to be read with or
                        subject to section 111 of the [Legal Profession] Act
                        which requires any agreement between a solicitor and his
                        client concerning his fee for contentious business to be
                        “in writing” and “signed by the
                        client”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Internal Architecture of Rule 9(2),
                Solicitors’ Accounts Rules</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     We will begin our
                    consideration of this question by first referring to the SA
                    Rules which prescribe how a solicitor should handle
                    client’s money. Rule 2(1) defines
                    “client’s money” as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">money held or received by a solicitor on account
                        of a person for whom he is acting (in relation to
                        the holding or receipt of such money) either as a
                        solicitor, or in connection with his practice as a
                        solicitor, an agent, a bailee or a stakeholder or
                        in any other capacity, other than —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    money to which the only person
                            entitled is the solicitor himself or, in the
                            case of a firm of solicitors, one or more of
                            the partners in the firm...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Rule 3(1) lays down a
                    mandatory requirement that every solicitor who holds or
                    receives client’s money “shall without delay
                    pay such money into a client account”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Rule 9(2), however,
                    provides a list of circumstances where a solicitor is not
                    required to pay money held or received by him into a client
                    account:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9(2)  Notwithstanding the
                            provisions of these Rules, a solicitor shall

                            received by him —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    which the client for his own
                            convenience requests the solicitor in writing

</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Respondent relies on
                        r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii) to
                    contend that in respect of the two sums he received from the
                    client on 28 February 2009 he was not required to
                    deposit them into a client account because those two
                    payments were agreed fees due to him for taking up the two
                    briefs of the complainant. He is saying that these payments
                    were really, in accordance with r 2(1), “money
                    to which the only person entitled is the solicitor
                    himself” and were thus not client’s
                    money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It would be seen from r
                    9(2) quoted above (at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>) that where writing is required, the
                    Rules would expressly provide for such a requirement. We see
                    two instances of this in r 9(2). First, r 9(2)(<em>a</em>) provides that where a client for
                    his own convenience “requests the solicitor <em>in writing</em>” to withhold
                    paying the money into a client’s account then the
                    solicitor would not infringe the rule if he complies with
                    the request. Second, r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(i) provides that where money is expressly
                    paid to the solicitor on account of costs incurred, in
                    respect of which “<em>a bill of costs
                        </em><em>or other written
                        intimation</em>” has been delivered for
                    payment, the solicitor will not be required to pay the sum
                    into a client account. On the other hand, r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii), which we are here concerned
                    with, merely provides for “an agreed fee”
                    without imposing any formal requirement as to writing. In
                    this regard, it may be useful to note that, unlike r
                        9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii), the
                    equivalent English rule, r 19(5) of the English
                    Solicitors’ Accounts Rules 1998, expressly provides
                    that “[a]n agreed fee must be evidenced in
                    writing”. In the absence of such express stipulation
                    in r 9(2), the Respondent argued that the court should be
                    slow to imply such a requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Symbiosis between Rule 9(2)(c)(ii) and Section
                111, Legal Profession Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     We now turn to consider s
                    111 of the LPA upon which the DT had placed much reliance to
                    hold that for there to be a valid “fee
                    agreement” the agreement must be evidenced in writing
                    (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>
                        above)<em>.</em> For ease of
                    reference, s 111 is quoted hereunder:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Subject to the provisions

                            corporation or a limited liability law
                            partnership <em>may make an agreement
                                in writing</em> with any client
                            respecting the amount and manner of payment for

                            or otherwise, and at either the same rate as or
                            a greater or a lesser rate than that at which
                            he or the law corporation or the
                            limited liability law partnership would
                            otherwise be entitled to be
                        remunerated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Every such agreement shall be
                            signed by the client and shall be subject to
                            the provisions and conditions contained in this
                            Part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The first point we would
                    highlight is that s 111(1) provides that a solicitor
                        “<em>may make an agreement in
                        writing</em>” with a client for his fees in
                    contentious business. It would be noted that the provision
                    is couched in <em>permissive</em>,
                    rather than <em>mandatory</em>, terms.
                    It does not say that there could not be an oral fee
                    agreement or that such an oral agreement would be invalid.
                    In the absence of such an express stipulation, we see no
                    reason why it should be so construed. In <em>Wee Soon Kim Anthony v Chor Pee &amp;
                        Partners</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 518 (“the
                        <em>Chor Pee</em> case”),
                    the Court of Appeal held at [26] that s 111(1) is “an enabling
                    provision and is not intended to replace the common
                    law”. Similarly, Professor Tan Yock Lin, in <em>The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in
                        Singapore and West Malaysia</em> (Butterworths
                    Asia, 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 1998)
                        (“<em>Tan Yock
                    Lin</em>”) at p 685 has opined that s 111 is
                    “an empowering section”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     What, then, are the
                    effects and consequences of s 111? First, we note that by
                    virtue of s 111(2), any fee agreement to be enforceable
                    against the client must be signed by the client. This is
                    obviously for the protection of the client. In the <em>Chor Pee</em> case, the Court of Appeal
                    stated at [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Indeed, s 111(1) essentially reflects much of the
                        common law position. In a sense, it can be said that the
                        provision is for the benefit of the solicitor as it
                        means that upon the solicitor ensuring that the written
                        agreement has the signature of the client, and in the
                        absence of there being any vitiating factors, the
                        solicitor will be able to enforce the agreement against
                        the client. In another sense, one can also say that s
                        111 was enacted to protect the client, so that no
                        agreement, not even a written agreement, would bind the
                        client unless the client signified his consent thereto
                        by his signature. However, the absence of the
                        solicitor's signature would not preclude the client from
                        enforcing it against the solicitor. Section 111(2)
                        enshrines that position...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In other words, a client can enforce an oral agreement
                        against a solicitor but not the other way around.</p>

                    following subsections of s 113 are germane and they show
                    that even written fee agreements, enforceable against the
                    client, are far from sacrosanct and could be reviewed and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Finally, s 118, referred
                    to in s 112(4), provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[N]o solicitor shall, except by leave of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Therefore, in the light of
                    all the provisions mentioned above, a fee agreement in
                    writing made in accordance with s 111 could give rise
                    to, <em>inter alia</em>, the following
                    effects, depending on the nature of the complaint and/or on
                    whose initiative the issue is being brought before the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     the agreement could be
                        declared to be unreasonable and void by the court,
                        and/or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     the solicitor is not obliged to wait
                        one month after sending a bill of costs to the client
                        before commencing an action to enforce the fee
                        agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     There is nothing in those
                    provisions which could be read to suggest that an oral fee
                    agreement is invalid. From s 111(2) it is clear that
                    Parliament intended to draw a distinction between validity
                    and enforceability and sought to accord greater protection
                    to the client. This explains why, following from
                    s 111(2), a client could enforce an agreement not
                    signed by the solicitor (and this would include an oral
                    agreement). This view was taken by the High Court, and we
                    say rightly so, in <em>Re Nirumalam
                        </em><em>Kanapathi
                        </em><em>Pillai</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 1037, a case relied on by the Respondent,
                    where Judith Prakash J reviewed an assistant
                    registrar’s taxation of a solicitor-client bill of
                    costs tendered by the solicitor’s firm. The taxing
                    registrar did not take into account an express agreement
                    between the solicitor’s firm and the petitioner, one
                    of 30 insurance companies, who had instructed the respondent
                    on an express oral agreement that the respondent’s
                    costs would be shared according to their respective shares
                    in the reinsurance risk.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The fee agreement, not
                    having been expressed in writing, clearly fell outside the
                    remit of s 111 and the other related provisions of
                    ss 112, 113 and 118. Nevertheless, the judge held at
                        [26] and
                        [27]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    I accept that as between
                            petitioner and the respondent in this case, there
                            was no agreement which fell within the bounds of s
                            111 of the [Legal Profession Act]. This means that
                            the respondent firm was bound to tax its bill once
                            taxation was asked for and ordered. It does not
                            mean, however, that it had not agreed on a
                            particular formula for computing the extent of the
                            petitioner’s liability for the legal costs
                            incurred by the firm in acting for the petitioner
                            and the other reinsurers in relation to the matter.
                            Neither does it mean that the respondent firm was
                            not bound by such agreement...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    I see no reason in principle or
                            in practice why the taxing Registrar should not have
                            had regard to this agreement, even though it was not
                            an agreement falling within s 111 of the [Legal
                            Profession Act].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     At this juncture, we think
                    it useful to refer to another case where the Disciplinary
                    Committee (the previous title of the current DT) had the
                    occasion to address specifically the scope of
                        r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii) of the
                    SA Rules: <em>The Law Society of Singapore v
                        Chua Swee Keng</em> [2008] SGDSC 6
                        (“<em>Chua Swee
                    Keng</em>”). There the DC ruled that
                        r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii) is not
                    subject to s 111 of the LPA (at [11.5.6]). Following
                    from the reasons based on a plain reading of
                        r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii), as
                    well as the fact that where it was intended that the fee
                    agreement should be in writing the SA Rules would expressly
                    say so (rr 9(2)(<em>a</em>) and
                        9(2)(<em>c</em>)(i)), the DC
                    elaborated at [11.5.6(b)]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...the drafting convention adopted in rule 9 is
                        expressly to require writing when it is needed. This
                        convention makes the omission of a requirement of
                        writing in rule 9(2)(c)(ii) of substantive
                        significance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Equally helpful in
                    explaining the scope of s 111 are the following passages
                    from <em>Tan Yock Lin</em> at
                    p 685 where the author succinctly reviewed the previous
                    position and the current position:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Before the English statutory enactment, with which
                        section 111 [of the LPA] is <em>in pari
                            </em><em>materia</em>,
                        was enacted, a solicitor could make an oral agreement
                        with his client as to remuneration for prosecuting
                        contentious business. For example, he could orally agree
                        to charge nothing for the services; but if he made an
                        oral agreement for more than his proper costs in
                        prosecuting or defending an action, that agreement could
                        not be enforced by him. Section 111...was designed to
                        enable a solicitor to enforce such agreements provided
                        they are in writing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 111 has nothing to do with validity but is
                        concerned only with enforceability by the solicitor.
                        Being an empowering section, it does not affect the
                        position of a client who sets up an agreement as to
                        costs. Before the enactment of section 111, a client
                        could enforce an oral agreement as to costs against his
                        solicitor and that remains true after the enactment.
                        Thus in <em>Clare v Joseph</em>, in
                        an action brought to recover moneys received by a
                        solicitor to the use of his client, the English Court of
                        Appeal held that the client continued to be entitled,
                        despite the enactment of the English equivalent of
                        section 111, to set up an oral agreement by the
                        solicitor to be paid less than usual costs. However,
                        where a solicitor purports to set up an agreement as to
                        costs, the agreement must be in writing for it to be
                        enforceable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We would hasten to
                    emphasise that the client is not deprived of protection
                    simply because there is an oral fee agreement. In <em>Wong Foong Chai v Lin Kuo Hao</em> [2005]
                    3 SLR(R) 74, Andrew Phang Boon Leong JC
                    stated at [31]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[N]o agreement for the payment of costs between client
                        and solicitor is sacrosanct in the sense that it is
                        conclusive and immune to, as well as impervious from,
                        any investigation by the court itself. That such
                        agreements can in fact be – and are –
                        subject to the court's scrutiny, particularly from the
                        perspective of reasonableness and fairness, is
                        established in both local as well as English case
                        law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, if the Complainant here were to complain
                    about the reasonableness of the fees charged by the
                    Respondent, the latter would, by virtue of s 111(2), be
                    precluded from relying on the oral fee agreement with the
                    Complainant to justify the fee charged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     We would reiterate that
                    all seeming difficulties or incongruity would vanish if
                        r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii) is
                    viewed not as a provision concerned with the enforceability
                    of a fee agreement, but only in determining whether there is
                    an agreement between the solicitor and client which would
                    permit the solicitor not to have to place money so received
                    by him from a client into a client account. We find that is
                    the proper reading of r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii). The question, then, in this case, is
                    whether or not there were, in fact, the alleged oral
                    agreements between the Respondent and the Complainant on
                    fees relating to the two matters which the Complainant had
                    entrusted the Respondent to handle and which would warrant
                    the Respondent depositing the two sums he received from the
                    Complainant into the firm’s account. As this would
                    amount to the Complainant paying the Respondent in advance
                    of work being performed, clear proof of the client’s
                    agreement must be established. In this regard, it is
                    pertinent to note that when a solicitor has done work for a
                    client and wishes to pay himself, he has to observe the
                    following rules:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_i"></a>(i)     Where the
                        payment is to be taken from client’s account
                        – “money properly required for or towards
                        payment of the solicitor’s costs where a bill of
                        costs or other written intimation of the amount of the
                        costs incurred has been delivered to the client and the
                        client has been notified that money held for him will be
                        applied towards or in satisfaction of such costs”
                        (see r 7(1)(a)(iv) of the SA Rules);
                    or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Where the payment is from money held or received
                        by him – “which is expressly paid to him on
                        account of costs incurred, in respect of which a bill of
                        costs or other written intimation of the amount of the
                        costs has been delivered for payment” (see r
                        9(2)(c)(i) of the SA Rules).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 2: Whether or not an “agreed
                fee” must be for the entirety of the
                transaction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     We now move to the second
                    issue as to whether an agreed fee could be in respect of
                    part of the work to be undertaken by the solicitor on the
                    contentious matter entrusted to him or if it must cover the
                    entire work in relation to the engagement. The DT did not
                    appear to have considered this issue as it had found that
                    there was in fact no agreement on fees between the
                    Complainant and the Respondent because in its view the
                    $2,000 cash and $3,000 cheque were in fact deposit or
                    initial payment. We do not see anything in r 9(2)(<em>c</em>)(ii) of the SA Rules which
                    expressly or implicitly touches, or has a bearing, on this.
                    However, s 111 of the Act states clearly that “a
                    solicitor ... may make an agreement in writing with any
                    client respecting the amount and manner of payment <em>for the whole or any part of its
                        costs</em> in respect of
                    contentious business”. Thus, as an agreed fee in
                    writing could be made in respect of the costs of part of the
                    work to be undertaken by the solicitor, or up to a certain
                    stage of the proceeding, we cannot see any reason why an
                    oral agreement could not be similarly made. In this regard,
                    we would underscore the need to differentiate between
                    matters of principle and matters of evidence. One should not
                    confuse the two. It may well be that where an oral agreement
                    is involved, there could be difficulties in proving what the
                    parties had exactly agreed on as fees, both in terms of the
                    amount as well as the scope of work covered by that agreed
                    fees. But the fact that there could be such evidential
                    difficulties does not mean that there could not be an oral
                    fee agreement touching on part of the work to be undertaken
                    by the solicitor. This may explain why, as a matter of good
                    practice, it is always desirable to reflect all fee
                    agreements in writing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Having said that, we would
                    caution that solicitors have the obligation to make
                    abundantly clear – both to the client and, if need be,
                    to the court – which specific part (or up to which
                    specific stage) of the transaction is covered by the agreed
                    fees. For the protection of the client, a solicitor cannot
                    be allowed to vary his agreed fees upwards at his
                    will.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue 3: Whether or not there is any reason to
                overturn the DT’s findings of fact with respect to the
                first two charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     We now turn to consider
                    the issue as to whether the Complainant had agreed with the
                    Respondent on an agreed fee in respect of each of the two
                    matters, namely, the Divorce Ancillaries and the Maintenance
                    Summons. The DT found that there was no agreement between
                    them on fees. The law is clear that an appellate court
                    should not seek to overturn a finding of fact which is based
                    on oral evidence and the veracity or credibility of
                    witnesses unless the lower tribunal had wrongly appreciated
                    the facts or the finding is plainly wrong or against the
                    weight of the evidence (see <em>Tat Seng
                        Machine Movers Pte Ltd v Orix Singapore Ltd</em>
                    [2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101 at [41] and <em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy</em>
                    [2011] 2 SLR 1157 at [42]). While we note that the principles
                    established in these two authorities relate to findings of
                    the lower courts which are up for consideration by the
                    appellate court, there is no good reason why the same
                    principles (of good sense and expedience) should not apply
                    in the present context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the present case, the
                    evidence is predominantly oral, essentially from
                    cross-examination. There are only a few pieces of objective
                    documentary evidence (<em>eg</em>, the
                    receipt issued for the $2000 in cash was dated
                    28 February 2009) and the findings of the DT could be
                    said to be based largely on witness credibility. There is,
                    however, one observation of the DT which gives us cause for
                    some concern and which we think warrants this court to
                    review the evidence and the findings of the
                DT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     At [19] of its Report, the DT
                    stated that the alleged agreement on fee “was not
                    pleaded in the Defence and was also not referred to in the
                    Respondent’s Opening Statement”. This comment
                    showed that the DT thought that the defence of an agreed fee
                    was an afterthought raised at the last minute at the DT
                    hearing. With respect, the comment is erroneous. In the
                    Opening Statement of the Respondent, it was averred that
                    “the full details of the Respondent’s Defence
                    are spelt from paragraphs 4 to 29 of his Affidavit Evidence
                    in Chief”. In his Affidavit of Evidence in Chief
                    (“AEIC”), the Respondent deposed at [11], in reference to the
                    $2,000 cash payment, that “[t]he Complainant paid
                    $2,000 as part of my agreed fees of $3,000 and he said that
                    he would pay the balance of my fees after the matter is
                    completed. I agreed.” Again at [13], the Respondent
                    stated “I submit that the Complainant was satisfied
                    with my work and agreed to my fees of <b>$3,000</b>” (emphasis in original). As
                    regards the $3,000 cheque payment, the Respondent stated at
                        [18] that
                        “<b>I told him that my fees [are]
                        $3,000 for the maintenance summons</b> ... The
                    Complainant agreed...” (emphasis in original). Given
                    the above, we have to be satisfied that this erroneous
                    perception of the Respondent did not unfairly colour the
                    DT’s assessment of the evidence of the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Having said that, the
                    burden is on the Respondent to prove that he had clearly and
                    unambiguously informed the Complainant that the two sums
                    paid would be his agreed fees for the two matters. As far as
                    the Complainant was concerned, he thought that he was
                    required to and so paid the two sums as deposits towards the
                    account of the Respondent’s fees in the two matters.
                    However, even both the Respondent and Mr Tan (a witness for
                    the Respondent) had described the sums as “only an
                    advance or initial payment”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> “an initial
                    fee for the maintenance”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> and
                    “initial advance fee”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> etc, words which
                    leave uncertainty as to what was exactly agreed. This is
                    really the difficulty confronting the Respondent’s
                    case. Where an agreed fee is not for handling the entire
                    matter, it is vitally important that what is covered by that
                    fee should be explicitly set out and agreed. His confusion
                    can be seen from the following
                        cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>

                            was there a discussion that your fee would be,
                            let’s say, $10,000 for the ancillary divorce
                            matters? Was there a discussion along those

                            inform you, see.” If---if at that point in
                            time we start telling him a sum, it---it---it will
                            be an unrealistic sum, and it will be speculative

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The First Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The DT found that the
                    $3,000 was meant to be the Divorce Ancillaries Contingency
                    Fee, and there was no subsequent agreement to convert the
                    $3,000 into an agreed fee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>

                    specify what evidence on which it relied in making that
                    determination, the cross-examination of the Respondent made
                    clear that no agreement could have been reached as to the
                    fees. The Respondent himself claimed that the meeting where
                    the fee agreement was allegedly made lasted “less
                    than 5 minutes” and took place when he “was
                    walking out [of his] door” while the Complainant was
                    going in.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> According to the
                    Respondent, the way in which he described to the Complainant
                    the conversion of the Divorce Ancillaries Contingency Fee of
                    $3,000 into a fee agreement for the Maintenance Summons was

</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It is difficult to
                    understand what the above spiel was even meant to
                    communicate, let alone come to an informed, reasoned fee
                    agreement based on that. Indeed, the Respondent claims that
                    in his hurry, he had erroneously written “initial
                    payment for MSS941/2009” on the receipt for the
                    $2,000 cash payment,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> when according to him
                    he should have written that the payment was for the Divorce
                    Ancillaries. The fact that the Respondent was in such a
                    rush, that he made such a crucial mistake, the little time
                    which he had talking to the Complainant and the lack of
                    intelligibility and clarity in what he said to the
                    Complainant, leave us in great doubt as to whether there
                    could have been an informed and reasoned fee agreement made
                    at the time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Accordingly we do not
                    think that it has been shown that the DT’s finding
                    with respect to the First Charge is erroneous. We would
                    affirm it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Second Charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In relation to the Second
                    Charge, the DT made its finding on the basis of the
                    following evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     The receipt
                        issued by the Respondent for the $2,000 stated that it
                        was “initial payment” for
                            “MSS941/2009”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> not an agreed
                        fee;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Respondent’s unsigned and
                        undated Bill No. B09-26teo also did not state that the
                        $2,000 was an agreed fee;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Complainant
                        stated in his AEIC that he was asked to pay the $2,000
                        as a deposit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We note that in
                    cross-examination the Complainant agreed that the
                    “$2,000 is part-costs for the ancillary
                        matter”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> But it could hardly follow
                    from this admission that there was therefore an agreement
                    between them as to a fixed fee for the Respondent handling
                    the Divorce Ancillaries. There is a leap in logic. Even
                    accepting, as the Respondent now alleges, that in issuing
                    the receipt for the $2,000 cash payment he had wrongly
                    stated the “cause” for which the payment was
                    intended, <em>ie</em>, it should be the
                    Divorce Ancillaries rather than the Maintenance Summons,
                    this still leaves open the question as to why he did not
                    state that that the payment was part payment of an agreed
                    fee instead of stating that it was “initial
                    payment”, an expression which can hardly connote an
                    agreed fee. Equally pertinent to note is that the
                    Respondent’s unsigned and undated Bill No. B09-26teo
                    also did not state that the $2,000 was payment towards an
                    agreed fee or part payment of an agreed fee. In this
                    connection, we would hasten to add that a lay client would
                    not likely know about the intricacies concerning the
                    accounts of a solicitor and which particular account his
                    payments to the solicitor should rightly be deposited into.
                    It is clear that the SA Rules were promulgated to protect
                    the interests of clients. It is vitally important that the
                    solicitor should make it absolutely clear to the client as
                    to the nature of the client’s payment. The burden is
                    on the Respondent to prove that the client understood the
                    nature of the payment which the client was required to make
                    to the solicitor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the result, we do not
                    think that there is sufficient basis for us to disturb the
                    DT’s finding with respect to the Second
                Charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">
<b>Issue 4: Whether the third
                    charge has been made out</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The Third Charge centred
                    on the scope of r 35(<em>a</em>) of the
                    PC Rules which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An advocate and solicitor shall inform the client
                        –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    of the basis on which fees for
                            professional services will be charged and the manner
                            in which it is expected that those fees and
                            disbursements, if any, shall be paid by the
                            client…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The question whether or
                    not a solicitor has complied with r 35(<em>a</em>) of the PC Rules is very much a question
                    of fact. It seems to us clear that the object behind the
                    rule is to ensure transparency in the way a solicitor
                    charges his client. In <em>Chua Swee
                        Keng</em>, which concerned the payment of overtime
                    fees, it was held by the DC that it was sufficient for the
                    solicitor to have explained that overtime would be payable
                    for her staff, stating her overtime rates, and providing a
                    detailed breakdown of overtime charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In relation to the present
                    case and the First Charge, for the reasons discussed at
                        <a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> to <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above, the Respondent
                    could not have adequately informed the Complainant of the
                    basis on which his professional fees were or would be
                    charged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     As regards the Third
                    Charge, the DT reached its conclusion based , <em>inter alia</em>, on the following
                    evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     The
                        Complainant’s AEIC and oral
                    evidence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Respondent’s concession
                        that he did not explain the basis and manner of his
                            fees;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Respondent’s admission that he had not replied to
                        any of the Complainant’s letters.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Respondent has not
                    persuaded us as to why the DT’s conclusion was wrong.
                    The only explanation the Respondent provided for not having
                    explained to the Complainant the basis on which his fees
                    were charged were that the $3,000 was a lump sum payment,
                    “there were no overtime charges or related fees which
                    called for an explanation from the Respondent”, and
                    that no explanation of hourly rates were needed because
                    “he did not have the practice of charging by the
                        hour”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> This does not quite answer
                    the question. The Respondent could have explained the
                    breakdown of what fees were charged for each stage of the
                    proceedings right up to just before trial, such as discovery
                    of means and assets, preparation of AEIC and so on. All that
                    the Respondent could say was that “$3,000 was a fixed
                    fee for all the work to be done by the Respondent up to the
                    resolution of the matter before trial”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>
                    This is hardly transparent enough for a client to be
                    sufficiently informed. Further, for the reasons which this
                    court in <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> to
                        <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above has ruled
                    that there was no agreed fees between the Complainant and
                    the Respondent on the two matters entrusted by the
                    Complainant to the Respondent, the Respondent’s
                    assertion that he had clearly explained the basis of his fee
                    charge to the Complainant leaves us in considerable doubt as
                    to the transparency of the explanation. Considered as a
                    whole, we find the Respondent’s evidence and
                    explanations unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Again, there is
                    insufficient basis for this court to interfere with the
                    DT’s findings with respect to the Third
                Charge.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     At this juncture, we ought
                    to highlight the fact that s 83(1) of the LPA, which
                    prescribed the sanctions which the court could impose on a
                    solicitor on due cause shown was amended in 2008 to provide
                    for the additional sanction of a monetary penalty of up to
                    $100,000 for disciplinary offences committed by solicitors.
                    The amended version (which is the current version) of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The first case which
                    imposed monetary penalty upon a delinquent solicitor
                    pursuant to s 83(1)(<em>c</em>) of the
                    LPA was <em>Law Society of Singapore v Andre

                    4 SLR 1184 (“<em>Andre
                        Arul</em>”), a seminal case where the court
                    of three judges laid down important guidelines as to when a
                    monetary penalty should be favoured over the more severe
                    (and sometimes crippling) sanctions of suspension or
                    disbarment. The misconduct in <em>Andre
                        Arul</em> related to overcharging under
                        s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the LPA
                    (grossly improper conduct). The court explained at [36] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This [monetary] penalty was introduced to enable
                        the court of three judges to impose fines for
                        disciplinary offences that are too serious to be
                        punished with mere censures, but insufficiently serious
                        to deserve the punishment of suspension from practice.
                        In our view, the disciplinary offence of overcharging
                        amounting to grossly improper conduct falls within this
                        category of disciplinary offences, provided no deception
                        or dishonesty is involved. <em>We hold
                            that the starting point in imposing a proportionate
                            penalty for overcharging amounting to grossly
                            improper conduct should be a fine in the first
                            instance, and not a suspension of the errant lawyer
                            from practice.</em> A fine, especially a heavy
                        fine, together with payment of the disciplinary
                        tribunal's and the Law Society's costs in the
                        proceedings, should generally be an adequate punishment
                        for the errant solicitor. Repeat offenders will, of
                        course, be penalised more severely.</p>

                        of cheating or deceiving the client</em>”
                    (at [38]). Further,
                    striking the solicitor off the roll is justified only
                        “<em>[i]n the most egregious cases
                        where cheating is involved </em><em>(such as where there are fabricated bills or invoices
                        for work which has not in fact been
                    done)</em>” (at [39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     It is clear, therefore,
                    that the distinguishing factor between an offence that
                    warrants a monetary penalty and one that warrants suspension
                    or disbarment is the element of <em>dishonesty</em> or <em>deceit</em>. Gross negligence may or may not be
                    sufficient; it will have to depend on the overall
                    circumstances. Do they come close to dishonesty? Where
                    dishonesty or deceit on the solicitor’s part is not
                    made out, the starting point should be a monetary
                    penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Counsel for the Law
                    Society relied heavily on <em>Prem
                        Singh</em>, where the court of three judges
                    imposed a two-year suspension for a solicitor’s
                    failure to place client moneys into a client account, as
                    required under r 3 of the SA Rules. The court stated at
                        [22]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rule 3 of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’
                        Accounts) Rules prescribes a mandatory requirement that
                        the client’s funds be placed into a separate
                        account. The purpose of this rule is to protect the
                        public and to instil public confidence in solicitors...
                        In our opinion, the respondent’s omission to place
                        the funds in his client account was a serious breach of
                        the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts)
                        Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     We agree that such
                    omission to place client moneys into a client account
                    constitutes a serious breach of the Rules, and may
                    constitute grossly improper conduct under s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the LPA. The past precedents
                    show that, prior to the 2008 amendment, the court would
                    invariably, impose a suspension even where no dishonesty is
                    proven or even alleged (<em>Tan Sok
                        Ling</em>). The case of <em>Tan
                        Chwee Wan Allan</em> is instructive. In that case,
                    the court of three judges found at [53] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There was no suggestion that the respondent had
                        behaved dishonestly. This was essentially a case of
                        professional oversight as a result of the
                        respondent’s sheer carelessness and inadvertence
                        in relation to staff supervision and the management of
                        his clients’ accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The court ordered the
                    respondent to be censured and imposed an undertaking on the
                    respondent not to practise as a sole proprietor for a period
                    of two years. <em>Tan Chwee Wan
                        Allan</em> is a perfect example of a case where
                    the court, unarmed with the enhanced sentencing options
                    under the new s 83 of the LPA, sought to temper justice with
                    mercy by ordering only a censure and imposing an undertaking
                    not to practise as a sole proprietor. The 2008 amendments
                    were designed to bridge the cavernous gulf between a censure
                    and suspension or disbarment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In our view, this is an
                    appropriate case to impose a monetary penalty. In the
                    circumstances of this case, the Third Charge is really
                    incidental to the First and Second Charges. While we note
                    that the Respondent has not pleaded guilty to the charges,
                    we are satisfied that he resisted the charges out of a bona
                    fide conviction, although we have held his belief to be
                    wrong, that he had reached an understanding with the client
                    on fees. It was also clear that there was no dishonesty or
                    deceit involved in what he did. If he had really thought
                    that he had done wrong with regard to his treatment of the
                    client’s payments, he would have wasted no time to
                    satisfy the demand of the client for a refund of the $3,000
                    which the client sought. Although failure to put client
                    moneys into a client account is a serious breach,
                    irrespective of the amount involved – and the two
                    amounts here were small – in our judgment a monetary
                    penalty in this case would be sufficient to satisfy the
                    considerations of “the importance of protection of
                    the public and maintaining public confidence in the manner
                    in which client’s money is to be handled and
                    safeguarded by members of the legal profession”
                        (<em>Prem Singh</em> at [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In considering the
                    appropriate quantum of monetary penalty to be imposed on the
                    Respondent there is a need to address the gravity and nature
                    of the Respondent’s misconduct in contradistinction
                    with the misconduct in <em>Andre
                        Arul</em>. Even absent dishonesty or deceit, the
                    misconduct of overcharging in <em>Andre
                        Arul</em> involved the <em>intention</em> to charge a client more than what
                    was fair and necessary. However, the situation here of the
                    Respondent putting the two sums of client money into an
                    office account is quite different in that it was borne of a
                    mistaken belief, rather than an intention to do an act that
                    is manifestly improper. Further, one other factor must also
                    be borne in mind – the sums involved in <em>Andre Arul</em> and those of the present
                    case. In <em>Andre Arul</em> the court
                    accepted the DT’s decision that a reasonable sum would
                    have been about $75,000, while the solicitor in fact charged
                    more than $226,000 – a differential of about $151,000
                    (at [40]). In this
                    case, the wrong only involved two small sums of $2,000 and
                    $3,000. Having regard to the <em>gravity</em> and <em>nature</em> of the misconduct, as well as the
                        <em>potential loss or injury</em>
                    to the client had the solicitor not been brought to task, it
                    is clear to us that the gravity of the misconduct committed
                    by the Respondent here is certainly lighter than that in
                        <em>Andre Arul</em> where a penalty
                    of $50,000 was imposed. Accordingly, we would impose a
                    penalty of $15,000. This should suffice as a specific as
                    well as a general deterrence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In the result, cause
                    having been shown, we order the Respondent to pay a penalty
                    of $15,000. He shall also bear the costs of the Law
