She could have brought an appeal as to whether the Commissioner had the power to receive her belatedly submitted notice of objection, or if his power to do so ceased because the Notice had crystallised into an order pursuant to s 24(3) of the WICA. The Commissioner referred to two High Court authorities that have found that s 29(1) allows an aggrieved claimant to appeal against decisions as to whether a notice of appeal of compensation has crystallised into an order under s 24(3): <span class="font-italic">Goh Yee Lan </span><span class="font-italic">Coreena and others v P &amp; P Security Services Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 4 SLR 1065 (“<span class="font-italic">Coreena</span><span class="font-italic"> Goh</span>”) at [24] and [25]; <span class="font-italic">Temasek</span><span class="font-italic"> Polytechnic and another v Poh Peng Ghee and others (Attorney-General, intervener) </span>[2019] 3 SLR 305 (<span class="font-italic">“</span><span class="font-italic">Temasek Polytechnic</span>”) at [19] to [32].

It is on that basis that s 24(3B) provides for the serious consequence that no appeal is allowed.

The substantial question of law was whether a notice of objection served by an employer’s insurer, and not the employer, constituted a valid objection by the employer for the purposes of s 24(3) of the WICA: at [4]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">Coreena</span><span class="font-italic"> Goh</span>, the plaintiff brought an appeal under s 29(1) of the WICA in relation to the substantial question of law as to whether the Assistant Commissioner’s decision to schedule a hearing under s 25D was valid, or if its power to do so had ceased because the notice of assessment that had been issued had become an order for payment pursuant to s 24(3): at [25]. Similarly, the case turned on whether an employer’s insurer’s objection constituted a valid objection by the employer under s 25(1): at [34] to [39]. On the facts, the insurer’s objection was not a valid objection under s 25(1), the notice of assessment thereby crystallised into a binding non-appealable order pursuant to s 24(3) read with s 24(3B), and the Commissioner ceased to have jurisdiction to hear the matter thereafter: at [38] to [39]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is clear that the plaintiffs in <span class="font-italic">Temasek</span><span class="font-italic"> Polytechnic </span>and <span class="font-italic">Coreena</span><span class="font-italic"> Goh </span>did not rely upon s 29(1) to bring appeals in circumstances similar to the Applicant. I thus disagree with the Commissioner that these cases<span class="font-italic"> </span>stand for the broader proposition that the Applicant may bring an appeal under s 29(1) of the WICA against the decision as to whether the Notice has crystallised into an order under s 24(3).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Crucially, the Applicant did not serve any notice of objection during the 14-day time period for objections. In comparison, objections were submitted during the requisite 14-day period in <span class="font-italic">Temasek</span><span class="font-italic"> Polytechinc </span>and <span class="font-italic">Coreena</span><span class="font-italic"> Goh</span>, albeit by the employers’ insurers. The two s 29(1) appeals thus concerned the question of whether those were valid objections under s 25(1) that prevented notices of assessment from crystallising into orders under s 25D pursuant to s 24(3). Here, s 24(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the WICA operated in a mandatory manner such that the Notice automatically crystallised after no objections were served in the 14 days from 1 March 2017. The Commissioner had no discretion in this regard, and made no “decision” against which an appeal may lie. Rather, it was by operation of s 24(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that the Notice became a <span class="font-italic">non-appealable</span> order for compensation thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 At this point, it would appear that the Applicant’s position that alternative remedies have been exhausted is correct in law. If, as parties accept, the Notice was served on the Applicant on 1 March 2017, the Applicant does not have recourse to the statutory avenue of appeal under s 29(1) of the WICA as the Notice crystallised into an order on 15 March 2017 pursuant to s 24(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). The Applicant’s belief that this was the case was corroborated by the position ACOL Loh took in his letter, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that s 25(2) required that he disregard the Applicant’s objection out of time because the Notice had already crystallised into an order by then (see [16] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I note, however, that the Applicant’s position regarding whether the Notice was properly served was inconsistent. In order to first establish that she exhausted all alternative remedies, the Applicant implicitly accepted that she was properly served the Notice, such that the timelines under s 24(3) of the WICA ran accordingly and the Notice crystallised into a non-appealable order against which an appeal under s 29(1) could not lie.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Yet in the later part of her submissions arguing for ACOL Loh’s decision on 25 July 2017 to be quashed, the Applicant stated that the Notice had been improperly served.

</div>
</div>
</div> Counsel for the Applicant stated in oral arguments that the personal service of the Notice on the Applicant had prejudiced her and that the Notice should have been served on her solicitors instead. The Applicant had sought legal representation because she did not understand what had to be done under the WICA. Given this improper service, ACOL Loh should have taken into account her objection out of time. His decision not to do so should be quashed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Notice was effectively served on 1 March 2017</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Applicant is not entitled to take an inconsistent position as regards service, given that the preliminary and substantive bases for judicial review are to be established cumulatively. The Applicant’s contradictory submissions therefore require that I make a finding as to whether the personal service of the Notice on the Applicant on 1 March 2017 was effective to trigger the timelines under s 24(3) of the WICA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Commissioner addressed this issue in written and oral submissions. He first argued that s 24(2) of the WICA only requires the Commissioner to “cause to be served” on the Applicant and her employer a relevant notice of assessment. Section 24(2) is facultative and not prescriptive. It does not require that documents be served only on the lawyers of legally represented person. Similarly, s 43, which specifies the methods by which documents may be served under the WICA, is also non-prescriptive. In any case, the effective informal service rule considered in <span class="font-italic">Progressive Builders Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Long Rise Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 5 SLR 689 at [22] to [38] applied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Commissioner then submitted that the Notice was effectively served on the Applicant on 1 March 2017. The Applicant had opened and read MOM’s sealed letter and the Honan cover letter which expressly stated that the cheque for $2,620 was for the Applicant’s claim for work injury compensation. She also deposited the MSIG cheque by 6 March 2017. Considering these facts together led to the “sole, logical conclusion” that the Applicant must have known that the cheque was in satisfaction of her WICA claim, and the amount stated on the cheque was as determined pursuant to the Notice. Even if she had not appreciated the legal significance of the Notice, she would have known that it concerned work injury compensation assessed by the MOM. It would not be unreasonable to expect that she would have forwarded the Notice to her solicitors, whom she had appointed for the purpose of assisting her with her WICA claim.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Notwithstanding the above, I am concerned that it is not clear from the facts that the date of service of the Notice for the purposes of s 24(3) of the WICA was 1 March 2017. The following are salient:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) By ACOL Tan’s admission, the Commissioner made an administrative error in sending the Notice to the Applicant c/o Pan Asia on 16 January 2017. MOM’s administrative lapse led ACOL Tan to be unaware that the Applicant’s solicitors had requested on 19 December 2016 for her WICA-related correspondence to be forwarded to them. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It appears that the Commissioner initially intended for the date of service of the Notice to be 16 January 2017. This was the (postdated) date of service listed on the notices of assessment sent to the Applicant c/o Pan Asia and to MSIG. It was clearly also the point at which the 14-day timeline under ss 24(3) and 25(1) of the WICA was supposed to begin running: ACOL Tan’s letter dated 9 January 2017 specified that the Applicant had until 30 January 2017 to object to the Notice.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) MSIG interpreted the date of service to be 16 January 2017. MSIG was supposed to issue the cheque for the compensable amount within 21 days after service of the notice if no objections were submitted within 14 days of service: see [10] above and s 24(4)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the WICA. As no objections were received by 30 January 2017, MSIG issued the cheque for the compensation amount of $2,620 and sent it to Honan. Honan then sent the cheque to Pan Asia, which received it on 14 February 2017. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The fact that the employer’s payment of the compensation amount (here, via the MSIG cheque payable to the Applicant) is supposed to <span class="font-italic">follow </span>the 14-day period for objection under s 24(3) of the WICA means that the Applicant should not have been handed the MSIG cheque on the same date the Notice was served on her. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The Applicant is, by her own account, not proficient in English.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Applicant’s 2nd Affidavit at para 14.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The MOM letter and the accompanying Notice were written in English.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Ms Juliana did not inform the Applicant what the contents of the sealed MOM letter were and that they were time-sensitive when she handed her the letter on 1 March 2017. It did not appear from the affidavit evidence that Ms Juliana explained to the Applicant that the MOM letter and Notice had been received on her behalf on 16 January 2017.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) ACOL Tan’s letter and the accompanying Notice only specified the date of service and the deadline for objections to be the original January dates. Nothing in the body of the letter (excerpted above at [15]) clarified to the Applicant that the Notice’s date of service should be taken to have shifted if she received the Notice and letter late.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Having considered the facts, I disagree with the Commissioner that the Applicant was in a position that enabled her to be aware that the sealed MOM letter contained a Notice that should have immediately been brought to the attention of her solicitors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 First, there are serious timeline consequences that follow from the date of service of the notice of assessment: if no objections are served within 14 days of the service of the notice, it crystallises into a non-appealable order. There is force in the Applicant’s argument that parties who convey that they are legally represented are generally entitled to assume that time-sensitive legal documents will be sent to their solicitors, who are trained and equipped to handle these matters and whom parties have put expense and time towards engaging.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Second, I find that the case involved such facts that adopting the Commissioner’s position would place an unduly unfair and onerous burden on the Applicant. Any layperson, let alone one not proficient in English, would have been confused in the circumstances. The Applicant had been handed a notice of assessment and an accompanying letter that specified a timeframe for objections that had expired by the time of her receipt of the documents. No explanation was provided as to what the letter and notice entailed, that legal consequences followed if she failed to submit objections within 14 days, or even that these documents had been received by Pan Asia while she was away. No express or implied indication was given to the Applicant and MSIG that the initial timelines for objections would be shifted backwards to accommodate the Applicant’s absence from work from January to 1 March 2017. It is reasonable for the Applicant to have assumed that any WICA-related documents would have been sent to her solicitors, and that she therefore did not act hastily. Although it would have been prudent of her to have shown her solicitors the MOM letter and Notice upon receipt, the Commissioner’s own administrative lapses contributed to the existing state of affairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Although the Commissioner placed weight on the fact that the Applicant deposited the MSIG cheque by 6 March 2017, I do not find this fact significant. The Applicant should not have been given the cheque with the Notice in the first place if her WICA claim was ostensibly still pending as at 1 March 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Finally, I note the interpretative approach taken by Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Pang Chew Kim (next of kin of Poon </span><span class="font-italic">Wai Tong, deceased) v Wartsila Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 1 SLR 15 (“<span class="font-italic">Pang Chew Kim</span>”) at [27]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> … It is clear that s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) enjoins courts to prefer an interpretation that would promote the purpose underlying any particular legislation. The WICA describes itself as being “[a]n Act relating to the payment of compensation to employees for injury suffered in the course of their employment”. Being a piece of social legislation, the WICA should be interpreted purposively in favour of employees who have suffered injury during their employment. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">At the same time, I recognise that the WICA framework was also intended to provide “one final stop” for the expeditious payment of compensation, thereby avoiding protracted legal proceedings: <span class="font-italic">Selvam</span><span class="font-italic"> Raju v Camelron General Contractors and another</span> [2010] 2 SLR 1113 at [9]. Nevertheless, balancing the goals of simplicity and expedition against the need to ensure fairness to the Applicant, I find that the balance in this case tips in favour of the latter goal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 This is not to say a similar outcome will be reached in every case. I recognise that the Commissioner would usually have great discretion to determine how service under the WICA should be effected. However, the administrative errors on the Commissioner’s part and the unique facts in this case mean that service of the Notice was not effected on 1 March 2017. Effective service only occurred, at the earliest, on 18 April 2017, when the Applicant handed the Notice to her solicitors. As the Applicant’s objection was submitted on the same day, the Notice had not crystallised into an order by virtue of s 24(3) of the WICA. An appeal under s 29(1) may thus be brought against ACOL Loh’s decision on 25 July 2017 not to consider the Applicant’s objection dated 18 April 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I therefore find that the Applicant’s alternative remedies have not been exhausted, and dismiss her application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The effect of the Commissioner’s letter dated 22 February 2019</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 As required under O 55 rr 2(1) and 3(2) of the ROC, an appeal under s 29(1) of the WICA must be brought by originating summons within 28 days after the date of the “judgment, order, determination, or other decision” being appealed against. Although any appeal against ACOL Loh’s decision would now be out of time, leave for an extension of time may be granted by the court hearing the s 29(1) appeal: see <span class="font-italic">Coreena</span><span class="font-italic"> Goh</span> at [26] to [29]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Commissioner stated in his 22 February 2019 letter (excerpted above at [28]) that the Government will not object to such an application for leave, but I leave it to him to decide if he wishes to maintain that position in the present circumstances. I would note only that the Applicant’s case is that she elected to apply for leave to commence judicial review on the understanding that the Notice had crystallised into an order, thus barring an appeal under s 29(1) of the WICA: see [24(b)] above.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Applicant failed in her application for leave to commence judicial review, but on the basis that her right to appeal under s 29(1) of the WICA had not been exhausted as her objection to the Notice was properly raised. The matter is now in the hands of the Applicant, who must decide if she wishes to proceed with that route.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the circumstances, I am not minded to order costs, but will hear parties on this through separate directions.
