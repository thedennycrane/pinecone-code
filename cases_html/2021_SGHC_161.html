</div> He submitted that since the FJC can only grant a DEO but not an interim DEO, the High Court cannot grant an interlocutory injunction that amounts to an interim DEO. I disagreed.

I rejected that completely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 By giving the FJC the power to grant DEOs, Parliament did not curtail the High Court’s power to grant injunctions. In particular, the fact that the FJC has been given the power to make DEOs, but no power to make interim DEOs, cannot mean that the High Court is powerless to grant an interlocutory injunction for the protection and personal safety of an applicant. That is absurd. To the contrary, the FJC’s lack of power to make an interim DEO all the more justifies an applicant seeking relief from the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">SUM 2536 should not be deferred until after SUM 2693</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In the alternative, Dr Nithiananthan contended that SUM 2536 should only be heard after SUM 2693 – his subsequent application for Mdm Ambihathevi to be medically examined as to her mental capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 He contended that because he had put in issue Mdm Ambihathevi’s mental capacity, the court should not proceed with the injunction application until after his application for Mdm Ambihathevi to be medically examined had been dealt with.

As mentioned at [24] above, he filed an affidavit on 8 June 2021 claiming to hold the property on trust for Mdm Ambihathevi “and for the family” (which would include himself). From cl 3 of the Will, however, and as Dr Nithiananthan represented to IRAS, Mdm Ambihathevi is the <span class="font-underline">sole</span> beneficiary of the Property. The Will does not purport to give Dr Nithiananthan any beneficial interest in the Property.

It is not a principle in the sense of being capable of application in all cases or capable of explaining what courts do in all cases. It is a factor, no doubt often a strong factor, which the court will take into consideration when granting a mandatory injunction. The stronger the case appears at this stage, the lesser the risk of being proved wrong at the trial. However, the court, of necessity, has to consider other relevant factors, such as the conduct of the parties and whether damages instead of an injunction are an adequate remedy. <span class="font-underline">The strength of a party’s case (reaching a </span><span class="font-underline">‘high assurance’ or ‘clear case’ standard) is neither a necessary, nor is it a sufficient, condition for the grant of a mandatory injunction</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 While the “high assurance” test is a useful generalisation, the Court of Appeal had earlier emphasised that it is important to distinguish between fundamental principles and guidelines, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, useful generalisations.  The Court said (<span class="font-italic">Chuan Hong </span>at [88]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… a fundamental principle is that the court should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been wrong at trial in the sense of granting relief to a party who fails to establish his rights at the trial, or of failing to grant relief to a party who succeeds at the trial. We agree with Hoffmann J that <span class="font-italic">the guidelines for the grant of both kinds of interlocutory injunctions are derived from this principle</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 That fundamental principle was reiterated in <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings International Inc v Loh Choon Phing Robin</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2017] 2 SLR 997 (at [28]), with the Court of Appeal adding (at [31]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The need for caution arises from the recognition that an interim mandatory injunction is a more invasive remedy and, as such, may lead to irreversible prejudice to a defendant. A court must therefore be sure, in accordance with the fundamental principle described above, that the grant of the interim mandatory injunction is indeed the course of action which carries the lower risk of injustice – in other words, that the prejudice to the applicant from not granting the interim mandatory injunction outweighs that to the defendant from granting it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the present case, the injunction is mandatory in effect. But that is only because Dr Nithiananthan is presently residing at the Property. If he were residing elsewhere, then an injunction excluding him from the Property would merely be a prohibitory one. Either way, the prejudice Dr Nithiananthan suffers from not being able to stay at the Property is the same; the difference lies in him having to leave the Property in the present circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On the other hand, not granting the injunction will have the effect of keeping Mdm Ambihathevi out of the Property. Dr Nithiananthan said the Property is his home, but it is also Mdm Ambihathevi’s home. Just as Dr Nithiananthan would suffer prejudice from having to leave the Property, Mdm Ambihathevi would suffer prejudice in not being able to return home.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Dr Nithiananthan said Mdm Ambihathevi is free to return, and the EO that she had already obtained should provide her with some assurance (although no assurance is really needed).

My conclusion was that the course of action which carries the lower risk of injustice, is to allow Mdm Ambihathevi to stay at the Property, and to require Dr Nithiananthan to leave the Property and stay elsewhere.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Mdm Ambihathevi is the sole beneficiary of the Property under the Will, and has been recognised as such by Dr Nithiananthan. He has also acknowledged (at least to IRAS) that he is “merely” or “only” the executor and trustee appointed under the Will (see [22]-[24] above). He did not tell IRAS that he had any interest in, or right to stay in, the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In the present proceedings, Dr Nithiananthan has sought to use his position as executor and trustee, and the powers he claimed cl 7 of the Will gives him, to refuse to transfer the Property to Mdm Ambihathevi and instead indefinitely stay there himself (on the basis that he can retain the Property as a family home, for the family – in effect, himself). I preferred to allow the sole beneficiary to reside at the Property, rather than the executor and trustee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Moreover, besides Mdm Ambihathevi’s pending claim for a transfer of the Property, there were also her allegations against Dr Nithiananthan which are going to trial in the FJC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 If a high degree of assurance were required to grant the injunction, I had that degree of assurance in the present case. The merits of the FJC application, and the OS, remained to be determined.  Nevertheless, I considered Mdm Ambihathevi to have the better of the argument that, as the sole beneficiary under the Will, she is entitled to have the Property transferred to her. Dr Nithiananthan’s assertion that he is holding the Property on trust for Mdm Ambihathevi <span class="font-underline">and for the family</span> (including himself) (see [26] above) seems to go against the terms of the Will. As for his reliance on cl 7 of the Will, his claim that that allows him to retain the Property (and stay there indefinitely) does not sit well with cl 3 which gives all of the late Mr Jeevarajah’s property to Mdm Ambihathevi absolutely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Dr Nithiananthan has filed an affidavit from the solicitor who prepared the Will.

</div> In relation to Mr Premananthan’s share, this is provided for in cl 6(a) of the Will (see [20] above). But there is no equivalent in relation to Mdm Ambihathevi’s interest – to the contrary, cl 3 simply says that all of Mr Jeevarajah’s property is given to Mdm Ambihathevi absolutely.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Finally, Mdm Ambihathevi is 83 years old, and she has no other property. Dr Nithiananthan is in his 60s, a medical doctor, and he owns another property at Marine Terrace. Dr Nithiananthan’s position is that his mother, Mdm Ambihathevi, should fend for herself if she did not want to return home to the Property (with him continuing to live there). I considered that Dr Nithiananthan is better able to fend for himself, than Mdm Ambihathevi for herself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 At the conclusion of the hearing, I indicated my view that the course which carries the lesser risk of injustice, was to require Dr Nithiananthan to move out. I asked if he would do so voluntarily, as an alternative to me granting the interlocutory injunction. He declined to do so. Instead, his counsel indicated that an expedited appeal would be filed, and sought a stay until after the hearing of that appeal.

</div> I did not agree to such a stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Mdm Ambihathevi is staying with a family friend who will be leaving the country on 29 June 2021. If I did not require Dr Nithiananthan to vacate the Property by 28 June 2021, Mdm Ambihathevi would not return home with Dr Nithiananthan still there. A stay would mean that come 29 June 2021, Mdm Ambihathevi will have to fend for herself in terms of accommodation. I did not think that was right.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In the course of argument, Mdm Ambihathevi’s counsel acknowledged that the usual undertaking as to damages had been omitted, and indicated that a further affidavit would be filed to rectify that
