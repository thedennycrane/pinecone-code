<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1. The Plaintiff averred that the Defendant borrowed $700,000

from him pursuant to an agreement dated 7 Oct 1998 and that despite demands made by him

for repayment, the Defendant failed and refused to repay the said loan.

<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. The writ of summons was served on the Defendant by way of

substituted service towards the end of Dec 2000. On 10 Jan 2001, judgment in default of

appearance was entered against the Defendant for the amount of $700,000, interest and

costs. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. On 26 Apr 2001, the Defendant applied to set aside the default

judgment and for leave to enter an appearance and to defend the action. The Defendant, an

Indonesian citizen, stated in her affidavit that she was not in Singapore between 28 Nov

2000 and 15 Jan 2001 and was not residing in the flat (54 Toh Tuck Road #02-09 Signature

Park, Singapore 596745) at which substituted service of the writ of summons had been

effected and that the Plaintiff was aware of these facts. She also sought to defend the

action on the merits. On 25 May 2001, the Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court set aside

the default judgment on the ground that it had not been regularly obtained. This was

without prejudice to the Plaintiff’s right to proceed under Order 14 of the Rules of

Court.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The Defence and Counterclaim was then filed. On 21 Sep 2001, the

Plaintiff filed his Reply and Defence to Counterclaim and, at the same time, applied for

summary judgment pursuant to Order 14 of the Rules of Court. The Assistant Registrar

granted the Defendant unconditional leave to defend. The Plaintiff appealed.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>

The Plaintiff’s affidavit of 21 Sep 2001</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. The Plaintiff claimed that the $700,000 in question was the amount

paid by him on the Defendant’s behalf to acquire the said Signature Park property and

that the Defendant had acknowledged the debt in a document dated 7 Oct 1998 prepared by

her solicitor who had also explained its contents to her. This document was in the

following terms :</p>

<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. The Plaintiff explained that the Defendant was his

"companion" (ie mistress) in Indonesia. When the riots began in Indonesia in May

1998 and Indonesians of Chinese descent were targeted, he wanted to ensure the

Defendant’s safety and therefore brought her to stay in Singapore temporarily. To

enable the Defendant to remain in Singapore for a longer period, he asked her to apply for

a study visa and to enrol in some educational courses until the situation calmed down back

home. He provided her the necessary funds to do this.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. Initially, the Defendant stayed in a hotel here and the Plaintiff

would visit her there. Being a prominent businessman both in Indonesia and in Singapore,

meeting her frequently in the hotel was not the best thing to do. He wanted a place where

they could meet more discreetly and therefore instructed the Defendant to look for an

apartment to buy. Further, the property market here was in the doldrums and it was a good

time to buy for investment purposes.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. Although the Plaintiff had a home in Cluny Park, Singapore, he was

frequently in Indonesia. When the Defendant selected the Signature Park property, the

Plaintiff approved the purchase and the price as it was suitably private and unlikely to

draw much attention to the 2 of them.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. The Defendant liaised with the estate agent and the sellers and the

option to purchase the property was taken out in her name. The Plaintiff was not happy

with this but decided, on further reflection, that it would be better not to have his name

on record. However, to protect his interest in the property, he wanted a document prepared

that would secure the recovery of his money when the property was sold. That was why the

Defendant instructed her solicitor to prepare the Acknowledgement of Debt document dated 7

October 1998. That was signed around 14 October 1998, the date of completion of the

purchase. It was unclear why it was back-dated although the Plaintiff explained in his

second affidavit that it was intended to have legal effect from the day the Defendant took

possession of the property.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. There was no dispute that the funds for the said purchase were

entirely furnished by the Plaintiff and that the Defendant could not have afforded to buy

the property on her own. However, the property was never intended as a gift by the

Plaintiff to the Defendant.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. The Plaintiff claimed that the Defendant made some handwritten

amendments in the Indonesian language to the draft of the Acknowledgement of Debt which he

agreed to. He said the amendments pertained to the last paragraph on the forgiveness of

debt but corrected this in his subsequent affidavit as the amendments actually concerned

his discretionary power of sale.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. The Plaintiff exhibited a letter dated 21 May 2001 from his

solicitors to the law firm (M/s Ganesha &amp; Partners) which dealt with the conveyancing

and the Acknowledgement of Debt. In that letter, his solicitors asked certain questions

relating to the Acknowledgement of Debt. M/s Ganesha &amp; Partners’ reply, contained

in their letter of 22 May 2001, stated that they received instructions to draft the said

document from the Defendant on or about 7 October 1998. The solicitors also stated that

they understood from the Defendant that the handwritten amendments to the draft were

proposed by the Plaintiff. The letter also stated that Mr Ganesha explained to the

Defendant the nature and the contents of the document and told her at the same time that

the Plaintiff had informed them that the purpose of the document was to enable the

Defendant to explain to the Singapore Government or authorities how she was able to

acquire the said property in case inquiries were made. Her solicitors were satisfied that

the said document would satisfy the purpose of showing the source of funds.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The Defendant’s affidavit of 18 October 2001</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. The Defendant was born in Surabaya, Indonesia, on 13 April 1975.

The Plaintiff is about 80 years old. She first met the Plaintiff, one of the richest men

in Indonesia, in Jakarta in March 1992 when she was about 17 years old. She had gone to

Jakarta, after completing High School, with an aunt to visit her cousin who was then also

a "companion" of the Plaintiff and being maintained by him in a house bought by

him for her. The aunt was the mother of the said cousin.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. Initially, the Plaintiff did not know the Defendant was staying in

the cousin’s house as she would stay out of sight upstairs. In May or June 1992, his

body guards informed him of her presence. She was then introduced to the Plaintiff who

invited here to lunch but she declined. One or two weeks later, she returned to Surabaya.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. She passed her High School examinations and wanted to study

economics at tertiary level but could not afford to do so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16. In February 1993, she met the Plaintiff again when he went to

Surabaya with the cousin during Chinese New Year. The Plaintiff told the Defendant that if

she needed a job after graduation from university, she could approach him for help.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17. In 1994, the Defendant went to work in a factory in Taiwan for

about half a year. In 1995, she decided to study Economic Management in Universitas Putra

Bangsa. She worked during the day and attended lectures in the evening.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18. In December 1996, she gave up her studies and moved to Semarang to

live with her brother. She worked as a bank teller from February to June 1997.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19. When she became jobless and had no one to turn to for support, she

decided to contact the Plaintiff. He invited her to Jakarta and she went there with a very

close friend, Magdalena Kurniawati Limanto, in August 1997. She regarded Magdalena as her

sister. They stayed in a hotel arranged by the Plaintiff. The costs of the trip by air and

the hotel charges were borne by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20. The Plaintiff visited them and told the Defendant that he had

separated from her cousin. She was to learn from him subsequently that he had wanted to

sell the house which was in her cousin’s name but she was unwilling to do so.

Subsequently, her cousin sold the house without the Plaintiff’s knowledge, kept the

proceeds of sale and moved back to Surabaya.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21. The Plaintiff then informed the Defendant that he had feelings for

her since their first meeting in 1992. He told her that he would take care of her and her

family if she would "marry" him. He would buy her a house and take care of all

her material needs for the rest of her life.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22. On 7 September 1997, they "married" in a hotel in

Jakarta. The Defendant stayed in hotels and the Plaintiff visited her from time to time.

He told her he was looking for a suitable house to buy for her. About 2 months later, the

Plaintiff arranged for her to move into a house owned by his company and provided a

company car for her use. He forbade her from working, saying he wanted her to concentrate

on looking after him.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23. When the riots broke out in Jakarta in May 1998, the Plaintiff was

out of Indonesia. He did not return home but came to Singapore instead. He arranged for

the Defendant to move to Surabaya for a few days and then to Singapore where she stayed in

the Apollo Hotel. The Plaintiff stayed with his family in the Cluny Road bungalow. He

would visit her and spent time with her in the hotel room from time to time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24. After a couple of weeks, the Defendant returned to Jakarta as

instructed by the Plaintiff who remained in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25. In June or July 1998, the Plaintiff told her that as the situation

in Jakarta was volatile, it was best for her if he bought a property for her in Singapore

where she would live in comfort and safety. He asked her to look for a freehold property

in Districts 9, 10 or 11.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26. The Defendant, her sister and her brother then came to Singapore

for this purpose. They stayed in the Apollo Hotel and were introduced by the duty manager

to an estate agent (who is the wife of Mr Ganesh and who introduced the Defendant to his

law firm). After viewing several properties, they were brought to Signature Park where 2

units were for sale. After negotiations, she agreed to purchase the unit in issue for

$700,000/-. The Plaintiff was informed by telephone. The property was purchased in the

Defendant’s name as requested by the Plaintiff who paid the purchase price.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27. At the Plaintiff’s request, the Defendant returned to Jakarta

on 10 September 1998 and proceeded to buy furniture and other accessories for the

Signature Park property. These were then shipped to Singapore in a container. She also

purchased other items in Singapore for the property. All these were given to her by the

Plaintiff for her use.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28. In October 1998, the Defendant and her "sister",

Magdalena, moved into the said property. The Plaintiff would visit and spend time with the

Defendant from time to time. He told her that he wanted her to execute a document to

explain how she came to own the property and that such a document was necessary for her

protection because the Singapore Government might want to investigate how she was able to

make the purchase. Having no knowledge of Singapore law and having absolute trust in the

Plaintiff, with whom she was having a very good relationship, she agreed to execute such a

document.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29. The contents of the document were dictated by the Plaintiff to

Magdalena in the Indonesian language. He then instructed Magdalena to bring the draft to

Mr Ganesh and to instruct him to prepare the document in English. When that had been done,

the Plaintiff dictated some amendments thereto to Magdalena who wrote them out in the

Indonesian language on the draft. The amended draft was then faxed by the Defendant to the

lawyer on 14 October 1998.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30. The Defendant, accompanied by Magdalena, then went to the

lawyers’s office to sign the document. Mr Ganesh explained the contents to her but

also said at the same time that the Plaintiff had informed him that the purpose for the

preparation of the document was to enable the Defendant to explain to the Singapore

Government or authorities how she was able to acquire the property in case inquiries were

made. Since this was the same reason mentioned by the Plaintiff, the Defendant signed the

document. The document was signed by the Plaintiff in the Signature Park property after it

was interpreted to him by Magdelena.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31. The Defendant resumed her studies while in Singapore. She took an

English course at Inlingua for about 3 months and also studied English at the British

Council for about 1 month. Magdalena also took up courses here. All the expenses of the

Defendant were paid for by the Plaintiff who also bought her a new BMW 520i.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32. Around March 1999, the Plaintiff told the Defendant he wished to

acquire some more properties in Singapore. He wanted to buy another property for her so

that she could live in one and earn rental income from the other and thus would have no

financial worries for the rest of her life. They were very much in love then and the

Defendant cried because she was deeply moved by the Plaintiff’s feelings and concern

for her. The Plaintiff then bought for her a property at 28 Scotts Road #03-04

("Scotts 28") again funding the entire purchase.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33. Shortly thereafter, the Plaintiff told the Defendant that he would

like her to sign the same kind of document for Scotts 28 that she did for the Signature

Park property, repeating the reason for the need to do that. Similarly, ignorant of the

law here and trusting the Plaintiff completely, the Defendant was prepared to sign the

document requested by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34. Soon thereafter, the Plaintiff stunned the Defendant one day by

confessing to her that he had developed feelings for her "sister", Magdelena,

and wanted her to be another of his "wives". The Defendant was deeply hurt but

said nothing to him. The Plaintiff pestered her to persuade Magdelena to be his

"wife". The Defendant told Magdelena about this and she was shocked. She

declined the proposal and told the Plaintiff so.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35. Thereafter, the Plaintiff’s attitude and feelings towards the

Defendant changed. He became very insistent that the Defendant sign the aforesaid document

in respect of Scotts 28 and the Defendant began to be suspicious about his true intentions

towards her. She therefore kept delaying the execution of the document with excuses. That

led to quarrels. The Defendant kept reminding the Plaintiff of his earlier assurances to

her that both the properties were hers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36. Around May 2000, the Plaintiff told the Defendant that they should

move back to Jakarta where he had prepared a house owned by one of his companies for her.

He therefore wanted her to execute a power of attorney for him to sell the 2 properties in

Singapore, claiming that he had lost the document of 7 October 1998. By this time, she was

sure that the Plaintiff was trying to get rid of her and she refused to execute any such

document, leading to frequent quarrels. During the quarrels, he also said he wanted to

sell the 2 properties as he was in financial difficulties. It became obvious to the

Defendant that the Plaintiff was angry that Magdalena had rejected his advances and wanted

to vent his anger on the Defendant because she kept refusing to persuade Magdalena to be

his "wife".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37. In order to escape the frequent quarrels, the Defendant and

Magdelena left Singapore on 28 November 2000 and had no further contact with the

Plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38. The Defendant maintained that there was never any loan given by the

Plaintiff to her as she was clearly in no position to repay any loan of such a substantial

amount. She maintained that the Signature Park property was a gift to her. The title deeds

were in her possession all this time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39. The Defendant claimed she had been misled about the contents and

the effects of the Acknowledgement of Debt document of 7 October 1998 which was never

intended to be a binding loan document. This was further buttressed by the fact that the

Plaintiff had requested her to execute a power of attorney in his favour in November 2000

to enable him to sell the Signature Park property. There would be no need for a power of

attorney if the document of 7 October 1998 was intended to be valid and enforceable. She

also had a counterclaim against the Plaintiff for damages for conversion as he had removed

all her movable properties in the Signature Park property.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Magdalena’s affidavit of 18 October 2001</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40. Magdalena stated that she met the Defendant in High School in 1989

and became so close to her that each regarded the other as a sister. She went with the

Defendant to meet the Plaintiff in August 1997 as she also intended to seek his help in

getting a job. On the second day of their stay in Jakarta, the Plaintiff gave her some

money and asked her to go shopping as he had something to discuss in private with the

Defendant. When she returned to the hotel, she was told by them that they were getting

"married".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41. She confirmed that the Plaintiff had told the Defendant that he was

looking for a house in Jakarta to purchase for her. When they moved into the house owned

by the Plaintiff’s company, the Plaintiff forbade the Defendant to work and told

Magdalena not to work as well so that she could keep the Defendant company. Both of them

had to massage the Plaintiff daily. The Plaintiff gave Magdalena some money monthly for

her expenses.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42. In Singapore, Magdalena was with the Defendant at all material

times save for the moments of intimacy between the Plaintiff and the Defendant in their

bedroom. She was therefore able to confirm what the Defendant said in her affidavit.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43. As for the Plaintiff’s proposal to her, she was shocked as she

had always regarded him as her brother-in-law. She did not give him an answer immediately

as she wanted to figure out a way of telling him without hurting his feelings. The

Plaintiff subsequently asked her in front of the Defendant whether she would

"marry" him, offering her a condominium unit in Gardenville at 10 Walshe Road.

She requested the Defendant to leave them alone and then told the Plaintiff that she could

not "marry" him. He became very angry, telling her that he had never been

rejected by anyone. He also became angry with the Defendant because he felt the Defendant

should have persuaded Magdalena to "marry" him. His attitude towards them

changed and he started pestering the Defendant to sell the Scotts 28 property.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44. They had no hint at all that the Plaintiff was contemplating legal

action against the Defendant. Magdalena tried her best to patch things up between the

couple but failed as the Plaintiff was adamant about selling both properties and was

insistent about the Defendant having to sign certain documents that he had instructed Mr

Ganesh to prepare. The Defendant had no knowledge what those documents were although the

Plaintiff did tell her that one of them was a power of attorney. She knew that the

Defendant was not prepared to sign anything. She had no doubt that the 2 properties were

gifts by the Plaintiff to the Defendant as they had a very loving relationship at the

material time until Magdalena’s rejection of his proposal.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Plaintiff’s affidavit of 23 November 2001</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45. The Plaintiff in response stated that he acceded to the

Defendant’s request to let Magdalena live with her as they were very close to each

other and the Defendant was afraid to live alone.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">46. Although he paid for the two properties and the furnishings, he

never told the Defendant that they were gifts to her. There was no reason to buy them as

gifts as he had already purchased a house for the Defendant in her hometown of Surabaya in

January 1998. In early 2000, he arranged for the property to be completely rebuilt for her

as a permanent home and the house was ready in October 2000.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47. He had always intended to set up home for the Defendant in

Indonesia. She is an Indonesian Citizen. He spent much of his time in Indonesia and it

would be convenient for him to visit her there. Her study visa was temporary. The purchase

of the two properties in Singapore during the downturn was for his investment purposes

and, at the same time, would provide the Defendant with accommodation here. It was

ludicrous that he would give the Defendant the two properties worth more than S$3million

when she was unable to live in Singapore permanently to enjoy them. It would make far

better sense if he were to give her cash instead.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48. The Scotts 28 property is the subject of a separate legal action.

At the time it was being purchased in 1999, the Plaintiff had serious health problems and

was hospitalized on many occasions. The Defendant sought to take advantage of his poor

health and advanced years and tried to take away the Scotts 28 property from him. That was

the cause for the unhappiness in the middle of 2000 when he found out and not any alleged

spurning by Magdalena in whom he had no romantic interest and who was married to the

Defendant’s brother.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49. The Defendant had failed to arrange the documentation instructed by

the Plaintiff in respect of Scotts 28. Further, when the Plaintiff wanted to sell it, she

told him that it was tenanted, she had taken 2 years of rent in advance which was placed

in fixed deposit and she wanted to use the interest as additional living expenses

especially during the periods of his prolonged absence. Scotts 28 was never rented out.

She had sold the BMW 520i within a year without telling him. She lied that the courses she

had enrolled in were for much longer periods and took money from him to pay for them.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50. The Defendant was now more interested in enriching herself at the

Plaintiff’s expense and that was why she and Magdalena were making the allegations

contained in their affidavits.</p>

The Decision of the Court</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51. The Defendant contended that Mr Ganesh had said that the "sole

purpose" of the Acknowledgement of Debt document of 7 October 1998 was to show the

source of the Defendant’s funds. Since that was the "sole purpose" for the

Defendant to sign the document, it did not matter anymore what other words were in the

document although those other words were explained by the lawyer. It was further argued

that if the Plaintiff had an unexpressed purpose in mind, then he had deceived the lawyer.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52. The Defendant relied on the decision of the Privy Council in <i>Tyagaraja

Mudaliar &amp; Another v. Vedathanni</i> [1936] MLJ Rep. 62, an appeal from India. There,

a document only intended to create evidence of the undivided status of a Hindu family

included an agreement that the widow signing the document relinquish her claims for

maintenance. When the widow sought to recover arrears of maintenance, it was held that

oral evidence in disproof of the alleged agreement, that the document was never intended

to operate as a agreement but was brought into existence solely for the purpose of

creating evidence of some other matter, stood exactly on the same footing as evidence that

a signature was forged. Such oral evidence could therefore be adduced.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53. The Defendant submitted that it was a question of fact what exactly

the document of 7 October 1998 was meant to be. The Plaintiff had not denied the purpose

was as indicated by the lawyer. His solicitors had asked Mr Ganesh whether that was one of

the purposes but Mr Ganesh replied otherwise. The Defendant was not told that the other

provisions in that document were to make it an enforceable loan agreement.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54. It should be noted that the widow in that case had refused to sign

the document when it was presented to her 3 days after her husband’s death. She was

induced to do so 2 days later by representations that it would not be acted on and that

its only purpose was to provide evidence of the undivided status of the family. The

Defendant in our case was under no pressure of any sort, emotional or otherwise. Indeed,

she said that the relationship between her and the Plaintiff then was a very loving one.

There was not even any evidence that the document had to be signed in a great hurry.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55. There was no doubt that Mr Ganesh did tell her what the Plaintiff

said the purpose of the document was. The lawyer certainly did not tell her that that was

the sole or only purpose or that the other clauses were thrown in as decoys and were not

meant to be acted upon. The stated purpose was true in any event and was achieved –

the document did show that the money came from the Plaintiff as a loan and not as a gift

and the other provisions reinforced that fact rather than detracted from it to any extent.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56. What was so sinister about this purchase anyway? It was not as if

the Plaintiff was not entitled under Singapore law to make the purchase and was using the

Defendant as a front to fool the authorities here. Their relationship was very good and

the money was his to do as he pleased. What need was there for him to trick the Defendant

in any way? If it was meant to be a gift from lavish "husband" to beloved

"wife", why not just say so?</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57. The evidence showed that Mr Ganesh faithfully and accurately

explained everything to the Defendant who raised no protest or query about the terms,

obviously because that was the understanding she had with her "husband", her

provider of all material things. The amendments pertaining to the power of sale must have

come from the Plaintiff rather than the Defendant, contrary to the Plaintiff’s

assertions, but that did not change anything of substance here. Indeed, it would be

further evidence of the Plaintiff wanting to be doubly sure there was no doubt who owned

the property, which would be the Defendant’s only if the Plaintiff should pass away

without having dealt with the property.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58. Clearly, the Defendant had no defence to the Plaintiff’s claim

and had raised nothing that would merit a trial. I therefore allowed the Plaintiff’s

appeal and gave judgment as claimed. I awarded the Plaintiff $5000/- costs for the entire

action.</p>
