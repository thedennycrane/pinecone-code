Where the plaintiff in a claim for breach of contract proves the breach but fails to prove loss or damage, should his claim be dismissed or should it be allowed with nominal damages awarded? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The full facts are set out in the District Judge’s Grounds of Decision in <span class="font-italic">Youprint</span><span class="font-italic"> Productions Pte Ltd v Mak Sook Ling </span>[2022] SGDC 131 (the “GD”). Suffice it to say that the appellant sued the respondent (a former employee) in the District Court for breach of her employment contract. The District Judge found that the respondent had breached her employment contract, but the appellant had not proved loss. The District Judge also declined to make an order for an account of profits because it had not been pleaded and, in any event, ordinary compensatory damages were available as a remedy save that the appellant had not adduced sufficient evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The District Judge did not award nominal damages to the appellant. Instead, he dismissed the appellant’s claim, relying on <span class="font-italic">LighthouseCarrwood</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Luckett</span> [2007] EWHC 2866 (QB) (“<span class="font-italic">LighthouseCarrwood</span>”) (GD at [18]). In that case, the English High Court struck out a claim for breach of contract for the following reasons (at [84]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… To win the case, the Claimant must prove liability and prove that he has sustained a computable loss. One without the other is no good. What is the merit in establishing liability if no provable loss can be shown to flow from the breach? I have to say that, even if the case were to go ahead on the issue of liability and the Claimant were to win on liability, the Claimant will be faced with the costs bill in any event, in all probability from this particular judge, having been unable to establish any part of its claim other than liability for no remedy. Accordingly, the sensible thing to do, and I do, is to make the final step which I am asked to make and strike out the whole of the claim. I only add this observation. In my judgment this is a strike out in name only. What I am really doing is ruling that the Claimant’s case fails because it cannot, on the evidence which it is allowed to place before the court, establish a crucial part of that case. Thus there has to be a judgment in favour of the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The appellant argued that the District Judge was wrong in dismissing its claim outright and that he ought to have allowed the claim and awarded nominal damages instead. The respondent supported the District Judge’s decision, relying on <span class="font-italic">LighthouseCarrwood</span>. I agreed with the appellant. In my view, the District Judge’s decision was wrong as a matter of law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The innocent party is always entitled to claim damages <span class="font-italic">as of right</span> for loss resulting from breach of contract: see <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another appeal </span>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 at [40]; <span class="font-italic">Denka Advantech Pte Ltd and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Seraya Energy Pte Ltd and another and other appeals</span> [2021] 1 SLR 631 at [60]. Breaches of contract are actionable without proof of damage, but recovery of substantial damages requires proof of such loss: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Contract in Singapore</span> vol 2 (Andrew Phang Boon Leong gen ed) (Academy Publishing, 2022) at para 20.073. If the claimant fails to prove either the fact of damage or the quantum of its loss, only nominal damages may be awarded: <span class="font-italic">Biofuel Industries Pte Ltd v V8 Environmental Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2018] 2 SLR 199 (“<span class="font-italic">Biofuel</span>”) (at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The position is explained in <span class="font-italic">Butterworths Common Law Series</span><span class="font-italic">: The Law of Damages</span> (Andrew Tettenborn gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2010) (“<span class="font-italic">The Law of Damages</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>as follows, at paras 2.05–2.07 and 2.09:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.05</span> A fundamental fault-line runs through the English law of obligations. It divides wrongs into two categories: (1) those for which proof of loss is an essential ingredient, and (2) those which are actionable <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. In cases in the former category, which importantly includes the torts of negligence, nuisance, deceit and the economic torts, no cause of action at all arises unless and until some loss is suffered by the claimant. In the latter, any infringement is automatically wrongful, and damages are available as of right whether or not any loss is suffered. It follows from this that, if no other recoverable loss is proved, the claimant still has a right to nominal damages. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.06</span> … nominal damages are essentially symbolic. The giving of them is only appropriate where no actual recoverable loss is shown. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.07</span> For the purpose of the award of nominal damages, wrongs actionable per se include all breaches of contract …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2.09</span> …where a claimant proves a breach but no recoverable loss, the court has effectively no choice but to award nominal damages. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The District Judge noted (GD at [18]) that <span class="font-italic">LighthouseCarrwood</span> was recently cited in <span class="font-italic">Phua</span><span class="font-italic"> Seng Hua and others v Kwee Seng Chio Peter and another </span>[2022] SGHC(A) 11 at [46]. However, in that case, the Appellate Division had cited <span class="font-italic">LighthouseCarrwood</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>for the principle that a claim for <span class="font-italic">Wrotham Park</span> damages has to be pleaded. The question as to whether a breach of contract is actionable as of right was not in issue in that case and nothing in the Appellate Division’s grounds of decision can be said to have approved the statement in <span class="font-italic">LighthouseCarrwood</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that was relied on by the District Judge. In my view, in so far as <span class="font-italic">LighthouseCarrwood</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>decided that a claim for breach of contract fails if loss cannot be proved, it was wrong and should not be followed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The respondent also relied on <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 (“<span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and <span class="font-italic">Biofuel</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In <span class="font-italic">Biofuel</span>, the Court of Appeal referred to<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay</span> and stated as follows (at [42]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay</span>, we recognised that there were two competing considerations that a court should take into account when assessing damages – while the claimant bears the burden of proving the fact and amount of loss, and therefore must adduce sufficient evidence to quantify the damage, in some cases, absolute certainty and precision as to the quantum of damage would be impossible to achieve (see [30]). … The starting point remains that ‘a plaintiff cannot simply make a claim for damages without placing before the court sufficient evidence of the loss it has suffered even if it is otherwise entitled in principle to recover damages’ (<span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay </span>at [31]). It is only ‘where the [claimant] has attempted its level best to prove its loss <span class="font-italic">and </span>the evidence is cogent’ that the court will allow it to recover the damages claimed even if the quantum of loss cannot be determined with exact certainty (<span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay</span> at [31]) [emphasis in original].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The respondent submitted that the appellant was not entitled to nominal damages as it had not shown that it had attempted its level best to prove its loss and adduce cogent evidence.<span class="font-italic"> </span>I disagreed with the respondent’s submission. The references to the claimant having attempted its level best to prove its loss were made in the context of proof of substantial damages, not nominal damages: see <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay </span>at [27] and <span class="font-italic">Biofuel</span> at [40]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 I would add that where the trial is not bifurcated and the claimant succeeds in proving breach of contract but recovers only nominal damages because it fails to prove loss, generally, the claimant ought to be awarded costs. The quantum of costs may, of course, take into account the fact that the claimant has failed to prove loss. On the other hand, where the trial is bifurcated and the claimant fails to prove loss during the hearing for the assessment of damages, the claimant would generally either recover no costs or be ordered to pay the costs of the assessment. This is because at the assessment hearing, the only issue is the quantum of loss and a claimant who merely receives nominal damages has effectively lost: <span class="font-italic">The Law of Damages</span> at para 2.15.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In the present case, the appellant confirmed that it was not seeking costs of the trial below but submitted that it should be awarded costs of the appeal. The respondent pointed out that it had made an offer to settle before the hearing of this appeal. The terms of the offer to settle were more favourable to the appellant than my decision in this appeal. However, the respondent submitted that there should be no order as to costs in respect of this appeal. In the circumstances, I made no order as to costs in respect of this appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 In conclusion, I allowed the appeal, set aside the District Judge’s order dismissing the appellant’s claim and awarded the appellant nominal damages fixed at $1,500. Finally, I made no order as to costs of this appeal. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Roche Eng Keng Loon (R.E.
