The Wife took out the present application (“the Application”), seeking to strike out the Action under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, Rev Ed 2014) (“Rules of Court”), on the basis that the Action disclosed no reasonable cause of action and claimed no relief against her. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In February 2018, the Husband and the Wife obtained an Interim Judgment of divorce, and proceeded to have ancillary matters heard in the Family Courts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The ancillary matters dispute concerned two properties, which I shall refer to as “the First Property” and “the Second Property” (collectively, “the Properties”). It is undisputed that the Properties were purchased during the marriage, in the joint names of the Husband and the Son, and that the Husband and the Son hold the Properties as joint tenants. The Wife contended in the matrimonial proceedings that the Properties were matrimonial assets as they were acquired by the Husband during the course of the marriage. She therefore asked for an appropriate share of the Properties under s 112 of the Women’s Charter, seeking <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span> the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that the First Property be sold in the open market, and the sale proceeds (less the costs and expenses of sale) be divided between the Husband and her in the proportion of 60:40; or, alternatively, if the Husband wished to retain the First Property, for the Husband to pay to her a sum equivalent to half of its open market value; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the Second Property is a matrimonial asset for division between the Husband and her.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Husband denied the Wife’s claims on the Properties. In relation to the First Property, he pleaded that his intention at the time of the purchase was to ensure that his children and his aged parents would have a roof over their heads, and that upon his demise this property would go to the Son. As for the Second Property, he pleaded that it was purchased for the Son’s benefit and interests, that the Son had repaid him the down payment, and that the Son has been paying the mortgage instalments. The Husband therefore claimed that he and the Son were beneficial owners of the First Property, while the Son was the beneficial owner of the Second Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Family Courts stayed the ancillary matters proceedings, so that civil proceedings could be taken out to determine the proprietary interests in the Properties. The Husband and the Son thus commenced the Action to seek the following:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(1)  A declaration [that] the [Husband] and [the Son] are the beneficial owners of [the First Property]; in the alternative</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(2)  A declaration [that] the [Wife] does not have any beneficial interest in [the First Property]; </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(3)  A declaration [that] the [Son] is the beneficial owner of [the Second Property]; in the alternative</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(4)  A declaration [that] the [Wife] does not have any beneficial interest in [the Second Property]; </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(5)  Costs; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(6)  Such further or other relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Wife applied to strike out the Action under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court, on the basis that there was no reasonable cause of action and no relief claimed against her.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ Arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 3 October 2018, I heard oral arguments by counsel for the Wife, Mr Yong Hong Kit Clement (“Mr Yong”) and counsel for the Husband and the Son, Mr Decruz Martin Francis (“Mr Decruz”). Further written submissions were tendered in late October 2018 to address four queries that I had raised. On 19 November 2018, prior to the rendering of this judgment, I invited counsel to address me on O 15 r 16 of the Rules of Court, as this rule appeared to be of importance in determining the Application and neither set of counsel had argued on it (see [14] below). Counsel’s arguments are summarised in the following paragraphs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Mr Yong confirmed that the Wife was seeking a share of the Properties only in the context of the ancillary matters proceedings, and was not claiming any legal or beneficial interest in the Properties arising from property law. He raised numerous contentions for striking out the Action: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, prayers 1 and 3 seek declarations that the Husband and the Son are beneficial owners of the Properties and, as such, can only be sought against legal owners of the Properties. This is because unless and until there is a separation of the legal and equitable estate, there can be no separate equitable title (citing <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669 at 706).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Wife, not being a legal owner of the Properties, has no capacity to divest equitable estate. As such, prayers 1 and 3 reveal no reasonable cause of action and no relief sought against the Wife. The proper approach is, instead, for the Son to be named as the plaintiff, bringing an action against the Husband as the defendant, with the Wife having the option of intervening in the proceedings; this would be more in line with the approach in <span class="font-italic">UDA v UDB </span>at [54]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A third party claiming an interest in any property alleged to be a matrimonial asset is entitled to have his rights ruled on by the court and is, further, entitled to the benefit of a final ruling which he can assert against the rest of the world. If the third party wants to directly assert those rights, what should he do? <span class="font-italic">He can, of course, and should commence independent civil proceedings against either or both the spouses (depending on the factual situation) for a declaration as to his interest and other relief.</span> … (emphasis added)</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, it is unclear how prayers 2 and 4 are alternatives to prayers 1 and 3, because if the court finds (under prayers 1 and 3) that the Husband and the Son are beneficial owners of the Properties, it would follow that the Wife has no beneficial interest in the Properties. In any event, the Action is the wrong forum for determining the Wife’s beneficial interest in the Properties; rather, it is for the Family Courts to determine the Wife’s share in the Properties under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. The Action is therefore a “premature [attempt] to thwart the Family Court’s jurisdiction to determine the Wife’s beneficial interests in the [Properties], and is not helpful to the proceedings which will resume in the Family Court”.

It would serve “no useful practical purpose” to have declarations which do not specify, in percentages, the Son’s and Husband’s respective interests in the Properties. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Prayers 2 and 4 would serve “no useful practical purpose” as the issue is not whether the Wife has a share in the Properties, but rather, what exactly the Husband’s share in the Properties is. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Mr Decruz’s arguments were as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Action does not preclude the Family Courts from determining proceedings under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. This is because the nature of the interest under s 112 of the Women’s Charter is different from the nature of a beneficial interest that arises from the operation of property law.

These arguments did not address the impact of O 15 r 16 of the Rules of Court on the Application; rather, they related to the question of whether the Action was an attempt to thwart the Family Courts’ jurisdiction, a point which I address at [30]–[34] below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I therefore turn to analyse O 15 r 16 of the Rules of Court and its implications for the Application. The rule provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Declaratory judgment (O. 15, r. 16)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">16</span>. No action or other proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make binding declarations of right whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 From a plain reading of the rule, it is clear that a claim would not be struck out on the ground that the plaintiff is seeking “merely declaratory judgment or order”, whether or not there are claims for “any consequential relief”. In <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another appeal </span>[2006] 1 SLR(R) 112 (“<span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas</span>”), the Court of Appeal elaborated on this rule and the requirements for obtaining declaratory judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As explained in <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas</span>, while every claim must be founded on a reasonable cause of action, O 15 r 16 of the Rules of Court provides an exception where the plaintiff seeks only a declaration of right (<span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas </span>at [13]). Conceptually, the rule does not mean that such a plaintiff has a reasonable cause of action by virtue of seeking declaratory relief; rather, it is an “exception to the general principle” that a claim must be founded on a reasonable cause of action (<span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas </span>at [13]). There is good reason for this position: declaratory relief is generally superfluous where a plaintiff has a subsisting cause of action (<span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas </span>at [13], citing Lord Diplock’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers </span>[1978] AC 435 (“<span class="font-italic">Gouriet</span>”)).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The requirements to be satisfied before a court would grant declaratory relief are (<span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas </span>at [14]): </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(a) the court must have the jurisdiction and power to award the remedy; </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(b) the matter must be justiciable in the court; </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(c) as a declaration is a discretionary remedy, it must be justified by the circumstances of the case; </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(d) the plaintiff must have <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring the suit and there must be a real controversy for the court to resolve. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(e) any person whose interests might be affected by the declaration should be before the court; and</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(f) there must be some ambiguity or uncertainty about the issue in respect of which the declaration is asked for so that the court’s determination would have the effect of laying such doubts to rest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Element (d) in the cited passage bears further elaboration. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong v Attorney-General </span>[2012] 4 SLR 476 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong</span>”), the Court of Appeal explained that the <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas </span>test laid down three elements for establishing <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>, <span class="font-italic">viz</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [115]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There must be a real interest in bringing the action.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There must be a real controversy between the parties concerned. This element goes to the court’s discretion (<span class="font-italic">contra </span>jurisdiction) to grant declaratory relief, and stems from the judicial function of adjudicating disputes between parties rather than determining hypothetical or academic questions (<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [115], [132], [137] and [143]; see also <span class="font-italic">Principles of Civil Procedure </span>at paragraph 25.033). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) There must be a violation of a right that is personal to the applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The upshot of the principles above is that declaratory relief is unlikely to be available in situations such as the following:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) where the declaration sought is in relation to rights that the claiming party could not claim for itself (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas </span>at [19]–[20] and <span class="font-italic">Meadows Indemnity Co Ltd v Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc and International Commercial Bank plc </span>[1989] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 298); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) where the rights between the parties have already been resolved by a judgment of court and therefore the controversy had ended, subject only to the right of appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Salijah bte Ab Latef v Mohd Irawan bin Abdullah Teo</span> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 80 (“<span class="font-italic">Salijah</span>”) at [63]); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) where the declaration sought is in relation to theoretical issues as opposed to real, subsisting problems, which would require the court to declare the law generally or provide an advisory opinion (<span class="font-italic">Salijah </span>at [60], <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas </span>at [19]–[21] and <span class="font-italic">Gouriet </span>at 501), unless the circumstances are such that the declaration will be of value to the parties or the public (<span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Hong </span>at [143]; see also <span class="font-italic">Principles of Civil Procedure </span>at paragraph 25.003).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Whether the requirements for declaratory relief as set out above are satisfied is to be considered and finally determined by the court hearing the Action. At this interlocutory stage, it suffices to note that there is presently no indication that the Statement of Claim fails to meet these requirements. The declarations sought are brought by the Husband and the Son, who are legal (and allegedly beneficial) owners of the Properties, and who therefore have a real interest in bringing the Action for a declaration of rights relating to the Properties. Prayers 2 and 4 seek declaratory relief <span class="font-italic">directly </span>against the Wife in the form of declarations that she has no beneficial interest in the Properties under property law, while prayers 1 and 3 <span class="font-italic">indirectly</span> affect the Wife’s interests because, if granted, would have an effect similar to prayers 2 and 4, and would also have an impact on the Wife’s interests in the pending matrimonial proceedings in relation to the quantification of matrimonial assets.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I would add for completeness that even if<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Wife did not intend to assert any beneficial interest in the Properties under property law (which is not currently a pleaded position), this would not constitute a lack of “real controversy” in the context of the <span class="font-italic">Karaha Bodas </span>test (see [20(b)] and [21] above). As already alluded to, the determination of the Husband’s and Son’s interests in the Properties would affect the Wife’s ability to subsequently claim an interest in the Properties under s 112 of the Women’s Charter: depending on whether the declarations are granted, a significant part of the Properties may be taken out of the pool of matrimonial assets altogether. As such, Mr Yong’s assertion that the Wife did not intend to claim any beneficial interest in the Properties under property law is no bar to the declaratory relief sought, and does not justify striking out the Action. Indeed, the Wife’s pleading of such a position may well entitle the Husband and the Son to a judgment on an admission of facts (under O 27 r 3 of the Rules of Court) or summary judgment (under O 14 of the Rules of Court), at least in relation to prayers 2 and 4. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As such, in view of O 15 r 16 of the Rules of Court and the circumstances of the present case, I decline to strike out the Action under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was there a misjoinder of parties? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I turn next to address Mr Yong’s argument to the effect that there has been a misjoinder of parties. From the outset, it ought to be emphasised that a misjoinder of parties would not, in the ordinary course, justify a striking out of the Action. In this regard, O 15 r 6(1) of the Rules of Court provides: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties (O. 15, r. 6)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">6.</span>—(1) No cause or matter shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder or nonjoinder of any party; and the Court may in any cause or matter determine the issues or questions in dispute so far as they affect the rights and interests of the persons who are parties to the cause or matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 This provision, as with other provisions in O 15 r 6 of the Rules of Court, seeks to “save rather than to destroy, to enable rather than to disable and to ensure that the right parties are before the court” (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yow Kon v Tan Swat Ping </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 881 at [36]; see also <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure </span>at paragraph 15/6/2 and Jeffrey Pinsler SC, <span class="font-italic">Principles of Civil Procedure </span>(Academy Publishing, 2013) (“<span class="font-italic">Principles of Civil Procedure</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at paragraph 07.019). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As such, even if<span class="font-italic"> </span>Mr Yong is correct that the situation envisaged in <span class="font-italic">UDA v UDB </span>at [54] is for the third party to commence independent civil proceedings against<span class="font-italic"> </span>either or both of the spouses (see [9(a)] above), this ought not to be taken as laying down a hard and fast procedural rule on precisely how parties ought to be joined to the civil proceedings. Indeed, it bears noting that the Court of Appeal had also expressed the view that either spouse may commence the separate legal proceedings to determine the proprietary interests <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>a third party (see <span class="font-italic">UDA v UDB </span>at [56(b)]). Ultimately, the point is that all relevant parties should be before the court in determining the property dispute.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As against this backdrop, Mr Yong has not demonstrated how the fact that the Husband and the Son are joint plaintiffs would fall foul of O 15 rr 4 and 6 of the Rules of Court, or prejudice the Wife in the Action. The only argument mustered in support of Mr Yong’s position (that the Husband ought to be a defendant rather than a joint plaintiff) was an assertion that the Husband and the Son “have opposing interests”,

</div> with no authorities cited to buttress the argument. In my view, it is not evident as to how or why their interests are said to be opposed when they are in fact seeking identical reliefs in the Action. In any event, O 15 r 6(1) of the Rules of Court would prevent the Action from being defeated on the basis of an alleged misjoinder; it expressly envisages that the court may “determine the issues in dispute … so far as they affect the rights and interests of the persons who are parties to the cause or matter”. As the Husband, the Son and the Wife are all parties to the Action, there does not appear to be any reason why the action cannot proceed with the parties as currently lined-up. In the circumstances, there is no basis to compel either the Husband or the Son (who, it should be added, are currently represented by the same legal counsel) to assume the mantle of a defendant, when their interests are aligned and they consent to be joint plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 There is therefore no reason to strike out the Action on the basis of a misjoinder of parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was the Action an attempt to thwart the Family Courts’ jurisdiction? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I turn next to Mr Yong’s argument that the Action was a premature attempt to thwart the Family Courts’ jurisdiction. As a preliminary point, this argument does not fall within the Application, which is premised on O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court; it would instead more appropriately be canvassed under other limbs of O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court, such as, “abuse of process”. However, for completeness, I address this argument as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I have difficulty understanding Mr Yong’s position on this argument.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, a declaration of beneficial interests in the Action does not thwart the jurisdiction of the Family Courts in determining a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. The principles underlying property disputes in civil proceedings are distinct from those underlying proceedings under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. In the former, the court determines the proprietary interests of the parties in accordance with areas of law such as property, equity and trusts or succession; in the latter, the court treats matrimonial assets as “community property”, to be divided justly and equitably between the spouses according to the principles set out in s 112 of the Women’s Charter. The long line of authorities establishing such a jurisprudential and conceptual distinction include: <span class="font-italic">UDA v UDB </span>[2018] 3 SLR 1433 at [27] (cited in <span class="font-italic">UDA v UDB </span>at [10]), <span class="font-italic">JAF v JAE </span>[2016] 3 SLR 717 at [17], <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another </span>[2008] SLR(R) 108 at [80]–[81] and <span class="font-italic">Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye </span>[2007] 3 SLR(R) 520 at [40]; see also <span class="font-italic">Law and Practice of Family Law in </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore </span>(Valerie Thean JC editor-in-chief &amp; Foo Siew Fong gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2016) at paragraph 4.2.2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Where a spouse’s proprietary interests under property law is found, in matrimonial proceedings, to fall within the pool of matrimonial assets, these will be liable for division under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. In dividing these assets, the Family Courts may well award the respective spouses the requisite beneficial interests which operate <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>on the matrimonial assets (see <span class="font-italic">Central Provident Fund Board v Lau Eng Mui </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 826 at [7]). However, these interests are conceptually different from the spouses’ proprietary interests <span class="font-italic">prior </span>to the division of assets. As Mr Yong recognised in his further submissions, even if the Wife is found in the Action to have no beneficial interest in the Properties, this would not preclude the Family Courts from subsequently apportioning part of the Husband’s share in the Properties to her, thereby giving her a proprietary interest in the Properties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 As such, I am unable to see how the declarations sought would thwart the jurisdiction of the Family Courts under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. Quite the contrary, a judicial pronouncement in the Action on these proprietary interests will provide useful assistance to the Family Courts in determining the pool of matrimonial assets. It will also assist the Family Courts in ascertaining a just and equitable division of the assets; in this regard, it bears noting that s 112(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Women’s Charter imposes a duty on the court to consider “the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets”. As observed in Leong Wai Kum, <span class="font-italic">Elements of Family Law </span><span class="font-italic">in Singapore </span>(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2013) at 546, albeit in the context of s 59 of the Women’s Charter, having declarations of the spouses’ respective proprietary interests could “make the court’s task in the application for division of matrimonial assets easier as their respective property holdings have become determined”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Do the declarations serve any useful practical purpose? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I turn finally to Mr Yong’s argument that the declarations do not serve any useful practical purpose. Whether the declarations serve a useful practical purpose is a factor for the court’s consideration in determining whether to exercise its discretion to grant declaratory relief (<span class="font-italic">Latham Scott </span>at [74]–[75]). At this interlocutory stage, there appears to be a useful practical purpose for the declarations, as explained in [34] above. This is, however, subject to the Statement of Claim being amended as mentioned in [36] below.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the light of the foregoing, I decline to strike out the Action under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court. However, I order that the Statement of Claim be amended to expressly plead the material facts relating to the precise percentage share of beneficial interests that the Husband and the Son respectively claim in the Properties, the basis for these claims, and how these interests are said to arise. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Justin Yeo<br/>Assistant Registrar</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Decruz Martin Francis (Shenton Law Practice LLC) <br/>for the Plaintiffs; <br/>Louis D’Souza and Yong Hong Kit Clement <br/>(Legal Aid Bureau) for the Defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
