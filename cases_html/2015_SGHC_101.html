<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns the ability of the majority
                    shareholder of a company to conduct a meeting to allow him to put to the vote
                    essentially his vision of how the company should proceed. The minority
                    shareholders, namely his mother and siblings opposed his plans, and declined to
                    attend the meetings called by him, rendering these meetings inquorate. I granted
                    his application to have a quorum of one. The minority shareholders have
                    appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Mr Lim Yew Ming, the plaintiff and majority
                    shareholder of Aik Chuan Construction Pte Ltd (the first Defendant, hereafter
                    ‘Aik Chuan’), sought to have the company, previously active only in
                    the construction industry and boarding business, move into the renewable energy
                    sector. His desire to expand the company’s activities into this new area
                    ran up against the concerns of the 2<sup>nd</sup> to
                        7<sup>th</sup> defendants (“the Defendants”).
                    The Defendants are the other shareholders of Aik Chuan, and are also the
                    Plaintiff’s family members. These Defendants chose not to attend
                    extraordinary general meetings (“EGMs”) called by him on two
                    occasions in 2014 depriving him of the needed quorum. The case thus turns on
                    whether the property rights of the majority shareholder should be vindicated, or
                    whether he is constrained from pursuing his vision by the other
                    shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Plaintiff by Originating Summons 1043 of
                    2014 (“OS 1043/2014”), sought an order against Aik Chuan and the
                    Defendants under s 182 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, Rev Ed 2006) (“the
                    Companies Act”) that a quorum of one be sufficient for a general meeting
                    of the members or shareholders of the company. Aik Chuan did not take an active
                    part in the proceedings. After hearing arguments, I granted the order. The
                    Defendants have now pursued the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Plaintiff has 51.5%, of Aik Chuan. He is
                    also the Managing Director. The remaining 48.5% is held by other family members,
                    namely Lim Yew Soon, Lim Yew Ghee, Lim Yew Chee, Lim Po Lin, Lim Yu Lin, and
                    Neoh Siew Inn (the mother of the Plaintiff). Lim Yew Soon (the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant) and Lim Po Lin (the
                        5<sup>th</sup> Defendant) are the other directors. Aik Chuan
                    Construction, as the name suggests is active primarily in construction work in
                    Singapore, though it has also gone into boarding and lodging
                houses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In 2013, the Plaintiff sought to get into the
                    renewable energy business, incorporating AC Global Energy Pte Ltd (“AC
                    Global”) in December 2013. A contract was subsequently entered into on 1
                    February 2014 to construct a biomass plant in Tennessee, the United States. AC
                    Global was to invest in the biomass plant, funded by an increase in AC
                    Global’s paid up capital, and a $32m loan from Hitachi Capital Singapore
                    Pte Ltd, which would be obtained to pay for the construction costs of the
                    biomass plant. The Hitachi Loan in turn required a personal guarantee from the
                    Plaintiff, a corporate guarantee, and an irrevocable banker’s guarantee of
                    $3.2m over AC Global’s performance of its obligations. To provide the
                    $3.2m bank guarantee, a first charge over Aik Chuan’s fixed deposit
                    accounts had to be given to the bank, CIMB Bank Berhad. This was signed by the
                    Plaintiff and the 5th Defendant. The application for the bank guarantee and a
                    letter of authorisation in respect of the bank guarantee was signed by the
                    Plaintiff and the 6<sup>th</sup> Defendant (an authorised
                    signatory). The bank guarantee was approved. Subsequently, the Plaintiff and the
                        5<sup>th</sup> Defendant signed a resolution approving the
                    corporate guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Plaintiff then considered financing the
                    Biomass Project by other means through project financing with the United
                    Overseas Bank (“UOB”). The project financing supposedly offered
                    better terms, and the possibility of enrolling on to an IE Singapore supported
                    programme. IE Singapore approved AC Global’s application to be part of the
                    programme. The UOB facility required a personal guarantee from the Plaintiff,
                    and a corporate guarantee from Aik Chuan. However, at this point, the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Defendants
                    declined to sign the corporate guarantee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Plaintiff sought to convene an EGM on 8
                    October 2014 for the removal of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        5<sup>th</sup> Defendants as directors. General meetings are
                    governed by Article 54 of Aik Chuan’s Memorandum of Articles of
                    Association (“Aik Chuan’s Articles”), which states the
                    following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any director may whenever he thinks fit convene an extraordinary general
                        meeting, and extraordinary meetings shall be convened on such requisition or
                        in default may be convened by such requisitionists as provided by the
                        Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Quora at general meetings are governed by
                    Article 57 of Aik Chuan’s Articles, which state the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of
                        members is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business, and
                        continues to be present until the conclusion of the meeting. Save as herein
                        otherwise provided, two members present in person shall be a
                        quorum…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Article 58 specifies what happens if there is no
                    quorum:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is
                        not present, the meeting, if convened upon the requisition of members, shall
                        be dissolved; in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the same day in
                        the next week at the same time and place, or to such other day and at such
                        other time and place as the directors may determine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Defendants refused to attend this EGM, and
                    no quorum could be formed. The Plaintiff attempted to have a
                        2<sup>nd</sup> EGM on 1 November 2014 to consider the
                    appointment of other persons as directors of Aik Chuan. The Defendants again
                    refused to attend, and the meeting was again inquorate. No issues were raised as
                    to the propriety of the requisitions for these meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Plaintiff’s Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Relying on s 182 of the Companies Act, and the
                    English case of <em>Union Music Limited v Russell John Watson
                        &amp; Anor</em> [2003] EWCA Civ 180 (“<em>Union
                        Music</em>”), interpreting a provision <em>in
                        pari materia</em>, the Plaintiff contended that the inability to
                    convene a meeting with a quorum because of the 2nd to 7th Defendants’
                    refusal to attend amounted to an impracticability, allowing the Court to order
                    the meeting to proceed on a quorum of one. It was further argued that minority
                    shareholders do not have a right of veto through the quorum
                requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It is said that the Defendants had in
                    defending their position made allegations which that were irrelevant to the
                    Plaintiff’s application. The Defendants justified their stand on the
                    ground that the agreement to invest in the Biomass Project was only on the basis
                    that the Company would not invest more than $6.5m in the project. Any balance
                    was to be raised by AC Global on its own. The Plaintiff contended that the
                    Defendants, or at least the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        5<sup>th</sup> Defendants, knew all along that the financial
                    support required went beyond $6.5m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In addition, the actions of the Plaintiff are
                    intended to further the interests of Aik Chuan. In contrast, the Defendants seek
                    to pressure the Plaintiff into agreeing to enter a share swap between these
                    Defendants’ shares in Aik Chuan, and the Plaintiff’s interests in
                    the companies controlled by these Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Defendants’ Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Defendants argued that s 182 is not
                    engaged as there is no deadlock in the running of Aik Chuan’s business;
                    that as Aik Chuan is a family business, the Defendants had the right to use the
                    quorum provision to defend their interests. The Court should not grant an order
                    under s 182 as the Plaintiff merely sought to further his personal
                    project.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Defendants also contended that there was
                    an agreement that Aik Chuan would not need to lend more than $6.5m to a related
                    company for the purposes of the Biomass Plant. This assurance led the Defendants
                    to agree to that loan. Subsequently however, the Plaintiff informed them that
                    $15m was needed. This additional sum was objected to by these Defendants as they
                    saw this as going beyond the agreement that had been reached. As it was, a
                    subsidiary of Aik Chuan was caused by the Plaintiff to provide the Biomass
                    entity with funds for the project. The Plaintiff requisitioned two EGMs: the
                    first to remove the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                        5<sup>th</sup> Defendants as directors of Aik Chuan, and the
                    second to appoint two persons friendly to him on to the board of directors. The
                    Defendants declined to attend both EGMs, leading to the present
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The main issue in this case was whether the
                    Plaintiff should be permitted to proceed with a quorum of one at a meeting of
                    Aik Chuan to approve his preferred course of action. In resisting the
                    application by the Plaintiff to do so, the Defendants relied on local cases
                    which, they contend, recognise the right of shareholders to effectively boycott
                    company meetings and veto proposals by their absence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Grouping the issues a little differently from
                    the parties, for ease of discussion, the issues in the present case are
                    thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The operation of s 182 Companies
                        Act</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     ‘Impracticability’ and the court’s exercise of discretion
                        under s 182 of the Companies Act</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether minority shareholders are entitled in Singapore
                        to cause a lack of quorum; in particular,</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_17-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       whether a different
                            approach applies to family run companies; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_17-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       whether a family agreement
                            is a sufficient basis to depart from the general position under s 182 of
                            the Companies Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I drew no distinction between membership and
                    shareholding in the company in my decision as the issue did not
                arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The operation of s 182 of the Companies Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The portion of s 182 of the Companies Act
                    relevant to the present case reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If for any reason, it is impracticable to call a meeting in any manner in
                        which meetings may be called or to conduct the meeting in the manner

                        motion or on the application of any director or of any member who would be
                        entitled to vote at the meeting or the personal representative of any such
                        member, order a meeting to be called, held and conducted in such manner as
                        the Court thinks fit, and may give such ancillary or consequential
                        directions as it thinks expedient, including a direction that one member
                        present in person or proxy shall be deemed to constitute a
                        meeting.…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The section thus provides in the present
                    circumstances that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     if it is impracticable to call a

                        considers fit, and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     give consequential directions, including a direction that a quorum of
                        one will suffice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The approach has been laid down in <em>Union Music</em> in clear terms. The case looked at s 371 of
                    the English Companies Act 1985, which is <em>in pari
                        materia</em> with s 182:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_1"></a>(1)     If for any reason it is
                        impracticable to call a meeting of a company in any manner in which meetings
                        of that company may be called, or to conduct the meeting in the manner
                        prescribed by the articles or this Act, the court may, either of its own
                        motion or on the application of any member of the company who would be
                        entitled to vote at the meeting, order a meeting to be called, held and
                        conducted in any manner the court thinks fit.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>Where such an order is made, the court may give such
                            ancillary or consequential directions as it thinks expedient; and these
                            may include a direction that one member of the company present in person
                            or by proxy be deemed to constitute a
                meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The English Court of Appeal in <em>Union Music</em> ordered that a quorum requirement could be
                    dispensed with. In the view of the Court, a provision requiring a quorum of two
                    members’ attendance would not prevent a decision in favour of an applicant
                    who seeks a proper order, such as the appointment or removal of a director, as
                    that is something which a majority shareholder would have the right to effect.
                    In the words of Peter Gibson LJ, at para 49, ‘Companies should have
                    effective boards able to take decisions’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Court of Appeal in <em>Union Music</em> took a holistic assessment in determining whether to
                    exercise its powers. In the present case, the Defendants advocated that even
                    where an impracticability exists, the court must find good reasons for the
                    exercise of its discretion. This was essentially a two stage approach. The
                    different approaches should not lead to different results. Nonetheless, the
                    holistic assessment has the benefit of not slicing up the analysis: matters
                    going to impracticability and the exercise of discretion will overlap
                    considerably. This can be seen in the Defendants’ list of matters
                    establishing good reasons for the exercise of the court’s discretion:
                    deadlock affecting day-to-day management; inability of the company to comply
                    with statutory requirements; and the death of all corporators. There is
                    therefore little to be gained by separating out impracticability and the
                    existence of a good reason. A holistic assessment entails an assessment of
                    whether there is indeed impracticability and whether such impracticability is of
                    a sufficient degree as to call for the intervention of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">‘Impracticability’ and the court’s exercise of
                discretion under s 182 of the Companies Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     As noted above, what s 182 requires is that
                    there is an impracticability in calling or conducting a meeting. An
                    impracticability arises when the company is unable to proceed with the meeting
                    because quorum is not met through the refusal of the members to attend. A number
                    of other cases cited by the Plaintiff underlined what amounted to
                    impracticability and the approach that should be adopted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In <em>Re El Sombrero
                        Ltd</em> [1958] 3 WLR 349 (“<em>Re El
                        Sombrero</em>”), the English court adopted the position that
                    impracticability arose if the meeting could not, as a practical matter, be
                    conducted. Refusal to attend was found sufficient to give rise to
                    impracticability. As emphasised in <em>Union Music</em>,
                    the choice of a member to attend or not attend does not operate as a right of
                    veto or the ability to frustrate the majority. This was followed in <em>Re Woven Rugs Limited</em> [2002] 1 BCLC 324.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     A concise statement of this position is found
                    in <em>Phuar Kong Seng v Lim Hua</em> [2005] 2 MLJ 338. In
                    that case the plaintiff sought an order from the Malaysian High Court under s
                    150 of the Companies Act (1950) on the grounds that it was impracticable to
                    conduct a meeting as prescribed by the Articles: attempts to call meetings were
                    defeated on various occasions by lack of quorum. Zaleha Zahari J noted at para
                    16 to 17:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is a basic principle of company law that the corporate will is advanced
                        by the resolution of the company in general meeting in matters in which the
                        general meeting is competent to act and that the majority of members
                        controls the decision-making in the company by the exercise of its voting
                        power. A related principle is that voting rights are in the nature of
                        property and members may exercise this power in their own
                        self-interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am in agreement with the submission of the plaintiff’s counsel
                        that the quorum provisions cannot be regarded as conferring a form of veto
                        on a minority party in a situation where a deadlock exists. The proposed
                        resolutions involved the interests of the plaintiff and the defendant qua
                        shareholders and as such shareholders they are accordingly free to exercise
                        their voting rights to advance their own self-interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     With respect, the position adopted by Zaleha
                    Zahari J is sound, as it gives due weight to the property rights of the
                    shareholders, and their respective autonomy to act in their own
                    interests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Similarly, in <em>Re Success
                        Plan Ltd</em> [2002] 3 HKLRD 610 at [43], in respect of the Hong Kong
                    equivalent of s 182 of the CA, Yuen JA stated the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is well-established law that the refusal of another shareholder to form
                        a quorum for a meeting is an example of a situation where it would be
                        impracticable to call a meeting of the company (eg <em>Re El
                            Sombrero Ltd</em> [1958] Ch 900). A quorum requirement does not
                        confer a veto power on a majority shareholder by his ability to prevent a
                        shareholders’ meeting from being held (<em>Re Opera
                            Photographic Ltd</em> [1989] 1 WLR 634), unless the minority
                        shareholder has a special right attached to his shares rendering his
                        presence at meetings indispensable (eg <em>BML Group Ltd v
                            Harman</em> [1994] 1 WLR 893).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Yuen JA considered whether the court’s
                    discretion should be exercised. It was noted that the possibility of unfair
                    prejudice would be taken into account, but it was found that there was nothing
                    before the court to show that all the resolutions sought to be passed were
                    clearly oppressive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     From the above discussion, we can see that
                    case law from various jurisdictions clearly supports the position that an
                    inability to meet quorum requirements due to members not wanting to attend the
                    meeting is an example of there being impracticability under s 182 of the
                    Companies Act (or its equivalent), and can be a grounds for judicial
                    intervention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As a matter of interpretation alone of s 182,
                    refusal to attend, causing a failure to meet quorum requirements, is an
                    impracticability. ‘Impracticability’ is defined in the <em>New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical
                        Principles</em> (Lesley Brown, ed) (Oxford University Press, 1993)
                    as</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_a"></a>(a)     the quality or condition of being
                    impracticable;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_b"></a>(b)     an impracticable thing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     ‘Impracticable’ in turn is defined
                    as “[n]ot practicable; unable to be carried out or done; impossible in
                    practice”. It seems to me that all s 182 contemplates is that there be
                    something which prevents the meeting from being conducted, though whether or not
                    an order should be granted is for the court’s assessment of the
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Defendants on the other hand argued that
                    good reasons exist in more limited circumstances than in the present case. They
                    say that there must be general deadlock preventing day to day management,
                    inability to comply with statutory requirements, or a situation where all
                    members have died. It is said none of these circumstances exist here. This
                    proposition is derived by the Defendants from cases such as <em>Beck v Tuckey Pty Ltd and Others</em> (2004) 49 ACSR 555 (Supreme
                    Court of New South Wales) (“<em>Beck v
                    Tuckey</em>”) as well as <em>Re Opera Photographic
                        Ltd</em> [1989] 1 WLR 634 (“<em>Re
                        Opera</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In <em>Beck v
                    Tuckey</em>, while the judge found that there was insufficient deadlock as
                    nothing stopped day-to-day operations, it was telling that in that specific
                    case, the parties indicated that they were prepared to negotiate to resolve
                    their differences. The judge stated (at [51]) “I believe the court should
                    be reluctant to intervene in the dispute in a partial fashion when there is a
                    prospect that such negotiations will take place and might succeed.” The
                    final order indicated that mediation was to be ordered under the Supreme Court
                    Act 1970 (NSW). The strength of that case as authority for the proposition that
                    impracticability requires the failure of day-to-day operations is therefore
                    relatively weak. There were clearly other salient reasons that motivated the
                    court’s ultimate finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Requiring deadlock extending to day to day
                    management is setting the bar too high. Section 182 does not actually use the
                    word ‘deadlock’. That section simply requires that there be
                    impracticability. Certainly, deadlock would amount to an impracticability, but
                    an impracticability is not synonymous with deadlock. The Defendants in effect
                    seek to put a gloss on s 182 that restricts its operation to fairly extreme
                    situations of distress for the company. The words of the provision do not
                    support this gloss. The Defendants have not shown anything in parliamentary
                    debates or other referable material that would compel the adoption of such a
                    limited meaning to the word ‘impracticability’. The English Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Union Music</em> did not take on such a gloss
                    either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Both the Defendants and the Plaintiff referred
                    to the case of <em>In re Opera Photographic Ltd</em> in
                    support of their respective cases. That case involved an application for an
                    order under s 371 of the Companies Act 1985 allowing a quorum of one at a
                    meeting of the company. Morritt J after referring to <em>Re El
                        Sombrero Ltd</em>, and other authorities, said, at p 636H to
                    637A:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plain fact of this matter is that deadlock exists between the two
                        individuals which has to be resolved one way or another. It is either
                        capable of being resolved by ordering a meeting, at which no doubt Mr.
                        Martin will be removed, and which will then no doubt result either in him
                        exercising the pre-emption rights under the articles of selling his shares,
                        or presenting a petition for the winding-up of the company, or presenting a
                        petition under section 459 of the Act of 1985 based on unfair prejudice to
                        him. Equally, if no order is made the deadlock will continue because no
                        meetings can be conducted which are going effectively to manage or procure
                        the management of this company, and if that persists for any length of time
                        then no doubt one or other of the individuals will again be presenting a
                        petition based on that deadlock in order to provide some form of
                        resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Morritt J was concerned with a situation of
                    deadlock in the meeting of members. His Lordship’s remarks were made in
                    the context of a failure between members to agree. There is nothing in those
                    remarks dealing with day-to-day operations or management; rather the focus was
                    on ‘management’ in the sense of the setting of a direction for the
                    company by its members. Furthermore, Morritt J was dealing only with an aspect
                    of impracticability. There is nothing in His Lordship’s judgment which
                    could be read as equating impracticability with the existence of deadlock. This
                    case therefore did not assist the Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Defendants also referred to <em>Re Sticky Fingers Restaurant</em> [1992] BCLC 84 as support
                    for the proposition that something of the nature of an obstruction of the
                    business of the company is required. In that case, the inability of the company
                    to conduct meetings of the members or the board resulted in the company having
                    difficulties in dealing with its accounts and tax issues. Again, that would be a
                    specific instance of when the discretion should be exercised. It was not meant
                    to limit the discretion to only those situations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Defendants cited <em>Jenashare Pty Ltd v Lemrib Pty Ltd</em> (1993) 11 ACSR 345 (Supreme
                    Court of New South Wales) (“<em>Jenashare</em>”), for the proposition that impracticability is
                    made out where the corporators (presumably the members) are all dead, having
                    been killed in an accident. That would be one example of impracticability. But
                        <em>Jenashare</em> itself recognised that was but one
                    instance. What Young J said was, at p 349 to 350:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 251 [the equivalent of s 182] permits the court to order meetings
                        in case of impracticability. Impracticability will cover a wide range of
                        circumstances, from the case where all the corporators have been killed in
                        an aircraft accident, down to situations where it is extremely inconvenient
                        for a meeting to be called.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     A wide range of circumstances was thus
                    recognised in that case. Young J went on to note that the court has discretion,
                    but would not intervene unless there is evidence of “a good reason to do
                    so” (at p 350). In particular, where there is a prescribed procedure to
                    deal with the impracticability the company faces, the court would ordinarily not
                    make an order unless there is strong evidence. It is also noteworthy that in
                    that case, at the time of the hearing, it was purely a matter of speculation
                    whether a meeting held would be inquorate (at p 350).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The other restricted circumstances identified
                    by the Defendants are just instances where the power under s 182 should be
                    exercised. But these instances cannot circumscribe the ambit of that section.
                    That would be unduly restrictive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether minority shareholders are entitled to cause a lack of
                quorum</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Defendants pointed to cases which they
                    contend show that minority shareholders can legitimately cause a lack of quorum.
                    These were primarily those that engaged s 392 of the Companies Act, which deals
                    with irregularities, including absence of quora, such as <em>Chang Benety and ors v Tang Kin Fei and ors</em> [2012] 1 SLR 274
                        (“<em>Chang Benety</em>”). These cases are concerned with
                    whether there has been such an irregularity in compliance with requirements that
                    a substantial injustice results.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In the High Court in <em>Tang
                        Kin Fei and others v Chang Benety and others</em> [2011] 1 SLR 568
                        (“<em>Chang Benety HC</em>”) at [39],
                    Justice Woo Bih Li, at first instance, noted that the defensive tactic referred
                    to is legitimate, at para [39]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I was of the view that the starting point should be that where there is a
                        provision which allows one party to engage in the defensive tactic mentioned
                        above, he is, <em>prima facie</em>, entitled to do so.
                        Where there is a deadlock in the sense that no quorum can be formed for a
                        board meeting, I was of the view that to allow one party to push ahead with
                        his agenda in the absence of the other party was <em>prima
                            facie</em> an injustice which was substantial because he was
                        denying the other party the right to stop the proposing party from
                        proceeding with his agenda, a right which the parties had agreed to
                        beforehand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     These remarks were in the context of an
                    application under s 392, on irregularity. The position stated by Justice Woo was
                    that there would be <em>prima facie</em> injustice thereby
                    requiring the party seeking an order of court to show that grounds existed for
                    validation. In such a s 392 application, the Court would need to consider
                    whether an irregularity has caused or will cause substantial injustice which
                    cannot be remedied. The court, adopting the approach in <em>The
                        Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Reliance National Asia Pte Ltd</em> [2008]
                    3 SLR (R) 121, as noted by Woo J, would consider a holistic weighing and
                    balancing of the various interests. This is demonstrated by his analysis of the
                    different prayers sought in the case before him: vide paras 41 to 48. The
                    approach is thus different from that under s 182. Authorities such as <em>Re El Sombrero</em> and <em>Union
                        Music</em> were not considered by Woo J.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The distinction between the two requirements
                    under s 182 and 392 is there because of the different perspectives involved.
                    Section 392 operates <em>post hoc</em>. Where an
                    irregularity arises such as a decision taken at an inquorate meeting, the
                    question that is examined is whether a substantial injustice has arisen, because
                    of the conduct of the party proceeding in breach. In contrast, when the
                    court’s intervention is sought under s 182, the issue is whether the
                    meeting should be permitted to go ahead, and the prescribed criteria under that
                    section is impracticability. No decision has yet been made; the only question is
                    the holding of the meeting. The decision may yet be influenced by those choosing
                    to attend. They are given that opportunity, slim though it may be at times, and
                    it is for them to decide what to make of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     At the Court of Appeal in <em>Chang Benety</em>, the Court of Appeal was concerned with not just a
                    quorum requirement, but representation reflecting a position reached under a
                    shareholder’s agreement, at para [48]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It bears noting that the quorum requirement in the present case was not
                        merely an ordinary one specifying a minimum <em>number</em> as such but also one which related, in fact, to the
                        issue of <em>representation</em> on the board of
                        directors. This requirement was to ensure that parties would have their
                        interests represented at board meetings and could thus prevent the Company
                        from making any decision which would prejudice them. The importance of this
                        requirement is evident as it was not only provided for in the articles of
                        association but enshrined in the Shareholders’ Agreement as well. In
                        our view, where such a quorum requirement is breached, there will <em>prima facie</em> be substantial injustice to the side
                        which exercised its deadlock rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in the original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In contrast, there is no shareholder agreement
                    in the present case. The Defendants instead rely on a family understanding,
                    which will be dealt with below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The next case relied upon by the Defendants to
                    illustrate that the minority’s refusal to attend meetings is acceptable in
                    the local context is the High Court decision in <em>Re Goodwealth
                        Trading Pte Ltd</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 691 (“<em>Re Goodwealth HC</em>”). The Defendants argued that that case
                    established a principle that a refusal to attend a meeting is a recognised
                    defensive strategy. <em>Re Goodwealth HC</em> was however a
                    case concerned with winding up on just and equitable grounds under s 254. At the
                    High Court, a preliminary point had arisen as to whether solicitors were
                    properly appointed, as there was no quorum at the relevant meeting. In
                    recounting the facts of the case, Yong Pung How CJ (sitting as a Judge of the
                    High Court) stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Within the company, one defensive tactic which was used by the petitioner
                        throughout this confrontation was to refuse to attend directors’
                        meetings, so that there could not be the necessary quorum of two for a valid
                        directors’ meeting. The result of the use by the petitioner of this
                        defensive tactic was that, while the restaurant business could be continued
                        in some sort of way, no corporate decisions of the board of directors could
                        be made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In my view, this was not an endorsement of the
                    use of absenteeism from meetings. It merely described what happened in the
                    company as a matter of historical fact. The rest of the judgment was concerned
                    with whether winding up on just and equitable grounds was made out. For the
                    reasons above, I was of the view that this case bore little relevance to the
                    present one. As for the decision on appeal in <em>Chua Kien How v
                        Goodwealth Trading Pte Ltd and another</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 870
                        (“<em>Re Goodwealth CA</em>”), the focus
                    was specifically on winding up on just and equitable grounds. .</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I next consider <em>Sum Hong
                        Kum v Li Pin Furniture Industries Pte Ltd</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 529
                        (“<em>Sum Hong Kum</em>”), which
                    concerned a company which had been incorporated specifically to take over the
                    business of a partnership. The partners’ respective positions in the
                    partnership were to be carried over into the company. The relationship between
                    them <em>qua</em> shareholders was thus governed by their
                    prior relationship as partners. As they each held equal shares and equal say in
                    the running of the partnership, the holding by the judge that a proper quorum
                    had to include all three of the founding members is understandable. That
                    situation is however different from the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The above cases thus do not establish a
                    general rule that impracticability under s 182 does not capture inquorate
                    meetings. What is required is that the court should make a holistic assessment,
                    considering whether the events, omission or other actions require its
                    intervention. As a matter of principle, impracticability is made out in the
                    present case as the refusal of members to attend meetings perverts the point of
                    membership and the meeting process. As has been emphasised in the English cases
                    discussed above, a minority shareholder or member cannot use the quorum
                    provision as a <em>de facto</em> veto mechanism, allowing
                    him to obstruct the desires of the majority shareholder. A meeting is a
                    mechanism to allow decisions to be made. Proposals are meant to be put, debated
                    and voted upon. The quorum is to ensure only that there is at least a minimal
                    opportunity to debate and convince. It is part of the structure of a proper
                    meeting. On the other hand, allowing the minority to cause the meeting to fail
                    by staying away gives them a <em>de facto</em> veto,
                    allowing them to scupper the mechanism of decision-making. The proposal is not
                    defeated through persuasion and tallying of those empowered to decide, as it
                    should be; instead, it is defeated by the minority by their refusal to allow the
                    matter to go to a vote at all. Veto by lack of quorum is nothing more than the
                    imposition of the will of the minority on the majority. In my view, such
                    impracticability justifies the court exercising its powers under s 182 of the
                    CA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It may be otherwise, if the minority could
                    point to some basis that it would be inequitable or cause a substantial
                    injustice, such as a shareholders’ agreement requiring specific
                    representation at a meeting, or even enshrining a general position that
                    decisions are to be made on a cooperative or consensual basis among the members
                    or shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     There is no shareholders’ agreement in
                    the present case, but the Defendants rely on: a) a different approach for family
                    run companies to the position; and b) an agreement between the family members in
                    the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether a different approach applies to family run
                companies</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The Defendants cited a number of local cases
                    which they contend point towards a different approach, permitting them to avoid
                    attending EGMs without triggering the operation of s 182. It was contended that
                    local law recognised rights under the quorum provisions. The cases relied upon
                    by the Defendants are in particular, <em>Chow Kwok Chuen v Chow
                        Kwok Chi and another</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 362 (“<em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em>”) and <em>Sum Hong
                        Kum</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     
          <em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em>
                    was cited for the proposition that family run companies are in a special class
                    of their own. It is true that the familial relations, expectations and duties
                    underlying the incorporation and management of companies held by family members
                    can in some circumstances provide a special context for the interpretation of
                    rights and obligations between such family members. However, I do not understand
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em> to go
                    beyond this. How the familial context influences the outcome of a particular
                    case will depend on the facts of the particular case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In <em>Chow Kwok
                        Chuen</em>¸ three brothers holding interests of
                    roughly similar sizes in various companies founded by their father were in
                    deadlock. The case came before the court because one brother sought to wind up
                    the companies on the just and equitable ground. There are several important
                    factual distinctions between <em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em> and
                    the present case. They are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_a"></a>(a)     The family arrangements in <em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em> were much more
                    elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        deadlock was between roughly equal shareholders.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_56-p2_c"></a>(c)     The case was concerned with
                        winding-up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>These reasons point to
                        distinguishing factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The family arrangements in <em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em> were much more elaborate than in the present
                    case. The Court of Appeal noted at para 32 that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the present case, the Companies were incorporated by Mr
                        Chow with the intention of using them to hold properties for the family's
                        benefit, and he made special provision in the articles of association of
                        each company to ensure that his wishes of wealth distribution and management
                        involvement for male descendants were achieved. This was described by the
                        Judge in the GD as follows (at [6]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Mr Chow devoted most of his life to building up his fortune, acquiring
                            real properties and incorporating the companies to hold the properties.
                            He intended the companies to be family companies and he made special
                            provision in the articles of association of each company in order to
                            ensure that his wishes were achieved. In ADPL, the articles provided
                            that Mr and Mrs Chow would be the governing directors and could not be
                            removed from office by any director or shareholder. Further, every male
                            descendent of Mr Chow in the male line who turned 21 years of age and
                            notified ADPL of his desire to be appointed had to be appointed as a
                            director of the company. In CCPL too, Mr Chow was the governing director
                            who could not be removed and his adult male descendents in the male line
                            were entitled to be appointed as directors of the company. In Lee Tung,
                            Mr and Mrs Chow were the governing directors. Membership in that company
                            was restricted to Mrs Chow, male descendents of Mr Chow in the male line
                            and Mr Chow's lawful daughter. It can be discerned that, all in all, Mr
                            Chow was a very traditional man.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The arrangements in <em>Chow
                        Kwok Chuen</em> were intricate, encompassing restrictions on who could
                    become directors or members, and clearly limiting or excluding the involvement
                    of outsiders to the family in the high level supervision of the companies.
                    Indeed, the restrictions were in favour of the male descendants of the founder.
                    All of that is absent in the present case. There is no restriction on membership
                    or directorship, and certainly no restriction to a specific line of descent.
                        <em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em> thus is case determined on
                    very special facts and very special circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In addition to the specific family
                    arrangements underlying the corporate structure, <em>Chow Kwok
                        Chuen</em> is also distinguishable as the competing shareholders in
                    that case held roughly equal holdings. In contrast, here, the Plaintiff holds a
                    majority in Aik Chuan. In other companies, the position is reversed, with
                    various Defendants holding the majority interests, while the Plaintiff holds
                    clearly minority stakes. The inference is that each party would be in control of
                    a different company. A diversity of interests, and objectives is thus
                    accommodated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Finally, the fact that <em>Chow
                        Kwok Chuen</em> was concerned with winding-up is significant. The
                    Court of Appeal had to consider winding-up on just and equitable grounds. While
                    winding up on that basis is not confined to quasi-partnerships, it is easier to
                    establish a sufficient basis if the company in question is a quasi-partnership
                    of the sort found in <em>Chow Kwok Chuen</em>. With roughly
                    equal holdings, and an expectation of adherence to family values, any departure
                    from a common understanding would probably make out a basis for the winding up
                    of the family’s corporate enterprise. The focus is different from that in
                    an analysis under s 182. In a winding-up, the issue is whether the basis for the
                    enterprises still remains. That examination of the existence of the basis is
                    broader than whether an impracticability in holding a meeting exists requiring
                    the intervention of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     None of these cases thus support the
                    Defendants’ contention that a special rule applies for family companies on
                    the facts such as the present. The only rule, or principle laid down is that
                    there needs to be an appreciation of the context of the incorporation of a
                    company in construing the contract between its members.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether a family agreement provides a sufficient basis to depart from
                the general position under s 182</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Defendants submit that the Plaintiff was
                    pursuing his personal project, and that he should not be allowed to pursue it as
                    it was not in the family’s contemplation or with the family’s
                    agreement. The Defendants also submit that there is a family arrangement or
                    agreement that decision-making should be collective. It is this agreement that
                    the Defendants seek to ask the court to uphold.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As noted above, there may be instances in
                    which the court may impose additional obligations on the parties even if such
                    obligations cannot be found in the formal agreement between the members
                        (<em>i.e.</em> in the Articles and Memorandum of
                    Association). For instance, where the company succeeds a partnership, as in a
                    situation similar to that in <em>Sum Hong Kum</em>, with
                    the parties holding similar interests in the company as they did in the
                    partnership, even if there were no formal agreement, it may possibly be inferred
                    that the relationship and balance of power between the parties are to remain as
                    when they were partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Although the Defendants attempted to argue
                    that the facts of the present case are similar to that in <em>Sum
                        Hong Kum</em>, it was clear to me that additional obligations
                    restricting the Plaintiff’s freedom of action as shareholder to decide
                    what he wanted to do with his interest in the company, and how to use his
                    shareholding to direct the activities of the company, should not be imposed. The
                    Defendants pointed to the fact that the company was founded by the
                    Plaintiff’s father, as well as to the fact that each of the children held
                    majorities in different companies, with the rest of the shareholding in each
                    company split among the siblings. It was argued that it was the intention of the
                    family and the father of the Plaintiff, Mr Lim Lam Hong, who founded Aik Chuan,
                    intended that the family should further the family’s interests
                    collectively. This, they argued, requires collective consultation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     There was certainly nothing in the nature of a
                    Shareholder’s Agreement, capturing all the parties’ express or
                    implied acceptance that there would be constraints, expressly or impliedly.
                        <em>Sum Hong Kum</em>, in particular, involved a
                    situation of another degree altogether. The position of the partners was
                    crystallised in the company as the company effectively succeeded to the
                    structure of the partnership. There is no such crystallisation in the present
                    case. Furthermore, unlike <em>Sum Hong</em> Kum, the
                    interests of the parties are not equal, and one person is clearly in control of
                    Aik Chuan. There was nothing to show that that control ought to be effectively
                    lessened in any way. The arrangements that were made in the companies held by
                    the Defendants and the Plaintiff, with differentiated shareholdings and control
                    of different companies by different family members, did not lead to the
                    conclusion that there was a common basis between the parties that would be given
                    legal effect. The wishes and hopes that may have been reflected in the
                    differentiated shareholdings did not create a definite obligation between the
                    Defendants and Plaintiff that should be given effect to by the Court. A definite
                    binding bargain, whether between shareholders or partners in a joint enterprise,
                    is what is needed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Miscellaneous Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The parties recounted the financial
                    arrangements and agreements between themselves. Save as some aspects may be
                    material to the determination of the s 182 application, I did not address the
                    status or impact of all of these. The Defendants are free to consider if there
                    are other avenues to pursue and other provisions to invoke to protect their
                    interests. All that I was concerned with in this case was the application by the
                    Plaintiff for an order on the quorum at the meeting of the
                Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In the present case, the Defendants have
                    chosen not to attend two EGMs called by the Plaintiff. There is no
                    shareholders’ agreement. The effect of their absence is that matters could
                    not be put to the vote; while the agenda of the two EGMs relate to different
                    matters, the upshot of the boycott of the EGMs is that investments in the
                    biomass project could not be effected. That to my mind is sufficient
                    impracticability, and it is of an appropriate degree as to call for the court to
                    intervene.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Costs were not ordered as the Plaintiff took
                    the position that it was not necessary.</p>
