<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the plaintiff from the
                    decision of the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) in <em>Equatorial Marine Fuel Management Services Pte Ltd v The Owners of the Ship
                        or Vessel “Bunga Melati 5”</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 193, granting the defendant’s application to strike
                    out and/or set aside the plaintiff’s admiralty writ <em>in
                        rem</em> and statement of claim pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (the
                    “ROC”) or the court’s inherent jurisdiction, and/or for want
                    of admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> under s 4(4)
                    of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap 123, 2001 Rev Ed)
                    (the “HCAJA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the parties, I dismissed the
                    appeal and upheld the decision of the learned AR, ordering that the
                    plaintiff’s action be struck out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC.
                    However, as I did not agree with all the views expressed by him (particularly
                    those which related to the invocation of admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>), which I believe raise matters of practical
                    significance to the Admiralty Bar, and as the plaintiff has appealed against my
                    judgment (<em>vide</em> Civil Appeal No 193 of 2010), I set
                    out the grounds of my decision below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I should add that the defendant had, in
                    Registrar’s Appeal (“RA”) No 256 of 2010, also
                    cross-appealed against part of the learned AR’s decision. However, as I
                    had already ruled in the defendant’s favour in the present action, RA No
                    256 of 2010 was adjourned pending the outcome of Civil Appeal No 193 of
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In these grounds, references to O 18
                    r 19 of the ROC should be understood as including a reference to the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction to strike out an action as being frivolous,
                    vexatious or an abuse of process (on which see <em>Singapore
                        Civil Procedure 2007</em> (G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell
                    Asia, 2007) at para 18/19/16). As some cases cited in these grounds make
                    reference to different editions of the HCAJA, I should also make clear that the
                    abbreviation “HCAJA” should be understood as including all
                    editions of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act, since they are
                    substantially the same in terms of content. In addition, since I will be
                    referring to ss 3(1) and 4(4) of the HCAJA frequently throughout these
                    grounds, it is convenient to set out these provisions <em>in
                        extenso</em>:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff, Equatorial Marine Fuel Management
                    Services Pte Ltd, was a Singapore company in the business of supplying marine
                    fuels (“bunkers”). The defendant, MISC Berhad, was a Malaysian
                    shipping company and the registered owner of a number of vessels, including the
                        <em>Bunga Melati 5</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In its statement of claim, the plaintiff alleged
                    that the parties had, on or about 3 July 2008, entered into two fixed price
                    contracts, under which it agreed to supply 35,000 metric tonnes of bunkers (per
                    contract) to a number of vessels owned or operated by the defendant in August
                    and September 2008 at the price of US$744 and US$750 per metric tonne
                    respectively (the “Fixed Price Contracts”). In addition, the
                    plaintiff alleged that the parties had, on or about 18 September 2008, entered
                    into a separate contract for the supply of 1,000 metric tonnes of bunkers, on a
                    “spot” basis, to the defendant’s vessel the <em>MT Navig8 Faith</em> (the “Navig8 Faith
                    Contract”). According to the plaintiff, a Malaysian company, Market Asia
                    Link Sdn Bhd (“MAL”), at all material times acted as the broker or
                    buying agent of the defendant in respect of the Fixed Price Contracts and the
                    Navig8 Faith Contract. I should say that the defendant contested these
                    allegations with a different version of events, which I will come to at
                        <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff did not receive full payment in
                    respect of the supplied bunkers, and, according to the plaintiff’s
                    statement of claim, a rather substantial sum of US$21,703,059.39 (plus
                    contractual interest) remained outstanding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Consequently, the plaintiff commenced the
                    present action <em>in rem</em> and served the writ
                        <em>in rem</em> on the <em>Bunga Melati
                        5</em>; however, no warrant of arrest was issued and the vessel was
                    not arrested. In all likelihood, security for the claim was furnished
                    voluntarily in lieu of an arrest. It was common ground that the <em>Bunga Melati 5</em> was not one of the vessels which had
                    received the bunkers supplied. As such, this was what is commonly known as a
                    “sister ship action” under s 4(4)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the HCAJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The plaintiff’s case was essentially that
                    the defendant was a party to the Fixed Price Contracts and the Navig8 Faith
                    Contract via the agency of the defendant’s alleged agent, MAL, and that
                    the defendant was therefore contractually liable to the plaintiff for the
                    bunkers supplied. As an alternative to its claim in contract, the plaintiff also
                    argued that, if there were no valid and binding contracts for the sale and
                    supply of the bunkers between the parties, the defendant was liable to it in
                    unjust enrichment, since the defendant had enjoyed the use of the
                    plaintiff’s bunkers without paying for them. In addition, the plaintiff
                    contended that the offer of a corporate guarantee by the defendant, in the
                    context of earlier court proceedings in the United States in respect of the same
                    dispute (the “US proceedings”), amounted to an admission of
                    liability by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The US proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Prior to the start of the present action, the
                    plaintiff had commenced another set of proceedings in the United States District
                    Court for the Central District of California (the “California District
                    Court”), based on essentially the same claims as the present action
                    (albeit the issue of agency was apparently not pleaded). The plaintiff filed a
                    “Verified Complaint” to obtain an attachment order under Rule B of
                    the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture
                    Actions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the “Rule B attachment
                    order”). The Rule B attachment order was executed against one of the
                    defendant’s vessels, the <em>Bunga Kasturi Lima</em>,
                    at Long Beach, California.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As alluded to above (at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>), the offer of a corporate guarantee was made
                    to the plaintiff by the defendant. It was made a day after the Rule B attachment
                    order was executed against the <em>Bunga Kasturi Lima</em>
                    and was to the effect that the defendant would pay to the plaintiff the sum of
                    US$22.4 million, on condition that the plaintiff withdrew all suits against the
                    defendant in the United States and not commence any further actions <em>in rem</em> against the defendant’s vessels. The
                    plaintiff, however, did not accept this offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The defendant filed a motion to vacate the
                    Rule B attachment order and to dismiss the Verified Complaint for failure to
                    state a claim. The California District Court vacated the Rule B attachment
                    order, a decision which was upheld on appeal by the United States Court of
                    Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Ninth Circuit Court of
                    Appeals”), though the motion to dismiss the Verified Complaint was not
                    considered, and was scheduled for further hearing. However, the further hearing
                    never took place, as the plaintiff voluntarily withdrew the Verified
                    Complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     As stated (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above), before the learned AR, the defendant applied
                        (<em>vide</em> Summons No 919 of 2010) for, <em>inter alia</em>, the following orders:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the plaintiff’s writ and statement of
                            claim be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the ROC and/or

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the plaintiff’s writ be struck out
                            and/or set aside on the basis that the admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> of the court under the HCAJA had been
                            improperly or invalidly invoked against the <em>Bunga
                                Melati 5</em>; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a declaration that the plaintiff was not entitled
                            to invoke the admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                                rem</em> of the court against the <em>Bunga
                                Melati 5</em> or any other vessel owned by the defendant in
                            relation to the plaintiff’s alleged claim.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The defendant’s primary submission in
                    support of its application was a straightforward denial of any agency
                    relationship between it and MAL, and therefore also a denial that it had
                    directly contracted with the plaintiff for the supply of bunkers. The defendant
                    asserted that at all material times, it had procured the sale and supply of
                    bunkers for its vessels from MAL as its contractual sellers (with MAL in turn
                    procuring bunkers from suppliers such as the plaintiff), and that there was
                    therefore no contractual relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff.
                    Consequently, the defendant submitted that the plaintiff’s claim should be
                    struck out for being plainly unsustainable on the merits, and that, for the same
                    reasons, the defendant was not “the person who would be liable on the
                    claim in an action <em>in personam</em>” (the
                    “relevant person”) under s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA and the plaintiff had therefore wrongly invoked
                    the admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> of the court.
                    The defendant also argued that these submissions applied with equal force to the
                    plaintiff’s claim in unjust enrichment. In addition, the defendant relied
                    on the doctrine of issue estoppel, arguing that the US proceedings estopped the
                    plaintiff from litigating the same issues before the Singapore court, and that
                    the plaintiff’s action should therefore be struck out as being frivolous,
                    vexatious or an abuse of process. Finally, the defendant submitted that the
                    plaintiff’s action, following on the heels of the US proceedings, offended
                    the “one claim, one ship” principle, and that the plaintiff was
                    thereby prevented from invoking the admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> of the court or that the action should therefore be struck
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The AR’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In a carefully considered decision, the
                    learned AR granted the first two orders sought (<em>ie</em>, [13(a)] and [13(b)] above), but declined to grant the final
                    order (which formed the subject matter of RA No 256 of 2010 and was not material
                    to this appeal).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In his grounds of decision, the learned AR
                    held that, although the relevant provisions of the HCAJA did not impose a
                    threshold test of merits which the plaintiff had to discharge before it could
                    invoke the admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> of the
                    High Court, in light of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994
                        (“<em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>”),
                    the common law required a plaintiff to show a good arguable case <em>on the merits</em> before the court’s admiralty
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> could be invoked. He
                    considered, however, that this view of the law did not sit easily with my
                    decision in <em>The Eagle Prestige</em> [2010]
                    3 SLR 394, which he interpreted as holding that there was no
                    requirement (whether under the HCAJA or at common law) for a plaintiff to go
                    into the merits of the claim when the invocation of the court’s admiralty
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> was challenged by the
                    defendant, unless there was also an application to strike out the action
                    pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the ROC or the inherent jurisdiction of the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Applying this view of the law to the facts,
                    the learned AR held that, on the evidence, the plaintiff had failed to establish
                    a good arguable case that there was a contractual relationship between it and
                    the defendant (via the agency of MAL). On the basis of his reading of <em>The Vasilily Golovnin (CA)</em>, the learned AR concluded
                    that the admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> of the
                    court had been improperly invoked as the plaintiff was unable to show that it
                    had a good arguable case on the merits, and the writ was to be set aside.
                    Alternatively, on the basis of <em>The Eagle Prestige</em>,
                    the writ was to be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the ROC or
                    pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court because, on the same facts,
                    the plaintiff’s claim was obviously unsustainable and bound to
                    fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The learned AR applied the same reasoning to
                    the plaintiff’s claim in unjust enrichment, and held that the plaintiff
                    had again failed to show a good arguable case on the merits, which meant that
                    the writ was to be set aside due to a lack of admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> (as <em>per</em> his
                    understanding of <em>The Vasilily Golovnin (CA)</em>), or
                    alternatively that the claim was to be struck out pursuant to O 18
                    r 19 of the ROC or the court’s inherent jurisdiction as it was
                    plainly unsustainable (as <em>per The Eagle
                    Prestige</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In view of his conclusions above, the learned
                    AR was not therefore obliged to consider the defendant’s other arguments
                    based on issue estoppel and the “one ship, one claim” rule, but he
                    nonetheless dealt with both submissions, concluding <em>obiter</em> that, in the circumstances, the plaintiff’s writ
                    ought not to be set aside or struck out on those grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">RA 252 of 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I should make it clear that, on appeal, a
                    number of matters were either common ground or not in dispute, namely
                    that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff’s claim for unpaid bunkers
                            fell squarely within s 3(1)(<em>l</em>) of the
                            HCAJA;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff had to satisfy the requirements of
                            s 4(4) of the HCAJA in order for the court to have jurisdiction to
                            entertain an action <em>in rem</em>;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the defendant was the beneficial owner of the
                                <em>Bunga Melati 5</em> when this action was
                            brought;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff’s claim arose in connection
                            with the supply of bunkers to another ship or other ships;
                        and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">when the alleged cause or causes of action arose
                            the defendant was the owner or charterer or person in possession or
                            control of that other ship or those other ships.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, the dispute centred on whether the defendant could be said to be
                    the “person who would be liable on the claim in an action <em>in personam</em>” within the meaning of
                        s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA. The thrust of the
                    plaintiff’s case was that the defendant could indeed be said to be such a
                    person, while the defendant’s arguments were to the contrary. This simple
                    summary of the respective positions, however, does not do justice to the
                    complexity of the underlying issues as well as the extensive arguments canvassed
                    by both parties before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff, for instance, made the

                            under s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA was that
                            of a “good arguable case”, and was similar to that under

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The defendant did not meet all the
                    plaintiff’s submissions, as the defendant conceded at the outset of the
                    hearing before me that the proper standard of proof to be applied under
                        s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA (see [21(a)]
                    above) was indeed that of a “good arguable case”, as opposed to
                    that of a “balance of probabilities”, as it had contended before
                    the learned AR. However, the defendant’s other submissions were as
                    follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the learned AR had erred in his interpretation of

                            of the HCAJA, but was merely explaining the merits requirement which had
                            always been inherent in the provisions of the HCAJA;</div>

                            warrant of arrest, if any, would also fall away), on the basis that the
                            plaintiff’s claim was certain to fail or obviously unsustainable
                            and was thereby frivolous, vexatious, or lacking in <em>bona fides</em> so as to otherwise be an abuse of process
                            (see generally <em>The Osprey</em> [1999]
                            3 SLR(R) 1099 at [8]
                            and [9]).</div>
<p class="Judg-1">I should add that the defendant may also apply to discharge the warrant
                    of arrest on the basis of material non-disclosure by the plaintiff in the
                    affidavit supporting the application for the warrant of arrest (<em>The Rainbow Spring</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 362
                        (“<em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)</em>”) at
                        [35]), as it was well-established
                    that this was entirely independent of applications under O 12 r 7 and
                    O 18 r 19 of the ROC (see <em>The Rainbow Spring
                        (CA)</em> at [37] and
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> at [84]), but as discharging the warrant of
                    arrest on the basis of material non-disclosure generally does not otherwise
                    affect the validity of the plaintiff’s admiralty action (unlike
                    applications under O 12 r 7 and O 18 r 19 of the ROC), and
                    because the issue of non-disclosure was not relevant to this case, I will not
                    discuss it further, and nothing in these grounds should be taken as being
                    inconsistent with my views on the matter of non-disclosure in <em>The Eagle Prestige</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For the avoidance of doubt, I have in these
                    grounds endeavoured (except where I have quoted <em>verbatim</em> from the source material) to use the term “set
                    aside” (and its various cognates) to describe the relief sought by the
                    defendant in challenging the court’s jurisdiction pursuant to O 12
                    r 7 of the ROC, and “strike out” (and its various cognates)
                    to describe the relief sought by the defendant pursuant to O 18 r 19
                    of the ROC or pursuant to the court’s inherent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The reason for such punctiliousness is that it
                    was sometimes unclear from the cases which route a defendant was adopting, and
                    consequently what relief the court was granting. The learned AR, for instance,
                    although clearly granting relief in the nature of O 12 r 7 of the ROC
                    by upholding the defendant’s jurisdictional objections, expressed himself
                    in terms of “striking out”, which was language that was more
                    appropriate to O 18 r 19. Notwithstanding this, in these grounds, I
                    have treated the learned AR as basing his decision on both O 12 r 7
                    and O 18 r 19. Precision is important, because the relationship
                    between relief under O 12 r 7 and O 18 r 19 of the ROC, in
                    the context of the HCAJA, is complex, and they have sometimes been confused due
                    to lack of clarity in the terminology used.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     There have been cases where the
                    defendant’s application was based solely on the ground of lack of
                    admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> (<em>eg</em>, <em>Schwarz &amp; Co (Grain) Ltd v St
                        Elefterio ex Arion (Owners) (The St Elefterio)</em> [1957] 1 P 179
                        (“<em>The St Elefterio</em>”); <em>The Wigwam</em> [1981-1982] SLR(R) 689
                        (“<em>The Wigwam (HC)</em>”); <em>The Owners of the Motor Vessel “Iran Amanat” v KMP
                        Coastal Oil Pte Limited</em> (1999) 196 CLR 130 (“<em>Iran Amanat</em>”)). There have also been cases where
                    the application was based solely on O 18 r 19 of the ROC or the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction (<em>eg</em>, <em>Sunly Petroleum Co Ltd v The Owners of the Ship or Vessel Lok
                        Maheshwari</em> [1996] SGHC 212 (“<em>Lok Maheshwari</em>”); <em>The J
                        Faster</em> [2000] 1 HKC 652). More often than not, however, the
                    application was effectively based on both grounds (albeit drafted as alternative
                    prayers in the application), with the defendant canvassing the same arguments in
                    its applications under O 12 r 7 and O 18 r 19 of the ROC (as
                    in the present action), or arguing that the plaintiff’s claim, in addition
                    to invalidly invoking jurisdiction under O 12 r 7, was bound to fail
                    for some other reason under O 18 r 19 (<em>eg</em>, <em>The Moschanthy</em> [1971] 1
                    Lloyd’s Rep 37; <em>The Hsing An</em>
                    [1971-1973] SLR(R) 843; and the present action, as far as issue
                    estoppel was concerned).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Strictly speaking, it should not be proper to
                    deploy the same arguments in respect of O 12 r 7 and O 18
                    r 19 of the ROC, for when an action is struck out under the latter
                    provision, that means the court is <em>exercising</em> its
                    jurisdiction to prevent (broadly speaking) an abuse of its process; whereas if a
                    writ is set aside under the former, that means the court has <em>no</em> jurisdiction (see <em>Astro Exito Navegacion
                        SA v W T Hsu (The “Messiniaki Tolmi”)</em> [1984]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep 266 and D C Jackson, <em>Enforcement of
                        Maritime Claims</em> (LLP, 4<sup>th</sup> ed, 2005) at
                    paras 9.60 and 10.67). In non-admiralty cases, for instance, where the
                    court’s jurisdiction depends on valid service of the writ of summons on
                    the defendant, an argument that the court is not properly seised of jurisdiction
                    due to a defect in service would be mounted under O 12 r 7 of the ROC,
                    and not O 18 r 19. Yet, in admiralty actions (as this case
                    illustrated), an unhealthy practice appears to have built up whereby both
                    reliefs are often claimed on the same arguments (<em>viz</em>, that the defendant could not be said to be the
                    “relevant person” within the meaning of s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA), so that facts forming the basis of
                    jurisdiction and those forming the substance of the underlying claim become
                    mixed up (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> below), leading to
                    confusion between the <em>existence</em> of jurisdiction
                    and its <em>exercise</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em>, I adverted (at [54]) to this undesirable state of affairs. The broad
                    terminology I used there, <em>viz</em>, “Situation
                    1” and “Situation 2” cases, was intended, <em>inter alia</em>, to emphasise the distinction between a
                    question of jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> under O 12
                    r 7 of the ROC and a question of merits under O 18 r 19. It was
                    also a convenient way to explain that, typically, in the former case, the
                    plaintiff in an action <em>in rem</em> is not required to
                    disclose defences to the claim at the stage of applying for a warrant of arrest.
                    Given its contextual purpose, that terminology would not have adequately
                    captured the full breadth and complexity of the two approaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Distinguishing between applications under
                    O 12 r 7 and O 18 r 19 of the ROC in this manner raised the
                    question of when the court should resort to O 12 r 7 of the ROC, and
                    when to O 18 r 19, especially in instances where (as in the present
                    case) it was faced with applications under both provisions, albeit framed in the
                    alternative. The touchstone, in my opinion, was whether the court could limit
                    its inquiry to purely <em>jurisdictional</em> matters of
                    fact or law, in which case O 12 r 7 was the correct procedural tool;
                    or whether it was required to delve into <em>non-jurisdictional</em> matters of fact or law (<em>ie</em>, the merits of the dispute), in which case O 18
                    r 19 was the correct means of proceeding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The distinction between issues of jurisdiction
                    and issues of liability or merits was one that was generally well-established in
                    admiralty law. Jurisdictional disputes, as I understood the term, were disputes
                    over the existence or veracity of jurisdictional facts (<em>ie</em>, facts which had to be found as a condition precedent to
                    jurisdiction), or disputes over the correct answer to a jurisdictional question
                    of law (<em>eg</em>, the proper interpretation of a
                    statutory provision which conferred jurisdiction). Jurisdictional disputes were
                    necessarily separate from, and logically prior to, the substantive,
                    non-jurisdictional dispute between the parties over the issue of the
                    defendant’s liability (<em>ie</em>, the merits of the
                    plaintiff’s claim), and as such, the court was obliged to resolve
                    jurisdictional disputes at the outset, once and for all (<em>I
                        Congreso del Partido</em> [1978] 1 QB 500 at 535–536 (see
                        <a href="#p1_105">[105]</a> below) and <em>The
                        Jarguh Sawit</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 829 at [30] (see <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a> below)), after which the matter was <em>res
                        judicata</em> (<em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> at
                        [32] and [39]), and the action (assuming the court was
                    seised of jurisdiction) proceeded to a trial of the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The conclusive resolution of jurisdictional
                    disputes in advance of the substantive trial of the merits was the proper
                    province of O 12 r 7 of the ROC, from which it followed that
                    non-jurisdictional matters (<em>eg</em>, the existence or
                    veracity of non-jurisdictional facts, or the resolution of non-jurisdictional
                    questions of law) relating to the merits of the dispute were not to be
                    investigated by the court in an application to set aside the writ under
                    O 12 r 7 (<em>The Indriani</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 5 at [17]), for at
                    that stage the court was concerned exclusively with <em>jurisdictional matters</em> (whether of fact or of law). Order 12
                    r 7 of the ROC was not the proper means by which to deal with
                    non-jurisdictional matters, because at the jurisdictional stage, the existence
                    and veracity of non-jurisdictional facts pleaded by the plaintiff were to be
                    assumed (David Chong Gek Sian, “In Personam Liability, Beneficial
                    Ownership and the Action in Rem” (1994) 6 SAcLJ 272
                    (“Chong’s article”) at p 275, citing many of the authorities
                    I will be dealing with later in these grounds), and non-jurisdictional questions
                    of law ignored. In other words, non-jurisdictional questions of fact (or the
                    application of the law to such facts), being matters which were appropriately
                    concerned with liability or merits (<em>ie</em>, the
                    strength of the plaintiff’s claim), were to be separately dealt with at
                    the substantive trial, or, if the plaintiff’s claim was so unmeritorious
                    as to be plainly unsustainable, under O 18 r 19 of the
                ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision under O 18 r 19 of the ROC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     At the hearing of the appeal the parties were
                    contesting a large number of non-jurisdictional matters of fact and law. Indeed,
                    from the outset, the defendant’s General Manager, Corporate Procurement
                    and Supply Management, Ms Noraini Binti Ibrahim, in her first affidavit claimed
                    that the present proceedings were “frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of
                        process”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> I therefore considered that the application
                    was to be dealt with under O 18 r 19 of the ROC. As I have already
                    indicated (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above), I upheld the
                    decision of the learned AR and struck out the plaintiff’s action under
                    O 18 r 19 of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In the first part of these grounds (<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>–<a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> below), I explain my ruling, while in the second part of
                    these grounds (<a href="#p1_76">[76]</a>–<a href="#p1_157">[157]</a> below), I explain my reasons for rejecting
                    the learned AR’s primary basis for his decision under O 12 r 7
                    to “strike out” (<em>ie</em>, set aside (see
                        <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above)) the action, <em>viz</em>, that the plaintiff was required to satisfy the
                    court that it had a good arguable case on the merits before it was entitled to
                    invoke the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">
<em>Introduction</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As I said in <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em> (at [57]), it is
                    always open to a defendant to apply at an early stage of admiralty proceedings
                    for the action to be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the ROC on
                    the basis that it has no chance of success, and the burden on the issue of
                    non-liability lies on the defendant to show that the plaintiff’s case is
                    wholly and clearly unarguable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The question for the court, upon an
                    application for a striking out of the action, would be the strength,
                    sustainability or merits of the plaintiff’s claim, <em>ie</em>, all the non-jurisdictional matters which are not generally
                    germane on a challenge to jurisdiction under O 12 r 7 of the ROC (see
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above). Counsel for the defendant,
                    Mr Prem Gurbani, advanced a number of submissions calculated to demonstrate
                    that the plaintiff’s claim was plainly unsustainable on the
                merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s locus standi</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Mr Gurbani took this as a threshold point
                    at the appeal (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above) even though
                    it was not his strongest submission. He argued that the plaintiff lacked
                        <em>locus standi</em> to bring the present action
                    because the invoices (which were annexed to a letter of demand sent by the
                    plaintiff’s previous solicitors) issued by the plaintiff in respect of the
                    unpaid bunkers plainly stated that “[a]ll proceeds hereunder are assigned
                    to BNP Paribas…”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    Consequently, the defendant submitted, it was clear that the party entitled to
                    those proceeds was BNP Paribas and not the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff
                    therefore had no arguable case against the defendant, necessitating that the
                    action be struck out as being obviously unsustainable. At the hearing,
                    Mr Gurbani expanded on this submission, asserting that, as a result of the
                    assignment, the action should have been brought by BNP Paribas, or BNP Paribas
                    should at least have been joined as plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I did not accept this argument, because it was
                    clear from the relevant documents that there was no absolute assignment of the
                    plaintiff’s receivables to BNP Paribas; the notice in its tax invoices was
                    merely confirmatory of a floating charge the plaintiff had granted to BNP
                    Paribas over the sums standing to the credit of the plaintiff’s account
                    with it. Notably, the statement comprising the notice directed all payment of
                    proceeds of tax invoices into the account of the plaintiff with BNP Paribas, and
                    not to BNP Paribas’ account – a strong sign that there was no
                    assignment in place. It was therefore somewhat misleading for the invoices to
                    have stated that the “proceeds” had been “assigned”
                    to BNP Paribas, for the fact of the matter was that the security in question was
                    a floating charge in favour of BNP Paribas over sums standing to the credit of
                    the plaintiff’s account with it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As Mr Leong Kah Wah, counsel for the
                    plaintiff, explained, at the material time, the plaintiff had in place trade
                    facilities with BNP Paribas, which was governed by a “Letter
                    Agreement” dated 29 July 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Clause
                    9(iii) of the Letter Agreement made reference to a “registered Fixed and
                    Floating Charge in the name of [the plaintiff] dated 27 September
                        2002”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Clause 15(iii) of the Letter
                        Agreement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and cl 3.1 of the Fixed and Floating
                        Charge,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> setting out the assets included within
                    the charge, were drafted in wide terms, and would certainly have included the
                    monies due to the plaintiff under the invoices, although the uncontroverted
                    evidence from the plaintiff’s Managing Director, Mrs Choong-Ong Gek Hoon,
                    was that, at all material times, there had been no default under the facilities
                    and the floating charge had not crystallised.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>
                    Mrs Choong-Ong further explained that the notice in the plaintiff’s
                    invoices was inserted because of clause 12(xii) of the Letter Agreement, which
                    provided that the plaintiff undertook to “notify the legal assignment of
                    proceeds in the invoice to all its buyers”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> In
                    short, the statement in the invoices regarding the assignment of proceeds
                    thereunder to BNP Paribas simply represented the plaintiff’s compliance
                    with its contractual obligations to BNP Paribas, and nothing more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     I did not think that the Letter
                    Agreement’s reference to a “legal assignment” necessarily
                    supported the defendant’s case, as Mr Gurbani had argued. In the
                    circumstances, the terminology was not decisive. There was an important
                    distinction between an outright assignment and an assignment by way of security,
                    and whether a particular transaction was one or the other depended on the real
                    intention of the parties (see Greg Tolhurst, <em>The Assignment
                        of Contractual Rights</em> (Hart Publishing, 2006) at paras [3.15] and
                    [3.16]), and if, on a true construction of the relevant documents, the real
                    intention of the parties was that of a charge, the fact that it had been
                    labelled an assignment was irrelevant (<em>The Manchester,
                        Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company v The North Central Wagon
                        Company</em> (1888) 13 App Cas 554 at 568 (<em>per</em> Lord Macnaghten) and <em>Helby v Matthews and
                        others</em> [1895] 1 AC 471 at 475 (<em>per</em>
                    Lord Herschell LC)). Here, it was clear from the Letter Agreement and the Fixed
                    and Floating Charge that what had been intended was a charge, and not an
                    assignment as such. There were important differences between a charge and an
                    assignment (see <em>The Assignment of Contractual
                        Rights</em> at para [3.17], especially pp 51–52), not least the
                    fact that the chargor would lack an intention to assign, a <em>sine qua non</em> of all consensual assignments (see <em>The Assignment of Contractual Rights</em> at paras [3.14] and
                    [7.03]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Consequently, the <em>locus
                        standi</em> point was without merit, and furnished no basis on which
                    to strike out the plaintiff’s action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s claim in contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The plaintiff’s claim in contract was
                    essentially that the defendant was a party to the Fixed Price Contracts and the
                    Navig8 Faith Contract via the agency of its alleged agent, MAL, and that the
                    defendant was therefore contractually liable to the plaintiff for the bunkers
                    supplied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The main argument raised by the defendant in
                    response was that there was no contractual relationship between itself and the
                    plaintiff (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above), because at all
                    material times, MAL was the defendant’s contractual seller, issuing its
                    invoices to the defendant based on the agreed unit price of the bunkers. It was
                    common ground that the plaintiff’s invoices had never been sent to the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The defendant’s argument sought to
                    demonstrate that the evidence did not support the existence of the Fixed Price
                    Contracts and the Navig8 Faith Contract as between the plaintiff and defendant,
                    nor did they establish an agency relationship between the defendant and MAL. As
                    such, Mr Gurbani submitted, the plaintiff’s claim in contract ought
                    to be struck out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Evidence of the Fixed Price Contracts and the Navig8 Faith
                Contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As stated (see <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above), contrary to the plaintiff’s pleaded case that
                    it (the plaintiff) was suing the defendant on two Fixed Price Contracts
                        (<em>ie</em>, for the supply of 35,000 metric tonnes of
                    bunkers in August 2008 for one month at the fixed price of US$744 per metric
                    tonne, and 35,000 metric tonnes of bunkers in September 2008 for one month at
                    the fixed price of US$750 per metric tonne), and the Navig8 Faith Contract, the
                    defendant’s position was that it had entered into a six-month Bunker Fixed
                    Price Agreement (“BFPA”), pursuant to which MAL supplied 138,000
                    metric tonnes of bunkers at a fixed price of US$475 per metric tonne, from 24
                    March 2008 to 23 September 2008, to a total of 13 vessels owned or operated by
                    the defendant. According to the defendant, the BFPA was the subject-matter of a
                    tender and MAL was amongst eight companies (including established firms such as
                    Petronas Dagangan Berhad, BP Singapore Pte Ltd and Shell Malaysia Trading Sdn
                    Bhd) that received bid documents. Six companies submitted bids to the defendant,
                    and eventually MAL was successful in the tender, being awarded the BFPA on 14
                    March 2008. In addition to the BFPA, there were nine spot contracts (referred to
                    by the defendant as the “Market Price Contracts”) for the supply
                    of bunkers to vessels owned or operated by the defendant at the prevailing
                    market rates for bunkers. Mr Gurbani argued that the plaintiff’s
                    version of events (<em>viz</em>, that the plaintiff had
                    contracted with the defendant, via the agency of MAL) was simply not credible in
                    light of the clear evidence supporting the defendant’s
                position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I agreed with Mr Gurbani and was of the
                    view that the plaintiff’s case was indeed fraught with insurmountable
                    evidential difficulties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     First, the plaintiff had pleaded that the two
                    Fixed Price Contracts were evidenced by two e-mails from Compass Marine, both
                    entitled “Bunker Confirmation” and dated 3 July 2008. The
                    pleadings did not refer to MAL’s fax confirmations dated 4 July 2008,
                    although both the e-mails from Compass Marine and MAL’s fax confirmations
                    were referred to by Mr Darren-Middleton, Managing Director of Compass
                    Marine, in an affidavit filed in support of the plaintiff’s
                        case.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>
                    The first e-mail from Compass Marine confirmed the supply of bunkers in the
                    month of August 2008 at the fixed price of US$744 per metric tonne,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> while the second e-mail confirmed the supply of
                    bunkers in the month of September 2008 at the fixed price of US$750 per metric
                        tonne.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Both these e-mails
                    contained a clause stating “Sellers/Suppliers General Terms and
                    conditions of sale to apply”. In its pleadings, the plaintiff referred to
                    or relied on a number of clauses from these “terms and
                    conditions”. In contrast, MAL’s fax confirmations of 4 July
                    2008 (confirming the supply of bunkers in August and September 2008 at the fixed
                    price of US$744 per metric tonne and US$750 per metric tonne
                        respectively)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> stated
                    that the supply of bunkers was to be governed by “the general terms and
                    conditions contained in “BIMCO STANDARD BUNKER
                    CONTRACT”…” There was therefore a clear inconsistency in
                    the terms and conditions under which the bunkers were to be supplied, which
                    seemed to me to be a classic example of a “battle of forms” (see
                        <em>Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corporation
                        (England) Ltd</em> [1979] 1 WLR 401). Thus, it might
                    plausibly be suggested that there was no consensus <em>ad
                        idem</em>, or at the very least, no Fixed Price Contracts on the
                    plaintiff’s pleaded terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Second, Mr Yahya bin Mohd Khalid, the
                    Managing Director of MAL, had filed an affidavit in support of the
                    plaintiff’s claim,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> but curiously and rather tellingly,
                    Mr Yahya did not mention the Fixed Price Contracts and the Navig8 Faith
                    Contract in his affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Third, the plaintiff simply had no answer to
                    the clear and cogent evidence from the defendant establishing the existence of
                    the BFPA and the Market Price Contracts. Mr Gurbani submitted that the
                    existence of the BFPA, and the due performance of their respective obligations
                    thereunder by MAL and the defendant, completely undermined the plaintiff’s
                    claim in contract, for it demonstrated beyond doubt that MAL was not the
                    defendant’s agent. In this respect, Mr Gurbani pressed the point that
                    it made no commercial sense for the defendant to obtain bunkers from MAL under
                    the BFPA (in March 2008) at US$475 per metric tonne, and then
                    “authorise” MAL (in July 2008) to contract, as the
                    defendant’s agent, with the plaintiff or its brokers at a price in excess
                    of US$740 per metric tonne. Like the learned AR (see [51] of his grounds of decision), I was
                    persuaded by these facts and contentions. The plaintiff sought to cast doubt on
                    the genuineness of the BFPA, contending that it was “puzzling”
                    that the defendant awarded the BFPA to MAL, notwithstanding that MAL had offered
                    the lowest bid, over more established companies such as BP Singapore Pte Ltd and
                    Shell Malaysia Trading Sdn Bhd, especially since, based on the prevailing market
                    prices at the time, by offering a bid of US$475 per metric tonne, the BFPA was a
                    loss-making transaction for MAL from the outset. As the learned AR pointedly
                    noted (at [53] of his grounds of
                    decision), however, one would have thought that it was precisely because MAL
                    offered such a low bid that it was awarded the BFPA over the other
                    bidders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In the face of these evidential problems, the
                    plaintiff contended that the issue of whether or not the defendant would be
                    liable to the plaintiff on the claim in contract was a matter that should
                    properly be dealt with at trial and could not be disposed of under O 18
                    r 19 of the ROC. The defendant, however, argued that, even aside from these
                    difficulties, the plaintiff’s claim in contract was unarguable and bound
                    to fail, because no agency relationship between the defendant and MAL was
                    disclosed, and to this I now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Agency by estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiff’s case was based on agency
                    by estoppel (also known as ostensible authority), which required (<em>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia

                        directed him to contact MAL to discuss the defendant’s bunker

                        Marine formed the belief that MAL must have been “very close
                        to”, and “acted exclusively for”, the
                            defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mr Yahya, in his affidavit dated
                        25 February 2010, confirmed that MAL had fixed bunker deals on behalf of the
                        defendant, and that everyone in the bunker industry knew that MAL was acting
                        “on behalf of” the defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mr Lars Nielsen, the Managing Director of Brilliant
                        Maritime Services (“BMS”), a firm of bunker traders and
                        brokers, filed an affidavit deposing that, in or around September 2008, an
                        employee in the defendant’s Bunker Unit named “Khairul”
                        told one of his staff that MAL was the defendant’s bunker broker, and
                        directed BMS to contact MAL to discuss the defendant’s bunker
                            requirements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Like Mr Middleton,
                        Mr Nielsen understood this to mean that the defendant had appointed MAL
                        as the defendant’s broker or exclusive buying agent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_53-p2_d"></a>(d)     Mr Grant Foulger, an employee of OceanConnect, filed
                        an affidavit deposing that in or around November 2005, he was contacted by a
                        representative of MAL, who advised him that MAL was acting as the
                        defendant’s broker, and asked OceanConnect to submit a quote for the
                        supply of bunkers to one of the defendant’s vessels.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>
                        In respect of that transaction, OceanConnect and MAL shared a brokerage
                            commission,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and this arrangement
                        continued up to December 2008, with OceanConnect and MAL sharing brokerage
                        fees as co-brokers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> It was not in dispute that
                        OceanConnect and MAL shared a brokerage commission in respect of the supply
                        of bunkers to the <em>MT Navig8
                    Faith</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     There were several fundamental problems with
                    the allegations in these affidavits. First, Mr Middleton’s affidavit
                    was contradicted by an affidavit filed on behalf of the defendant by
                    Mr Shahrol Azam Bin Shaharum,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> who was the
                    defendant’s Manager of Bunker Operations and Management. In his affidavit,
                    Mr Shaharum stated that no one in the defendant’s Bunker Section
                    recalled having conversations of the sort alleged by
                        Mr Middleton.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> There was some doubt, therefore, as
                    to whether or not the alleged representations had been made at all. In this
                    regard, it was noted (see [60] of the
                    learned AR’s grounds of decision) that Compass Marine might have had a
                    vested interest in asserting that MAL was the defendant’s agent, for, if
                    the truth were otherwise, Compass Marine would potentially be liable to the
                    plaintiff in negligence in having misrepresented that the plaintiff’s
                    contractual buyer was the defendant when it was in fact MAL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Second, Mr Yahya’s affidavit was
                    not at all persuasive, and I placed little weight on it. For instance, there was
                    a glaring omission in his affidavit that MAL acted as agent for the defendant
                    specifically in respect of the <em>Fixed Price
                        Contracts</em> and the <em>Navig8 Faith
                        Contract</em>, which omission was clearly deliberate because MAL had
                    confirmed elsewhere that it was the defendant’s contractual seller.
                    Firstly, in a previous Declaration, sworn on 5 December 2008 intended for the
                    purposes of the US proceedings,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Mr Yahya had clearly described the
                    relationship between MAL and the defendant as that of contractual buyer and
                    seller. Although the Declaration was not subsequently needed for the US
                    Proceedings, the fact remained that Mr Yahya’s signed statement
                    acknowledged the six-month contract between MAL and the defendant for the supply
                    of 138,000 metric tonnes of bunkers to the defendant (<em>ie</em>, the BFPA). Secondly, in legal proceedings which MAL had
                    instituted against Affin Bank Berhad (“Affin Bank”) (a Malaysian
                    Bank) on 30 March 2009 in Malaysia for its failure to extend sufficient credit
                    facilities to MAL (the “Malaysian proceedings”), the thrust of
                    MAL’s case was that it had contracted with the defendant, that the
                    plaintiff was one of MAL’s suppliers, and that it was on account of Affin
                    Bank’s failure to extend sufficient credit facilities that MAL could not
                    pay its suppliers. MAL pleaded its business model in its statement of claim,
                    stating that with the promised credit facilities it would:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… enter into a <em>short term periodic
                            contract</em> for the sale of Bunkers to MISC [the defendant in
                        the present action] at a certain and fixed price, before sourcing and
                        securing the required quantity of Bunkers at a lower price from the open
                        market in order to profit from the sale. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Furthermore, MAL pleaded that Affin Bank had also agreed but failed to
                    provide MAL with fresh and/or enhanced facilities to bridge price differences
                    due to price fluctuations when bunkers were bought by MAL at prices higher than
                    the fixed price MAL had agreed to sell to the defendant. Consequently, MAL was
                    not able to meet its payment obligations to its suppliers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> In other words, the position that MAL
                    had taken in the Malaysian proceedings was entirely inconsistent with what
                    Mr Yahya was now insinuating in his affidavit, as well as with the
                    plaintiff’s version of events (but, I might add, quite consistent with the
                    defendant’s allegations).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Thirdly, and in my view most importantly,
                    Mr Yahya also did not explain a letter of 18 November 2008 from MAL to the
                        defendant<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> appealing to the latter
                    to award MAL “a new <em>fixed term supply
                        contract</em>” [emphasis added]. As the learned AR concluded,
                    this was not a letter that would have been written by a party who took the view
                    that it was only acting as an agent purchasing bunkers on behalf of its
                    principal. Interestingly, MAL in this letter to the defendant actually referred
                    to MAL having “secured a six (6) months supply of 138,000 MT…
                    contract to [the defendant] at a fixed price USD475.00/MT at a total award price
                    of USD 65,550,000.00 (<b>“the
                    Contract”</b>)” [original emphasis].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Throughout the letter, MAL made repeated
                    references to “the Contract”, and from what MAL was saying to the
                    defendant, there was never any doubt of a purely contractual relationship
                    between MAL and the defendant (<em>ie</em>, the
                    defendant’s version of events) rather than an agency relationship (which
                    was the plaintiff’s submission).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Third, Mr Nielsen’s affidavit
                    evidence was irrelevant because, at the hearing, Mr Leong conceded that he
                    was not relying on Mr Nielsen’s affidavit, as it deposed to an
                    incident which occurred <em>after</em> the Fixed Price
                    Contracts and the Navig8 Faith Contract had allegedly been concluded. In any
                    case, it was difficult to see how Mr Nielsen’s evidence could be
                    regarded as a representation <em>to the plaintiff</em> that
                    MAL had authority from the defendant to enter the Fixed Price Contracts and the
                    Navig8 Faith Contract, when BMS was not involved at all in those
                    transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Finally, none of the affidavits actually
                    stated that there was a representation that MAL had authority to enter (on
                    behalf of the defendant) into, specifically, the <em>Fixed Price
                        Contracts</em> and the <em>Navig8 Faith
                        Contract</em>, as opposed to some other transaction. It has already
                    been noted that the alleged representation to Mr Nielsen took place in
                    September 2008, after the Fixed Price Contracts had been concluded in July
                    2008 (see <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a> above), but I should also
                    point out that the alleged representations to Mr Middleton and
                    Mr Foulger took place in 2006 and 2005 respectively, long before the Fixed
                    Price Contracts and the Navig8 Faith Contract were allegedly concluded
                    in July 2008 and September 2008. The plaintiff sought to meet this latter
                    difficulty by submitting that the alleged representations, once made, were
                    deemed to continue until retracted by the representor and the fact of retraction
                    communicated to the representee. On this argument, the alleged representations
                    in 2006 and 2005 therefore continued to remain operative in July and
                    September 2008, because they had never been retracted by the defendant. Although
                    Sean Wilken, <em>Wilken and Villiers: The Law of Waiver,
                        Variation and Estoppel</em> (Oxford University Press,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 2002), para [9.57], was cited in support
                    of this contention, the learned author of that work provided no authority for
                    this broad proposition. The proposition was stated more narrowly (and, in my
                    view, correctly) in K R Handley, <em>Spencer Bower, Turner and
                        Handley: Actionable Misrepresentation</em> (Butterworths,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2000) at para 61:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A representation having been made <em>for the purpose of an
                            intended transaction</em> will normally be regarded as continuing
                        until the transaction is entered into or completed, unless varied or
                        withdrawn in the meantime. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The case of <em>Director of Public Prosecutions v
                        Ray</em> [1974] 1 AC 370 was cited as authority for this proposition,
                    and it was clear from that decision that the House of Lords, when referring to
                    “continuing representations”, meant only to refer to a
                    representation made <em>for the purpose of a particular
                        transaction</em>. It was impossible, therefore, to link the alleged
                    representations in 2006 and 2005, which, even if made, would have related to
                    completely different transactions, to the Fixed Price Contracts and Navig8 Faith
                    Contract in 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In the face of all these difficulties, the
                    plaintiff’s case in contract, insofar as it rested on ostensible authority
                    based on an <em>express</em> representation, was bound to
                    fail. It was therefore necessary to consider whether the necessary
                    representation could be made out on the basis of an <em>implied</em> representation, in that the defendant knew or ought to
                    have known that MAL had been representing itself to the bunker industry as the
                    defendant’s agent, but took no steps to correct this view and/or
                    acquiesced in MAL’s actions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Implied representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In support of its contention that the
                    defendant knew or ought to have known that bunker suppliers and traders (such as
                    the plaintiff) were under the impression that MAL was the defendant’s
                    broker or agent, the plaintiff relied on a number of documents and allegations
                    contained in various affidavits:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_a"></a>(a)     It was alleged by Mr Yahya that
                        MAL would not have been able to procure the supply of bunkers on such
                        favourable credit terms if it was purchasing as contractual
                            principal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> However, that this allegation
                        was contained in Mr Yahya’s affidavit, in my opinion, seriously
                        weakened its evidential value (see <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_b"></a>(b)     According to Messrs Middleton and Nielsen, MAL had no reputation in the
                        bunker industry and was a “nobody” if not for the fact that it
                        was or was believed to be the defendant’s bunker broker.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>
                        In addition, according to Mr Yahya, about 90 to 95% of the
                        defendant’s bunker requirements were met through MAL, so much so that
                        Mr Leong submitted that the defendant was the only
                        “customer” of MAL. These assertions, however, foundered upon
                        Mr Foulger’s clear evidence that between February 2007 and
                        December 2008, OceanConnect and MAL engaged in “more than 540
                        separate bunker transactions”, and that, since the inception of
                        OceanConnect’s course of dealing with MAL (apparently in November
                        2005), “more than 120” bunker transactions involved the
                            defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> If so, then between February 2007
                        and December 2008 alone there were at least 420 transactions in which
                        OceanConnect was prepared to deal with MAL when the defendant was not
                        involved. It was hard to see how it could be said that MAL was a
                        “nobody”, or that the defendant was its only customer, in
                        light of the plaintiff’s own evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_c"></a>(c)     It was stated by Mrs Choong-Ong that when the
                        plaintiff, pursuant to the Fixed Price Contracts and the Navig8 Faith
                        Contract, supplied the bunkers in question to the defendant’s vessels,
                        the plaintiff would liaise directly with the defendant’s local agents
                        in Singapore, MISC (Singapore) Pte Ltd, to coordinate the bunkering
                        operations, and that MAL was never involved in the bunkering
                            operations.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Mrs Choong-Ong considered this to
                        be “consistent with [MAL’s] role as a broker (as opposed to a
                        contractual seller)”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> However, Mrs
                        Choong-Ong’s assertions concerned operational rather than
                        transactional matters, and since the Fixed Price Contracts and the Navig8
                        Faith Contract were to be performed in Singapore, it was not clear why the
                        fact that the defendant’s Singapore-based agent and subsidiary (rather
                        than the Malaysia-based MAL) was coordinating the bunkering operations
                        necessarily had to raise any eyebrows.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_d"></a>(d)     The plaintiff also relied on the fact that, on 5 November
                        2008, when the plaintiff first sent a written demand for payment, the
                        defendant did not deny liability but simply forwarded the demand to
                            MAL.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> This was true, but what had
                        actually happened was that, in forwarding the e-mail to MAL, the defendant
                        had also added the terse message “[please] check whether this is
                        [your] supplier”, which was, as the learned AR held (at [75] of his grounds of decision):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">… perfectly consistent with [the defendant’s] position
                            that the plaintiff was MAL’s contractual supplier, not the
                            defendant’s. If anything, the brevity of the defendant’s
                            response was indicative of its view that it clearly had nothing to do
                            with the actual procurement of the bunker supplies, a matter solely
                            between MAL and its contractual suppliers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">This was reinforced by MAL’s equally brief reply to the
                        defendant that “we [MAL] will check
                    immediately”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_e"></a>(e)     The plaintiff also pointed to the defendant’s offer of a
                        corporate guarantee on 2 December 2008, after the plaintiff had attached the
                        defendant’s vessel the <em>Bunga Kasturi
                            Lima</em> in California (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above), as an admission of liability, contending that
                        there was no reason why a large, publicly-listed company like the defendant
                        would offer to pay if it was not in fact liable for the outstanding amounts.
                        The problem for the plaintiff, however, was that, as the learned AR noted
                        (at [72] of his grounds of
                        decision), inherent in the very notion of a guarantee was the provision of
                        security for <em>another party’s liability</em>,
                        and that the wording of the corporate guarantee made it clear that it was to
                        guarantee the outstanding sum due and owing to the plaintiff <em>from MAL</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> In
                        addition, the defendant explained that the corporate guarantee would have
                        been much less costly for the defendant than the continued attachment of the
                            <em>Bunga Kasturi Lima</em>, as the vessel was
                        worth far more than the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was
                    therefore hard to understand how any of the above points could convincingly be
                    seen as some sort of implied representation from the defendant’s conduct
                    that MAL was the defendant’s agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Representation by person with “actual”
                authority</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The plaintiff’s claim based on agency by
                    estoppel was unsustainable also because there was no real evidence that any
                    representation, even assuming one had been made, emanated from a person with
                    “actual” authority. The alleged representation to Mr Foulger
                    was made by MAL, and not the defendant’s authorised representative, and it
                    was trite that an agent could not clothe himself with authority via his own
                    representations (see <em>Skandinaviska (CA)</em> at
                        [38]), while Mr Middleton could
                    not remember the name of the defendant’s employee he allegedly spoke to,
                    much less whether that employee was authorised to make the alleged
                    representations. Above all, Mr Yahya did not identify anyone from the
                    defendant who had made the alleged representation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Inducement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Finally, the plaintiff relied on a number of
                    matters dating from November and December 2008 (<em>eg</em>, the defendant’s reaction to the plaintiff’s demand
                    and the defendant’s offer of a corporate guarantee (see [60(d)] and
                    [60(e)] above)) to buttress its case of an alleged “industry-wide
                    belief” that MAL was purchasing bunkers in the name of the defendant as
                    the latter’s broker or agent. However, all these matters post-dated the
                    conclusion and performance of the Fixed Price Contracts and the Navig8 Faith
                    Contract, so it was impossible for them to be indicative of any sort of implied
                    representation by conduct which was relied upon by the plaintiff or which
                    induced it to enter the transactions in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the plaintiff’s claim in contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     On the evidence before me, the
                    plaintiff’s case that there was a contractual relationship between the
                    plaintiff and the defendant (established through the agency of MAL) for the sale
                    of the bunkers was therefore plainly unsustainable and ought not to be allowed
                    to proceed to a full trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Consequently, I struck out the
                    plaintiff’s action (insofar as it was based on a claim or cause of action
                    in contract) pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff’s claim in unjust enrichment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The plaintiff also framed its claim in unjust
                    enrichment, as an alternative to its claim in contract (<em>ie</em>, assuming there was no contractual relationship between the
                    plaintiff and the defendant), on the basis that the defendant had been unjustly
                    enriched at the plaintiff’s expense because the defendant had, with
                    knowledge of and/or having induced the plaintiff’s mistaken belief that
                    there was a binding contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, accepted
                    and used the bunkers but had not paid the plaintiff. It followed that once I
                    accepted that the bunkers were supplied to the defendant by MAL under the BFPA
                    and the Market Price Contracts (which I did), the plaintiff’s claim in
                    unjust enrichment was misconceived, since, even if the defendant could be said
                    to have been enriched by its receipt of the bunkers at the expense of the
                    plaintiff, it would not have been unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit
                    of the bunkers (a necessary element in making out a claim in unjust enrichment
                    (see Lord Goff of Chieveley and Gareth Jones, <em>Goff and Jones:
                        The Law of Restitution</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        7<sup>th</sup> ed, 2007) (“<em>Goff
                        and Jones</em>”) at para 1-016)). First of all, there was no
                    “unjust factor” to speak of: the bunkers had not been supplied by
                    the plaintiff under a failure of consideration, mistake <em>etc</em>. Second, by contracting with MAL, the plaintiff took on all
                    the risks that that entailed, including the risk that it would not be paid (or
                    paid fully) by MAL, and the law of unjust enrichment could not, save in the most
                    exceptional of circumstances (which were not present here), be used to undermine
                    the parties’ contractual arrangements and redistribute the risk which had
                    already been expressly allocated under the contract, so as to allow a party who
                    had made a bad bargain (such as the plaintiff) to impose liability on a stranger
                    to the contract (such as the defendant) (see <em>Pan Ocean
                        Shipping Co Ltd v Creditcorp Ltd</em> [1994] 1 WLR 161 at
                    166 (<em>per</em> Lord Goff) and <em>Costello &amp; Anor v MacDonald &amp; Ors</em> [2011] EWCA Civ
                    930).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In addition, the defendant could also rely on
                    the defence of change of position, in relation to which the learned AR concluded
                    (see [81]–[86] of his grounds of decision) that the
                    evidence clearly showed that the defendant had <em>bona
                        fide</em> changed its position following its receipt of the bunkers.
                    The defence of change of position was accepted by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Seagate Technology Pte Ltd and another v Goh Han
                        Kim</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 836 at [31] and confirmed in <em>Management Corporation
                        Strata Title Plan No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd</em> [2002]
                    1 SLR(R) 418 at [35], and it
                    required that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the person enriched had changed his
                            position;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the change was <em>bona
                                fide</em>; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">it would be inequitable to require the person
                            enriched to make restitution or to make restitution in
                        full.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant had changed its position by expending the bunkers, and
                    paying a substantial sum of money to MAL in full settlement of the
                    defendant’s contractual obligation to MAL under the BFPA. All of this was
                    done <em>bona fide</em>, and it would be inequitable to
                    require the defendant to make restitution, for the defendant would otherwise be
                    exposed to double liability: once to MAL and again to the plaintiff (see
                        <em>Yaku Shin (JB) Sdn Bhd v Panasonic AVC Networks Singapore
                        Pte Ltd and another</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 193 at [82]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Further, insofar as the principle that
                    restitution would not be ordered if <em>restitutio in
                        integrum</em> was not possible was distinct from the defence of change
                    of position (see <em>Goff and Jones</em> at para 1-084),
                    that too stood in the way of the plaintiff’s claim in unjust
                    enrichment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Consequently, the plaintiff’s claim in
                    unjust enrichment was doomed to suffer the same fate as its claim in contract,
                    in that it had to be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the ROC as
                    being completely unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The defendant submitted that the
                    plaintiff’s claims in contract and unjust enrichment had been determined
                    by the US proceedings, and that the plaintiff was therefore estopped from
                    litigating the same issues before the Singapore courts, with the result that the
                    plaintiff’s action had to be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 of
                    the ROC as being frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In order to establish issue estoppel, it was
                    necessary that (see <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 277 (“<em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (HC)</em>”) at [38];

<p class="Judg-1">As the parties accepted that all the other requirements (<em>viz</em>, (a), (c) and (d)) were satisfied, the dispute
                    before me was focused on whether or not the US proceedings resulted in a
                    judgment that was “final and conclusive on the merits”. In
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (HC)</em>, Tan Lee Meng J
                    held (at [42]) that “[f]or a
                    judgment to be conclusive and final, it must be one that cannot be reopened by
                    the court that pronounced it”, and endorsed (at [40]) the following comment by Lord Brandon in
                        <em>The Sennar (No 2)</em> (at 499):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Looking at the matter negatively a decision on procedure alone is not a
                        decision on the merits. Looking at the matter positively <em>a decision on the merits is a decision which establishes certain facts
                            as proved or not in dispute; states what are the relevant principles of
                            law applicable to such facts; and expresses a conclusion with regard to
                            the effect of applying those principles to the factual situation
                            concerned</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The defendant argued that the US proceedings
                    had indeed resulted in a “final and conclusive” judgment
                    “on the merits” because, in order to obtain a Rule B attachment
                    order, a claimant would have to satisfy the court that it had a <em>prima facie</em> maritime claim against the defendant. Given
                    that the California District Court had, after considering the evidence and
                    arguments of both parties, held that the plaintiff had failed to establish such
                    a <em>prima facie</em> case for breach of contract and
                    unjust enrichment and vacated the Rule B attachment order (a decision which was
                    upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above)), the defendant submitted that those decisions were
                    clearly judgments which were final and conclusive on the merits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I did not accept this submission for the
                    simple reason that the US proceedings were only concerned with whether or not
                    the Rule B attachment order was to be vacated, and it was open to the courts in
                    the United States to reach a different view on the same issues at the subsequent
                    stage of considering the actual motion to dismiss the Verified Complaint (albeit
                    the motion was subsequently withdrawn (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above)). This was clear from the judgment of District Judge
                    Valerie Baker Fairbank in the California District Court:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In its appellate brief before the Ninth
                    Circuit Court of Appeals, the defendant itself had accepted that the decision of
                    the California District Court was not final and conclusive on the
                        merits:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the District Court expressly recognised that the… hearing
                        [to vacate the Rule B attachment order] was not for a final determination of
                        the merits of [the plaintiff’s] underlying claim, and the Court did
                        not purport to make such a final determination…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Consequently, in my view, the US proceedings
                    did not result in a judgment which was final and conclusive on the merits, and
                    as such were not capable of giving rise to an estoppel. I therefore upheld the
                    learned AR’s refusal to strike out the plaintiff’s action under
                    O 18 r 19 of the ROC on the basis of issue estoppel.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on striking out</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     For the foregoing reasons, I upheld the
                    AR’s decision to strike out the plaintiff’s claim under O 18
                    r 19 of the ROC on the basis that the plaintiff’s action was plainly
                    and obviously unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision under O 12 r 7 of the ROC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     I now turn to the jurisdictional aspect of the
                    defendant’s application, <em>viz</em>, a prayer that
                    the action be set aside on the basis that the admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> of the court under the HCAJA had been improperly
                    and/or invalidly invoked by the plaintiff (see [13(b)] above). Although the
                    defendant did not specify which provision of the ROC it was relying on for this
                    prayer, as a challenge to the court’s jurisdiction, clearly it would have
                    had to have been based on O 12 r 7 of the ROC. As I have stated (see
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), the learned AR granted an
                    order in terms of this prayer as well, albeit using somewhat ambiguous language,
                    being that of “striking out” rather than “setting
                    aside” (see my discussion at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>–<a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above
                    regarding the difference between the two).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I did not agree with the learned AR’s
                    decision to set aside the writ <em>in rem</em> under
                    O 12 r 7 of the ROC, which was based on the notion that, following
                    some of the Court of Appeal’s remarks in <em>The Vasiliy
                        Golovnin (CA)</em>, in order to invoke admiralty jurisdiction
                        <em>in rem</em>, apart from satisfying the relevant
                    provisions of the HCAJA, there was also an <em>independent</em> requirement that a plaintiff show an appropriately
                    strong case on the merits, to the standard of a “good arguable
                    case”, and that, as the plaintiff had failed to do so (for the very same
                    reasons the learned AR struck out the plaintiff’s action under O 18
                    r 19 of the ROC), the admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> of the court was not properly invoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     I propose to structure this part of my grounds

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     When a defendant challenges the admiralty
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> of the court pursuant to
                    O 12 r 7 of the ROC, he is essentially arguing that the
                    plaintiff’s claim does not fall within the relevant provisions of the
                    HCAJA, which, for the purposes of this case, I regarded as being s 4(4)
                    (although I may refer more generally to ss 3 and 4 of the HCAJA for
                    illustration purposes). The heading “[m]ode of exercise of admiralty
                    jurisdiction” appears in s 4 of the HCAJA, but this should not be
                    taken to mean that s 4 is merely about the <em>exercise</em> of jurisdiction, for it is well-established that the
                    section also relates to the <em>existence</em> of
                    jurisdiction (see <em>The Ocean Jade</em> [1991]
                    1 SLR(R) 354 at [19] and
                        [20]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In such a jurisdictional challenge by the
                    defendant under O 12 r 7 of the ROC, the onus is on the plaintiff to
                    establish jurisdiction (<em>The Aventicum</em> [1978] 1
                    Lloyd’s Rep 184 at 186; <em>The Andres Bonifacio</em>
                    [1991] 1 SLR(R) 523 at [19]
                    (appealed on a different point and upheld at [1993] 3 SLR(R) 71);

                        Samudra</em> [2010] 2 SLR 518 at [23]), and he does so by demonstrating that
                    his claim falls within s 4(4).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     It is helpful to separate s 4(4) of the
                    HCAJA into its constituent parts in order to ascertain what it requires of a
                    plaintiff. Under s 4(4), the plaintiff must:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(1)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">show that he has a claim under
                                s 3(1)(<em>d</em>) to (<em>q</em>);</div>

<p class="Judg-1">I will refer to these requirements as “step (1)” or
                    “step (2)”
                    <em>etc</em> of s 4(4) of the HCAJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     At this juncture, I should reiterate my view
                    (see <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>–<a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above) that, when a court is adjudicating a jurisdictional
                    dispute under O 12 r 7 of the ROC, it is generally only concerned with
                        <em>jurisdictional matters</em>, <em>ie</em>, jurisdictional facts or jurisdictional questions of law.
                    Non-jurisdictional facts or questions of law are matters going towards the
                    merits of the dispute (<em>ie</em>, the strength of the
                    plaintiff’s case, or, what amounts to the same thing, the
                    defendant’s liability), which are usually dealt with at trial or under
                    O 18 r 19 of the ROC, with one ostensible anomaly which I discuss
                    below (at <a href="#p1_117">[117]</a>–<a href="#p1_138">[138]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Step (1) of s 4(4): jurisdictional facts to be proved on a
                balance of probabilities, and jurisdictional questions of law to be shown on a good
                arguable case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     As a matter of principle, in the absence of
                    statutory language dictating otherwise, jurisdictional facts have to be proved
                    by the plaintiff on the normal civil standard of proof, <em>ie</em>, on <em>a balance of probabilities</em>,
                    and this was supported by a great deal of authority where steps (2), (4) and (5)
                    of s 4(4) of the HCAJA were concerned, which I will come to in due course
                    (see <a href="#p1_99">[99]</a>–<a href="#p1_107">[107]</a> below). Insofar as step (1) of s 4(4) required
                    jurisdictional facts to be established, the full bench of the High Court of
                    Australia made it plain that the standard of proof was that of a balance of
                    probabilities (see <em>The Owners of the Ship “Shin Kobe
                        Maru” v Empire Shipping Company Inc</em> (1994) 181 CLR 404
                        (“<em>Shin Kobe Maru”</em>)), as did the
                    New Zealand Court of Appeal (see <em>Baltic Shipping Co Ltd v
                        Pegasus Lines SA</em> [1996] 3 NZLR 641 (“<em>Baltic Shipping</em>”) and <em>Vostok
                        Shipping</em>). I should add that the relevant provisions of the
                    Admiralty Act 1988 (Act No 34 of 1988) (Cth) (the “Admiralty Act
                    1988”) and Admiralty Act 1973 (Public Act 1973 No 119) (NZ), which were
                    the subject of consideration in those cases, were in all material respects
                    identical to the corresponding provisions of the HCAJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The learned AR appeared to suggest (at
                        [19] of his grounds of decision),
                    however, that under s 3(1) of the HCAJA (which necessarily includes step
                    (1) of s 4(4)), a plaintiff only had to show jurisdictional facts to the
                    standard of a <em>good arguable case</em>. The learned AR
                    drew an analogy with O 11 r 1 of the ROC, where it was
                    well-established that the standard of proof to be discharged by a plaintiff,
                    when proving his version of the facts, was that of a “good arguable
                    case” (<em>Seaconsar Far East Ltd v Bank Markazi Jomhouri
                        Islami Iran</em> [1994] 1 AC 438 (“<em>Seaconsar</em>”); <em>Bradley Lomas Electrolok
                        Ltd and another v Colt Ventilation East Asia Pte Ltd and others</em>
                    [1999] 3 SLR(R) 1156).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     However, I was of the view that the analogy
                    was unsafe, because, as Robert Goff J (later Lord Goff of Chieveley)
                    pointed out in <em>I Congreso del Partido</em> (at 536),
                    the standard of proof required under Ord 11 of the Rules of the Supreme Court
                    (SI 1965/1776) (“RSC”) (the equivalent of O 11 of the ROC)
                    was expressly provided for in RSC, Ord 11, r 4(2) (see also O 11
                    r 2(2) of the ROC), <em>ie</em>, it had to be
                    “made <em>sufficiently to appear</em> to the Court
                    that the case is a proper one for service out of [jurisdiction] under this
                    Order” [emphasis added]. Indeed, that was the very basis on which the
                    House of Lords in <em>Vitkovice Horni a Hutni Tezirstvo v
                        Korner</em> [1951] 1 AC 869 (“<em>Vitkovice</em>”) decided that a plaintiff was not required to
                    satisfy the court on the normal civil standard of proof of jurisdictional facts
                        (<em>ie</em>, on a balance of probabilities) under RSC,
                    Ord 11, r 1(1) (<em>per</em> Lord Simonds at 879, Lord
                    Radcliffe at 883 and Lord Tucker at 890), a decision which was confirmed in
                        <em>Seaconsar</em> (where the House of Lords finally
                    settled on the phrase “good arguable case” as expressive of the
                    requisite standard) by none other than Lord Goff (at 453).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Step (1) of s 4(4) of the HCAJA contained
                    no language similar to that of O 11 r 2(2), and in the absence of such
                    language, there seemed to me no good reason not to hold a plaintiff to the
                    normal civil standard of proof as far as proving jurisdictional facts was
                    concerned. Incidentally, in <em>Empire Shipping Co Inc v Owners
                        of the Ship “Shin Kobe Maru”</em> [1991] 104 ALR 489,
                    Gummow J, like the learned AR in this case, drew an analogy with the cases on
                    service out of jurisdiction (such as <em>Vitkovice</em>) in
                    deciding (at 493–494), on a defendant’s challenge to the
                    court’s jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> under
                    s 4(2) of the Admiralty Act 1988 (the Australian equivalent of s 3(1)
                    of the HCAJA), that the plaintiff was only required to show a “strong
                    argument” that the court had jurisdiction, but it was in my view
                    significant that Gummow J’s approach was ultimately not endorsed by the
                    High Court of Australia in <em>Shin Kobe Maru</em>;
                    instead, the High Court affirmed that, for the purposes of s 4(2) of the
                    Admiralty Act 1988 (corresponding to s 3(1) of the HCAJA and therefore step
                    (1) of s 4(4)), jurisdictional facts had to be proved on a balance of
                    probabilities. As a practical matter, it could of course be said (as it was by
                    the learned AR in his grounds of decision) that at such a preliminary stage of
                    the action, in the absence of discovery and cross-examination of witnesses, it
                    would be inappropriate to insist on a standard of proof normally applicable to
                    full trials. However, that was not a principled way of dealing with the point
                    that when the court’s entire jurisdiction to adjudicate the action rested
                    upon a disputed question of (jurisdictional) fact, that question of fact had to
                    be resolved once and for all, using a standard of proof that was consistent with
                    that used for proof of facts in general (in the absence of statutory language
                    stating otherwise). Further, such pragmatic objections have not convinced courts
                    in admiralty cases to abandon the standard of a balance of probabilities where
                    proving <em>jurisdictional facts</em> was concerned
                        (<em>I Congreso del Partido</em> at 535–536;
                        <em>The Aventicum</em> at 186 and 190; and <em>Vostok Shipping</em> at [21]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     However, where the jurisdictional dispute
                    concerned a <em>jurisdictional question of law</em>, it was
                    inapposite to speak of a “balance of probabilities”, since
                    questions of law cannot be “proved” in any meaningful sense.
                    Therefore, where the relevant limb of s 3(1) of the HCAJA (in step (1) of
                    s 4(4)) does not require jurisdictional facts to be established, but only
                    requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that his claim is of a particular legal
                    character, then this is a pure question of law which cannot be proved on a
                    balance of probabilities, but only has to be shown to the standard of a
                    “good arguable case”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     This was what I considered to be the true
                    interpretation of the Court of Appeal’s statements in <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> (at [43]) and <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (CA)</em> (at [52]) that,
                    where the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> was disputed by the defendant, all the plaintiff was required
                    to show was a “good arguable case” that his claim fell within
                    s 3(1) of the HCAJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     In <em>The Jarguh
                        Sawit</em>, pursuant to a memorandum of agreement, the respondent
                    (“NMB”) agreed to sell the vessel <em>Jarguh
                        Sawit</em> to a buyer, OJI. The vessel was to be sold as a
                    Lloyd’s Register Class vessel, and NMB advanced a loan to OJI for 90% of
                    the purchase price, secured by a mortgage over the vessel. NMB failed to deliver
                    the vessel as a Lloyd’s Register Class vessel, and as a result the
                    mortgage could not be registered. After some developments, NMB considered the
                    loan due and payable in full, but by then OJI had transferred ownership of the
                    vessel to the appellant, JH. NMB then commenced an action <em>in
                        rem</em> pursuant to ss 3(1)(<em>c</em>) and
                    4(2) of the HCAJA and arrested the vessel, which JH applied to set aside on the
                    basis that jurisdiction had been wrongly invoked as JH was not liable <em>in personam</em> on NMB’s claim, the mortgage having
                    been agreed between NMB and OJI, not NMB and JH. Essentially, JH’s
                    submission on jurisdiction was that ss 3(1)(<em>c</em>) and 4(2) of the HCAJA had to be interpreted as conferring
                    admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> on the court only
                    when the owner of the ship referred to in those sections was the person who
                    would be liable on the claim in an action <em>in
                        personam</em>. Understandably, this novel argument was rejected by
                    Rubin J (reported at [1995] 2 SLR(R) 913) in a decision upheld by
                    the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 122 of 1995. Subsequently, JH filed a
                    defence and counterclaim utilising the same objections to jurisdiction which had
                    been rejected by Rubin J, and NMB applied to strike out the offending
                    paragraphs, which application was granted by the AR and the High Court (reported
                    at [1997] 1 SLR(R) 213), and which was the subject of the appeal in
                        <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     M Karthigesu JA writing for the Court of
                    Appeal drew a clear distinction between adjudication on questions of
                    jurisdiction and on substantive questions of liability or merits. At [30], the Court of Appeal held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… whether or not a court has jurisdiction is, of necessity, a
                        question logically prior to the substantive dispute of the parties. Unless
                        and until a court is properly seized, it cannot adjudicate on the
                        matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the question of jurisdiction had been settled in the earlier
                    proceedings before Rubin J, the Court of Appeal held that the matter was
                        <em>res judicata</em>, and that JH was not permitted to
                    re-use its failed objections to jurisdiction as part of its substantive defence,
                    for “the question of jurisdiction is a procedural issue, [and] it follows
                    that it is not within the proper province of a hearing on substantive issues,
                        <em>ie</em> at the trial stage” (at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Counsel for JH then advanced an argument to
                    the effect that the question of jurisdiction was to be determined twice: once at
                    the interlocutory stage, where the plaintiff had to prove an arguable case, and
                    again at the merits stage (<em>ie</em>, the trial) where
                    the plaintiff had to prove its case on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     This was rejected by the Court of Appeal, on
                    the ground that counsel had confused the issues of jurisdiction and substantive
                    liability, and it was in this context that the Court of Appeal stated (at
                        [43]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In a hearing of an application to dispute jurisdiction,
                            the plaintiff need only show that he has a good arguable case that his
                            cause of action falls within one of the categories of
                            s 3(1)</em>, in this case, ground (c). [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Strictly speaking, the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> was not called upon to decide
                    the standard of proof applicable in a challenge to the court’s
                    jurisdiction under s 3(1) of the HCAJA; a jurisdictional challenge was not
                    being mounted (unlike in the earlier proceedings before Rubin J) and the passage
                    cited above merely represented the Court of Appeal’s response to
                    counsel’s argument that the question of jurisdiction ought to be litigated
                    twice. In addition, it was not entirely clear from the Court of Appeal’s
                    judgment what authority established the proposition that the standard of proof
                    under s 3(1) was that of a “good arguable case”. However,
                        <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> has long been understood as
                    laying down the requisite standard of proof a plaintiff must satisfy under
                    s 3(1) of the HCAJA (see for instance Toh Kian Sing, SC, <em>Admiralty Law and Practice</em> (LexisNexis,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> ed, 2007) (“<em>Admiralty Law and Practice</em>”) at p 46), even when required
                    to prove jurisdictional facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It seemed to me unlikely, however, that the
                    Court of Appeal intended, in a judgment where the point was not really even in
                    issue, to disrupt the settled approach throughout the Commonwealth (see
                        <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a> above) and in Singapore (see
                        <a href="#p1_99">[99]</a>–<a href="#p1_103">[103]</a> below) in relation to the standard of proof of
                    jurisdictional facts by substituting the standard of “good arguable
                    case” for that of “balance of probabilities”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I considered, therefore, that the Court of
                    Appeal’s statements in <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em>,
                    properly understood, only meant that where a defendant challenged (via O 12
                    r 7 of the ROC) the plaintiff’s invocation of the court’s
                    admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> under one of the
                    limbs of s 3(1) of the HCAJA, the plaintiff was only required to show a
                    “good arguable case” that his claim, properly characterised and
                    categorised, had the <em>legal character</em> required by
                    the relevant limb of s 3(1) (see <em>The Indriani</em>
                    at [15]–[17] where the Court of Appeal appears to have
                    adopted such an approach). In other words, <em>The Jarguh
                        Sawit</em> stood for the proposition that, under step (1) of
                    s 4(4), the plaintiff was required to show a “good arguable
                    case” as to <em>jurisdictional questions of
                    law</em>. This interpretation was supported by the Court of Appeal’s
                    statement (at [41]) that, when deciding
                    whether it had jurisdiction, the question the court had to ask itself was
                    whether there was a “good arguable case <em>based on a
                        ship’s mortgage</em>” [emphasis added]. The Court of
                    Appeal’s statement (at [43]) (see
                        <a href="#p1_92">[92]</a> above) also lent itself to this
                    view, for whether a cause of action “falls within one of the categories
                    of s 3(1)” is a question of characterisation and categorisation, and
                    therefore a question of law. This was also how <em>The Jarguh
                        Sawit</em> has been understood in Dr Damien J Cremean, <em>Admiralty Jurisdiction: Law and Practice in Australia, New Zealand,
                        Singapore and Hong Kong</em> (The Federation Press,
                        3<sup>rd</sup> ed, 2008) at p 126, although, as the learned
                    author noted, the point was not entirely free from doubt, as there was some
                    difficulty reconciling this with the idea that questions of law are not really
                    amenable to proof (see <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> above), and
                    hence standards of proof (<em>Shin Kobe Maru</em> and
                        <em>Baltic Shipping</em>), even that of a “good
                    arguable case” (<em>E F Hutton &amp; Co (London) Ltd v
                        Mofarrij</em> [1989] 1 WLR 488 at 495 (<em>per</em> Kerr LJ, albeit in the context of RSC, Ord
                11)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Therefore, if, on a jurisdictional dispute
                    under O 12 r 7 of the ROC, step (1) of s 4(4) of the HCAJA was in
                    issue, the plaintiff would be required to either prove a jurisdictional fact on
                    a balance of probabilities, or show a good arguable case as to a jurisdictional
                    question of law, depending on what it was the defendant was
                challenging.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     For instance, assuming that the
                    plaintiff’s claim was for non-payment by the defendant in respect of
                    bunkers supplied to the defendant’s vessels, the plaintiff would seek to
                    invoke the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> by relying on s 3(1)(<em>l</em>) of
                    the HCAJA (“any claim in respect of goods or materials supplied to a ship
                    for her operation or maintenance”). The defendant, if he wished to
                    challenge the court’s jurisdiction, could apply under O 12 r 7
                    of the ROC, arguing that step (1) of s 4(4) was not satisfied as the
                    plaintiff’s claim did not fall within s 3(1)(<em>l</em>) of the HCAJA because the bunkers had not been supplied to the
                    vessel as a consumable resource, but had instead been supplied as a tradable
                    commodity, and therefore were not “goods or materials supplied to a ship
                    for her operation or maintenance”. If the fact that the bunkers had been
                    supplied as a tradable commodity was not disputed by the plaintiff, the only
                    jurisdictional question for the court was one of law, <em>viz</em>, whether the plaintiff’s claim (a claim for unpaid
                    bunkers supplied to a ship as a tradable commodity), as pleaded, was within the
                    ambit of s 3(1)(<em>l</em>) of the HCAJA. This was a
                    question of the proper characterisation of the plaintiff’s claim and the
                    true construction of s 3(1)(<em>l</em>), and on the
                    authority of <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em>, to succeed, the
                    plaintiff would only have to show a “good arguable case” that his
                    claim, as pleaded, fell within s 3(1)(<em>l</em>) of
                    the HCAJA (see <em>The Golden Petroleum</em> [1993]
                    3 SLR(R) 209, where it was held that such a claim did not fall within
                        s 3(1)(<em>l</em>) of the HCAJA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     If, on the other hand, the plaintiff disputed
                    the defendant’s factual assertion (that the bunkers had been supplied as a
                    tradable commodity), then the court was obliged to find, on a balance of
                    probabilities, as a precondition to deciding whether the plaintiff’s claim
                    fell within s 3(1)(<em>l</em>) of the HCAJA, whether
                    the bunkers had in fact been supplied as a consumable or as a commodity. This
                    fact was simply a condition precedent to jurisdiction under
                        s 3(1)(<em>l</em>), <em>ie</em>, it was a jurisdictional fact which had to be found at the
                    outset. That fact-finding might be rendered difficult as a result of the
                    preliminary nature or urgency of the action, or the evidence being in affidavit
                    form, did not detract from the task of the court (see <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Steps (2), (4) and (5) of s 4(4): jurisdictional facts to be
                proved on a balance of probabilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Unlike step (1) of s 4(4), steps (2), (4)
                    and (5) of s 4(4) were only concerned with jurisdictional facts (and not
                    jurisdictional questions of law): the plaintiff had to show that the relevant
                    person <em>was</em> the owner, charterer, beneficial owner
                        <em>etc</em> in order for an action <em>in rem</em> to be brought in the High Court. It has been repeatedly
                    held that, on a jurisdictional dispute under O 12 r 7 of the ROC, such
                    jurisdictional facts must be proved by the plaintiff on a balance of
                    probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In <em>The
                        Alexandrea</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 812, the defendant
                    challenged the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> on the ground that the plaintiff’s claim did not arise
                    “in connection with a ship”, <em>ie</em>,
                    that the plaintiff did not satisfy step (2) of s 4(4) of the HCAJA. I
                    stated (at [18]) that the arresting
                    party (<em>ie</em>, the plaintiff) had to show on a balance
                    of probabilities that the action was within the jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> of the court by proving that the “ship”
                    referred to in step (2) of s 4(4) was the same ship that received the
                    bunkers in a claim falling within s 3(1)(<em>l</em>)
                    of the HCAJA (<em>ie</em>, that step (2) of s 4(4) was
                    satisfied).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In <em>The Catur
                        Samudra</em>, one of the grounds on which the defendant challenged the
                    plaintiff’s invocation of the court’s admiralty jurisdiction
                        <em>in rem</em> was that the defendant was not in
                    possession or in control of the vessel (against which the plaintiff was
                    proceeding <em>in rem</em>) at the time the cause of action
                    arose, <em>ie</em>, that the plaintiff did not satisfy step
                    (4) of s 4(4) of the HCAJA. In dealing with this argument, Steven Chong JC
                    held (at [22] and [23]) that the plaintiff had to satisfy the
                    burden of proving the jurisdictional requirements of s 4(4) (<em>ie</em>, step (4) of s 4(4)) on a “balance of
                    probabilities”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Again, in <em>The Andres
                        Bonifacio</em>, the issue confronting the court, on the
                    defendant’s action to set aside the plaintiff’s writ <em>in rem</em>, was whether the defendant (POCI) was the
                    beneficial owner of the vessel <em>Andres Bonifacio</em> on
                    the date the actions were brought, as the defendant contended, or whether its
                    parent company (PNOC) was the beneficial owner of the vessel at that time, as
                    the plaintiff contended. In other words, the question was whether the plaintiff
                    had satisfied <em>step (5)(a)</em> of s 4(4) of the
                    HCAJA. The headnote to the case misleadingly states that “[t]he basis of
                    POCI’s applications [to set aside the writ] was that it was not liable
                        <em>in personam</em> to the plaintiff when the cause of
                    action arose for the purposes of s 4(4) of the [HCAJA]”, suggesting
                    that the defendant was arguing that the plaintiff had not satisfied <em>step (3)</em> of the HCAJA. That is plainly incorrect, for M
                    Karthigesu J clearly stated (at [13]) that the issue was whether, on a “full
                    investigation of all the facts”, it had been shown that, when the action
                    was brought, the vessel was beneficially owned by POCI. Karthigesu J
                    concluded (at [47]) that on “the
                    balance of probabilities”, POCI was indeed the beneficial owner of the
                        <em>Andres Bonifacio</em> when the action was brought.
                        <em>The Andres Bonifacio</em>, therefore, was clear
                    authority for the proposition that a plaintiff had to prove step (5)(a) of
                    s 4(4) of the HCAJA on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Similarly, in <em>In Re Dong
                        My Ong</em> [1999] SGHC 248, the plaintiffs invoked the
                    court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> and
                    arrested the <em>Sangwon</em>, which was the alleged sister
                    ship of the wrongdoing vessel, the <em>Dong Myong</em>. The
                    defendants applied to set aside the plaintiffs’ writ <em>in
                        rem</em>, arguing that admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> had been wrongly invoked, because, contrary to the
                    plaintiffs’ case, the <em>Sangwon</em> and the
                        <em>Dong Myong</em> were not in the common beneficial
                    ownership of the State of North Korea. The issue before the court, therefore,
                    was whether the plaintiffs had satisfied <em>step
                        (5)(b)</em> of s 4(4) of the HCAJA. In the course of holding that
                    they had, Tay Yong Kwang JC stated (at [7]) that “[i]t was <em>not
                        sufficient</em> for the Plaintiffs to show that they had a <em>good arguable case</em> that both vessels were beneficially
                    owned by the State at the time this action was brought” [emphasis added].
                    The clear implication, therefore, was that step (5)(b) of s 4(4) had to be
                    proved on a balance of probabilities. Although Tay JC’s decision was
                    reversed on appeal (see <em>The Sangwon</em> [1999]
                    3 SLR(R) 919), this was because the Court of Appeal disagreed on the
                    facts, and not, as far as I could tell, because it took a different view of the
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    It was important to understand these cases
                    in their proper context: they decided only that <em>steps (2),
                        (4) and (5)</em> of s 4(4) of the HCAJA had to be established on
                    a balance of probabilities, and <em>not</em> that <em>every single step</em> of s 4(4) had to be so
                    established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The approach adopted by these cases was
                    first articulated by Goff J in <em>I Congreso del
                        Partido</em>, where the plaintiff attempted to argue that, for the
                    purposes of satisfying the English forerunner of s 4(4)(<em>b</em>)(ii) of the HCAJA (<em>ie</em>, step
                    (5)(b) of s 4(4)) in s 3(4) of the Administration of Justice Act 1956
                    (4 &amp; 5 Eliz 2, c 46) (UK) (the “AJA 1956”), it was only
                    incumbent on it to show a “reasonably arguable case” that the
                    defendant was the owner of the vessel <em>I Congreso del
                        Partido</em> at the time the action was brought. For this contention,
                    reliance was placed on <em>The St Elefterio</em>, where
                    Willmer J was traditionally understood to have held that the words
                    “the person who would be liable on the claim in an action <em>in personam</em>” in s 3(4) of the AJA 1956 (the
                    English equivalent of s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA)
                    did not require the plaintiff to prove his action on a balance of probabilities
                    (see <a href="#p1_112">[112]</a>–<a href="#p1_116">[116]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Rejecting this argument, Goff J
                    explained (at 535 and 536) the rationale for requiring the plaintiff to prove
                    the issue of ownership on a balance of probabilities, and drew a clear
                    distinction between two components of s 3(4) of the AJA 1956 (<em>ie</em>, between what is now step (3) of s 4(4) of the
                    HCAJA, which was in issue in <em>The St Elefterio</em>, and
                    step (5)(b) of s 4(4), which was in issue in <em>I Congreso
                        del Partido</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Jurisdiction in Admiralty actions is statutory, and is defined by the
                        Administration of Justice Act 1956. Section 3 of the Act [the English
                        equivalent of s 4 of the HCAJA] lays down the circumstances in which an
                        action in rem may be brought; if the case is not within the section then the
                        court has no jurisdiction in respect of an action in rem, and the writ and
                        all subsequent proceedings should be set aside…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It follows as a matter of principle that any question of jurisdiction,
                        such as the question in the present motions, must be dealt with on the
                        motions and cannot be dealt with as an issue in the actions. Of course, on
                        the hearing of such a motion, evidence will be admitted. Usually that
                        evidence will be in the form of affidavits… On the evidence so
                        admitted… the question of jurisdiction has to be
                        decided…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The cases cited by [counsel for the plaintiff] do not, in my judgment,
                        assist him. In <em>The St. Elefterio</em>…
                        Willmer J. pointed out… that the words used [in s 3(4) of the
                        AJA 1956 (the English equivalent of s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA)] were “the person who would be
                        liable,” not “the person who is liable,” and that they
                        were intended to refer to the person who would be liable on the assumption
                        that the action succeeded. In contrast, the subsection goes on also to
                        require that, for the purposes of an action in rem against a ship, such ship
                            <em>is</em> when the action is brought beneficially
                        owned by that person as respects all the shares therein. This shows clearly,
                        in my judgment, that the question of ownership of the res, if in issue, has
                        to be decided on the motion to set aside the writ in an action in
                        rem.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, because jurisdiction had to be conclusively
                    established as a threshold matter, where the court’s admiralty
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> under s 4(4) of the HCAJA
                    depended on the plaintiff establishing certain factual preconditions (as in
                    steps (4) and (5) but <em>not</em> step (3)), such
                    jurisdictional facts would have to be established on the normal civil standard
                    of proof, <em>ie</em>, on a balance of
                    probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Goff J’s approach in <em>I Congreso del Partido</em>, in my respectful view, accorded
                    entirely with principle insofar as proof of jurisdictional facts was concerned,
                    and, to the best of my knowledge, has been universally followed in all
                    Commonwealth jurisdictions which inherited the UK’s statutory admiralty
                    regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Step (3) of s 4(4): identity of the “relevant
                person” not a jurisdictional matter</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    It has been seen that step (1) of
                    s 4(4) of the HCAJA requires the plaintiff to show a good arguable case on
                    jurisdictional questions of law (<em>The Jarguh Sawit</em>)
                    and to prove jurisdictional facts on a balance of probabilities (<em>Shin Kobe Maru</em>), while steps (2), (4) and (5) are
                    jurisdictional facts which the plaintiff must prove on a balance of
                    probabilities (<em>The Alexandrea</em>; <em>The Catur Samudra</em>; <em>The Andres
                        Bonifacio</em>; <em>In Re Dong My Ong</em> and
                        <em>I Congreso del Partido</em>). What of step (3) of
                    s 4(4), <em>ie</em>, the identification of the
                    “relevant person”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Step (3) of s 4(4) was the main point
                    of contention between the parties (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a>
                    above). Although the defendant had all along maintained that step (3) had not
                    been satisfied by the plaintiff, the defendant’s position on the standard
                    to which step (3) had to be satisfied was not constant. Before the learned AR,
                    Mr Gurbani had initially contended that the plaintiff had to satisfy step
                    (3) of s 4(4) on “a balance of probabilities”, but this
                    argument was decisively rejected by the learned AR, and on appeal,
                    Mr Gurbani did not seek to resuscitate it, being content to agree with
                    Mr Leong’s position that step (3) of s 4(4) merely required the
                    standard of a “good arguable case” (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). However, I was of the opinion that that was not
                    quite accurate either.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    Step (3) was the most troublesome limb of
                    s 4(4) of the HCAJA because, on the one hand, it appeared to concern a
                    jurisdictional matter (located as it is amongst the other jurisdictional
                    provisions of s 4(4)), but on the other, it appeared also to concern a
                    non-jurisdictional matter, <em>viz</em>, the issue of
                    liability, which was normally a matter for trial or an application under
                    O 18 r 19 of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    If step (3) of s 4(4) truly concerned a
                    jurisdictional matter, it then had to be asked whether that took the form of a
                    jurisdictional question of law or a jurisdictional fact (or both). Identifying
                    the “person who would be liable on the claim in an action <em>in personam</em>” could rarely be said to be a pure
                    question of law, for, as my decision under O 18 r 19 of the ROC (at
                        <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>–<a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> above) demonstrates, it would quite plainly involve the
                    determination of factual controversies, <em>eg</em>,
                    whether contracts have been agreed, money has changed hands, services have been
                    rendered <em>etc</em>. Could it then be said that the
                        <em>in personam</em> liability (or more accurately, the
                    likelihood thereof) of the relevant person was a jurisdictional fact which had
                    to be proved by the plaintiff on a balance of probabilities when the defendant
                    challenged the court’s jurisdiction pursuant to O 12 r 7 of the
                    ROC?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   
        <em>The St Elefterio</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    To this question a negative answer was
                    clearly given by Willmer J in <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em>, the <em>locus classicus</em> in
                    this area, where the defendants attempted to set aside the plaintiffs’
                    action <em>in rem</em> (and consequent arrest of the
                    defendants’ vessel <em>St Elefterio</em>) on the
                    ground that the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> had been improperly invoked because, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the defendants had various defences to the
                    plaintiffs’ claim, and therefore could not be liable on the claim in an
                    action <em>in personam</em> for the purposes of s 3(4)
                    of the AJA 1956 (equivalent to s 4(4) of the HCAJA). Willmer J refused
                    to consider the validity of the defendants’ putative defences, holding (at
                    185–186):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…
                        <em>I do not propose to go into the merits [of the
                            defendants’ possible defences] now, or to decide whether the
                            defendants are right or whether the plaintiffs are right</em>. It
                        seems to me, having regard to the view I take of the construction of section
                        3 (4) of the Act, that this is not the moment to decide whether the
                        defendants are right or whether they are wrong in their submissions on the
                        points of law raised. <em>If they are right on all or any of
                            these various points advanced, it may well be that in the end they will
                            show a good defence to the action. But that</em>, in my judgment,
                            <em>furnishes no good reason for setting these
                            proceedings aside in limine</em>, and thereby depriving the
                        plaintiffs of the right to have these issues tried.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It has not been suggested that the proceedings are
                            frivolous or vexatious, so as to call for the exercise of the
                            court’s inherent jurisdiction to halt such proceedings in
                            limine</em>. The defendants’ argument is founded on the
                        proposition that section 3 (4) of the Act of 1956 introduces a new
                        restriction on the right to proceed in rem, and that a plaintiff cannot
                        arrest a ship under that subsection unless he can prove - and prove at the
                        outset - that he has a cause of action sustainable in law. In my judgment
                        that proposition rests upon a misconception of the purpose and meaning of
                        section 3 (4). As it appears to me, <b><em>that subsection, so
                            far from being a restrictive provision, is a subsection introduced for
                            the purpose of enlarging the Admiralty jurisdiction of the
                            court</em></b>. As I view it, <b><em>its purpose is to
                            confer, and to confer for the first time in England, the right to arrest
                            either the ship in respect of which the cause of action is alleged to
                            have arisen or any other ship in the same ownership. That is an entirely
                            new right so far as the law of England is concerned… and the
                            reason for conferring that right now is for the purpose of bringing this
                            country into line with other countries as a result of an international
                            convention</em></b>. In my judgment <b><em>the purpose of
                            the words… “the person who would be liable on the claim in
                            an action in personam,” is to identify the person or persons
                            whose ship or ships may be arrested in relation to this new
                            right… of arresting a sister ship</em></b>. <b><em><u>The words used, it will be observed, are “the person
                            who would be liable” not “the person who is
                            liable,” and it seems to me</u></em></b>, <b><em>bearing in mind the purpose of the Act</em></b>, <b><em><u>that the natural construction of those quite simple words is
                            that they mean the person who would be liable on the assumption that the
                            action succeeds</u></em></b>. This action might or might not succeed if it
                        were brought in personam; that would depend upon the view which the court
                        ultimately took of the various contentions raised…
                        <em>But clearly, if the action did succeed, the person or

                            steamship St. Elefeterio. In such circumstances, in the absence of any
                            suggestion that the action is a frivolous or vexatious action, I am
                            satisfied that the plaintiffs are entitled to bring it and to have it
                            tried, and that, whether or not their claim turns out to be a good one,
                            they are entitled to assert that claim by proceeding in
                        rem</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In other words, for the purposes of step (3)
                    of s 4(4), it was immaterial whether the relevant person had a good defence
                    to the plaintiff’s claim. On Willmer J’s approach, the question for
                    the court was, on the assumption that the plaintiff’s action, as pleaded,
                    succeeded, against whom would it succeed? That person was the “relevant
                    person”. In effect, on Willmer J’s approach, the words “the
                    person who would be liable” created a <em>statutory
                        assumption</em> of the relevant person’s (hypothetical)
                    liability for the purposes of step (3) of s 4(4). To appreciate why this
                    must be so, it is necessary to examine step (3) of s 4(4) in greater
                    detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    As noted by Willmer J in the passage
                    cited in <a href="#p1_112">[112]</a> above, what eventually
                    became step (3) of s 4(4) of the HCAJA was first introduced in s 3(4)
                    of the AJA 1956, as part of the reforms designed to extend the availability of
                    an action <em>in rem</em> to sister ships, thereby
                    extending the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em>. In inserting the idea of “<em>in
                        personam</em> liability”, s 3(4) of the AJA 1956 (and
                    hence step (3) of s 4(4)) clearly reflected the “procedural
                    theory” that underpinned the AJA 1956. Under the procedural theory, the
                    object of commencing an action <em>in rem</em> against the
                    ship was to coerce the defendant shipowner as the person alleged to be liable to
                    appear and defend the action, and meet or refute the liability alleged. Modern
                    day admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>, particularly
                    the new statutory rights of action <em>in rem</em>
                        (<em>ie</em>, s 3(1)(<em>d</em>) to (<em>q</em>) of the HCAJA), was
                    therefore predicated upon the relationship between the action <em>in rem</em> and the person who would incur liability <em>in personam</em> – which liability, however, could only
                    ever be putative until a trial on the merits had been concluded. Hence the
                    deliberate formulation of s 3(4) of the AJA 1956 (and now s 4(4) of
                    the HCAJA), requiring a link between the ship to be proceeded against and the
                    person alleged to be liable. The procedural theory was to be contrasted with the
                    “personification theory”, under which the action <em>in rem</em> was to be regarded as an action against the
                    wrongdoing ship herself, independently of any liability <em>in
                        personam</em> on the part of the owner. I cannot emphasise enough,
                    however, that the reference to the “relevant person” as the
                    “person who would be liable on the claim in an action <em>in personam</em>” in s 3(4) of the AJA 1956 (and now step
                    (3) of s 4(4)) merely reflected the <em>theoretical</em> ascendancy of the procedural theory over the
                    personification theory, and was never intended to interfere with the <em>conceptual</em> division between jurisdiction and merits by
                    introducing a requirement that the court assess the defendant’s liability
                    in order to determine whether or not it possessed jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>. To do so would, as Willmer J recognised,
                    restrict the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em>, when the purpose of the AJA 1956 in general, and s 3(4)
                    in particular, was clearly to expand the availability of the <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction. With that purpose firmly in mind,
                    Willmer J refused to accept that the merits of the plaintiff’s claim
                    had to be considered before the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> could be invoked, and his Lordship did so by
                    contrasting the words “would be” with “is”, and
                    reasoning that the deliberate use of the former meant that the Legislature
                    intended to introduce a statutory assumption regarding the relevant
                    person’s (hypothetical) liability (see <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a> above), but the same result could have been reached as a
                    matter of logic by having regard to the difference between jurisdictional and
                    non-jurisdictional matters: liability, involving as it did the existence or
                    veracity of non-jurisdictional facts alleged by the plaintiff (or the
                    application of the law to those facts), was to be assumed or ignored when the
                    court’s jurisdiction was being challenged under O 12 r 7 of the
                    ROC (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    In addition, the construction adopted by
                    Willmer J was broadly consistent with the 1952 International Convention for
                    the Unification of Certain Rules relating to the Arrest of Sea-Going Ships
                    (Brussels, 10 May 1952) (439 UNTS 193) (the “1952 Arrest
                    Convention”). As Willmer J noted in the passage quoted at <a href="#p1_112">[112]</a> above, s 3(4) of the AJA 1956 was
                    enacted to bring England in line with the 1952 Arrest Convention. As Francesco
                    Berlingieri, <em>Berlingieri on Arrest of Ships</em>
                    (Informa, 4<sup>th</sup> ed, 2006) states at para 52.294:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the context of the [1952] Arrest Convention “claim” is
                        not used in the sense of an established right… It follows
                        that…
                        <b><em>the court should not determine the merits of the claim
                            or establish whether or not the claim exists</em></b><em>…</em> All this is made clear by the use, in the
                        definition of <em>créance maritime</em>, in the French
                        text of the [1952 Arrest] Convention, of the words “<em>allegation d’un droit ou d’une
                        créance</em>”: “<em>allegation d’un
                            droit</em>” means that <b><em>the claimant
                            must assert that he has a claim, but not prove it</em></b>. Further
                        evidence of this may be found in the definition of claimant, in Article
                        1(4). “ ‘Claimant’ means a person who alleges that a
                        maritime claim exists in his favour.” This definition is perfectly in
                        line with the French definition of <em>créance
                            maritime</em>… [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the extra-judicial words of James Allsop J of the Federal
                    Court of Australia, in a paper entitled “Admiralty Jurisdiction –
                    Some Basic Considerations and Some Recent Australian Cases”, presented on
                    18 April 2007 to the University of Newcastle Maritime Interest Group, MLAANZ
                    (NSW &amp; ACT Branches) and University of Canberra (available at
                    &lt;http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/how/admiralty_papersandpublications04.html&gt;),
                    in dealing with the notion of the “relevant person” for the
                    purposes of the Admiralty Act 1988, “[j]urisdiction does not rest upon
                    the assertions being made good, but being made.” As such, whether on the
                    express words of the legislation, or as a matter of the logic and purpose
                    underpinning them, it was not necessary or appropriate at the jurisdictional
                    stage to embark upon an inquiry into the merits of the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Of course, if the strength of the
                    defendant’s defence was plain, to the extent that the plaintiff’s
                    claim was bound to fail and therefore frivolous or vexatious, then, as
                    Willmer J recognised, it was always open to the court to strike out the
                    plaintiff’s action pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the ROC or its
                    inherent jurisdiction, but in such circumstances, the court would be <em>exercising</em> (or perhaps declining to exercise)
                    jurisdiction, rather than being deprived of the <em>existence</em> of jurisdiction (see <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> above). The ever-present possibility of striking out the
                    action means that it is sometimes said that the plaintiff only has to show an
                    “arguable case” in making out the identity of the relevant person.
                    For instance, G P Selvam J in <em>The Opal 3 ex
                        Kuchino</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 231 at [10] stated that “[i]n applying the
                        <em>in personam</em> test, all that is needed is an
                    arguable case: see <em>The Elefterio</em>…”
                    (see also <em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)</em> at [15] and [25]). Although I have, in the past, used such expressions (see
                    my judgment in <em>The Rainbow Spring</em> [2003]
                    2 SLR(R) 117 (“<em>The Rainbow Spring
                        (HC)</em>”) at [8]), I
                    was now of the respectful view that such statements could be somewhat misleading
                    if they were used in the context of an application under O 12 r 7 to
                    argue that where the plaintiff has no arguable case that the defendant would be
                    liable on the claim in an action <em>in personam</em> under
                    step (3) of s 4(4) the defendant would be entitled to set aside the writ
                        <em>in rem</em> for lack of jurisdiction, for that
                    would be inconsistent with Willmer J’s approach of <em>assuming</em> the success of the plaintiff’s action as a matter
                    of statutory interpretation. Applying the “arguable case”
                    formulation to step (3) of s 4(4) in an O 12 r 7 application
                    might erroneously lead to a determination of the issue of liability at the
                    jurisdictional stage when jurisdiction was a logically anterior question (see
                        <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> at <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a> above). To reiterate, to identify the “relevant
                    person”, the court assumes the success of the plaintiff’s action as
                    pleaded and asks who would be liable on it, and this was, in my view, quite
                    different from saying that the plaintiff has to show an “arguable
                    case” when identifying the person who would be liable on the claim in an
                    action <em>in personam</em>. This is why I have been keen
                    to emphasise the difference between O 12 r 7 and O 18 r 19
                    of the ROC in admiralty cases, for the language of “arguable case”
                    was appropriate to the latter and not the former, as Brandon J’s judgment
                    in <em>The Moschanthy</em> demonstrated. After rejecting,
                    on the authority of <em>The St Elefterio</em>, the
                    defendant’s attempt to set aside the writ <em>in
                        rem</em> on the basis that it was not the “relevant
                    person” (see further <a href="#p1_125">[125]</a> below),
                    his Lordship continued (at 42):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I pass to the second main question raised by the motion, whether the
                        action should be stayed on the ground that it is vexatious...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for the defendants argued that there were so many difficulties in
                        the plaintiff’s case, both in fact and law, that it should be regarded
                        as hopeless, or nearly so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It is certainly open to a defendant to apply to the

                            action has no chance of success and is therefore vexatious; and the
                            Court certainly has power, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction,
                            to grant a stay on that ground</em>. <em>This was

                        <em>The St Elefterio</em>…. The Court, however,
                        should only stay an action on that ground when the hopelessness of the
                        plaintiff’s claim is beyond doubt. <em>If</em> it
                        is not beyond doubt, but, on the contrary, <em>the plaintiff

                liable on the claim in an action <em>in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    As I pointed out in <em>The
                        Eagle Prestige</em> (at [64]),
                    there was no question in <em>The St Elefterio</em> but that
                    the defendant was indeed the relevant person, <em>ie</em>,
                    the defendant there was not suggesting that the plaintiff should have sued
                        <em>someone else</em> because that latter person
                    “would be liable on the claim in an action <em>in
                        personam</em>”. However, there have been cases where the
                    plaintiff’s admiralty action was sought to be set aside by the defendant
                    pursuant to O 12 r 7 of the ROC on the ground that the court’s
                    admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> had been improperly
                    invoked because some other entity, and not the defendant, was the relevant
                    person. As in the present case, the defendant’s argument in such cases was
                    usually that the plaintiff had entered into a contract with another party, to
                    which the defendant was not privy, and consequently, the relevant person
                        (<em>ie</em>, the person who would be liable on the
                    plaintiff’s claim in an action <em>in personam</em>,
                    assuming the action succeeded) was that other party and not the defendant. Put
                    simply, the defendant’s argument was that the plaintiff had sued the wrong
                    person, and on this basis, the writs <em>in rem</em> in

<p class="Judg-1">After referring to <em>The St Elefterio</em> with
                    apparent approval, his Lordship continued (at 258):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the evidence, I am satisfied that there was no contract express or
                        implied between the owners and the repairers. <em>I am
                            satisfied that there was no liability on the owners when the cause of
                            action arose</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As Judith Prakash J noted in <em>The AA
                        V</em> (at [36]), these
                    passages in <em>The St Merriel</em> were followed in
                    Singapore by the Court of Appeal in <em>The Thorlina</em>
                    (at [5]) (without comment as to their
                    being <em>obiter dicta</em>). In <em>The AA
                        V</em> (at [37]),
                    Prakash J held that <em>The Thorlina</em> stood for
                    the proposition that, where there was “clear evidence” before the
                    court that the defendant sued was not liable <em>in
                        personam</em> because it was not a party to the contract sued on, the
                    admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> of the court could
                    not be invoked under s 4(4) of the HCAJA (see also Chong’s article at
                    p 278). In reaching this conclusion Prakash J also referred to and
                    apparently endorsed (at [38]) <em>Lok Maheshwari</em>, although I am constrained to point out
                    that the bases for the two decisions were quite different (a point I revisit at
                        <a href="#p1_134">[134]</a>–<a href="#p1_135">[135]</a> below): <em>The AA V</em> being
                    decided under O 12 r 7 of the ROC, and <em>Lok
                        Maheshwari</em> being decided under the court’s inherent
                    jurisdiction (approximating to O 18 r 19 of the ROC).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Nonetheless, Prakash J’s
                    interpretation of <em>The Thorlina</em> in <em>The AA V</em> was given the imprimatur of the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)</em>, where the Court of
                    Appeal (upholding my decision at first instance in <em>The
                        Rainbow Spring (HC)</em>) held (at [21]) that, on the facts, it was “clear” that the
                    defendant had not been a party to the charterparty on which the plaintiff was
                    suing (because it had been entered into between the plaintiff and some other
                    person), and that therefore the defendant was not the “relevant
                    person”, causing the plaintiff’s writ to be set aside for lack of
                    jurisdiction under s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    HCAJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    It appeared, therefore, that <em>The St Merriel</em>, <em>The
                        Thorlina</em>, <em>The AA V</em> and <em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)</em>, in contrast to the approach
                    adopted by Willmer J in <em>The St Elefterio</em>,
                    treated the identification of the “relevant person” as a
                    jurisdictional fact, and were prepared to find, on the defendant’s
                    application under O 12 r 7 of the ROC, that the defendant was not the
                    relevant person if there was “clear evidence” that the defendant
                    was not a party to the contract being sued upon by the plaintiff, and hence
                    “would not be liable on the claim in an action <em>in
                        personam</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Although I did not have the occasion to
                    comment upon this in <em>The Rainbow Spring (HC)</em>, this
                    line of cases could be said to give rise to some difficulty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    First, in <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em>, the actual <em>in personam</em>
                    liability of the defendant was presumed for the purpose of deciding whether it
                    was the relevant person, while the above cases declined to do so. The only
                    difference was that, in the line of cases above, the defendant’s <em>in personam</em> liability was being denied on the basis that
                    it was the wrong party to be sued, rather than on the basis of a substantive
                    defence. However, it could be said with some force (as it was by the learned AR
                    at [37] of his grounds of decision, and
                    in <em>Iran Amanat</em> at 139 (see <a href="#p1_131">[131]</a> below)), that, as a matter of principle, a
                    defendant’s assertion that he was not the right party to be sued was just
                    as much a defence as any other substantive defence on the merits, <em>eg</em>, that the plaintiff’s claim was time-barred,
                    that an exclusion clause operated in the defendant’s favour <em>etc</em>. This was particularly so where the
                    defendant’s defence on the merits took the form of doctrines, such as
                    common mistake or illegality, which had the effect of voiding a contract
                        <em>ab initio</em>: such a defence, if well-founded,
                    would mean a complete lack of a contractual relationship between plaintiff and
                    defendant – the very same effect achieved by the defendant’s
                    assertion that he was the wrong party sued because he was not a party to the
                    contract with the plaintiff. Yet in the one case the defendant’s <em>in personam</em> liability would be presumed in deciding if
                    he was the “relevant person” (see, in relation to a defence of
                    illegality, <em>Sin Hua Enterprise Co Ltd v The Owners of the
                        Motor Ship “Harima”</em> [1987] HKLR 770 at 776), while
                    in the other it would not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    A related problem was the standard of proof
                    required to convince the court that some other party, and not the defendant, was
                    the “relevant person”, with the consequence that s 4(4) of
                    the HCAJA was not satisfied and admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> improperly invoked. In <em>The AA V</em>
                    (at [32]), Prakash J referred to
                    Willmer J’s construction of the words “the person who would be
                    liable on the claim in an action <em>in
                    personam</em>” in <em>The St Elefterio</em> as
                    the “would be” test, and contrasted this with the
                    “is” test, which Prakash J considered to have been applied in
                        <em>The St Merriel</em> (see the passages quoted in
                        <a href="#p1_118">[118]</a> above) and <em>The
                        Thorlina</em> (I should add that it was also applied in <em>The Interippu</em>). Subsequent Court of Appeal cases have
                    not shed much light on the matter: although the Court of Appeal in <em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)</em> (at [13] and [25]) appeared
                    to apply the “would be” test, the actual decision at [22] and [28] could arguably have been based on the “is”
                    test. The difference between the two, it has been said (see <em>Admiralty Law and Practice</em> at p 109), in terms of the standard
                    of proof, was that the “is” test connoted a finding of the
                    relevant person’s personal liability on a balance of probabilities,
                    whereas the “would” test merely required the plaintiff to show an
                    arguable case thereof (although, as I said at <a href="#p1_116">[116]</a> above, in my view, this particular formulation was apt to
                    mislead). The “is” test was problematic because the court would,
                    at the jurisdictional stage, essentially be giving judgment for the plaintiff,
                    thereby rendering a trial on the merits completely unnecessary (see
                    Chong’s article at pp 275–276). In addition, assuming that the
                    “is” test applied, a disparity would be created between an
                    application under O 12 r 7 and O 18 r 19 of the ROC. In the
                    face of a defendant’s application pursuant to O 12 r 7 to set
                    aside the writ <em>in rem</em> for lack of jurisdiction
                    under s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA, the plaintiff
                    would have to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the defendant
                    “was” liable on the claim in an action <em>in
                        personam</em>. It would not be enough for the plaintiff merely to show
                    an arguable case in relation to the defendant’s personal liability.
                    However, to avoid having the action struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19,
                    it would be enough for the plaintiff to oppose the defendant’s application
                    by showing an arguable case as to that liability (see <em>The
                        Eagle Prestige</em> at [57]),
                    even if the facts on which the plaintiff was relying were exactly the same as
                    those which failed under O 12 r 7. It seemed distinctly odd that the
                    law required more of a plaintiff on a challenge to jurisdiction (<em>ie</em>, a balance of probabilities) than on an application
                    to strike out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Apart from these problems of principle, the
                    line of cases represented by <em>The Thorlina, The
                        Interippu</em>, <em>The AA V</em> and <em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)</em> also appeared to be at variance
                    with other Commonwealth and local authorities dealing with this question
                        (<em>viz</em>, the approach to be adopted in cases
                    where the defendant’s defence was that someone else was the
                    “relevant person”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    In <em>The
                        Moschanthy</em>, one of the arguments by the defendant was that it was
                    not a party to the contract on which the plaintiff was suing, <em>ie</em>, that some other entity was the “relevant
                    person” under s 3(4) of the AJA 1956 (the English equivalent of
                    s 4(4) of the HCAJA). Brandon J did not find it necessary to express
                    any view on the defendant’s <em>in personam</em>
                    liability, but followed <em>The St Elefterio</em> and held
                    (at 42) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That question [whether the Court had jurisdiction to entertain the
                        plaintiff’s claim <em>in rem</em>] must, in my
                        view, be answered by reference to the nature of the plaintiff’s claim
                        as put forward, without reference to the further point whether it is likely
                        to succeed or not. That further point may be relevant… to the second
                        main question raised by the motion, namely, whether the action should be
                        stayed on the ground that it is vexatious. It does not, however, go to
                        jurisdiction as such. In this matter I respectfully follow the approach
                        adopted by Mr Justice Willmer in <em>The St
                            Elefterio</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    The same sort of argument (<em>ie</em>, that the plaintiff had contracted with some other
                    entity, and was therefore not in a contractual relationship with the defendant,
                    and as a result some entity other than the defendant was the “relevant
                    person”) was deployed by the defendant in an attempt to set aside the
                    plaintiff’s writ <em>in rem</em> in <em>The Wigwam (HC)</em>, but was rejected by F A Chua J, who
                    endorsed <em>The St Elefterio</em> (at [11] and [12]), and noted (at [13]) that, as in <em>The St
                    Elefterio</em>, the defendant in <em>The Wigwam
                        (HC)</em> had not suggested that the proceedings were frivolous or
                    vexatious so as to call for the exercise of the court’s inherent
                    jurisdiction to strike out the proceedings. On appeal (<em>The
                        Wigwam; The Owners of the ship or vessel “Wigwam” v Inter
                        Maritime shipping (Pte) Ltd</em> [1984] SGCA 24 (“<em>The Wigwam (CA)</em>”), the Court of Appeal (at
                        [7]) agreed with Chua J and
                    expressly approved of Willmer J’s approach in <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Similarly, in <em>Lim Bok Lai
                        v Selco (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [1987] SLR(R) 466
                        (“<em>Lim Bok Lai</em>”), the plaintiff,
                    like the plaintiff in the present case, was a bunker supplier suing to recover
                    amounts outstanding in respect of bunkers it had supplied. As in the present
                    case, admiralty writs <em>in rem</em> had been issued but
                    no vessels had been arrested. The defendants attempted to argue (at [14]) that they were not the persons liable
                        <em>in personam</em> to the plaintiff, as the vessels
                    which had been supplied bunkers had been bareboat chartered to some other party
                        (<em>ie</em>, that that party, and not the defendant,
                    was the “relevant person”). However, this was rejected by Lai Kew
                    Chai J (at [15]), who endorsed
                        <em>The St Elefterio</em> and held that “at this
                    threshold stage the defendants are not entitled to shut [the plaintiff] out of
                    his claims against the defendants”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    The Court of Appeal’s decision in
                        <em>“Avro International” (Owners) v Arabian
                        Marine Bunkers Sales Co Ltd and another</em>
                    [1987] SLR(R) 610 (“<em>Avro
                        International</em>”) also provided some assistance, albeit only
                    in terms of <em>obiter dicta</em> as the Court of Appeal
                    was concerned with a different question, <em>viz</em>,
                    whether a defendant could apply to set aside the action for want of jurisdiction
                    after an unconditional appearance had been entered. Nonetheless, the fact
                    pattern was familiar: the respondents, as plaintiffs, had instituted actions
                        <em>in rem</em> for unpaid bunkers against the
                    appellant ship-owners (as defendants), who, five months after entering an
                    unconditional appearance, eventually sought to “strike out”
                        (<em>ie</em>, set aside (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>–<a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above)) the
                    actions on the ground that another party, <em>viz</em>, the
                    bareboat charterer at the time the bunkers had been supplied, was the party
                    liable on the claim in an action <em>in personam</em> under
                    s 4(4) of the HCAJA. In the course of deciding that the appellants had, by
                    entering an unconditional appearance, waived any objections to jurisdiction, the
                    Court of Appeal stated (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Learned counsel for the appellants in these appeals submitted that…

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Again, in <em>The Yuta
                        Bondarovskaya</em> [1998] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 357, as in the present
                    case, the plaintiffs were bunker suppliers claiming for money due under a
                    contract for the supply of bunkers to the vessel <em>Yuta
                        Bondarovskaya</em>. At the time the bunkers were supplied, the vessel
                    had been demise chartered to the defendants, who had in turn time chartered it
                    to another party (“EMEL”). The plaintiffs commenced an action
                        <em>in rem</em> against the defendants, on the basis
                    that the defendants were liable to pay for the bunkers bought by EMEL, as EMEL
                    had allegedly contracted as the defendants’ agent. The defendants applied
                    to set aside the plaintiffs’ writ <em>in rem</em> on
                    the basis that the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> had been wrongly invoked, as they (the defendants) were not
                    in an agency relationship with EMEL, and therefore not contractually liable to
                    the plaintiffs. Consequently, the defendants argued that they were not
                    “the person who would be liable on the claim in an action <em>in personam</em>”, <em>ie</em>,
                    they were the wrong person to sue. Clarke J expressed full agreement with
                    the judgments of Willmer J in <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em> and Brandon J in <em>The
                        Moschanthy</em>, and said (at 361):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Counsel for the defendants] suggests that in <em>The St.
                            Elefterio</em> and <em>The Moschanthy</em>
                        the Courts were considering defences on the merits and not defences which
                        went to the jurisdiction. However, <em>I am unable to accept
                            that submission. It appears to me that in both cases the Court was
                            considering the very question which I have to consider, namely, what is
                            the correct approach to the identity of “the person who would be
                            liable in personam” within the meaning of the statute?</em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Likewise, in <em>Iran
                        Amanat</em>, the plaintiff was a company in the business of supplying
                    bunkers, and it commenced a sister ship action <em>in
                        rem</em> against the defendant’s vessel <em>Iran
                        Amanat</em>, in respect of bunkers supplied to the defendant’s
                    vessels <em>Iran Chamran</em> and <em>Iran
                        Adl</em>, for which the plaintiff was evidently not fully paid. On the
                    defendant’s application to set aside the writ for lack of jurisdiction,
                    Tamberlin J at first instance found that, at the time of the supply of the
                    bunkers, the <em>Iran Chamran</em> and <em>Iran Adl</em> were on time charter, and that the terms of the charter
                    obliged the charterer to pay for all fuel, and that the defendant conferred no
                    authority on the charterer to contract with the plaintiff on its behalf
                        (<em>ie</em>, as with <em>The Yuta
                        Bondarovskaya</em> and the present case, the defendant’s
                    argument appeared to be that it was not the “relevant person”
                    because some other party (the charterer in those cases and MAL in the present
                    case) was). Consequently, Tamberlin J held that the defendant was not the
                    “relevant person” for the purposes of ss 3 and 19 of the
                    Admiralty Act 1988 (the Australian equivalent of s 4(4) of the HCAJA), and
                    set aside the writ. The Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia concluded
                    that Tamberlin J had erred in his approach to the question of jurisdiction,
                    because he treated the definition of “relevant person” (“a
                    person who would be liable on the claim in a proceeding commenced as an action
                    in personam”) as though the words “would be liable” meant
                    “is liable”, thereby deciding the ultimate issue in the case,
                        <em>ie</em>, whether the defendant was liable to pay
                    for the fuel supplied to the two sister ships of the arrested vessel. On appeal
                    to the High Court of Australia, the High Court agreed, holding (at 138):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In some of the reported cases, the court has been dealing with two
                        motions: one, a challenge to jurisdiction; the other, a claim to strike out
                        proceedings on the ground that they were frivolous or vexatious. However,
                            <em>no motion of the second kind being before Tamberlin
                            J, he was concerned only with the question of jurisdiction, a question
                            which, in relation to whether the appellants were relevant persons,
                            turned upon the nature of the claim, not its strength</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The High Court (at 139) also roundly rejected the suggestion that the
                    question of whether someone else (apart from the defendant) was the
                    “relevant person” ought to be treated differently from any other
                    question of the defendant’s <em>in personam</em>
                    liability:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is not apparent why a dispute as to whether the [defendant] were
                        parties to the contracts for the supply of fuel, involving questions of
                        actual or apparent authority, and evidence as to the conduct of those who
                        arranged the supplies, is in a different category from a dispute… as
                        to whether any fuel was in fact supplied, or any other dispute concerning
                        the alleged liability of the [defendant] to pay for the fuel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The common approach in cases such as
                        <em>The Moschanthy</em>, <em>The Wigwam
                        (HC)</em>, <em>The Wigwam (CA)</em>, <em>Lim Bok Lai</em>, <em>Avro
                        International</em>, <em>The Rolita</em>,
                        <em>The Yuta Bondarovskaya</em> and <em>Iran Amanat</em>, therefore, was to take the reasoning of
                    Willmer J in <em>The St Elefterio</em> to its logical
                    conclusion: for the purposes of identifying the “relevant person”
                    in s 4(4) of the HCAJA (or its English and Australian equivalents), it was
                    assumed that the plaintiff’s action would succeed <em>as
                        against the defendant</em>, regardless of the defendant’s
                    possible defences, even if the defence amounted to an assertion that someone
                    else ought to have been sued. Such matters were questions of liability involving
                    non-jurisdictional matters of fact and law to be dealt with at trial, or by the
                    defendant taking out a separate application pursuant to O 18 r 19 of
                    the ROC to strike out the plaintiff’s action. In other words, these cases
                    treated any challenge based on step (3) of s 4(4) (including an allegation
                    that the defendant was not a party to the relevant contract being sued upon by
                    the plaintiff) as not amounting to a challenge to jurisdiction at all, but
                    purely a matter of the defendant’s liability. Indeed, this emerged clearly
                    from <em>The Moschanthy</em>, where Brandon J held
                    that such an argument “does not… go to jurisdiction as
                    such” (see <a href="#p1_125">[125]</a> above), and from
                        <em>The Andres Bonifacio</em>, where, it will be
                    remembered, the issue was as to step (5)(a) of s 4(4), which
                    Karthigesu J held had to be proved on the balance of probabilities (see
                        <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a> above). Counsel had attempted to
                    argue that based on, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>The St Elefterio</em>, <em>Lim Bok
                        Lai</em> and <em>The Wigwam (HC)</em>, step
                    (5)(a) of s 4(4) did not need to be proved on a balance of probabilities,
                    but this submission was swiftly rejected by Karthigesu J (at [15]) in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I do not agree. These cases are not in point. <em>They did
                            not deal with jurisdiction</em>… [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    As a matter of principle, the unqualified
                    approach to step (3) of s 4(4) represented by <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em>, <em>The Moschanthy</em>,
                        <em>The Wigwam (HC)</em>, <em>The Wigwam
                        (CA)</em>, <em>Lim Bok Lai</em>, <em>Avro International</em>, <em>The
                        Rolita</em>, <em>The Yuta Bondarovskaya</em> and
                        <em>Iran Amanat</em> had, in my respectful view, much
                    to commend it. The court would simply assume the truth of the plaintiff’s
                    non-jurisdictional facts, and the success of the plaintiff’s action, as
                    pleaded, and ask who would be liable in an action <em>in
                        personam</em> on such an assumption. If the defendant wanted to
                    challenge that assumption and dispose of the plaintiff’s action summarily,
                    whether because he had an ironclad substantive defence on the merits or because
                    it was overwhelmingly clear on the evidence that some other party was the
                    correct defendant, the proper course of action was for him to take out an
                    application under O 18 r 19 and <em>not</em>
                    O 12 r 7 of the ROC (see <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em> at [60]). In
                    doing so he would be contesting, not the <em>existence</em>
                    of the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>
                    (because, on the construction placed on s 4(4)(<em>b</em>) of the HCAJA by Willmer J in <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em>, the court would indeed have such jurisdiction) but
                    rather, the <em>exercise</em> of that jurisdiction, by
                    placing in issue the sustainability of the plaintiff’s claim. Even if, for
                    some reason, the defendant applied pursuant to O 12 r 7 rather than
                    O 18 r 19 of the ROC, the court was not bound by the defendant’s
                    procedural choice; it could exercise its inherent jurisdiction to strike out the
                    plaintiff’s action, for the court would not allow its process to be abused
                    by permitting the bringing of actions which were plainly lacking in <em>bona fides</em> or merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    I found clear support for this approach in
                    the unreported decision of <em>Lok Maheshwari</em>, where
                    Choo Han Teck JC struck out the plaintiff’s action (pursuant to the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction) because there was no evidence of a contract
                    between the plaintiff and defendant, and the plaintiff’s action (based on
                    such a contract) was therefore misconceived and unsustainable. Choo JC was not
                    hampered by the fact that the defendant’s application was made on the
                    erroneous ground that the court had no jurisdiction over the defendant because
                    the plaintiff’s case did not fall within s 4(4) of the HCAJA;
                    instead, he stated (at [19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel for the Defendants did not submit that the Plaintiffs’ claim
                        was frivolous or vexatious, but that is not fatal to their application to
                        strike out if, on the affidavit evidence before the court, it is plain that
                        the action is unsustainable on the ground that it is frivolous. The court is
                        entitled to strike out the writ.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    In <em>Lok
                        Maheshwari</em>, Choo JC (at [11]) expressed his complete agreement with Chua J’s
                    endorsement, in <em>The Wigwam (HC)</em>, of the approach
                    to step (3) of s 4(4) taken by Willmer J in <em>The St
                        Elefterio</em>, but (at [12])
                    Choo JC did not accept that this construction would necessarily lead to the
                    indiscriminate invocation of admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em>, because such an abuse of process could always be controlled
                    via <em>O </em>18 r 19 of the ROC or the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, the judgment of Willmer J does not invariably open a door
                        which cannot be shut until the matter has been ventilated in full at trial.
                        Although the courts will not deny access to any party who is able to
                        formulate a cause of action against a party identified as the person who
                        would be liable in personam on that cause of action (whether the party suing
                        succeeds or not is a matter for the trial judge), nonetheless, <em>if it is clear that the evidence relied upon by the Plaintiffs
                            is obviously tenuous the courts will strike out the action. In other
                            words, if the action appears to the court to be frivolous then it would
                            not be permitted to proceed</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was perfectly in accordance with my own decision, in this case,
                    to strike out the present action under O 18 r 19 of the
                ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Similarly, in <em>The Yuta
                        Bondarovskaya</em>, after refusing to accept the defendants’
                    challenge to jurisdiction on the basis that it was not the “relevant
                    person”, Clarke J nonetheless recognised that, on the approach taken
                    in <em>The St Elefterio</em> and <em>The
                        Moschanthy</em>, that was not the end of the matter, for it was still
                    possible that the plaintiff’s claim was so utterly hopeless on the merits
                    that it ought to be struck out (at 359):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It appears to me that on Mr. Justice Brandon’s approach [in
                            <em>The Moschanthy</em>], in order to be allowed to
                        proceed the plaintiff’s case must be arguable because otherwise it
                        would be bound to fail, in which event it would be oppressive or vexatious
                        to allow it to proceed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, much like my decision under O 18 r 19 of the ROC in
                    this case, Clarke J concluded (at 365):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I have reached the conclusion that it is <em>not
                            arguable</em> that EMEL had [the defendant’s] authority to
                        make bunker contracts on its behalf, whether implied actual authority,
                        apparent or ostensible authority, or any other kind of authority. <em>The plaintiff’s claim was bound to fail</em> and
                        the vessel should be released from arrest. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As I have already observed (see <a href="#p1_116">[116]</a> above), it is in this context of striking out under
                    O 18 r 19 of the ROC (or the court’s inherent jurisdiction) that
                    the language of an “arguable case” of liability is
                    appropriate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    What then of <em>The St
                        Merriel</em>, <em>The Thorlina</em>, <em>The Interippu</em>, <em>The AA V</em>
                    and <em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)</em>? I was in the rather
                    invidious position of having to choose between the approach adopted by those
                    cases, or that adopted by the Court of Appeal in <em>The Wigwam
                        (CA)</em> and hinted at in <em>Avro
                        International</em>. Notwithstanding the fact that I followed <em>The AA V</em> in <em>The Rainbow Spring
                        (HC)</em> (at [10]) and that I
                    was content to endorse the other cases in <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em> (at [64]), I now
                    considered that the better approach, consistent with both principle and
                    international authority, was that represented by <em>The Wigwam
                        (CA)</em>, and that the plaintiff’s writ could not be set aside
                    under O 12 r 7 of the ROC simply because it had been shown that the
                    defendant was not in a contractual relationship with the plaintiff, and
                    therefore was not the “relevant person”. In preferring the
                    unqualified approach adopted by <em>The St Elefterio</em>
                    and approved of in <em>The Wigwam (CA)</em>, I was mindful
                    of the words of the High Court of Australia in <em>Iran
                        Amanat</em> (at 138):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Australian legislation having been enacted against the background of
                        English legislation [<em>ie</em>, the AJA 1956] and
                        authority [<em>ie</em>, <em>The St
                            Elefterio</em> and <em>The
                        Moschanthy</em>]…, the definition of “relevant
                        person” should be understood as having the same meaning as the courts
                        had given to the corresponding words in the English statute. When the
                        Parliament has enacted legislation, affecting the subject of international
                        shipping, and followed a statutory precedent from overseas which has by then
                        received a settled construction, there is every reason to construe the
                        statutory language in the same way in this country unless such construction
                        is unreasonable or inapplicable to Australian circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Like the Australian Admiralty Act 1988, our HCAJA originated from and
                    was based on the AJA 1956, and indeed was designed to bring Singapore’s
                    admiralty law into line with the AJA 1956 (see <em>The Trade
                        Fair</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 641 at [13]). Given this, there was every reason to
                    regard the construction of step (3) of s 4(4) as settled by <em>The St Elefterio</em> and <em>The
                        Moschanthy</em>, especially when they had been endorsed by the Court
                    of Appeal in <em>The Wigwam (CA)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    I hasten to add, however, that I am not at
                    all suggesting that <em>The St Merriel</em>, <em>The Thorlina</em>, <em>The
                        Interippu</em>, <em>The AA V</em> or <em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)</em> were wrongly decided; on the
                    facts, the refusal to permit the actions in those cases to proceed to trial was
                    correct, but instead of setting aside the writs under O 12 r 7 of the
                    ROC (or, in the case of <em>The St Merriel</em>, its
                    English equivalent), the courts in those cases should have struck out the
                    actions pursuant to their inherent jurisdiction, as was recognised by
                    Brandon J in <em>The Moschanthy</em>, Clarke J in
                        <em>The Yuta Bondarovskaya</em> and Chua J in
                        <em>The Wigwam (HC)</em>, and as was done by Choo JC in
                        <em>Lok Maheshwari</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Conclusion on step (3) of s 4(4)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    To reiterate, any challenge by the defendant
                    to the identity of the “relevant person” (<em>ie</em>, step (3) of s 4(4)) was not a jurisdictional matter
                        (<em>ie</em>, it was not to be dealt with at the
                    jurisdictional stage under O 12 r 7 of the ROC), but was properly a
                    dispute pertaining to the defendant’s liability on the merits of the
                    claim, and was therefore to be dealt with at trial or, if the plaintiff’s
                    case was hopeless, under O 18 r 19 of the ROC (or the court’s
                    inherent jurisdiction), and <em>only</em> in the
                    last-mentioned case would it be appropriate to investigate whether the plaintiff
                    had an “arguable case”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the requirements of s 4(4) of the HCAJA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    In summary, although the cases were in some
                    confusion, a number of principles were eventually discernible:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_a"></a>(a)     When a defendant applied pursuant
                        to O 12 r 7 of the ROC to challenge the plaintiff’s
                        invocation of the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                            rem</em>, the plaintiff had the onus of establishing jurisdiction
                            (<em>The Aventicum</em>, <em>The
                            Andres Bonifacio</em>, <em>The Temasek

                            <em>The Catur Samudra</em>) (see <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_b"></a>(b)     Where the court’s jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> depended on the establishment of a factual
                        precondition or state of affairs, the plaintiff had to establish such
                        jurisdictional facts on a balance of probabilities (<em>Shin
                            Kobe Maru</em>, <em>Baltic Shipping</em>,

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_c"></a>(c)     Where the court’s jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> depended on the proper characterisation of the
                        plaintiff’s claim and/or construction of the words in the relevant
                        statutory provision, the plaintiff only had to show a good arguable case
                        that his claim was of the type or nature required by the relevant statutory
                        provision (<em>The Jarguh Sawit</em>) (see <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_140-p2_d"></a>(d)     At the jurisdictional stage under O 12
                        r 7 of the ROC, the strength of the plaintiff’s claim on the
                        merits, <em>ie</em>, the accuracy or validity of any
                        non-jurisdictional matters of fact or law (such as the defendant’s
                        possible defences to the claim), was not relevant to jurisdiction, but was a
                        matter for trial or an application for striking out under O 18
                        r 19 of the ROC or the court’s inherent jurisdiction, and this
                        was so even where the defendant’s defence was that some other person
                        would be liable on the plaintiff’s claim in an action <em>in personam</em> (<em>The St
                            Elefterio</em>, <em>The Moschanthy</em>,

                    on these matters at some length, as I was of the opinion that they were vital to
                    correctly appreciating the true position when the defendant challenges the
                    court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> under
                    O 12 r 7 of the ROC, and also in order to understand the purport of

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Court of Appeal’s comments in The Vasiliy Golovnin
                (CA)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    In explaining his decision under O 12
                    r 7 of the ROC, the learned AR interpreted certain paragraphs of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> as establishing that,
                        <em>independently</em> of the provisions of the HCAJA,
                    there was a <em>separate</em> requirement of merits that a
                    plaintiff had to satisfy in order to invoke the admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> of the court. On appeal, both parties submitted
                    that the learned AR had erred on this point. The plaintiff contended that those
                    paragraphs of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> were
                    concerned with striking out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC and not
                    jurisdictional disputes, while the defendant submitted that those paragraphs
                    explained a merits requirement that was implicit in (and not independent of) the
                    HCAJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    It follows from all I have said that I did
                    not agree with and hence rejected the defendant’s argument that there was
                    a merits requirement within the HCAJA with which the plaintiff had to comply
                    before he could invoke the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    I also did not agree with the learned
                    AR’s views of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>, and
                    it is necessary to set out in some detail what those were. At [40] and [41] of his grounds of decision, the learned AR stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40    In <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em>, V K Rajah JA on
                            behalf of the Court of Appeal stated the following (at
                        [50]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Satisfying the requirements of s 3(1) of the HCAJA cannot be said
                            to be the end all and be all when assessing the sustainability of an
                            admiralty action. Invoking the admiralty jurisdiction may be in one
                            sense a procedural step but <em>it also plainly attracts
                                substantive considerations</em>. There are two requirements
                            that claimants in every admiralty action must satisfy: <em>first, the</em> in rem <em>jurisdiction must be established, through</em>, inter
                                alia<em>, ss 3 and 4 of the HCAJA. Second, the
                                claim must, if challenged, also meet the requirement of being a good
                                arguable case on the merits</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    The above pronouncement by the Court of Appeal
                            clearly indicates that there is <em>a separate</em>
                            requirement of merits that a claimant in an admiralty action has to
                            satisfy in addition to the requirements under ss 3(1) and 4(4) of
                            the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    It was not quite apparent to me that V K
                    Rajah JA’s comments at [50] of
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>
                    “clearly” indicated that there was a separate requirement of
                    merits outside of the HCAJA. Rather, it seemed to me that, in that passage,
                    Rajah JA was underscoring the importance of O 18 r 19 of the ROC in
                    controlling unmeritorious admiralty actions. First, Rajah JA stated that
                    satisfying s 3(1) of the HCAJA was not exhaustive as to the sustainability
                    of an admiralty action, which was plainly true: simply because a plaintiff could
                    invoke the court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em> under the HCAJA did not mean that the claim would eventually
                    succeed at trial, or that it could not be struck out under O 18 r 19
                    of the ROC. Next, Rajah JA commented that an admiralty plaintiff had to satisfy
                    two requirements: establishing jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>
                    via ss 3 and 4 of the HCAJA, and the claim, if challenged, had to meet the
                    requirement of being a good arguable case on the merits. It was true that the
                    words “if challenged” could mean “if challenged at the
                    jurisdictional stage”, <em>ie</em>, under O 12
                    r 7 of the ROC, and if so this would have been at odds with the received
                    wisdom of <em>The St Elefterio</em>, which established
                    that, at the jurisdictional stage, the plaintiff’s action was assumed to
                    be successful, without regard to its strength. However, as I explained in
                        <em>The Eagle Prestige</em> (at [58]), given that the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> endorsed (at
                        [49]) passages from <em>Admiralty Law and Practice</em> which summarised the legal
                    principles from <em>The St Elefterio</em>, and that the
                    Court of Appeal clearly did not regard itself as departing from <em>The St Elefterio</em> (which has been followed and applied
                    locally without question, including by the Court of Appeal itself in <em>The Wigwam (CA)</em>), it was far more likely that the words
                    “if challenged” in [50] of
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> meant “if
                    challenged at an early stage of the action”, <em>ie</em>, under O 18 r 19 of the ROC, for it was then
                    entirely unexceptionable that the plaintiff would need to have an arguable case
                    to avoid having his action struck out as being plainly and obviously
                    unsustainable, frivolous and vexatious, or an abuse of process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    At [52] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>,
                    Rajah JA elaborated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The standard to be applied in Singapore at this early stage of the matter,
                        if there is a challenge on the merits, is indeed the “good arguable
                        case” yardstick (see also Karthigesu J's observations in <em>The Jarguh Sawit (CA)</em>, at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above). The plaintiff does not have to establish at
                        this stage that he has a cause of action that might probably prevail in the
                        final analysis. Karthigesu J had rightly pointed out in <em>The Jarguh Sawit (CA)</em> that the plaintiff need only
                        show that he has a “good arguable case” that his cause of
                        action falls within one of the categories provided for in s 3(1) of the
                        HCAJA. The party invoking the arrest procedure must be prepared, when
                        challenged, to justify that it was entitled right from the outset to invoke
                        this remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">One possible interpretation of the first sentence was that Rajah JA
                    viewed <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> as authority for the
                    proposition that an admiralty plaintiff was required to show a good arguable
                    case on the merits in order to invoke jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em>. However, in the penultimate sentence of the above passage,
                    it was noted that <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> pointed out
                    that the plaintiff only had to show a “good arguable case” that
                    his cause of action fell within one of the limbs of s 3(1) of the HCAJA. As
                    I have endeavoured to show (see <a href="#p1_89">[89]</a>–<a href="#p1_95">[95]</a> above), the
                    best interpretation of this aspect of <em>The Jarguh
                        Sawit</em> was that, at the jurisdictional stage, a plaintiff had to
                    show a good arguable case that his claim, properly characterised, was of the
                    nature required by the relevant limb of s 3(1), and determination of
                    non-jurisdictional facts or the application of the law to those facts (<em>ie</em>, the merits of the plaintiff’s claim) was to be
                    deferred till the trial or dealt with under O 18 r 19 of the ROC, as
                    jurisdiction was separate from, and prior to, the merits (see <a href="#p1_90">[90]</a> above). Further, that <em>The
                        Jarguh Sawit</em> had nothing to say about the merits of an admiralty
                    plaintiff’s claim appeared to have been accepted at [47] of <em>The Vasiliy
                        Golovnin (CA)</em>, for <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em>
                    received approval for the “trite” proposition that (see also
                        <em>The Indriani</em> at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the issue of whether or not the jurisdictional requirements of
                        s 3(1) of the HCAJA are satisfied is a procedural rather than a
                        substantive one dealing with the merits of the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It would be surprising if, having accepted that, the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> then considered that
                        <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em> had something to say about
                    the merits of an admiralty plaintiff’s claim (for jurisdictional purposes)
                        <em>outside</em> of the HCAJA, as the learned AR
                    appeared to have thought. Therefore, notwithstanding the citation of <em>The Jarguh Sawit</em>, it seemed to me that [52] of <em>The Vasiliy
                        Golovnin (CA)</em> was consistent with the idea that, to avoid the
                    action being struck out as plainly and obviously unsustainable (and therefore
                    frivolous and vexatious) or lacking in <em>bona fides</em>
                    (and therefore an abuse of process) at an early stage under O 18 r 19
                    of the ROC or the court’s inherent jurisdiction, the plaintiff had to be
                    prepared to show that his claim, on the merits, was arguable (see [47] and [57] of <em>The Eagle
                    Prestige</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    Assuming <em>arguendo</em>, however, that the learned AR’s reading of
                        <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> was correct, and
                    there was indeed a freestanding requirement (outside of the provisions of the
                    HCAJA) that an admiralty plaintiff show a “good arguable case” as
                    to the merits of his claim in order to invoke the court’s admiralty
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>, from whence did such a
                    requirement spring?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    The learned AR was particularly persuaded by
                        [51] of <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>, and his reasoning (at [44] and [45] of his grounds of decision) was as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    … This view
                            [that there was an independent jurisdictional requirement for the
                            plaintiff to show a “good arguable case” on the merits] is
                            further supported by Rajah JA’s comment which immediately follows
                            that paragraph [<em>ie</em>, [50] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em>], on specifically an arrest
                            of a vessel (at [51]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The arrest of a vessel is never a trifling matter. Arrest is a very
                            powerful invasive remedy. An arrest of a ship can lead to tremendous
                            inconvenience, financial distress and severe commercial
                            embarrassment… Even the briefest of delays can sometimes cause
                            significant losses. It can also in certain instances prejudice the
                            livelihood of the ship’s crew and the commercial fortunes of the
                            shipowner. Maritime arrests can, when improperly executed, sometimes be
                            as destructive as Anton Piller orders and even as potentially ruinous as
                            Mareva injunctions, the two nuclear weapons of civil litigation. As
                            such, a plaintiff must always remain cautious and rigorously ascertain
                            the material facts before applying for a warrant of arrest. <em>While there is no need to establish a conclusive case at
                                the outset, there is certainly a need to establish</em> a good
                            arguable case, <em>before an arrest warrant can be
                                issued. This determination plainly requires a preliminary assessment
                                of the merits of the claim</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    It therefore appears clear from the Court of
                            Appeal’s pronouncements that some preliminary assessment of the
                            merits of the case is required even at the jurisdictional stage, and
                            that the standard to which such merits are to be established is that of
                            a good arguable case. Rajah JA’s reference to Mareva injunctions
                            and Anton Piller orders is instructive. For both types of orders, an
                            applicant is required to establish a certain degree of merits to his
                            case before he can obtain the relief, even though the proceedings are
                            only at an interlocutory stage. A good arguable case on the merits must
                            be shown in order to obtain a Mareva injunction (see <em>Amixco Asia Pte Ltd v Bank Negara Indonesia 1946</em> [1991]
                            2 SLR(R) 713), whereas an Anton Piller order will only be
                            granted if the applicant satisfies the court of an extremely strong
                                <em>prima facie</em> case on the merits (see
                                <em>Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest
                                Management Ltd (Singapore Branch)</em> [2006]
                            1 SLR(R) 901). The imposition of such stringent conditions to
                            show merits in the claim, at a usually early stage of the proceedings,
                            is justified based on the draconian nature of the remedy. Since the
                            arrest of a vessel is, as the Court of Appeal pointed out in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em>, also a very powerful and
                            invasive remedy, it can be said that there ought likewise to be some
                            test of merits which must be satisfied. In this regard, a parallel can
                            also be drawn where the court is asked to exercise its
                            “long-arm” jurisdiction by permitting service of its
                            process overseas. It is well established that a claimant who wishes to
                            effect service out of jurisdiction requires leave of court under
                            O 11, which would only be granted if the claimant can satisfy the
                            court, <em>on the merits</em>, that there is a
                            serious issue to be tried: <em>Seaconsar Far East Ltd. V
                                Bank Markazi Jomhouri Islami Iran</em> [1994] 1 AC 438;
                                <em>Goodwill Enterprise (Malaysia) v CT Nominees (in
                                liquidation)</em> [1996] 2 SLR 404.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    I was of the view that, with respect, there
                    had been an undue focus by the learned AR on the issue of the arrest of a
                    vessel. It was well-established that admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> could be invoked by simply serving the writ <em>in rem</em> on the vessel, without any arrest warrant being
                    issued or arrest taking place (as in this very case). If <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> truly introduced a new jurisdictional
                    merits test, independent of the provisions of the HCAJA, into Singapore’s
                    admiralty law, it must obviously have done so regardless of whether the exercise
                    of admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> was accompanied
                    by an arrest, for it would make little sense for the test of jurisdiction to
                    differ depending on the exact manner in which the plaintiff chose to invoke
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The essential question remained, however,
                    whether <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> was to be
                    understood as having introduced such a test, and I considered that the answer to
                    that question had to be in the negative for a number of reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    Primarily, as a matter of principle, the
                    analogy between the arrest of a vessel and Mareva injunctions or Anton Piller
                    orders was, with respect to the learned AR, doubly inaccurate. First, as I have
                    explained (see <a href="#p1_148">[148]</a> above), any analogy to
                    be drawn had to be between such ancillary relief and admiralty jurisdiction
                        <em>per se</em>, and not merely the arrest of a vessel.
                    Second, the real question was not whether the invocation of admiralty
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> had consequences comparable to
                    that of Mareva injunctions and Anton Piller orders, but whether the
                    court’s admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> and
                    its jurisdiction to grant such injunctions or orders were governed by the same
                    principles, and it was clear beyond peradventure that they were
                not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    As Goff J stated in <em>I Congreso del Partido</em> (see <a href="#p1_106">[106]</a> above), jurisdiction in admiralty actions was statutory,
                    and therefore defined by the four corners of the HCAJA, which has generally
                        (<em>The St Merriel</em>, <em>The
                        Thorlina</em>, <em>The Interippu</em>, <em>The AA V</em> and <em>The Rainbow Spring
                        (CA)</em> aside) not been interpreted as requiring an examination of
                    the merits of the plaintiff’s claim for the purposes of deciding whether
                    admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>
                exists.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    In contrast, the jurisdiction to grant a
                    Mareva injunction was based on s 45(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature
                    (Consolidation) Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo 5, c 49) (UK) (the
                    “1925 Act”) (<em>Nippon Yusen Kaisha v Karageorgis
                        and another</em> [1975] 1 WLR 1093 at 1095; and <em>Mareva Compania Naviera SA v International Bulkcarriers
                        SA</em> [1975] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 509 at 510 (<em>per</em> Lord Denning MR in both cases)), which provided that
                    “The High Court may grant… an injunction… in all cases in
                    which <em>it appears to the court to be just or
                        convenient</em> to do so” [emphasis added]. An equivalent
                    jurisdiction was to be found in s 4(10) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43,
                    1999 Rev Ed) (<em>Art Trend Ltd v Blue Dolphin (Pte) Ltd and
                        others</em> [1981-1982] SLR(R) 633 at [27]; <em>Swift-Fortune Ltd v
                        Magnifica Marine SA</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 629 at [65]), which was in essentially the same
                    terms. In <em>Rasu Maritima SA v Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak
                        Dan Gas Bumi Negara (Government of the Republic of Indonesia
                        intervening)</em> [1978] 1 QB 644, where the jurisprudential basis of
                    the Mareva injunction was clarified by the English Court of Appeal after hearing
                    full argument, Orr LJ (at 664), in laying down the requirement that an
                    applicant for a Mareva injunction had to show a “good arguable
                    case” on the merits, thought that that was one factor which, in
                    accordance with s 45(1) of the 1925 Act, would make it “just”
                    to grant an injunction. Lord Denning MR (at 661), in addition to relying on the
                    statutory language in s 45(1) of the 1925 Act of “just and
                    convenient”, reasoned by analogy from the test in <em>Vitkovice</em> which, as I have pointed out (at <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a> above), was decided on the basis of the
                    similarly expansive wording of RSC, Ord 11, r 4(2). In other words, the
                    requirement of a “good arguable case” on the merits in cases of
                    Mareva injunctions was grounded firmly in the express words of the empowering
                    legislation. At the risk of stating the obvious, similar words were entirely
                    absent from the provisions of the HCAJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    As for Anton Piller orders, I was of the
                    opinion that any comparison between such orders and an action <em>in rem</em> had to take into account the very different functions
                    served by the former (<em>viz</em>, interim preservation of
                    evidence) and the latter (<em>viz</em>, pre-trial
                    security), and in any event the jurisdiction to grant an Anton Piller order was
                    based on the inherent jurisdiction of the court to do justice between the
                    parties (<em>Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Processes Ltd and
                        others</em> [1976] 2 WLR 162 at 166 (<em>per</em> Lord Denning MR)). The requirement for an applicant for an
                    Anton Piller order to show an extremely strong <em>prima
                        facie</em> case on the merits was inseparably tied up with the desire
                    to do justice to the plaintiff (see for instance the judgment of Ormrod LJ
                    in the same case at 167).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    The Mareva and Anton Piller jurisdictions
                    were therefore firmly in the discretion of the court, which could refuse to
                    grant such relief if justice did not demand it. While I recognised, of course,
                    that the granting of a warrant of arrest was also discretionary (<em>The Rainbow Spring (CA)</em> at [32]), the same, however, was not true of the admiralty
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>, which the plaintiff was
                    entitled to invoke as of right by satisfying the requirements of the HCAJA. In
                    such circumstances, there was neither room nor need to impose a requirement that
                    the plaintiff show a “good arguable case” on the merits by analogy
                    to the court’s jurisdiction to grant ancillary relief.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Similar objection had to be taken to the
                    learned AR’s comparison of the court’s admiralty jurisdiction
                        <em>in rem</em> to O 11 of the ROC, which I have
                    already cautioned against (see <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a> above).
                    Under the express terms of O 11, service out of jurisdiction is permissible
                    only at the court’s discretion (r 1), which will not be exercised in
                    the plaintiff’s favour unless an affidavit had been sworn deposing a
                    belief that the plaintiff has a “good cause of action”
                    (r 2(b)), and where it has been made “sufficiently to appear”
                    to the court that the case is a proper one for service out of jurisdiction
                    (r 2(2)). Given those express legislative requirements, it was hardly
                    surprising that the plaintiff had to show a “serious issue to be
                    tried” before he would be permitted to utilise O 11 (<em>Seaconsar</em> at 451 to 452). None of these considerations,
                    however, applied to the invocation of admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> under the HCAJA. Significantly, O 70 r 3(3)
                    expressly excludes the application of O 11 rr 2–8 to <em>in rem</em> actions. Instead, O 70 r 7(1) requires
                    a writ <em>in rem</em> to be served directly on the
                        <em>res</em>. There was, therefore, simply no parallel
                    to be drawn between the invocation of the admiralty jurisdiction <em>in rem</em> and service out of jurisdiction under O 11
                    of the ROC. I was fortified in this conclusion by <em>The Yuta
                        Bondarovskaya</em>, which, it will be recalled (see <a href="#p1_136">[136]</a> above), was a case where the defendants
                    attempted to set aside the plaintiff’s writ <em>in
                        rem</em> on the basis that they were not “the person who would
                    be liable on the claim in an action <em>in
                    personam</em>”, because some other party, as the contracting party,
                    was liable instead. Counsel for the defendants argued that the same approach
                    should be adopted to this question as that adopted under RSC, Ord 11 by the
                    House of Lords in <em>Seaconsar</em> (<em>ie</em>, by asking whether there was a “good arguable
                    case” of such liability). Clarke J rejected this submission, stating
                    (at 360–361) that “… there [was] no support for such an
                    approach in any of the cases in the 40 years or so since [the AJA
                    1956]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    Quite apart, therefore, from the objections
                    of principle was the fact that introducing a merits test <em>dehors</em> the HCAJA would place Singapore out of step with the
                    Commonwealth countries which have inherited England’s statutory admiralty
                    jurisdiction (<em>eg</em>, the UK, Australia, New Zealand
                    and Hong Kong), none of which has seen fit to superimpose a jurisdictional
                    merits requirement on its equivalent of the HCAJA by analogy with Mareva
                    injunctions and Anton Piller orders. In this respect I was guided by the words
                    of Scott LJ in <em>The Tolten</em> [1946]
                    1 P 135 at 142:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question is, however, one of far-reaching importance and calls for
                        careful consideration of British admiralty law, and if there be doubt about
                        that, then of the general law of the sea amongst Western nations, out of
                        which our maritime law largely grew, and from which it is to the interest of
                        maritime commerce that it should not unnecessarily diverge. <em>Judicial action cannot of course reverse a definite departure
                            from the general law of the sea once definitely taken by our own
                            maritime law and expressed in the judgment of a court which binds: but
                            where there is doubt about some rule or principle of our national law,
                            and one solution of the doubt would conform to the general law and the
                            other would produce divergence, the traditional view of our admiralty
                            judges is in favour of the solution which will promote uniformity. For
                            this there are two good reasons, first, because that course will
                            probably be the true reading of our legal development, and, secondly,
                            because uniformity of sea law throughout the world is so important for
                            the welfare of maritime commerce that to aim at it is a right judicial
                            principle</em> – as many of our admiralty judges have said
                        in the past. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although it was of course true that our admiralty laws were in some
                    respects not the same as those of the rest of the Commonwealth, I have been at
                    pains in these grounds to demonstrate that, insofar as invoking the jurisdiction
                        <em>in rem</em> of the court was concerned, the
                    Commonwealth authorities spoke with one voice, and if, as the learned AR
                    thought, the Court of Appeal had truly intended in <em>The
                        Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> to depart from the established position and
                    introduce a jurisdictional merits test into Singapore’s admiralty law, I
                    considered that it would have done so using language which left no room for
                    doubt as to its intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    Consequently, I did not agree with the
                    learned AR’s views on <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                        (CA)</em>, but remained of the opinion which I expressed in <em>The Eagle Prestige</em> (at [58]), <em>viz</em>, that [50]–[52] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em>
                    were not concerned with invoking admiralty jurisdiction <em>in
                        rem</em>, and were certainly not meant to introduce a new merits
                    requirement before that jurisdiction could exist/be invoked; rather, they
                    expressed the Court of Appeal’s anxiety that the court’s admiralty
                    jurisdiction <em>in rem</em>, and in particular its power
                    of arrest, not be abused. Read in that context they were simply references to
                    striking out of the action under O 18 r 19 of the ROC or the inherent
                    jurisdiction of the court, and/or discharging the warrant of arrest for material
                    non-disclosure, as methods of disposing, at an early stage of the matter,
                    unmeritorious admiralty actions (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a>
                    above). Setting aside the writ and all consequent proceedings for lack of
                    jurisdiction under O 12 r 7 of the ROC were governed solely by
                    compliance with the HCAJA, under which there was no enquiry into the merits of
                    the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    For all the foregoing reasons, I upheld the
                    decision of the learned AR and struck out the plaintiff’s action under
                    O 18 r 19, but did not agree with his decision setting aside the
                    plaintiff’s writ <em>in rem</em> under O 12
                    r 7 of the ROC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    I also ordered that the costs of the appeal
                    were to be awarded to the defendant, to be taxed if not agreed.</p>
