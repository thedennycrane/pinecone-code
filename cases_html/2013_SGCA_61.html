        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court, which is reported at <em>Low Tuck Kwong v Sukamto
                        Sia</em> [2013] 1 SLR 1016 (“the Judgment”). The
                    action was started by the appellant Low Tuck Kwong (“the
                    Appellant”) against the respondent Sukamto Sia (“the
                    Respondent”) following the publication of letters sent in 2008 by the
                    Respondent in Indonesia to various persons and the subsequent republications of
                    those letters in Indonesia and Singapore to other persons and various media. In
                    brief, the contents of these letters alleged that the Appellant and the
                    Respondent had sometime in 1995 or 1996 entered into an agreement whereby for
                    the provision of some money, the Appellant would give to the Respondent half of
                    the shares of the coal mining company he was intending to set up if he was
                    successful in securing this deal. The Respondent therefore claimed ownership
                    over 50% of the shares of the Appellant’s coal mining company and
                    threatened legal action if his demands were not acceded to. These letters were
                    published in the shadow of an impending Initial Public Offering
                    (“IPO”) of the Appellant’s coal mining company. As a result,
                    disclosures were made about the Respondent’s claims to various parties
                    involved in the IPO process and to the investing public, thereby causing
                    republications of the Respondent’s words.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Appellant claimed against the Respondent in
                    defamation and in malicious falsehood. The High Court judge (“the
                    Judge”) dismissed the Appellant’s claims and it is from this
                    decision that the Appellant appeals. A counterclaim brought by the Respondent
                    against the Appellant for breach of contract, proprietary estoppel, constructive
                    trust, breach of fiduciary duty and money had and received was also dismissed by
                    the Judge. No cross-appeal was filed by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant is the president commissioner and
                    controlling shareholder of PT Bayan Resources Tbk
                    (“PT Bayan”), a coal mining company listed on the Indonesian
                    Stock Exchange (“the IDX”). The Respondent is a businessman. The
                    two were close friends until 1997, after which they had an irreconcilable
                    falling out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In 2007, PT Bayan started preparing for its
                    IPO on the IDX. In relation to the IPO, PT Trimegah Securities Indonesia
                    Tbk (“PT Trimegah”) was the domestic lead managing
                    underwriter, Merrill Lynch (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Merrill Lynch
                    Singapore”) (which was assisted by PT Merrill Lynch Indonesia
                    (“Merrill Lynch Indonesia”)) was the sole book runner and the lead
                    international selling agent, and Macquarie Capital (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                    (“Macquarie Singapore”) was the co-lead manager and the
                    international selling agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 1st and 2nd Letters of 10 and 15 July 2008
                respectively</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 10 July 2008, the Respondent’s
                    Indonesian lawyers, M/s Hotman Paris &amp; Partners (“HPP”)
                    sent a letter to the Appellant and PT Bayan (“the 1st
                        Letter).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This letter was in Bahasa

                    translation is in italics and in brackets while the Respondent’s
                    translation is underlined):</p>

                            Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck Kwong in establishing the coal mining

                            Bayan Resources Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    From the start, Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck Kwong
                            tried to convince our client that if our client invests and facilitates
                            in the establishment of the coal mine, Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck
                            Kwong guarantees that the investment would be worth a minimum of
                            USD 500,000,000.00 (five hundred million United States dollars)
                            within 7 to 8 years, especially when the coal mining company is listed
                            on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    Whereas, on the basis of that proposal, our client
                            was persuaded by Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck Kwong to <u>fund and facilitate the investment in</u>
                                [<em>invest and provide facilities for</em>]
                            the coal mining company and Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck Kwong did
                            receive the money from our client to fund and to get the concession
                            rights to the coal mine. Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck Kwong promised
                            that our client would get 50% (fifty percent) of all the shares in the
                            coal mine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Finally, in light of their friendship and seeing
                            Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck Kwong’s grave financial condition at
                            that time, our client <u>funded and provided
                                facilities</u> [<em>invested and provided
                                funds</em>] for Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck Kwong to fund the
                            development of the coal mining company, including to get the concession
                            rights to the coal, which was then established under the name Bayan
                            Resources Ltd. and its company group.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, it turned out that Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck Kwong <b>NEVER GAVE</b> the rights to 50% (fifty percent) of the
                        shares in Bayan Resources Ltd. and its entire company group to our client,

                        pertaining to a plan for Bayan Resources Ltd. to go public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whereas our client has issued a warning to Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck
                        Kwong through a Legal Notice No. 0175/0425.01/MA dated 10 July
                        2008, but as of now there has been no response from Bayan Resources Ltd. and
                        Mr. Dato’ Low Tuck Kwong, and we have only received a letter from

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The eventual IPO</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     According to the Appellant, the immediate
                    result of the 3rd Letter was that BAPEPAM informed PT Bayan’s IPO
                    advisors that they “would have to clear any disputes on the shares before
                    the IPO could proceed”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Appellant and PT Bayan were
                    advised by the IPO advisors to remove his planned vendor shares offer and these
                    were replaced by vendor shares offered by other shareholders. On 24 July
                    2008, PT Bayan accordingly informed BAPEPAM and IDX that the Appellant
                    would withdraw his shares from the IPO vendor shares sale, and that other
                    PT Bayan shareholders would sell more shares to make up the shortfall. On
                    4 August 2008, BAPEPAM issued an Effective Statement which allowed the IPO
                    to proceed. The IPO was launched on 12 August 2008, four days later than
                    originally planned and without the Appellant’s vendor
                shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ respective cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Appellant’s claims in the court
                    below were in the torts of defamation and malicious falsehood. It was the
                    Appellant’s case that the Indonesian Publications, the Indonesian
                    Republications and the Singapore Republications were defamatory. The
                    Appellant’s case as pleaded was that in their natural and ordinary
                    meaning, the words complained of held the following meanings, <em>viz</em>, that the Appellant:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>

                        50% of the shares of that business, has reneged on his part of the

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     is

<p class="Judg-1">The Appellant’s further and
                    alternative claim in malicious falsehood was that the words complained of were
                    false and that they were publish maliciously by the Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It was claimed that as a result of the
                    above:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Appellant’s reputation was
                        damaged and he suffered hurt, distress and embarrassment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Appellant was not able to sell
                        375,000,000 vendor shares in the IPO at the price of 5,800 rupiah per share
                        for 2.175 trillion rupiah; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Appellant lost the opportunity to use and invest
                        2.175 trillion rupiah.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Respondent’s pleaded case was
                    essentially that there was a common understanding with the Appellant, to whom he
                    had in 1995 given S$3m to “invest and facilitate” the
                    Appellant’s establishment of an Indonesian coal mining business, on the
                    basis that if it was established, he would have a 50% share in the business and
                    if not, he would return the amount (“the Common
                        Understanding”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> He thus denied the defamation
                    and the malicious falsehood. It was also on the basis of the truth of this
                    Common Understanding that he advanced his counterclaim for breach of contract,
                    proprietary estoppel, constructive trust, breach of fiduciary duty and money had
                    and received. As noted above, these counterclaims were dismissed by the Judge
                    and no appeal has been filed in respect of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As some of the torts alleged were committed in
                    Indonesia, the action having been brought in Singapore, it was common ground
                    that the double-actionability rule applied. In respect of the claims in
                    defamation for the Indonesian Publications and the Indonesian Republications,
                    and the claim in malicious falsehood, all of which were committed in Indonesia,
                    the Judge held that the double-actionability rule in <em>Boys v
                        Chaplin</em> [1971] AC 356 as applied in Singapore in <em>JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd</em>
                    [2011] 1 SLR 391 at [88] required that the Appellant show that they were
                    actionable under both Singapore and Indonesian law. In respect of the Singapore
                    Republications, the Appellant was only required to show that they were
                    actionable in Singapore (see the Judgement at [16]). This meant that assuming
                    the required actionability is made out, to avoid liability, the Respondent had
                    to show, in respect of the Indonesian Publications and the Indonesian
                    Republications, that he has a defence under either Singapore law or Indonesian
                    law, and, in respect of the Singapore Republications, that he has a defence
                    under Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As is evident, there were many discrete issues
                    which fell to the Judge to decide. These issues straddled both Singapore law and
                    Indonesian law. Where the issues engaged questions of Indonesian law, the Judge
                    heard expert evidence given by Indonesian lawyers who testified on behalf of the
                    respective parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is also relevant to state that the trial of
                    the matter was bifurcated by an Order of Court dated 22 October 2009
                    pursuant to O 33 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”) for damages to be
                    assessed separately from liability. Consequently, the Judge only had to decide
                    issues relating to liability and so did not address issues relating to the
                    assessment of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s findings on the defamation claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Given the nature of the present claim and the
                    many factual and legal sub-issues which arise from it, the Judge’s
                    findings on the defamation claim are numerous. Where necessary, we will
                    elaborate on the Judge’s findings, but for the most part we only set out
                    in a summarised and tabular form the findings of the Judge which are relevant
                    for the purposes of this appeal. The Judge’s findings were:</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Judge held that to an
                        ordinary reasonable person using his general knowledge and common sense, and
                        in the context of an imminent IPO, the defamatory meaning of the Indonesian
                        Publications is that the Appellant and the Respondent had some private
                        arrangement or understanding to account for and deliver 50% of
                        PT Bayan’s shares, which the Appellant had not performed,
                            <em>viz</em>, the first pleaded meaning as advanced
                        by the Appellant (see above at [13(a)]), and that this would tend to lower
                        the Appellant in the estimation of right-thinking members of society
                        generally or impute a lack of integrity.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Judge rejected
                        the first extended meaning, that is, that the Appellant was seeking to
                        mislead the public in relation to his shareholding, <em>viz</em>, the second pleaded meaning as advanced by the Appellant
                        (see above at [13(b)]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> The Judge did not

                        dishonourably and had committed a crime (see above at
                    [13(c)]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_19-p2_c"></a>(c)     Having
                        regard to the principle that “the antidote” must be taken with
                        “the bane” (see <em>Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin
                            Jian Wei and another</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 1004

                        [92]), and having regard to the fact that most of the Indonesian
                        Republications contained denials of and responses to the Respondent’s
                        claim, the Judge held that the Indonesian Republications (save for the
                        republication of the 3rd Letter by Merrill Lynch Singapore to PT Bayan)
                        carries a third level defamatory meaning as defined in <em>Chase v Newsgroup Newspapers Ltd</em> [2003] EMLR 218
                            (“<em>Chase</em>”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In other

                        not performed, as alleged by the Respondent and as denied by the Appellant.
                        As regard the republication of the 3rd Letter by Merrill Lynch Singapore to
                        PT Bayan, the Judge was of the view that because this contained the
                        full text of the 3rd Letter and nothing more, it carried the same defamatory
                        meaning as the 3rd Letter. The Judge was of the view that the Respondent is
                        responsible for the Indonesian Republications as they were the natural and
                        probable result of the Indonesian Publications.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p>

                        Singapore Republications (save for the republication of the 1st Letter by
                        the Appellant to Merrill Lynch Singapore), carried the third defamatory
                        meaning as defined in <em>Chase</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s findings on the malicious falsehood claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Judge also found that the Appellant did
                    not prove falsehood<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> and malice (for the same reasons explained at
                    [19(f)] above)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> required to found the claim in malicious
                    falsehood under Singapore law. Accordingly, the Judge did not consider whether
                    the tort is actionable under Indonesian law. The claim in malicious falsehood
                    was thus dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In Civil Appeal No 173 of 2012, the
                    Appellant appeals against several aspects of the Judge’s dismissal of his
                    claim:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the claim in defamation, the Appellant takes issue
                        with the Judge’s refusal to accept that the words complained of had
                        the first and second extended meanings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, he disputes that the defence of
                        qualified privilege attaches to the Indonesian Publications, Indonesian
                        Republications and Singapore Republications (collectively, “the
                        Publications and Republications”) and appeals against the
                        Judge’s rejection of his assertion that the Publications and
                        Republications were published with actual malice which would defeat the
                        defence. The issue of malice is relevant also to the Appellant’s claim
                        in malicious falsehood.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, the Appellant appeals against the Judge’s
                        finding that he had not proved falsity in respect of the Indonesian
                        Publications and consequently in respect of the Indonesian Republications
                        and Singapore Republications as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, the Appellant makes submissions on the issue of
                        causation of special damage under both the defamation and the malicious
                        falsehood claims. This issue was not addressed by the
                    Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fourth, the
                        Appellant appeals against the Judge’s findings on the available heads
                        of relief under both the defamation and the malicious falsehood claims.
                        Under the defamation claim, the Appellant argues that he is entitled to
                        aggravated damages and an injunction; under the malicious falsehood claim,
                        he argues that he is entitled to an injunction and a
                    declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_f"></a>(f)     Fifth,
                        the Appellant appeals against the Judge’s finding under Indonesian law
                        that in a claim in defamation, he is not entitled to damages for loss of
                        opportunity. Two arguments are advanced for such purpose. One, it is argued
                        that a claim in defamation can be brought in Indonesia under both
                        Arts 1372 and 1365 of the Indonesian Civil Code, and not only the
                        former, which was the finding of the Judge. Under Art 1365, the
                        Appellant argues that he is entitled to damages for loss of opportunity.
                        Two, it is argued that damages available under Art 1365 are also available
                        in a claim under Art 1372.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_g"></a>(g)     Last, the Appellant submits that the tort of malicious
                        falsehood is actionable under Indonesian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It bears mention that in response, the
                    Respondent does not seek to reverse the aspects of the Judge’s findings
                    which are adverse to him. He only makes submissions seeking to uphold the
                    aspects of the Judge’s findings against which the Appellant has
                    appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues in this appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In our view, the main issues in this appeal
                    may be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     What is the natural and ordinary
                        meaning of the words complained of?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     Were the Publications and Republications made on
                        occasions of qualified privilege?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     Are the words complained of false and were they published
                        maliciously?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     What are the reliefs available to the Appellant if his claims are made
                        out?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">What is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained
                of?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The threshold for appellate intervention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The parties took diametrically opposed views
                    as to what the threshold for appellate intervention in respect of findings of a
                    trial judge as to the natural and ordinary meaning of defamatory words should
                    be. Quite unsurprisingly, the Appellant takes a more liberal view on the scope
                    for appellate intervention and suggests that an appellate court is in as good a
                    position as a trial judge in making such a determination. This is because, it is
                    argued, it is simply a matter of reading the words and determining in the light
                    of the well-established principles of interpretation the natural and ordinary
                    meaning an ordinary reasonable person would understand the words to bear (citing
                        <em>Evans on Defamation in Singapore and Malaysia</em>
                    (Keith R Evans gen ed) (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2008)
                        (“<em>Evans on Defamation</em>”) at
                    pp 21–22). In contrast, the Respondent advocates a more restrictive
                    approach. In <em>Skuse v Granada Television Limited</em>
                    [1996] EMLR 278 (“<em>Skuse</em>”) at 287,
                    the English Court of Appeal, while recognising that this was not an exercise
                    based on the assessment of the reliability of witnesses and that the material
                    before the appellate court is the same as that before the trial judge, held that
                    an appellate court nevertheless ought not to disturb the trial judge’s
                    finding unless it was “quite satisfied [that] he was
                    wrong”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In our view, the two contrasting positions put
                    forth are much ado about nothing. A plain reading of <em>Evans of
                        Defamation</em> understates the case, whereas the decision in
                        <em>Skuse</em> does not in fact state the position as
                    being quite so extreme. While in Singapore our judges are the sole deciders of
                    fact and law, this does not mean that the distinction between the two no longer
                    holds true. It is therefore incorrect to assume that an appellate court would be
                    willing to interfere in this respect as readily as it would in respect of
                    questions of law. It remains that a trial judge’s finding on the natural
                    and ordinary meaning of the words complained of is a finding of fact. We
                    acknowledge the difficulties a trial judge faces in making such determinations.
                    Salmon LJ put it quite candidly in <em>Slim and Others v
                        Daily Telegraph Ltd and Others</em> [1968] 2 QB 157
                        (“<em>Slim v Daily Telegraph</em>”) at
                    187:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am very conscious of the difficulty which a judge faces in trying to
                        ascertain the meaning which the ordinary layman would attribute to words
                        which he reads in his newspaper. Much of a judge’s time is spent in
                        construing statutes and legal documents—an apparently similar task to
                        the one which now confronts us, but a task which, in reality, requires a
                        different technique. There have been many differences of judicial opinion
                        even on the question of what words are capable of meaning to the ordinary
                        layman, see, e.g., <em>Lewis v. Daily Telegraph
                            Ltd</em>. The principles are easy to formulate but difficult to
                        apply. They were never better formulated than they were in <em>Capital and Counties Bank v. Henty</em> nor perhaps ever
                        worse applied. It was there held that the words complained of were incapable
                        of meaning to ordinary men that the bank was in financial difficulties, yet
                        they caused a run on the bank whose customers, presumably, were ordinary
                        men. If it is difficult to decide whether words are capable of a defamatory
                        meaning, it is still more difficult to decide what they in fact are likely
                        to mean to the ordinary layman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Due deference should sensibly be accorded to a
                    trial judge’s finding as to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words
                    complained of. Accordingly, it is not sufficient for an appellant merely to show
                    that one meaning is <em>preferable</em> to another. An
                    appellate court will not intervene and disturb a trial judge’s finding in
                    this respect unless it is satisfied that the he was wrong. On the other hand,
                    the requirement plainly does not amount to the same high threshold as in the
                    case where a factual finding is made by a trial judge on an assessment of oral
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first and second extended meanings of the Indonesian
                Publications</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">That the Appellant was seeking to mislead the public</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The Appellant contends that in addition to the
                    Judge’s finding that the Indonesian Publications bear the natural and
                    ordinary meaning that there was a legal dispute between the parties relating to
                    the PT Bayan shares, <em>ie</em>, that they had a
                    private arrangement under which the Appellant was to account for and deliver 50%
                    of the shares and the Appellant had not performed, the Judge ought also to have
                    found that they carried the meaning that the Appellant was seeking to mislead
                    the public in relation to his shareholding in PT Bayan. Reliance is placed
                    by the Appellant on the context in which the Indonesian Publications were made.
                    The Appellant argues that given the context of an imminent IPO, which is an
                    initial public offering to the public in which the Appellant was represented to
                    be the controlling shareholder of PT Bayan, the ordinary reasonable person
                    would understand the Indonesian Publications to mean that the Appellant was
                    seeking to mislead the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     This meaning which the Appellant advances is
                    not plain from the language of the Indonesian Publications themselves. The
                    Appellant’s argument must be that the meaning is derived by way of an
                    inference, <em>ie</em>, on the basis that “the
                    ordinary reasonable reader … can read between the lines and draw
                    inferences” (see <em>Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others v
                        Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal</em> [2012] 1 SLR 506
                        (“<em>Chan Bernard</em>”) at [18(c)]).
                    This meaning was rejected by the Judge, albeit summarily, without detailed
                    reasons. Nevertheless, the Judge perhaps ought not to be faulted in this regard,
                    bearing in mind that the difficulties involved and realities of making such a
                    determination (see <em>Slim v Daily Telegraph</em>, above
                    at [26]) and given that such a determination is ultimately an exercise drawing
                    on the Judge’s experience as to the workings of the mind of a layman. The
                    Appellant’s arguments may, in the light of the fact that the letters were
                    sent to IPO professionals, appear convincing. IPO professionals, in this
                    context, may be more ready to infer the meaning that the Appellant is asserting,
                    and most certainly more readily than the ordinary reasonable person. That
                    however, is not the applicable test. The test here is what the <em>ordinary reasonable person</em> would infer in the given
                    context of an IPO.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     At the hearing before us, counsel for the
                    Appellant, Mr Davinder Singh SC (“Mr Singh”) sought
                    to persuade us specifically that the 3rd Letter (see above at [8]) held the
                    extended defamatory meaning by emphasising two particular aspects of it. First,
                    it was emphasised that in the 3rd Letter, it is stated that the Appellant had
                    not obtained the authorisation of the Respondent to proceed with the IPO.
                    Second, in the 3rd Letter, the Respondent demands that the addressees not
                    proceed with the IPO, and threatens that he would otherwise take legal action
                    against them. On the basis of these specific words, Mr Singh submitted that
                    the Appellant’s first extended meaning as pleaded is “no more and
                    no less” than what is stated in the 3rd Letter. We do not see how
                    Mr Singh’s reliance on these specific words in the 3rd Letter adds
                    anything. Mr Singh’s first point was that it could be inferred from
                    the suggestion that the Appellant had not obtained authorisation from the
                    Respondent that the Appellant had misled the public as to the true shareholding
                    of the company because PT Bayan could only have reached that stage of the
                    IPO thus far if the Appellant had the requisite shareholding to authorise it. We
                    do not think that it is right to say that this is something an ordinary
                    reasonable reader should be taken as capable of inferring. In so far as
                    Mr Singh’s reliance on the threat of legal proceedings against the
                    addressees of the 3rd Letter should they fail to accede to the demand to halt
                    the IPO process reinforces the first point, the same can be said of
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     It is apparent to us that much of the
                    Appellant’s argument on this issue rode, albeit subtly so, on the fact
                    that the Indonesian Publications were sent to and read by persons familiar with
                    the IPO context. If, however, this was his case, the claim would have been more
                    plausible had he pleaded an innuendo instead of relying on the natural and
                    ordinary meaning of the words. In pleading an innuendo, the Appellant would
                    prove certain extrinsic facts and that these extrinsic facts were known to the
                    readers. In the present context, these extrinsic facts may include the legal and
                    regulatory context of an IPO, the documents already published in the IPO process
                    up till the point in time that the Indonesian Publications were made, and also
                    the specialised knowledge of IPO professionals. In our view, the extended
                    meaning that the Appellant seeks to attribute to the Indonesian Publications
                    requires the reader to have, amongst other things, the knowledge of these
                    extrinsic facts. This, however, was not the Appellant’s pleaded
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>Chan Bernard</em>
                    (at [26]), this Court held that the context of the statements in question
                    included previous annual general meetings of the Singapore Swimming Club and the
                    issues discussed therein, as well as previous publications, and thus the
                    ordinary reasonable reader was held to be a “reasonably interested Club
                    member” [original emphasis omitted] with such knowledge. Accordingly, it
                    was held that the statement in question held the defamatory meaning that the
                    plaintiff had deliberately misled club members. This raises the issue in the
                    present case as to where the line between the context of a publication and
                    extrinsic facts supporting an innuendo lies. Sir Brian Neill <em>et al</em>, <em>Duncan and Neill on
                        Defamation</em> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2009) (“<em>Duncan and Neill</em>”) at para 5.20 notes that
                    there are <em>dicta</em> suggesting that regard must be had
                    to the particular class or group of people to whom the words were published. In
                    our view, however, this goes towards the level of care and attention the reader
                    would pay in reading and interpreting the words complained of. The knowledge of
                    such class of persons is quite a separate consideration altogether. In <em>Gordon Berkeley Jones v Clement John Skelton</em> [1963]
                    1 WLR 1362 at 1370–1371, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
                    explained what is meant by the natural and ordinary meaning:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ordinary and natural meaning of words may be either the literal
                        meaning or it may be an implied or inferred or an indirect meaning: any
                        meaning that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond
                        general knowledge but is a meaning which is capable of being detected in the
                        language used can be a part of the ordinary and natural meaning of words.
                        … The ordinary and natural meaning <b><em>may therefore
                            include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader guided
                            not by any special but only by general knowledge</em></b> and not
                        fettered by any strict legal rules of construction would draw from the
                        words. [emphasis added in bold italics and underline]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The test is whether what is being relied on can fairly be treated as
                    part of the ordinary reasonable person’s “general
                    knowledge”. We are of the view that the first extended meaning that the
                    Appellant argues that the Letters bear is not a meaning which can be reached
                    without, <em>inter alia</em>, an appreciation of the legal
                    and regulatory context of an IPO, and this is not something which can be taken
                    as within the “general knowledge” of the ordinary reasonable
                    person even in the IPO context. For these reasons, we reject the
                    Appellant’s arguments for the first extended meaning, that is, that the
                    Appellant was seeking to mislead the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">That the Appellant had committed a crime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As we have noted, the Judge did not, in the
                    Judgment, deal with the Appellant’s second extended meaning, that is, that
                    the Appellant had acted dishonourably and committed a crime. To begin, it was
                    not clear to us what the Appellant meant when he pleaded that the words held the
                    meaning that he had committed a crime. It was unclear from the pleadings whether
                    such crime referred to the alleged failure of the Appellant to honour the
                    alleged promise, or whether it was the act of misleading of the public. When
                    queried, Mr Singh clarified that it was the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     This meaning is likewise not express from the
                    plain words of the Letters. For the same reasons we reject the first extended
                    meaning that the Appellant was seeking to mislead the public, we would also
                    reject this second extended meaning. We do not think that the ordinary reader
                    would infer such a meaning. This meaning requires several logical steps. First,
                    since the crime alleged is premised on the act of misleading the public, this
                    meaning cannot be sustained because, as we have already explained above, we do
                    not accept that the Letters carry the meaning of the Appellant having misled or
                    seeking to mislead the public. Second, there needs to be an understanding of the
                    fact that to so mislead the public is a crime. It is not apparent that an
                    ordinary reasonable reader with only the appropriate general knowledge would
                    come to this meaning. We were specifically referred by Mr Singh to that
                    fact that in all three Letters, it is stated that the Respondent would seek to
                    bring “criminal suit” against the Appellant if his demands were
                    not acceded to. In our view, the mere mention of the words “criminal
                    suit” does not necessarily impute the meaning that a crime had been
                    committed. The use of those words must be examined in the context of the
                    entirety of each letter. The 1st Letter and the 2nd Letter were written as legal
                    demands addressed to PT Bayan and the Appellant. In this context, we do not
                    think that the fact that the words “criminal suit” are used at in
                    the penultimate paragraph of the two letters plainly impute the meaning that a
                    crime had been committed. The “criminal suit” is described as a
                    possible consequence of the Appellant not acceding to the Respondent’s
                    request to deliver up 50% of the shares in PT Bayan. The mere statement
                    that criminal suit will be brought against the Appellant does not mean that a
                    crime <em>had been</em> committed. As regard the repetition
                    of the same in the 3rd Letter, it also does not impute the meaning that the
                    Appellant argues that it does.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Finally, the Appellant relies on a passage in
                    the cross-examination of the Respondent at the trial below. When cross-examined
                    by Mr Singh, the Respondent admitted that when he said he was going to
                    start “criminal suit”, he understood it to mean that a crime had
                    been committed:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     It is trite law in Singapore that the meaning
                    intended by the publisher is irrelevant for the purposes of determining what
                    meaning the words complained of bear. This is because the test is an objective
                    one (see <em>Chan Bernard</em> at [18(b)]). This principle,
                    founded on venerable authority (see <em>E Hulton &amp; Co v
                        Jones</em> [1910] AC 20 at 23, <em>Cassidy v Daily
                        Mirror Newspapers, Limited</em> [1929] 2 KB 331 at 354), makes
                    eminent sense. Just as a defendant is not allowed to defend himself by showing
                    that he did not intend to defame, a plaintiff does not succeed in his claim for
                    defamation merely because the defendant acknowledges an intention to defame. All
                    depends on the words actually used. Diplock LJ in <em>Slim v
                        Daily Telegraph</em> (at 172) explained:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… What is the “natural and ordinary meaning” of words
                        for the purposes of the law of libel? <em>One can start by
                            saying that the meaning intended to be conveyed by the publisher of the
                            words is irrelevant.</em> However evil the imputation upon the
                        plaintiff’s character or conduct he intended to communicate, it does
                        not matter if, in the opinion of the adjudicator upon the meaning of the
                        words, they did not bear any defamatory meaning. However innocent an
                        impression of the plaintiff's character or conduct the publisher of the
                        words intended to communicate, it does not matter if, in the opinion of the
                        adjudicator upon the meaning of words, they did bear a defamatory meaning.
                        … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     We therefore reject the contention that the
                    Letters carried the meaning that the Appellant had committed a
                crime.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The natural and ordinary meaning of the republications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     At this juncture, we note that the reason the
                    Respondent is responsible for the Indonesian and the Singapore Republications
                    (if proven) even though they may not have been made by him personally is because
                    they were the natural and probable consequence of the Indonesian Publications
                    (see <em>Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</em>
                    [1997] 3 SLR(R) 46 at [127]) (see also the Judgment at [39] and [44]). This
                    has not been challenged on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The republication of the 3rd Letter to Merrill Lynch Singapore in
                Singapore</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     We first deal with the finding of the Judge
                    that the Appellant had not proven that there was a republication of the 3rd
                    Letter from Merrill Lynch Indonesia to Merrill Lynch Singapore in Singapore (see
                    the Judgment at [42]). The Judge said that there was no evidence of such
                    republication. The Appellant pointed us to an email sent from Merrill Lynch
                    Indonesia to Merrill Lynch Singapore<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> to substantiate its assertion. The Respondent,
                    on the other hand, does not dispute that the email was sent, but instead argues
                    that such an email should not be taken as a republication in Singapore because
                    this was, he says, a mere “forwarding” of documents from one
                    employee to another within a global organisation, with no distinction between
                    the various Merrill Lynch offices located in different countries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We are unable to accept the Judge’s
                    holding that there was no evidence of such republication. The email cited is
                    clearly such a republication. We therefore reject the Respondent’s
                    argument. In the law of defamation, each communication of a defamatory matter to
                    a publishee is taken as a separate publication, such that if a letter is read by
                    a series of persons in turn, in truth, a series of publications take place (see
                        <em>The Duke of Brunswick and Luneberg v Harmer</em>
                    (1849) 14 QB 185 and <em>Berezovsky v Michaels and
                        Another</em> [2000] 1 WLR 1004 at 1012). <em>Duncan and Neill</em> (at para 8.07) observe that in practice, a
                    plaintiff sues in respect of all the communications as though they constitute a
                    single publication and the number of individual communications is taken as
                    relevant to the issue of damages. The Respondent’s argument that internal
                    communication within a global entity cannot be considered a republication is
                    inconsistent with this analysis. We cannot agree with the Respondent. Even
                    within an organisation, each communication is in truth a publication in
                    itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We therefore find that there was in fact a
                    republication of the 3rd Letter to Merrill Lynch Singapore in Singapore. As
                    this republication contained the full text of the 3rd Letter without more, its
                    meaning must be that of the 3rd Letter itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The natural and ordinary meaning of the Indonesian and the Singapore
                Republications: the third defamatory meaning in Chase?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The Judge held that the Indonesian
                    republication of the 3rd Letter by Merrill Lynch Singapore to PT Bayan and
                    the Singapore republication of the 1st Letter by the Appellant to Merrill Lynch
                    Singapore which comprised of the text of the 3rd Letter and 1st Letter
                    respectively without more, hold the meanings of the 3rd and 1st Letters
                    accordingly (see the Judgment at [38] and [44] respectively). We would say the
                    same of the Singapore republication of the 3rd Letter from Merrill Lynch
                    Indonesia to Merrill Lynch Singapore (see above at [41]). As for the other
                    Indonesian and Singapore Republications (which we will refer to as “the
                    republications in question”), the Judge held that they hold the third
                    defamatory meaning in <em>Chase</em>, <em>viz</em>, that there are grounds for investigating whether the
                    Appellant had an agreement or understanding with the Respondent which had not
                    been performed (see the Judgment at [38] and [44] respectively). In <em>Chase</em>, the English Court of Appeal held, <em>per</em> Brooke LJ (at [45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The sting of a libel may be capable of meaning that a claimant <em>has in fact committed</em> some serious act, such as
                        murder. Alternatively it may be suggested that the words mean that there are
                            <em>reasonable grounds to suspect</em> that he/she
                        has committed such an act. A third possibility is that they may mean that
                            <em>there are grounds for investigating</em>
                        whether he/she has been responsible for such an act. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Appellant argues for a higher level of
                    defamatory meaning in respect of the republications in question than the third
                    defamatory meaning in <em>Chase</em>. It is argued that
                    these republications carried the first defamatory meaning in <em>Chase</em>, that is, that the Appellant had in fact committed what is
                    stated. The Judge’s determination was made after an application of the
                    principle that a publication must be looked at as a whole (see <em>Chan Bernard</em> at [18(e)]) and that in considering the
                    impression conveyed by the alleged libel, any “antidote” must be
                    taken together with “the bane” (see <em>Lim Eng
                        Hock Peter</em> at [92]). The republications in question contain
                    denials of the allegations made by the Respondent. It was for this reason that
                    the Judge held that they only bore the third defamatory meaning in <em>Chase</em>. To this, the Appellant contends that the
                    “antidote” in this case was not sufficient to offset the
                    “bane”. According to the Appellant, this is because, in the
                    ordinary course of things, the ordinary reasonable reader would expect
                    PT Bayan and the Appellant to deny the allegations, and so the
                    “sting” would not be attenuated by the denials.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     We do not disagree with the Appellant that
                    “the mere presence of a denial of a defamatory charge does not
                    necessarily prevent the article being defamatory” (see <em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em> (Patrick Milmo and WVH Rogers
                    eds) (Thomson Reuters (Legal) Limited, 11th Ed, 2008) (“<em>Gatley</em>”) at para 3.31). This approach,
                    however, is not as straightforward as the Appellant seems to say it is.
                    Samuels JA, sitting in the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in <em>Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd</em> [1980]
                    2 NSWLR 418(n) at 419–420 lucidly explained how the antidote must be
                    weighed up against the bane in such an exercise:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… But in a case such as this the material already contains a
                        defamatory imputation; and the inquiry is to whether that effect is overcome
                        by contextual matter of an emollient kind so as to eradicate the hurt and
                        render the whole publication harmless.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It follows that, in a case such as the present, what is involved
                        is essentially the weighing up and comparison of bane and antidote, to
                        repeat Baron Alderson’s evocative formula [in <em>Chambers v Payne</em> (1835) 2 Cr M &amp; R 156 at 159].
                            <b><em>It is a question of degree and competing
                            emphasis.</em></b> …

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Merely pointing out that the denials in the
                    republications in question were made by PT Bayan and the Appellant is not
                    sufficient to lead to the conclusion that these denials, as
                    “antidotes”, are completely ineffective in removing or
                    ameliorating the defamatory sting of a statement. The court still has to embark
                    on the exercise of carefully weighing what exactly was said. The fact that what
                    is claimed as an antidote was said by the Appellant himself or by PT Bayan
                    is <em>a</em> factor going towards is effectiveness, but in
                    the final analysis, it is an evaluation of the actual words of the antidote
                    which is of primary importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     First, we examine the republication of the 1st
                    and 2nd Letters by PT Bayan to BAPEPAM in Indonesia. Attached to these
                    letters was a cover letter by PT Bayan. The relevant part of the letter
                        reads:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">5.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">It is known that BAYAN was established in 2004 and

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">7.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The information / data provided by BAYAN
                            based upon the Registration Statement for Initial Public Offering of

                            market regulations.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">In this cover letter, PT Bayan denies the allegations made by
                    the Respondent. On a close reading, it is apparent that in so denying,
                    PT Bayan asserts that it has no connection with the Respondent and that it
                    shall be legally accountable for the accuracy of the information it has
                    provided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Second, we examine the 1st Letter sent by the
                    Appellant to BAPEPAM. Likewise, a cover letter was attached. It stated the
                        following:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That I, Dato’ Low Tuck Kwong hereby deny the accuracy of the claim
                        stated in the WARNING LETTER [1st Letter] and I would take legal
                        responsibility for my statement in accordance with the prevailing laws and
                        regulations including but not limited to capital market regulations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Not only does the Appellant deny the allegations in the 1st Letter, he
                    further states that he would take legal responsibility for the statements he had
                    made for the IPO thus far.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Third, we examine the republications in the
                    two Indonesian newspapers<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>
                    and the Indonesian Final Prospectus.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> In these republications, there is a
                    paragraph denying the allegations and also stating that PT Bayan did not
                    have any relations with the Respondent. The Indonesian Final Prospectus also
                    further explains the Appellant’s history with the Respondent in respect of
                    their dealings in a Hong Kong company, the result of which was a judgment given
                    against the Respondent causing a worldwide freezing injunction to be ordered
                    against him. Last, the same is so in respect of the Singapore Republications,
                        <em>viz</em>, the statements made in Bayan’s
                    Pricing Supplement and International Final Offering Memorandum.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> In addition, it is stated
                    that PT Bayan and the Appellant intend to “vigorously defend [the
                    Respondent’s] claims against him”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     What is apparent from the above is that the
                    denials in the republications examined (at [46]–[48]) were more than
                    “mere denials”. The text accompanying these republications all
                    purport to provide at least some factual basis or reason for denying the
                    allegations. At the lowest, it is stated that PT Bayan has no relation to
                    the Respondent. In others, they go so far as to provide a historical account of
                    the relationship between the Respondent and the Appellant. The Indonesian Final
                    Prospectus is a case in point, and what is said there could even be read as
                    suggesting that the Respondent was actuated by some ulterior motive in making
                    his allegations, thereby removing some of the sting of the defamatory words. The
                    fact that PT Bayan and the Appellant have stated that they are prepared to
                    bear responsibility for statements that they have made also go some way towards
                    supporting the denials. To the extent that the denials in these republications
                    were not mere bare denials, it can be concluded that (to use the language of
                    Alderson B and Samuels JA (see above at [44])) the
                    “antidote” is not completely ineffective in destroying the
                    “ingredients from which the bane has been brewed”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We are also mindful that the Judge did not
                    hold that the “antidote” in this case was to completely remove the
                    defamatory sting. All the Judge held was that the republications in question
                    carried a lower defamatory meaning, that is, the third and not the first
                    defamatory meaning in <em>Chase</em>. In our judgment, the
                    Appellant has not persuaded us that this finding of the Judge was
                wrong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In this regard, the Appellant’s appeal
                    against the finding of the Judge that the relevant Indonesian and Singapore
                    Republications carried only the third defamatory meaning in <em>Chase</em> is dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Were the Publications and Republications made on occasions of
                qualified privilege?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is the subjective frame of mind of the Respondent relevant to whether
                qualified privilege attaches?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The essence of the first part of the
                    Appellant’s arguments in this respect is that the Respondent’s state
                    of mind is relevant to the question of whether the defence of qualified
                    privilege attaches. The Appellant claims that the Respondent knew that the
                    statements made in the Publications were false and so the defence of qualified
                    privilege does not attach. It is clear in our view that the subjective state of
                    mind of the Respondent would be a factor towards showing malice. The ordinary
                    framework of analysis in this area of the law is to ask first, whether the
                    publications were made on an occasion of qualified privilege, and, second,
                    whether such defence is defeated by the plaintiff being able to show that the
                    defamatory statements were made with express malice. The effect of proving
                    express malice in the context of the defence of qualified privilege was
                    described by Bankes J in <em>Smith v Streatfeild and
                        Others</em> [1913] 3 KB 764 at 769–770 as such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The principle upon which the law of qualified privilege rests is,
                        I think, this: that where words are published which are both false and
                        defamatory the law presumes malice on the part of the person who publishes
                        them. <em>The publication may, however, take place under
                            circumstances which create a qualified privilege. If so, the presumption
                            of malice is rebutted by the privilege, and</em> …
                        <em>the plaintiff has to prove express malice on the part of
                            the person responsible for the publication. The effect of proving
                            express malice is sometimes spoken of as defeating the
                            privilege.</em> … [A]lthough the occasion remains a
                        privileged occasion, the privilege afforded by the occasion ceases to be an
                        effective weapon of defence. … Qualified privilege is a defence only
                        to the extent that it throws on the plaintiff the burden of proving express
                        malice. Directly the plaintiff succeeds in doing this the defence vanishes,
                        and it becomes immaterial that the publication was on a privileged occasion.
                        … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the modern law of libel and slander, the concept of presumed malice
                    no longer holds much sway, and today, it is simpler to just say that a defendant
                    is liable for the publication of a defamatory statement without cause or excuse
                    (see <em>Gatley</em> at para 17.2). Nevertheless, it
                    remains that the issue of malice is one posterior to the issue of qualified
                    privilege attaching. The Appellant’s suggestion that the
                    Respondent’s subjective frame of mind when publishing the 3rd Letter is
                    relevant to whether qualified privilege attaches seems to us to be conflating
                    the two-step analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In support of his suggestion, the Appellant
                    relies on Simon Brown LJ’s comment in <em>Fraser-Armstrong v Hadow</em> [1995] EMLR 140 (“<em>Fraser-Armstrong</em>”) at 143. <em>Fraser-Armstrong</em> was a case involving the question of whether a
                    statement made in a reply to a public attack was covered by the defence of
                    qualified privilege. There, the claimant had made various allegations against
                    his employer company. After he was dismissed, the first and second defendants
                    wrote a letter to a magazine explaining that the claimant was dismissed because
                    he was incompetent, had waged a personal vendetta against the company and had
                    harassed and threatened the staff. The claimant sued the two defendants and the
                    magazine for libel. It was argued that they could not rely on the defence of
                    qualified privilege because their motives for publishing the comments were
                    improper as they knew that his criticism of them was justifiable. Simon
                    Brown LJ said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I cannot accept that anyone enjoys a privilege to protect himself
                        against a justifiable attack upon his own character or conduct. If,
                        therefore, the plaintiff can show that he was defamed by the defendants for
                        the purpose of undermining what they knew to be his perfectly valid
                        criticism of the first and second defendants’ business, that would
                        seem to me to destroy any question of privilege. <em>It would
                            either demonstrate that no such privilege properly arises in the first
                            place or it would defeat the defence by a successful reply of malice, it
                            matters not which</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Simon Brown LJ’s first rationalisation of his holding was
                    that the privilege does not even arise because of the defendants’ state of
                    mind. It is this suggested analysis that the Appellant seeks to persuade us to
                    apply. This suggestion, however, was roundly rejected by this Court in <em>Jeyasegaram David (alias David Gerald Jeyasegaram) v Ban Song Long
                        David</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 712 at [45], which preferred the
                    orthodox analysis that the defence of privilege is defeated by the proving of
                    express malice. This Court was of the view (at [44]) that Simon
                    Brown LJ’s first rationalisation would create a possible chilling
                    effect on self-defence generally, and would encourage future litigants to
                    concentrate solely on the justifiability of the attack instead of considering
                    other equally important aspects of the defence. The first rationalisation of
                    Simon Brown LJ is also doubted by <em>Duncan and
                        Neill</em> at para 16.22, footnote 5, in which it is pointed
                    out that the test of qualified privilege is, in the first instance, an objective
                    test.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It is unclear to us why the Appellant is
                    relying on such an argument. The main point that the Appellant is making is that
                    the Respondent knew that the statements he made were false. This is relevant to
                    the issue of malice, so, in our view, there is no need for him to seek to
                    conflate the two and to cloud the analysis. The second part of the
                    Appellant’s argument is that the Respondent had a countervailing duty to
                    refrain from making the publications and therefore qualified privilege does not
                    attach. This countervailing duty the Appellant seeks to rely on is, he says, a
                    duty under Indonesian and Singapore law not to make false or misleading
                    statements to the capital markets regulators negligently or knowingly. Reference
                    was made to the relevant Singapore legislation and expert evidence was brought
                    to prove such a duty under Indonesian law. Under this analysis, the Appellant
                    again asserts that the Respondent knew that the allegations made in the Letters
                    were false. It may be that the first part of the Appellant’s argument
                    merely segues to this second part of his argument. If that is the case, it is
                    unnecessary because that principle (if valid in Singapore law), is a standalone
                    principle quite separate from the <em>Fraser-Armstrong</em>
                    proposition. We now turn to consider that principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Regard to a countervailing duty on the Respondent to refrain from
                publication</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     If a defendant has a countervailing duty to
                    refrain from publication, does that take him out of the protection of the
                    defence of qualified privilege? The Appellant argues that the Respondent has a
                    duty under both Indonesian and Singapore capital markets law not to make false
                    or misleading statements to the regulators knowingly or negligently. This would
                    of course be dependent on the Appellant showing that the Respondent’s 3rd
                    Letter is false and misleading. He relies on two English Court of Appeal cases
                    for the proposition that a countervailing duty not to publish would take a
                    defendant outside the protection of the defence of qualified
                        privilege.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> These are the cases of
                        <em>Wood v Chief Constable of the West Midlands
                        Police</em> [2005] EMLR 20 (“<em>Wood</em>”) and <em>Clift v Slough Borough Council
                        and another</em> [2011] 1 WLR 1774 (“<em>Clift</em>”). The Respondent’s attempt to distinguish
                    these two cases as involving the application of, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the European Convention on Human Rights (“the
                    ECHR”) which does not apply in Singapore, while broadly correct, does
                    not, with respect, fully address the legal issue at hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In <em>Wood</em>, a
                    police officer wrote letters to people involved in the motor insurance business
                    which were defamatory to the claimant (who was in the business of salvaging
                    motor vehicles) as the letters carried the meaning that the claimant had aided
                    and abetted in the commission of numerous criminal offences including stealing
                    motor vehicles. This was done before the trial for the alleged offences had even
                    been heard. In this regard, the English Court of Appeal, <em>per</em> May LJ (at [63]–[65]), considered that the duty
                    of the police in England not to disclose damaging information other than for the
                    purpose and extent necessary for the performance of their public duties,
                        <em>ie</em>, the principle established in <em>Regina v Chief Constable of the North Wales Police and Others, Ex
                        parte Thorpe and Another</em> [1999] 1 QB 396 (known as
                    “the <em>Thorpe</em> principle”), and that to
                    make such statements was in breach of the applicable police regulations. It was
                    accordingly concluded that the defence of qualified privilege could not attach.
                    In <em>Clift</em>, a local authority, after a less than
                    pleasant telephone conversation with the claimant, entered her onto a
                    “violent persons register” and forwarded it to employees and a
                    number of (both public and private) partner organisations (at [7]). The English
                    Court of Appeal, <em>per</em> Ward LJ, considered that
                    in so doing, the local authority, being a public authority, was in breach of
                    s 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c 42) (UK) (“the HRA”)
                    read with Art 8 of the ECHR and so was actually precluded from making the
                    publications it did. For that reason, it was held that there could be no
                    foundation for a claim to qualified privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In both <em>Wood</em> and
                        <em>Clift</em>, the countervailing duties not to
                    publish were owed by public bodies. The question thus is whether the principle
                    is one confined in its application to public authorities (and even at that, it
                    is one established under English law but has not fallen to be decided in
                    Singapore yet), or whether it extends to private individuals in respect of
                    private duties as well. A close reading of the two cases suggests that it does
                    not extend to private individuals. May LJ in <em>Wood</em> (at [58]) took pains to emphasise that the duty in question
                    on the police, <em>ie</em>, the <em>Thorpe</em> principle, was one resting “on a <em>fundamental rule</em> of good public administration <em>which the law must recognise</em>” [emphasis added].
                    In <em>Clift</em> (at [31]–[32]), Ward LJ was of
                    the view that the issue raised in <em>Wood</em> and
                        <em>Clift</em> was special in that the defendants were
                    “public authorities with public duties to perform” and accordingly
                    distinguished the case of <em>Kearns v General Council of the
                        Bar</em> [2003] 1 WLR 1357 where that was not the case. It is
                    apparent that in applying the principle, the courts in both cases were motivated
                    by a policy-driven need to support and uphold standards of good public
                    administration. Because the matter is not before us, we express no view as to
                    whether the principle has application in Singapore. Be that as it may, it is
                    also possible to read the case of <em>Clift</em> even more
                    narrowly. Ward LJ (at [46]) further founded his decision on the basis of
                    s 6 of the HRA which he said obliged the <em>court
                        itself</em> to act in accordance with an ECHR right. Therefore, the
                    court had to give effect to Art 8 of the ECHR as it arose squarely in that
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In our judgment, the Respondent’s duty
                    under Indonesian and Singapore capital markets law not to publish the statements
                    (if it applies at all) cannot be a duty which would prevent him from relying on
                    the defence of qualified privilege. First, there is no policy reason why this
                    particular private duty, as opposed to a duty owed by public authorities
                    underpinned by the policy of good public administration and the ECHR, should
                    trump the social policy behind the defence of qualified privilege. As observed
                    by Parke B in <em>Toogood v Spyring</em> (1834)
                    1 CM &amp; R 181 at 193, the law recognises that certain statements
                    “are protected for the common convenience and welfare of society”.
                    That the defence of qualified privilege is itself underpinned by social policy
                    is also expressed by Lord Diplock in <em>Horrocks v
                        Lowe</em> [1975] AC 135 (“<em>Horrocks</em>”) at 149C–E:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The public interest that the law should provide an effective means whereby
                        a man can vindicate his reputation against calumny has nevertheless to be
                        accommodated to the competing public interest in permitting men to
                        communicate frankly and freely with one another about matters with respect
                        of which the law recognises that they have a duty to perform or an interest
                        to protect in doing so. … For in all cases of qualified privilege
                        there is some special reason of public policy why the law accords immunity
                        from suit—the existence of some public or private duty, whether legal
                        or moral, on the part of the maker of the defamatory statement which
                        justifies his communicating it or of some interest of his own which he is
                        entitled to protect by doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This conclusion is especially so given the standard under the capital
                    markets laws the Appellant is relying on is, in his own submission, one of
                    negligence at its lowest. To therefore apply it in this context would be
                    inconsistent with the principle that carelessness in arriving at a belief in the
                    words complained of is not malice capable of defeating privilege (see <em>Horrocks</em> at 150B–E; this proposition being derived
                    from the social utility and policy of the defence itself). Second, it remains
                    open to the capital markets regulators to take action against the Respondent if
                    the statements were in fact in breach of such capital markets laws. Whereas in
                        <em>Clift</em> the HRA imposed on the English court the
                    obligation to give effect to Art 8 of the ECHR, there is nothing which
                    obliges us to take up and exercise the prosecutorial powers of the regulators to
                    give effect to such duty under such laws. Finally, the duties of the public
                    authorities in both <em>Wood</em> and <em>Clift</em> were owed to the claimants. In the present case, the duty
                    which the Appellant seeks to invoke is not one owed to him either directly or
                    indirectly. If the Appellant cannot in the ordinary course outside of this
                    defamation suit invoke such right against the Respondent, we do not think that
                    there is justification in allowing him to take advantage of it here in what is a
                    private proceeding between private individuals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     As we have alluded above, the
                    Appellant’s reliance on the Respondent’s knowledge of the falsity of
                    the statements in the Letters is a matter relevant to the issue of malice. There
                    is nothing stopping the Appellant from relying on it as such. We will consider
                    this matter further, below. At this juncture, it suffices us to say that we do
                    not think the Appellant’s appeal against the Judge’s finding that
                    the defence of qualified privilege attaches, at least for the purposes of the
                    first instance of the analysis, should be allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Are the copies of the 3rd Letter sent to parties other than BAPEPAM
                protected by qualified privilege?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The next part of the Appellant’s
                    argument is that in so far as the 3rd Letter was sent to IDX, PT Trimegah,
                    the Jakarta office of Macquarie and the Jakarta office of Merrill Lynch
                    Indonesia, these are not covered by the defence of qualified privilege because
                    these entities do not or did not have any regulatory powers which could be
                    invoked, so that they did not have a duty or an interest in receiving
                        it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> This was because the 3rd Letter was sent for
                    the stated purpose of procuring a suspension or prohibition of the IPO. In our
                    judgment, the Appellant has adopted too formalistic a view of the duty-interest
                    test in <em>Adam v Ward</em> ([19(f)] <em>supra</em>) at 334, <em>per</em>
                    Lord Atkinson:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A] privileged occasion is … an occasion where the person who makes
                        a communication has an interest, or a duty, <em>legal,
                            social, or moral</em>, to make it to the person to whom it is
                        made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or
                        duty to receive it. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Whether the recipients had a duty or interest to receive the
                    communication is not measured strictly by the legal powers they may exercise
                    upon receipt. The Judge explained (at [67] of the Judgment) how each recipient
                    of the 3rd Letter had an interest (not necessarily legal) in receiving
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     If the Appellant’s contention is that in
                    respect of these recipients other than BAPEPAM the letter ought not to have
                    included a demand that the IPO process be suspended or stopped, we also do not
                    accept such a contention. The authorities are settled in as much as the
                    inclusion of irrelevant or unnecessary material in a communication would not
                    take it out of the scope of qualified privilege; any excessive statement would
                    simply be treated as evidence going towards showing malice and should be
                    analysed as such (see <em>Nevill v Fine Arts and General
                        Insurance Company, Limited</em> [1895] 2 QB 156 at 170, <em>per</em> Lord Esher and <em>Horrocks</em> at 151).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Finally, the Appellant remarks in passing an
                    objection on the ground that the Indonesian office of Macquarie was not involved
                    in the IPO. We do not think that this objection is persuasive. The law accepts
                    that sometimes, in making a communication covered by qualified privilege, it may
                    reach an audience without the necessary duty or interest in relation to the
                    subject matter. In such a case, the question is whether such communication was
                    reasonably warranted by the exigency of the occasion (see <em>Duncan and Neill</em> at para 16.19). The result is that an
                    ancillary or incidental privilege attaches. The Judge made a finding of fact (at
                    [67] of the Judgment) that in PT Bayan’s Preliminary Offering
                    Memorandum, “Macquarie” was described by only its logo and nothing
                    more. In the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the Respondent to have
                    sent the 3rd Letter to the Indonesian office of Macquarie. The Appellant has not
                    challenged this finding of the Judge in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In summary, we do not find that there is
                    occasion for us to disturb the Judge’s finding that the Indonesian
                    Publications were made on occasions of qualified privilege. This being so, the
                        <em>prima facie</em> position is that the Respondent
                    can rely on the defence in relation to the republications as well. The issue of
                    malice defeating the defence will be dealt with further, below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Are the words complained of false and were they published
                maliciously?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     What is in issue here is the existence of the
                    “Common Understanding” (see above at [15]) as alleged by the
                    Respondent in the Letters. The Appellant seeks to show that there was no Common
                    Understanding and so the words complained of were false. The falsity of the
                    words complained of and whether they were published maliciously go to several
                    different issues. First, falsity may be a factor towards proving express malice,
                    which would defeat the defence of qualified privilege under the defamation
                    claim. Second, falsity of the words and malicious publishing thereof, if made
                    out, are elements under the tort of malicious falsehood under which the
                    Appellant also claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Are the words complained of false?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The Judge held that on the evidence before
                    him, he was unable to find one way or the other whether the case of the Common
                    Understanding was either true or false (see the Judgment at [53]). As the Judge
                    noted, the only piece of documentary evidence available was a cheque for S$3m
                    issued by the Appellant to the Respondent dated 25 April 1996 (“the
                    Cheque”). To begin, it is necessary to set out in some detail the
                    Respondent’s case. He says that sometime in 1995, the Appellant approached
                    him for S$3m to facilitate the establishment of a coal mining business in
                    Indonesia, with the representation that if the business was established, he
                    would be given a 50% share of the shareholding, or, if it was not, the Appellant
                    would return the money to him. He says that the Appellant issued the Cheque to
                    him as “assurance” that he would get his money back. He says that
                    the Cheque was actually issued in 1995 but post-dated to 1996. He was
                    subsequently informed by the Appellant in early 1996 that the coal mining
                    business did not take off and that he would return the money. It was only on
                    29 June 2008 when he overheard the Appellant’s name being mentioned
                    by a friend, one Mr Christopher Clower (“Clower”), in
                    relation to a prospective IPO that he made enquiries and learned that the
                    Appellant has successfully set up PT Bayan. It was this which, he says,
                    precipitated the sending of the Letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     In contrast, the Appellant denies that he had
                    received S$3m from the Respondent. The Appellant said that the Cheque was given
                    to the Respondent to allow him to raise money to satisfy certain debts he owed
                    various parties, including the Appellant. The Appellant accepts that the
                    Respondent’s failure to make out the justification defence (<em>ie</em>, the truth of the words complained of) does not
                        <em>ipso facto</em> mean that he has made out
                    falsity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     After a review of the record, we are of the
                    view that the Appellant has satisfied his burden of proving on a balance of
                    probabilities that the words complained of in the Letters as to the existence of
                    the Common Understanding are false. We do not agree with the Judge’s
                    conclusion that on the evidence before him, the Common Understanding was neither
                    true nor false (see above at [65]). Counsel for the Respondent, Mr Giam
                    Chin Toon SC (“Mr Giam”) sought to uphold the
                    Judge’s conclusion by arguing that under our law of evidence, a fact may
                    either be proved, disproved, or not proved (see ss 3(3)–3(5) of the
                    Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), respectively; <em>Loo Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo, deceased</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 286 at [20] and <em>Cooperatieve Centrale
                        Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading as Rabobank International),
                        Singapore Branch v Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 2 SLR
                    63 at [35]). In an action for defamation, the burden of proof lies on the
                    defendant to prove the truth of the matter to make out the defence of
                    justification. In this regard, the Judge found that the Respondent had not
                    proven the existence of the Common Understanding (see the Judgment at
                    [46]–[53]) for the purposes of his plea of justification. This, therefore,
                    means that the falsity of the defamatory words is <em>presumed</em>, but this does not equate to <em>proof</em> of falsity. The burden still lies on the Appellant, for
                    the purposes of his claim in malicious falsehood, to prove falsity. It is on
                    this analysis that, as a matter of <em>theory</em>, the
                    Judge’s conclusion is possible, <em>viz</em>, that
                    the truth and the falsity of the matter both lie in the realm of being
                    “not proved”. We agree, however, with the recent observation of
                    Tugendhat J in <em>Cruddas v Calvert &amp; Ors</em>
                    [2013] EWHC 2298 (QB), that from experience, the balance is seldom so finely
                    tuned in these matters of burden of proof in this context. Tugendhat J
                    noted in that case which involved claims in both defamation and malicious
                    falsehood (at [200]–[201]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">200.  I have already held that all three meanings were
                            untrue in the meanings which the Court of Appeal held they bore for the
                            purposes of the claim in libel. I recall that in libel the burden of
                            proving truth lies on the defendant, whereas in malicious falsehood the
                            burden of proving falsity lies on the claimant. So <em>it
                                would be theoretically possible for the Defendants to have failed in
                                proving truth for the purposes of the libel claim, and for
                                Mr Cruddas [the claimant] to fail in proving falsehood for the
                                claim in malicious falsehood</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">201.  However, <em>it is the experience
                                of judges in practice that the burden of proof is very rarely
                                decisive of the outcome of an action</em>. In the present case
                            it is not because of the burden of proof that I have decided that the
                            defence of truth failed for the purposes of the libel action. I would
                            have reached the same conclusion if the burden of proof had lain on
                            Mr Cruddas. Mr Cruddas has more than satisfied me that the
                            three meanings were all false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Put shortly, we disagree with the Judge’s conclusion that the
                    present case is such an exceptional case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     We now set out the reasons for our conclusion
                    that the Appellant <em>has proven</em> on a balance of
                    probabilities that the words complained of are false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Inconsistencies in the Respondent’s assertions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     First, the Respondent’s evidence on
                    various occasions and on oath in court proceedings in Singapore and in Hong Kong
                    were inconsistent with his assertions in the Letters of an investment based on
                    the Common Understanding. These instances of evidence on oath both preceded and
                    followed the Letters in time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Sometime in early 1996, the Appellant and
                    other shareholders in a listed company in Hong Kong known as China Development
                    Corporation Limited (“CDC”) sold their shares to Dynasty Line
                    Limited (“Dynasty”), a company owned by the Respondent. The
                    Respondent failed to meet certain payments for the shares and the Appellant
                    started to press him for payments. Two handwritten letters from the Appellant to
                    the Respondent dated 23 January 1997 and 6 November 1997 pressing for
                    payments were produced by the Appellant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Action No 9505 of 1999 was subsequently
                    filed in the High Court of Hong Kong by the Appellant and the other shareholders
                    against Dynasty for the monies owing to them. On 13 June 2000, the
                    Respondent filed a witness statement. In this witness statement, he says that
                    “in late 1995, [he] advanced S$3,000,000 to [the Appellant] which was
                    secured by a post dated cheque issued by [the Appellant] in [his]
                        favour”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> He annexed the said post dated
                    cheque. The Respondent sought to offset this S$3m against the claim against
                    Dynasty. Next, Companies Winding Up Proceedings No 382 of 2007 was brought
                    by the Appellant in the High Court of Hong Kong to wind up Dynasty. In response,
                    the Respondent made an affirmation on 14 January 2008. In this affirmation,
                    he repeats the same story he stated in the 13 June 2000 witness statement
                    that he had made a S$3m advance to the Appellant which ought to be set off
                    against the monies owing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> What is highly pertinent to us is that in both
                    these instances, there was no mention of the S$3m being part of an investment
                    entitling him to a half-share in PT Bayan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     It was only in an affidavit affirmed
                    28 October 2008, after these proceedings had commenced, that the Respondent
                    first tied the S$3m to being an investment in the coal mining business which
                    entitled him to a half-share in PT Bayan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> This affidavit was filed to support
                    his application for the present proceedings to be stayed on the ground of
                        <em>forum non conveniens</em>. This account was also
                    then repeated when he filed his defence and counterclaim. This in our view was
                    in itself not particularly damning because the Respondent’s explanation
                    was that he had previously thought that the coal mining business never took off,
                    and so he was previously under the belief that he was entitled to treat the S$3m
                    as a loan (see above at [65]).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     However, in his response to Suit No 256
                    of 2010 brought by the liquidators of Dynasty against the Respondent for breach
                    of his fiduciary duties as a director in the High Court of Singapore, the
                    Respondent returned to his earlier version of events. In his defence in that
                        action<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> and in an affidavit
                    dated 21 September 2010,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> the Respondent again asserted that
                    there was a S$3m sum he had advanced to the Appellant which ought to be offset
                    against the purchase price of the CDC shares. Not only were these documents
                    filed after he had allegedly learned of the existence of PT Bayan, they
                    came after the affidavit and defence and counterclaim alleging the S$3m as an
                    investment were filed in these proceedings. When queried by Mr Singh in the
                    proceedings below as to why there was this inconsistency, the Respondent had no
                        answer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     During the hearing before us, Mr Singh
                    further pointed out that the figure of S$3m was not mentioned in any of the
                    Letters. Given the details the Respondent had thought to include in the letters,
                    one could have expected that he would also include at least a mention of the
                    S$3m figure there; that fact being such a central aspect of his claim.
                    Mr Singh submitted that this showed that tying the S$3m figure and the
                    Cheque to the alleged investment was conjured by the Respondent only after these
                    proceedings were commenced against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Further, the Respondent’s testimony on
                    the source of the S$3m, which he says came in the form of cash kept in a safe in
                    his office, was dubious, to say the least. When asked to produce the bank
                    statement corroborating the withdrawal of this sum, the Respondent changed tack
                    and asserted that he received the sum in cash from a “Peter
                        Lim”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> There was no
                    receipt confirming this or evidence from this individual adduced. He
                    subsequently changed his story again and claimed that the S$3m was spare cash
                    lying around in his office. The Respondent was then unable to plausibly explain
                    why he would have kept in his office such a large amount of cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In our view, these incomprehensible
                    inconsistencies tended to suggest that there was no such investment and so more
                    likely than not no Common Understanding.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Respondent’s inaction for 13 years</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Secondly, as pointed out by the Appellant, the
                    Respondent’s inaction for a period of 13 years is difficult to accept.
                    Even on the basis that the Respondent was labouring under the impression that
                    the coal mining business did not materialise and so the S$3m was to be taken as
                    a loan, he did not for 13 years seek to recover it. This was despite coming
                    under severe financial pressure in the many proceedings against him over the
                    years, starting from the two letters written by the Appellant in 1997 and the
                    law suits which followed. In addition, bankruptcy proceedings were brought
                    against the Respondent in the late 1990s which resulted in him filing for
                    bankruptcy protection in Hawaii, USA. Pertinently, the S$3m was not listed in
                    the statements he had to make declaring his assets and
                liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In respect of enforcing the Common
                    Understanding itself, <em>viz</em>, to his share of 50% of
                    the shareholding of PT Bayan, the Respondent’s case is, of course,
                    that he was simply not aware that the coal mining business had been successfully
                    established and that he instructed his Indonesian lawyers to do so immediately
                    upon learning about it in 2008.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> The
                    problem with this is that it is difficult to imagine that the Respondent, a
                    sophisticated investor, could be ignorant of PT Bayan for so many
                        years.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> In our view, this is especially so
                    given the Respondent was embroiled with the Appellant in continuing legal
                    disputes over many years over the sale and purchase of certain shares and it was
                    not as if they had each disappeared from one another’s lives. Given such a
                    relationship between the parties, it is hard in our view to conclude that the
                    Respondent did not know of the existence of PT Bayan between 1997 and 2008.
                    That he sat on the alleged Common Understanding for so many years without
                    seeking to enforce his alleged rights under it suggests it did not really
                    exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The evidence as to the circumstances of the alleged
                investment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Finally, we find the manner in which the
                    Respondent said he came to give the Appellant the S$3m with the latter agreeing
                    in return to give him a half-share of a coal mining business also inherently
                    implausible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     To begin, the Respondent said that all that
                    happened was that the Appellant had asked him for the S$3m and offered the
                    half-share in the coal mining business and that he readily agreed because they
                    were good friends at the time. To our minds, it was strange that for such an
                    important investment, the Respondent had not made any inquiries into what
                    exactly he was investing in. Neither was there any evidence of any discussion as
                    to the details of the coal mining business which the Appellant was going to set
                    up and the nature of the coal mining concession he was going to acquire in
                    Indonesia. The Respondent sought to explain that given the extremely good terms
                    he was on with the Appellant, he would have lent the money without question. He
                    also said that the Appellant had orally assured him that the coal mining
                    business would be worth some US$500m. This may be so, but this on the other hand
                    raises questions from the Appellant’s point of view. It is difficult to
                    believe that the <em>quid pro quo</em> for the Respondent
                    investing S$3m could imaginably be a half-share of something envisaged to be
                    worth half a billion US dollars. Further, the Respondent’s account of the
                    Common Understanding was that if the coal mining business did not pan out, the
                    investment would instead be treated as a loan and the Appellant would have to
                    return him the S$3m. This was in essence an agreement under which the Respondent
                    had very little to lose and much more to gain than reasonably
                imaginable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     For these reasons, we find that the Judge
                    erred in failing to accept that the Appellant had proven on a balance of
                    probabilities that the words complained of, <em>viz</em>,
                    the existence of the Common Understanding, are false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were the words complained of published with malice?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The Appellant submitted that in the present
                    case, the falsity of the words complained of is highly probative of knowledge of
                    falsity on the part of the Respondent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Knowledge of falsity or lack of belief in the
                    truth of the words complained of in turn proves express malice (see <em>Horrocks</em> at 149–150 ; <em>Hytech
                        Builders Pte Ltd v Goh Teng Poh Karen</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 236 at
                    [39]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     However, the Judge found that the Respondent
                    “believed that he had a claim against [the Appellant] and that his claims
                    in the Indonesia Publications were true” and so found no malice (see the
                    Judgment at [66] and [70]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     The Appellant’s argument must be that
                    given the nature of the facts in issue, the Respondent’s assertion of
                    belief in the words complained of is so unreasonable that the court must reject
                    his contention that he holds it. Such an analysis is not without support and is
                    endorsed by <em>Gatley</em> (at para 17.18), in which
                    the editors cite to Lord Herschell’s speech in <em>William Derry, JC Wakefield and others v Sir Henry William Peek,
                        Baronet</em> (1889) 14 App Cas 337 at 375–376 (which was a
                    case involving the tort of deceit) on this issue of belief:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I can conceive many cases where the fact that an alleged belief was
                        destitute of all reasonable foundation would suffice of itself to convince

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     As we have noted, the first obstacle for the
                    Appellant to surmount is the Judge’s finding that the Respondent held an
                    honest belief in the truth of his claim. The Judge relied on (a) his
                    actions in instructing Singapore and Indonesian lawyers and acting on the
                    latter’s advice to make the Publications; (b) his issuance of a Power
                    of Attorney to HPP; (c) his meeting with Clower in 2008 wherein he first
                    discovered the existence of PT Bayan; (d) his further independent
                    enquiries including obtaining a copy of PT Bayan’s draft prospectus
                    dated July 2008; (e) instructing HPP to make the Publications; and
                    (f) his conduct and demeanour under cross-examination (see the Judgment at
                    [66]). Unfortunately, we agree with the Appellant that the Judge’s
                    reasoning was plainly wrong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> These facts (save for
                    the point on the Respondent’s conduct and demeanour under
                    cross-examination) are not unequivocal of an honest belief in the truth of the
                    claim by the Respondent. That a person instructs lawyers to advance a claim does
                    not necessarily prove his honest belief in it. Even taken together, these
                    factors listed by the Judge do not, with respect, lead to the conclusion he
                    reached. It is trite that an appellate court will give due deference to a trial
                    judge’s assessment of a witness’s conduct and demeanour. But, in the
                    present case, if the Appellant is right that the claim was false and of a nature
                    such that to believe it was so unreasonable, then the proper inference that the
                    court must draw must be that the Respondent did not hold any honest belief in
                    the truth of it, no matter how convincing he may have seemed on the stand to the
                    Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As the Respondent was <em>directly involved</em> in the events relating to the Common
                    Understanding, the Appellant is correct in asserting that this was “not a
                    case where there was the realistic possibility of a faulty but honest
                    recollection of the alleged event in question”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span>
                    The Common Understanding either <em>existed</em> or
                        <em>did not exist</em>. If there was no Common
                    Understanding, which was something between the Appellant and the Respondent
                    solely, there is no reason for the Respondent to believe it to exist. The
                    Respondent’s objection to this analysis on the ground that this means that
                    mere proof of falsehood leads to the conclusion of malice<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>
                    overstates the case. We make this conclusion only on the facts of this case
                    given the nature of the subject matter in the words complained of. This does not
                    create any independent legal principle of general application contrary to the
                    accepted principle that mere proof of falsity is not sufficient to establish
                    malice. As described by <em>Gatley</em> (at
                    para 21.8), “the law here merely follows the normal approach to
                    drawing inferences about a person’s knowledge, belief or
                    intention”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     We accordingly find that the Appellant had
                    established that the words complained of were published by the Respondent with
                    express malice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Effect of these conclusions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     At this juncture, we pause to take stock of
                    what our above findings mean to the Appellant’s claims against the
                    Respondent in this appeal. Given that we find that the words complained of were
                    false, and that they were published by the Respondent with express malice, it
                    follows that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defence of qualified privilege
                        is defeated in respect of the Publications and the Republications;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_88-p2_b"></a>(b)     if
                        causation of special damage is made out (see below at [103] <em>et seq</em>), the tort of malicious falsehood is also
                        made out under Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defamation claim</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion in respect of liability for defamation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     On the basis of the above, we make the
                    following determinations on the Appellant’s claim in defamation:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a>(a)     we reject the appeal against the
                        Judge’s findings in relation to the meanings held by the words
                        complained of;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_b"></a>(b)     we allow the appeal against the Judge’s finding that there was no
                        Singapore republication of the 3rd Letter to Merrill Lynch Singapore in
                        Singapore and hold that the content of this republication bore the same
                        meaning as the 3rd Letter itself; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_c"></a>(c)     we allow the appeal against the Judge’s finding
                        that the defence of qualified privileged was defeated by express
                        malice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, the Respondent is liable for
                    defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relief available under the defamation claim</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">General damages and aggravated damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It follows from our finding that liability for
                    defamation has been made out that the Appellant is entitled to general damages.
                    These would comprise the recognised heads of damage claimable as general
                    damages, <em>viz</em>, for injury to reputation, injury to
                    feelings, and for vindication (as set out in <em>Arul Chandran v
                        Chew Chin Aik Victor</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 86 (“<em>Arul Chandran</em>”) at [53]). These will fall to be
                    assessed by a High Court judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Judge’s conclusion that no
                    aggravated damages for the claim in defamation should be granted even if
                    defamation was made out was largely premised on the basis that the publications
                    were not made with malice and that they were not false (see the Judgment at
                    [80]). We would note that the Respondent has not since making the publications
                    apologised for them. We have found that the words complained of were false, that
                    the Respondent knew they were false, and that he was actuated by express malice
                    in making the publications. Further, the Respondent wrongly maintained the truth
                    of his false allegations through the trial of the matter via his plea of
                    justification and now in the arguments made on appeal. These are all matters of
                    a defendant’s conduct and state of mind which the court will consider in
                    deciding whether aggravated damages ought to be awarded (see <em>Koh Sin Chong Freddie v Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others and another
                        appeal</em> [2013] SGCA 46 at [51] and <em>Arul
                        Chandran</em> at [55], citing <em>Gatley on Libel and
                        Slander</em> (Patrick Milmo &amp; WVH Rogers eds) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 9th Ed, 1998) at pp 212–213). The Respondent does not
                    proffer any other reason for the refusal of relief in the form of aggravated
                        damages.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> We thus find that the Appellant is
                    entitled to aggravated damages (as a component of general compensatory damages).
                    These will also be assessed by a High Court judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Special damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The Appellant claimed special damages to be
                    assessed under his claim in defamation. He said that he suffered these when he
                    was not able to sell 375,000,000 vendor shares in the IPO at a price of 5,800
                    rupiah per shares (amounting to 2.175 trillion rupiah). He thus
                        claimed:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     the sum of 2.175 trillion rupiah or
                        its equivalent sum in Singapore dollars at the rate of exchange on
                        12 August 2008 at 6,505 rupiah to S$1, amounting to
                        S$334,358,186.01;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     further and/or alternatively, interest on 2.175 trillion rupiah or
                        S$334,358,186.01, pursuant to s 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43,
                        1999 Rev Ed);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_c"></a>(c)     further and/or alternatively, damages for currency exchange loss on
                        the sum of 2.175 trillion rupiah; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_d"></a>(d)     further and/or alternatively, damages for the loss of
                        opportunity to use and/or invest 2.175 trillion rupiah, including the loss
                        of opportunity to buy back his shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The Judge held that special damages may be
                    awarded in an action for defamation (see the Judgment at [81]) and the
                    Respondent did not and does not now on appeal dispute this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     We accept as a general proposition that a
                    plaintiff is not precluded from claiming special damages in an action for
                    defamation; the authorities say that an award for special damage may be made on
                    top of that for general damage. However, the availability of such an award is
                    not as wide as the Appellant’s pleadings allege it to be, <em>ie</em>, all consequential pecuniary loss. What is meant by
                    “special damage” in this context must be properly understood. As
                    long ago as in the case of <em>Ratcliffe v Evans</em>
                    [1892] 2 QB 524 (“<em>Ratcliffe v
                    Evans</em>”) at 529, Bowen LJ declared the use of the term
                    “special damage” as one “which, intelligible enough in
                    particular contexts, tends, when successively employed in more than one context
                    and with regard to different subject-matter, to encourage confusion in
                    thought”. It is true that to constitute special damage the loss must be
                    pecuniary, <em>ie</em>, it must be loss capable of
                    estimation in money’s worth, but the converse is not true: not all manner
                    of pecuniary losses fall within the scope of special damage. This appears to be
                    a conceptual misunderstanding on the part of the Appellant in the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In <em>Ratcliffe v
                        Evans</em>, Bowen LJ explained that in actions such as the
                    present, where the wrong is actionable <em>per se</em>,
                    special damage is used to denote the particular damage which a claimant suffers
                    beyond general damage (at 528):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">At times (both in the law of tort and of contract) it is employed to
                        denote <b><em>that damage arising out of the special
                            circumstances of the case which, if properly pleaded, may be superadded
                            to the general damage which the law implies in every breach of contract
                            and every infringement of an absolute right</em></b>: see <em>Ashby v. White</em>. In all such cases the law presumes
                        that <em>some</em> damage will flow in the ordinary
                        course of things from the mere invasion of the plaintiff’s rights, and
                        calls it general damage. <b><em>Special damage in such a
                            context means the particular damage (beyond the general damage), which
                            results from the particular circumstances of the case</em></b>, and of
                        the plaintiff’s claim to be compensated, for which he ought to give
                        warning in his pleadings in order that there may be no surprise at the
                        trial. [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics and
                        underline]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     That special damage in this context is so
                    limited and does not extend to all manner of consequential loss also explains
                    the observation in Harvey McGregor, <em>McGregor on
                        Damages</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2009)
                        (“<em>McGregor on Damages</em>”) at
                    para 39-034, that an award of special damages in an action for libel while
                    possible is somewhat extraordinary:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Again apart from the three regular heads of injury to reputation, injury
                        to feelings and vindication, there is pecuniary loss. This is a clear head
                        of damage but it cannot be said to be a regular one in this field. There are
                        a few old cases. In <em>Evans v Harries</em>, an action
                        for slander of the claimant in his business of an innkeeper, the claimant
                        recovered for a general falling off of custom, while in <em>Harrison v Pearce</em>, an action for libel upon the proprietors
                        a newspaper, damages were awarded in respect of the resulting general
                        decline in the newspaper’s circulation; and more specific losses, as
                        of particular contracts, particular employments, particular hospitality, may
                        also be allowed if properly pleaded and proved. <b><em>However,
                            modern libel cases where pecuniary loss is specifically claimed are
                            virtually impossible to find, the tendency being to claim simply for
                            damage to reputation </em></b><em>tout
                            court</em><b><em> in the hope, frequently, of a very
                            large general award</em></b>. [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The propensity of claimants to claim simply for damage to reputation
                        <em>tout court</em> stems from the fact that any
                    special damages which are claimable in an action for libel must, in our
                    judgment, be in any case losses referable to the damage to reputation; in other
                    words, it refers to particular damage in the nature of those recognised as
                    claimable as general damage. What is meant by special damage ought properly be
                    called ‘particular’ or ‘actual’ damage, this being in
                    contradistinction to the ‘presumptive’ damage the court awards when
                    one claims general damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Limiting what may be claimed as special damage
                    in this context is both commonsensical and supported by policy. The old English
                    case of <em>William Allsop and Hannah, his Wife v Thomas
                        Allsop</em> (1860) 5 H &amp; N 534 (“<em>Allsop v Allsop</em>”) is instructive. The claim in <em>Allsop v Allsop</em> was for damages relating to a married
                    woman’s illness which resulted from her being slandered. These were held
                    by the court to be too remote to be recoverable. We agree with <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (at para 6-082) in that the
                    first two bases upon which the case was decided were under the law at the time
                    accepted but no longer hold water today: first, that psychiatric injury as
                    opposed to physical injury were too remote to claim, and second, that the damage
                    in that case was too remote because it depended upon the peculiarities and
                    temperament of the particular individual. However, the third basis remains
                    relevant. This was the ground that loss through ill health was not within the
                    scope of protection of tort in question, even though it resulted in a pecuniary
                    loss. Particularly, Martin B remarked (at 539) that “[t]he law is
                    jealous as to actions for mere words”. <em>McGregor on
                        Damages</em> (at para 6-082) explains this third basis as
                    such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What was at the back of the court’s mind seems to have been
                            <b><em>the need to confine such slander actions within
                            strictly defined limits</em></b>, so that resulting ill health did not
                        ground recovery because it was not an interest protected by the tort.
                        Whether this conclusion was sound, in view of the fact that the loss was a
                        pecuniary one, may be doubted; but <b><em>it is basically a
                            matter of policy</em></b>, and this remains the one ground upon which
                            <em>Allsop v Allsop</em> could be supported today.
                        [emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     We agree. The tort of defamation is not one
                    which protects all kinds of interests and so not all kinds of losses are
                    recoverable. By their nature, certain kinds of losses are, as a matter of
                    policy, simply too remote to be recovered in an action for defamation. The tort
                    of defamation primarily protects a person’s reputation (see <em>Gatley</em> at para 1.1) and so grants relief for damage
                    to a plaintiff’s reputation, the injury to his feelings and also provides
                    a vindicatory effect. Where therefore the loss resulting from the publication of
                    the words complained of is not referable to such protected interests, such loss
                    is not claimable even if the publication was factually causative of it; it
                    therefore does not include <em>all</em> consequential
                    pecuniary loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In the present case, the Judge had found, and
                    we agree, that given the Publications and Republications held the meanings they
                    were found to hold, they would tend to lower the Appellant in the estimation of
                    right-thinking members of society generally or impute a lack of integrity. It
                    was not this lowering of the Appellant in the estimation of right-thinking
                    members of society generally or the imputation of a lack of integrity, <em>ie</em>, the damage to his reputation, which caused the
                    Appellant not to be able to sell his vendor shares in the IPO. Rather, it was
                    because of the concerns which the capital markets regulators had with the
                        <em>allegations</em> found <em>in</em> the 3rd Letter which led to the Appellant having to, he says,
                    remove his vendor shares from the sale. This is not a loss, even if it can be
                    proven, which is protected by the tort of defamation. It would be a different
                    matter in a case where defamatory materials were published calling a trader
                    dishonest (whether in the way of his trade or otherwise). He may as a result
                    suffer a fall in custom because of customer shunning him having heard of his
                    reputation of being dishonest. In such a case, the plaintiff may either claim
                    for a loss of reputation generally, or, if he can specifically prove so, the
                    fall in custom resulting from the damaged reputation as special damages, such
                    loss being the particular loss he suffered in his circumstances. Significantly,
                    the Appellant also seeks to claim such loss in his action for malicious
                    falsehood. It may well be that such losses are more appropriately claimed under
                    that separate tort which protects a different interest from the tort of
                    defamation; to allow recovery in the action for defamation would also obviate
                    the need of the Appellant to show that he satisfies the conditions on which he
                    can claim in the tort of malicious falsehood. We will examine this claim again
                    when we discuss it in the context of malicious falsehood (see below at [103]
                        <em>et seq</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    We accordingly find that under Singapore
                    law, the Appellant is not entitled to the special damages he seeks. Given our
                    judgment in this regard, the issue relating to whether such special damages of
                    the sort the Appellant is claiming are claimable under Indonesian law in an
                    action for defamation for the purposes of satisfying the double actionability
                    rule (see above at [16]) is moot. This was a major bone of contention between
                    the parties and their expert witnesses on Indonesian law in the proceedings
                    below. We appreciate the extensive submissions made by the parties in their
                    respective written cases on this specific issue, but as there is no necessity
                    for us to decide this issue, we make no comment on it or on the Judge’s
                    findings in this respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The Judge concluded that even if defamation
                    had been made out, there was no need for the court to grant an injunction
                    restraining “any repetition of the slander or of similar
                    imputations” because there was no evidence to give rise to any
                    apprehension of further publication by the Respondent (see the Judgment at
                    [82]). The Appellant’s case seems to be that because the Respondent was
                    actuated by malice, there are <em>ipso facto</em> grounds
                    to fear further publications and so a real risk that he will do so.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span>
                    The Appellant’s arguments are unsupported by authority. In addition to the
                    fact that there was no evidence of the danger of further publications, it may
                    also be noted that there is no evidence that in the four years since the
                    Publications and Republications, the Respondent had made further publications of
                    the same. We therefore do not think that it is necessary to order an injunction
                    in the present case.</p>

                    established if special damage is proven, this being an element of the tort
                    without which the claim cannot stand (see <em>WBG Network

                    claimable in an action for malicious falsehood. The tort of malicious falsehood
                    as it is commonly known today is of an entirely different character from an
                    action for defamation. W Blake Odgers and Robert Ritson, <em>A Digest of the Law of Libel and Slander and of Actions on the Case for
                        Words Causing Damage</em> (Stevens and Sons, Limited, 6th Ed,
                    1929) at p 66 describes such actions thus:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We pass [from the preceding discussion on defamation] now to words of an
                        entirely different character—to words, that is, which are not
                        defamatory of any individual, which do not injure the reputation of any one,
                        either personally or in the way of his profession or trade, but <em>which were intended to cause, and which did cause, pecuniary
                            loss to some one</em>. No action of libel or slander will lie for
                        such words. But <em>when a defendant either knows or ought to
                            know that special damage will happen to the plaintiff if he writes or
                            speaks certain words, and he writes or speaks those words, desiring and
                            intending that such damage shall follow, or recklessly indifferent
                            whether such damage follows or not, then, if the words be false, and if
                            such damage does in fact follow directly from their use, an action on
                            the case will lie</em>. And in such an action on the case it is
                        the plaintiff who must prove that the words are false, that they were
                        published by the defendant with some degree of malice, and that actual
                        damage has ensued. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It has been said that the “true legal aspect” of the
                    tort may be described as being an “[action] for <em>unlawfully causing damage</em>” [emphasis added]; and it is
                    for this reason that “damage is the gist of the action” (see
                        <em>The Royal Baking Powder Company v Wright, Crossley &amp;
                        Co</em> (1901) 18 RPC 95 at 104, <em>per</em> Lord Halsbury LC, and see also <em>Ratcliffe v Evans</em> at 527).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    In the Appellant’s statement of claim
                    (at paras 23–25, see above at [103]), the Appellant pleaded as
                    special damage the <em>entire value</em> of the
                    PT Bayan shares which were withdrawn from the IPO.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> In respect of
                    these pleaded heads of special damage, we dismiss the claim in malicious
                    falsehood because causation of such loss has not been made out. It quite simply
                    cannot by any stretch of the imagination be shown that a direct and natural
                    consequence of the false words was that loss amounting to the <em>entire value</em> of the shares would be suffered by the Appellant.
                    This was as though the false words caused the shares to become worthless. Quite
                    aside from the fact that we cannot accept that such loss as pleaded is a direct
                    and natural consequence of the publications, it was also disclosed in the
                    evidence brought below that the Appellant was in fact able to sell his shares in
                    a private sale not long after the IPO. Approximately 300m shares were sold by
                    the Appellant to another shareholder.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> This clearly showed that the
                    publication of the false words did not cause the shares to become
                    worthless.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In our view, the Appellant’s real
                    loss, if any, was what was pleaded in para 26, <em>ie</em>, the loss of opportunity to invest in the money he would have
                    gotten had he sold his PT Bayan shares at the IPO as planned.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> The
                    crux of the contention between the parties is whether the Respondent’s
                    acts had caused such loss. The Judge declined to address this issue, taking the
                    view that this was a matter which was to be decided at the assessment of damages
                    stage of the proceedings (see the Judgment at [81]). The parties are not in
                    dispute that this was a matter on which the Judge ought to have made a
                    determination. This was not least because special damage is, as we have noted,
                    an element of the tort of malicious falsehood, without which the tort cannot
                    stand and liability cannot be held to have been made out. Given the Judge did
                    not undertake the task of evaluating the evidence relating to this issue and did
                    not make any determination thereon, it is incumbent on us to do so
                now.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The Appellant’s case is that following
                    the Publications to BAPEPAM, BAPEPAM informed PT Bayan that it would have
                    to “clear” any dispute over the shares of PT Bayan before the
                    IPO could proceed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> As a
                    result of this, the Appellant says he had “no choice” but to
                    withdraw his vendor shares from the IPO. It was on this basis, he says, that
                    BAPEPAM issued the Effective Statement which allowed the IPO to
                        proceed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span> The Respondent, on the contrary,
                    argued that there was no causal link between the Publications and the special
                    damage alleged because BAPEPAM did not impose on the Appellant and PT Bayan
                    the requirement that he removed his vendor shares. Instead, he says, this was
                    done on his own accord or by PT Bayan’s management on the advice of
                    its IPO underwriter PT Trimegah.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The test of causation of special damage in
                    the tort of malicious falsehood is simply that such damage must have been the
                    natural and probable (or, in different parlance but meaning the same thing,
                    direct and natural) result of the words (see <em>Palmer Bruyn
                        &amp; Parker Pty Limited v Keith Parsons</em> (2001) 208 CLR
                    388). In this regard, we find that the Appellant has established the necessary
                    causal link in the present case. Kwan Jenny Quantero (“Quantero”),
                    a director and shareholder of PT Bayan, gave evidence as to the events
                    which followed the publications.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> On 21 July 2008,

                    PT Bayan’s lawyers met with representatives of BAPEPAM. They informed
                    BAPEPAM that the Appellant had assured PT Bayan that the Respondent’s
                    allegations were false, and that PT Bayan was not connected in any way to
                    the Appellant. They were informed by BAPEPAM that they would have to clear any
                    disputes on the PT Bayan shares before the IPO could proceed.
                    PT Trimegah met with the representatives of BAPEPAM a second time and
                    PT Trimegah then advised that the only way for the IPO to proceed was for
                    the Appellant’s shares to be removed from the vendor shares offering. This
                    advice was acted upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    We accept the evidence put forward by the
                    Appellant and find that the publication of the false words was the natural and
                    probable cause of the need to remove the Appellant’s vendor shares from
                    the IPO. The Respondent suggests that the Appellant and PT Bayan could have
                    taken other courses of action than to remove the Appellant’s vendor shares
                    to assuage BAPEPAM’s concerns for BAPEPAM to allow the IPO to proceed.
                    These are, however, nothing more than speculative suggestions on his part. We
                    accept the evidence that from the meetings with BAPEPAM, Quantero, the IPO
                    advisors and in particular PT Trimegah understood that BAPEPAM would only
                    allow the IPO to proceed if they took the course that they did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In the light of all of the above, we find
                    that the Appellant has made out the causation of special damage in the present
                    case. As we have noted, this is confined to the Appellant’s pleading that
                    as a result of the false words, he was not able to sell his vendor shares at the
                    IPO and that he suffered a loss of opportunity to use and/or invest in the money
                    he would have otherwise gotten.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relying on s 6(1)(a) of the Defamation Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In the alternative, the Appellant seeks to
                    rely on s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Defamation Act
                    (Cap 75, 1985 Rev Ed) which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>6.</b>—(1) In any action for
                        slander of title, slander of goods or other malicious falsehood, it shall
                        not be necessary to allege or prove special damage —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    if the words
                                upon which the action is founded are calculated to cause pecuniary
                                damage to the plaintiff and are published in writing or other
                                permanent form …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The question in the present case is whether
                    the words complained of were “calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the
                    plaintiff”. The words “calculated to” have been interpreted
                    by the Singapore High Court in <em>DHKW Marketing and another v
                        Nature’s Farm Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 774
                        (“<em>DHKW Marketing</em>”) at [39] to
                    mean “likely to produce the result” (see also <em>Gatley</em> at para 21.13). We agree with the High Court’s
                    interpretation of this phrase in <em>DHKW Marketing</em>.
                    We would further note by way of observation that in <em>Customglass Boats Ltd and Another v Salthouse Brothers Ltd and
                        Another</em> [1976] RPC 589 (“<em>Customglass
                        Boats</em>”) at 603, Mahon J in the Supreme Court of New
                    Zealand interpreted s 5 of the New Zealand Defamation Act 1954 (NZ), which
                    is <em>in pari materia</em> to our s 6 and the
                    original s 3 of the Defamation Act 1952 (c 66) (UK). Mahon J
                    similarly interpreted and held that “calculated” is equivalent to
                    “likely”. The New Zealand legislation has since been amended and
                    now speaks of the same in more direct terms (and consistently with the judicial
                    interpretation in <em>Customglass Boats</em>).
                    Section 5 of the Defamation Act 1992 (NZ) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In proceedings for slander of title, slander of goods, or other malicious
                        falsehood, it is not necessary to allege or prove special damage if the
                        publication of the mater that is the subject of the proceedings is <em>likely to cause</em> pecuniary loss to the plaintiff.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    If the provision applies, a plaintiff would
                    not need to prove specific pecuniary loss but instead the court will infer the
                    existence of such loss. The result is that the damages will be “at
                    large” (see <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at
                    para 40-013). In other words, even if the plaintiff is unable to bring
                    evidence to prove that he has <em>actually</em> suffered
                    the loss, that does not mean that he can recover only nominal damages as that
                    would be to render s 6(1) nugatory (see <em>Joyce v Sengupta
                        and Another</em> [1993] 1 WLR 337 at 346–347 and <em>WBG Network</em> at [86]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    For the same reasons we have adopted above
                    (at [105]), we cannot conclude that the words complained of in the present case
                    were likely to produce the result that the Appellant’s shares would be
                    rendered worthless. However, we accept that the sending of the Letters is one
                    which was likely to produce the result of pecuniary loss as pleaded at
                    para 26 of the Appellant’s statement of claim (see above at [103]).
                    We come to this conclusion bearing in mind, among other things, the context of
                    the listing exercise, the content of the Letters, and the fact that they were
                    sent so close to the proposed launch date of the IPO. In the circumstances, we
                    are satisfied that the Appellant’s claim in malicious falsehood in so far
                    as it relates to para 26 of his pleadings falls within
                        s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Defamation
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Actionability under Indonesian law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Whether the tort of malicious falsehood is
                    actionable under Indonesian law for the purposes of the double actionability
                    rule was not determined by the Judge in the light of his conclusion that the
                    tort was not made out under Singapore law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Mr Giam in the court below expressly
                    conceded in the course of cross-examining the Appellant’s expert witness
                    on Indonesian law, Dr Frans Hendra Winarta
                    (“Dr Winarta”), that what is known as malicious falsehood in
                    Singapore is actionable under Indonesian law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span>
                    Despite this, in his closing submissions below, the Respondent attempted to
                    argue otherwise. In the light of counsel’s concession, and the fact that
                    as a result, Dr Winarta was not cross-examined on his expert opinion on
                    this issue, we do not think that it is appropriate for the Respondent to now
                    attempt to row back from the position taken and argue that it is not actionable
                    under Indonesian law. We accordingly accept the conclusion that the tort of
                    malicious falsehood is actionable under Indonesian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion in respect of liability for malicious falsehood</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    In the light of malice and falsity having
                    been proven by the Appellant, and considering the causation of special damage in
                    the nature of the loss of opportunity to invest the money the Appellant would
                    have had had he been able to sell his vendor shares at the IPO having been
                    established, or, in the alternative, on the application of s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Defamation Act, we find that liability for
                    malicious falsehood is made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relief available under the malicious falsehood claim</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The Appellant is entitled to the special
                    damage as pleaded in para 26 of its statement of claim. In the alternative,
                    such damage in para 26 may be inferred pursuant to s 6(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Defamation Act and the Appellant is entitled
                    to an award on this basis. However, recovery is only allowed to the extent these
                    claims do not overlap: there should not be double recovery. These damages will
                    be assessed by a High Court judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    For the same reasons we decline to order an
                    injunction for the Appellant’s claim in defamation (see above at [101]),
                    we also do not think it necessary to order it under the claim in malicious
                    falsehood.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Declaration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    The Appellant seeks, in respect of his claim
                    in malicious falsehood, a declaration that the words complained of were false.
                    Specifically, he seeks a declaration that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the [Respondent] did not give money to the [Appellant] in 1995 or 1996 for
                        investment in the coal mining business as alleged by the [Respondent] in the
                        Defamatory Letters, and the [Respondent] is therefore not entitled to any
                        shares in PT Bayan Resources.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This issue was not dealt with by the Judge. The correct question to
                    ask first, in our view, is whether the relief of a declaration is available
                    under Singapore law in a claim such as the present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    The issue of whether a declaration of
                    falsity can be granted in a libel action was considered by the English High
                    Court in <em>Loutchansky v Times Newspapers Ltd
                        (No 6)</em> [2002] EMLR 44 (“<em>Loutchansky</em>”). Gray J concluded in the negative. The
                    facts of <em>Loutchansky</em> may be relevant to
                    understanding the decision. There, the claimant, Mr Loutchansky, sued for
                    libel and the defendant’s defence was that of qualified privilege,
                    specifically, the <em>Reynolds</em> privilege (<em>ie</em>, that established in English law in <em>Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd and others</em> [2001]
                    2 AC 127). He thus sought to amend his particulars of claim to seek a
                    declaration that the words complained of were false, saying that he had no
                    interest in concerning himself with the matters arising from a consideration of
                    the <em>Reynolds</em> privilege, but rather, wanted to
                    establish falsity to vindicate his reputation. Gray J (at [3]) gave four
                    reasons refusing permission to amend the particulars of claim. First, a
                    declaration may be granted only in respect of <em>an existing
                        legal right</em> (citing <em>Nixon v
                        Attorney-General</em> [1930] 1 Ch 566). Contrary to
                    Mr Loutchansky’s argument, there is no legal right to a good
                    reputation. Accordingly, there was no legal right to sustain the grant of a
                    declaration. Second, to grant a declaration of falsity even where the defendant
                    succeeded in their defence would subvert the balance sought to be maintained by
                    the defence. Third, there would be an opening of the floodgates, such that
                    newspapers would need to consider whether they, other than pleading the
                        <em>Reynolds</em> privilege, ought also to expend
                    monies defending a claim of falsity. Last, the court would be loath to grant a
                    declaration which may be used worldwide where evidence in relation to the truth
                    or falsity would not have been fully considered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    It is Gray J’s first reason which
                    is relevant to the analysis because the Appellant is seeking the declaration of
                    falsity on the basis of his claim in malicious falsehood and not defamation. It
                    is the position in Singapore as well that declaratory relief can only be granted
                    in respect of <em>legal rights</em> (see <em>Salijah bte Ab Latef v Mohd Irwan bin Abdullah Teo</em> [1995]
                    3 SLR(R) 233 (“<em>Salijah</em>”) at
                    [17], as approved by this Court in <em>Karaha Bodas Co LLC v
                        Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd and another appeal</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 112). If under the tort of defamation the Appellant cannot obtain
                    a declaration of falsity because there is no legal right to good reputation, we
                    likewise do not see how the Appellant can contrive a legal right capable of
                    supporting a grant of declaratory relief in a claim in malicious falsehood. In
                        <em>Jameel (Yousef) v Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc</em>
                    [2005] QB 946, the English Court of Appeal came to the same conclusion as the
                    High Court in <em>Loutchansky</em>. Lord Phillips of
                    Worth Matravers MR (at [67]) thought that at the end of a libel action, an
                    award of substantial damages provides vindication to the plaintiff, and so the
                    court does not have to make a declaration that the words complained of were
                    false. This reasoning in the context of defamation extends, in our view, to the
                    tort of malicious falsehood as well. The Appellant, succeeding in his claim in
                    malicious falsehood, a tort concerned with remedying the unlawful causing of
                    damage (see above at [104]), is fully compensated, leaving nothing requiring the
                    grant of a declaration of falsity. It is simply not sufficient for the Appellant
                    to say that declaration should be granted “to make clear to the
                    world” that what the Respondent alleged happened in 1995 or 1996 did not
                    happen and that the Respondent was not entitled to shares in
                        PT Bayan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> The Appellant’s reliance on
                        <em>Loudon v Ryder (No 2)</em> [1953] 1 Ch
                    423 (“<em>Loudon</em>”) where a declaration
                    was granted in an action for slander to title does not assist his case, as
                    there, in the specific context of slander to title (which is a specific species
                    of action and not the general action for malicious falsehood), the <em>legal right</em> in question was the <em>title
                        to property</em>, and it was that which supported the grant of a
                    declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    At common law, no such declaratory relief is
                    available in a claim for malicious falsehood generally.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Because declaratory relief is a
                    discretionary remedy, the court may not grant it where it will not give
                    “relief” in the real sense (see <em>Salijah</em> at [17]). Therefore, in addition to the above, it may be
                    useful to consider that there are several factors pointing towards the court
                        <em>not</em> granting declaratory relief in any event.
                    First, as noted, the Appellant’s reputation will be vindicated by an award
                    of damages for the torts of both defamation and malicious falsehood. Secondly,
                    in making out his claim in malicious falsehood, there is already a determination
                    of falsity by the court. Last, the Respondent’s counterclaim against the
                    Appellant for the shares in PT Bayan has already been litigated in this
                    action below and no appeal against the Judge’s dismissal of it was filed,
                    and so is <em>res judicata</em>, such that there is no need
                    to further protect the Appellant by way of a declaration of falsity to make
                    clear that the Respondent is not entitled to shares in Bayan. In contrast, in
                    the case of <em>Loudon</em>, the court found (at 428) that
                    the defendant was going to continue to make false assertions that the plaintiff
                    did not have title to her property – it was this which required the court
                    to make a declaration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    For all the reasons we have set out above,
                    we allow the appeal in so far as we find that the Respondent is liable in the
                    tort of defamation. However, we reject the appeal against the Judge’s
                    findings as to the natural and ordinary meanings of the words complained of. We
                    also find liability in malicious falsehood. The damages available to the
                    Appellant, under these two torts, to the extent that we have found are
                    claimable, will be assessed by a High Court judge. Taking into account the
                    conduct of these proceedings, we award the costs of the appeal and the costs of
                    the trial to the Appellant. These are to be taxed if not agreed. There will also
                    be the usual consequential orders.</p>
