On the 9 September 2015, Intraluck had submitted an application to United Overseas Bank Ltd (“UOB”) for clean invoice financing for the sum of US$60,415.51. This was supported by an arrival notice dated 28 August 2015 issued by Orient Overseas Container Line Limited, stating that Intraluck was to receive a shipment of aluminium products from Norinco New Energy Co Ltd under a bill of lading numbered “OOLU2564105080” (“BL080”). This application was approved and the funds were disbursed by UOB.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In respect of the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span>, the defence argued that there was no evidence that the appellant had submitted the applications for invoice financing with copies of BL080 or AN080, or that he had known or directed his staff to do so. The defence’s position was that it was the administrative duty of his staff (namely one Ms Cheah Yin Li and/or Ms Nah Xin Ying) to prepare the documents for either himself or Mdm Neo to sign.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The defence further argued that there was no evidence that the banks had been indeed been deceived into delivering the monies  stated in the invoices from the suppliers, as the specific officers processing the applications were not called or identified, and that the banks’ terms and conditions did not require either BL080 or AN080 to be provided as evidence of shipment.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> A key plank to the defence’s arguments at trial was the alleged practice of transhipment described by the appellant, whereby suppliers would ship goods from one country to another via a third country without physically passing through Singapore, and as no transport documents were provided, the applications for financing would have been submitted without any transport documents attached nor would it have been required.

This was implicitly recognised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Tang Yoke Kheng (trading as Niklex Supply Co) v Lek Benedict and others</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 263:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10 … What is clear is that dishonesty is an element of fraud. A trial judge must find dishonesty if he is to adjudge that there has been fraud. The burden of proving fraud in a civil case lies with the party alleging it, but the infusion of a shared criminal element (fraud) in civil proceedings tends to create some uncertainty as to the standard of proof required. The degree of proof is not as stringently required as it would be in a criminal case because it is accepted that the standard of proof in a civil case is that based on a balance of probabilities. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14   … There are, indisputably, only two standards of proof. For criminal cases, the standard is proof beyond reasonable doubt; for civil matters, the standard is that of a balance of probabilities, where, minimally, the party charged with the burden of proving will succeed if he can show just that little more evidence to tilt the balance. The prosecutor in a criminal case will have to furnish more evidence than just that little more to tilt the balance. So when fraud is the subject of a criminal trial, there is no difficulty appreciating what burden falls on the prosecutor. But since fraud can also be the subject of a civil claim, the civil standard of proving on a balance of probabilities must apply because there is no known “third standard” although such cases are usually known as “fraud in a civil case” as if alluding to a third standard of proof. However, because of the severity and potentially serious implications attaching to a fraud, even in a civil trial, judges are not normally satisfied by that little bit more evidence such as to tilt the “balance”. They normally require more. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Cheating and fraudulent misrepresentation both involve using some form of deception to convince another person into believing in something that was not true, in order to persuade that person to act to their detriment (or to the deceiving party’s benefit) in some way. Both are underscored by the element of dishonesty, and can often found to arise from the same set of facts. It is thus abundantly clear that in situations such as the present case, there can be civil liability coupled with criminal liability. However, it is not the case that just because civil remedies are available, that criminal culpability would not arise. The reason is simply that civil liability engendered in fraudulent misrepresentation is not meant to address the same issues that the offence of cheating seeks to punish. The former is a private action meant to compensate the innocent party, while the latter goes towards punishing behaviour that is not considered acceptable by society. This difference in criminal and civil liability is also apparent from the different standards of proof required. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Ratanlal &amp; Dhirajlal: The Indian Penal Code</span> vol 2 (H K Sema &amp; O P Garg eds) (LexisNexis, 34th Ed, 2018) have stated at p 2942, “[s]ometimes, the case may apparently look to be of a civil nature or may involve a commercial transaction but civil disputes or commercial disputes, in certain circumstances, may also contain ingredients of criminal offences and such disputes have to be entertained, notwithstanding, they are also civil disputes” (see also <span class="font-italic">Lee </span><span class="font-italic">Kun Hee and others v State of Uttar Pradesh and others</span> (2012) 3 SCC 132 at [26]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Accordingly, I found little merit in the appellant’s argument that the availability of civil remedies precludes the finding of criminal liability.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Deceiving a corporate body</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 As stated in <span class="font-italic">Gunasegeran s/o Pavadaisamy v Public Prosecutor</span> <br/>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 946 (“<span class="font-italic">Gunasegeran</span>”) at [40]–[44], the three elements comprising the offence of cheating punishable under s 420 of the Penal Code are that: </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Deception must have been practiced on the victim; </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) There was inducement such that the victim delivered any property to any person; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) There must be a dishonest or fraudulent intention on the part of the deceiving person to induce the victim to deliver the property.  </div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Section 11 of the Penal Code states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The word ‘person’ includes any company or association or body of persons, whether incorporated or not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 As the learned authors of Stanley Yeo, Neil Morgan and Chan Wing Cheong, <span class="font-italic">Criminal Law in Malaysia</span> <span class="font-italic">and Singapore </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2018) at para 14.67 have observed, reading s 11 with s 415 of the Penal Code would mean that a corporate entity can be the victim of cheating even if no human agent was in fact deceived. A company (or corporate body), as a legal construct, can only act through its officers, and is more than the sum of its parts. For example, the officer who receives and processes the applications, may not be the same officer who approves the applications. While it cannot be said that any one officer was deceived into believing something that was not true, and had consequently acted upon that deception, the onus will be on the Prosecution to show that the acts taken by the offender were such as to induce an action on the part of the corporate body, either as part of its internal protocol or management processes. In my view, such an interpretation would give effect to s 415 read with s 11 of the Penal Code. I am reinforced in my conclusion, having had sight of the following recent amendment to s 415 of the Penal Code in 2019: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Explanation 4.—A person that is a company or association or body of persons, whether incorporated or not, can be deceived for the purposes of this section, even though none of its individual officers, employees or agents is personally deceived.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Deception and inducement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 “Deception” has been defined as the inducing of a person to believe to be true something which the person making the representation knows is in fact false (see <span class="font-italic">Gunasegeran </span>at [42]; <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> <span class="font-italic">v Ong Eng Teck </span>[2012] SGHC 242 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 227 at [24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In the context of the deceiving a corporate body, as I have stated above at [26], where no particular human agent of the corporate body is identified, in order to show that the corporate body had “believed” the deception, it would be sufficient for the Prosecution to show that the corporate body’s processes were utilised to induce that corporate body to act in a manner that it would not have acted if the “representation” was not made.

The staff who faxed or sent the applications in were merely acting on his orders. Accordingly, I found no merit in this argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 To recapitulate, I was satisfied that pursuant to s 420 of the Penal Code, the appellant had cheated the six banks into disbursing the monies to the various suppliers as indicated by Intraluck, and the appeal against conviction was dismissed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The appeal against sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Global sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Applying the two-step analysis as set out in <span class="font-italic">Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 4 SLR 838 (“<span class="font-italic">Anne Gan</span>”) at [19], I first turn to consider if the individual sentences meted out by the DJ were manifestly excessive. In this regard, I was in broad agreement with the DJ that the primary sentencing consideration was that of general deterrence, and the underlying need to protect the integrity and reputation of Singapore’s financial services. In my view, the DJ had correctly considered the relevant offence-specific factors, which were: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The large sum of monies involved in the six charges, totalled up to US$622,783.95; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The extent of planning involved in arranging the various applications.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In addition, while Intraluck did eventually pay back all the monies disbursed by the banks in consequence of the acts of cheating, it was entirely fortuitous that no loss was in fact suffered by the various banks. If any of the purported transhipment transactions had fallen through, the banks would have found themselves in a difficult position of having no actual goods to turn to recoup their losses if the appellant himself did not have sufficient funds to pay them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Bearing in mind the sums involved and the fact that no actual loss was caused to the banks, the DJ’s starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment in respect of each of the five charges involving amounts less than US$100,000, was not manifestly excessive. The indicative sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment in respect of the charge involving an amount of US$162,673.44 also cannot be said to have been manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I turned next to consider the overall sentence, with due regard to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle (see <span class="font-italic">Anne Gan</span> at [18]). As the charges involved separate incidents involving separate banks, the DJ’s decision to run three of the sentences consecutively did not contravene the one-transaction rule. The starting aggregate sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment was also broadly consistent with the relevant case precedents, and would be proportionate to the entirety of the criminal behaviour in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 While the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Anne Gan</span> does not specifically provide for the consideration of ill health as an offender-specific factor, the court in <span class="font-italic">Chew Soo Chun </span>appeared to implicitly accept that ill health can be a reason for the court to further downward adjust the sentence to take into account an offender’s condition where it would cause undue hardship to the offender in the event that he is incarcerated. In my view, and bearing in mind the observations in <span class="font-italic">Chew Soo Chun</span> at [44] that judicial mercy is not consistent with the principle of proportionality, this would logically be an exercise that is taken over and above the <span class="font-italic">Anne Gan</span> framework.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicability of the appellant’s ill health</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As stated by the three judge coram of the High Court <span class="font-italic">in Chew Soo Chun </span>at [38]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In summary, ill health is relevant to sentencing in two ways. First, it is a ground for the exercise of judicial mercy. Judicial mercy is an exceptional recourse available for truly exceptional cases and which will likely result in an exceptional sentence. Where mercy is exercised, the court is compelled by humanitarian considerations arising from the exceptional circumstances to order the minimum imprisonment term or a non-custodial sentence where appropriate. Secondly, it exists as a mitigating factor. The cases where ill health will be regarded as a mitigating factor include those which do not fall within the realm of the exceptional but involve markedly disproportionate impact of an imprisonment term on an offender by reason of his ill health. The court takes into account the fact that ill health may render an imprisonment term that will not otherwise be crushing to one offender but may be so to another, and attenuates the sentence accordingly for the latter offender so that it will not be disproportionate to his culpability and physical condition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In determining which category of relevance to sentencing an offender’s ill health would fall into, the court necessarily should look into the evidence of the offender’s ill health (if any), as well as the ability of the prison authorities to address the offender’s health needs. On the facts, the evidence of the appellant’s medical condition was not disputed, and I accepted that the offender’s ill health (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, CMML) was a relevant issue for consideration in sentencing. However, as noted by the DJ, the prison authorities were also prepared to offer an adequate system of healthcare to manage the appellant’s medical condition.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Turning first to consider whether judicial mercy should be exercised, I was in agreement with the DJ that there were significant countervailing public interest considerations which favoured punishment, in view of the extent of cheating carried out by the appellant and the sums of money involved. While the appellant does suffer from a terminal illness, as stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">VDZ v VEA</span> [2020] 2 SLR 858 at [70], “myriad considerations must be factored into each sentencing equation as and when it arises for evaluation, with judicial mercy only being granted in limited and exceptional circumstances.” Accordingly, it was also my view, that the present case was not one in which judicial mercy ought to be exercised. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Next, I turn to consider if the appellant’s ill health was a relevant mitigating factor. As set out by the court in <span class="font-italic">Chew Soo Chun</span> at [30]–[33], ill health can have a mitigating effect on a sentence by directly decreasing the culpability of the offender, or by causing imprisonment to have a disproportionate impact on the offender. Similar to <span class="font-italic">Chew Soo Chun</span>, the present case was more concerned with the latter effect, and the question was whether the appellant faced far greater suffering than the usual hardship in serving a term of imprisonment. In my view, the DJ was justified in finding that it was likely that imprisonment would have a disproportionate impact on the appellant. To be clear, the prison authorities had specifically declined to comment on this. The reduction of six months’ imprisonment afforded to the appellant was entirely appropriate on the facts, as well as broadly consonant with the similar factual matrix found in <span class="font-italic">Chew Soo Chun</span>. All things considered, the final sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment could not be said to be manifestly excessive. I therefore dismissed the appeal against sentence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In summary, it was clear from the evidence in the record of proceedings that the elements of the offence of cheating were proven beyond reasonable doubt, and that the DJ had rightly considered the appropriate aggravating and mitigating factors in coming to a global sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment.
