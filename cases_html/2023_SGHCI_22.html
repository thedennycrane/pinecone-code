The Majority concluded that the defendant had a valid claim against the plaintiff for breach of contract under the Provisional Contract with respect to the plaintiff’s delivery of defective Material Packages, which constituted incomplete performance under Art X of the Code.

The latter pillar (the “fair hearing rule”) is also found in Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the Model Law which provides that an arbitral award may be set aside by the court if any party was unable to present his case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It is well established that the failure by an arbitral tribunal to address an issue submitted to it for decision can constitute a breach of the fair hearing rule: <span class="font-italic">CKH v CKG and another matter</span> [2022] 2 SLR 1 (“<span class="font-italic">CKH</span>”) at [12], citing <span class="font-italic">Front Row Investment Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Daimler South East Asia Pte Ltd</span> [2010] SGHC 80 and <span class="font-italic">AKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals </span>[2015] 3 SLR 488 (“<span class="font-italic">AKN</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In <span class="font-italic">CKH</span>, the Court of Appeal also emphasised the following (at [14]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There is an important distinction between making a decision on an issue (which may be right or wrong) and failing to consider an issue at all; it is only the latter which may lead to court intervention.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There must be shown to be a causal nexus between the breach and the award.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The breach must have prejudiced the aggrieved party’s rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 A breach of the fair hearing rule can also arise from the tribunal’s chain of reasoning. To comply with the fair hearing rule, the tribunal’s chain of reasoning must be: (a) one which the parties had reasonable notice that the tribunal could adopt; and (b) one which has a sufficient nexus to the parties’ arguments. A party has reasonable notice of a particular chain of reasoning (and of the issues forming the links in that chain) if: (i) it arose from the parties’ pleadings; (ii) it arose by reasonable implication from their pleadings; (iii) it is unpleaded but arose in some other way in the arbitration and was reasonably brought to the party’s actual notice; or (iv) it flows reasonably from the arguments actually advanced by either party or is related to those arguments. See <span class="font-italic">BZW</span><span class="font-italic"> and another v BZV</span> [2022] 1 SLR 1080 (“<span class="font-italic">BZW</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [60(b)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The overriding burden is on the applicant to show that a reasonable litigant in his shoes could not have foreseen the possibility of the reasoning of the type revealed in the award.

There, the plaintiff referred to Art 2.2.1 in support of its case that it was clear that the intention from the very beginning was to transfer the rights and obligations in the Provisional Contract to the Contractor and that the plaintiff’s core obligation was towards the Contractor, not the defendant.

</div> We do not think that is correct. In its ordinary meaning, the word “uncontentious” means not “likely to cause disagreement”: Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of Current English (Oxford University Press, 5th ed, 1995) at p 249. All that the Majority did in para 376 of the Final Award was to express its view that at the time the Provisional Contract was entered into, the plaintiff’s obligations under the Provisional Contract were owed to the defendant, and that this view should not give rise to argument. The Majority was not saying that this view was undisputed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The Majority was aware of the plaintiff’s argument that there were no effective rights or obligations until the Contractor was appointed. In the Final Award, the Majority had noted that the defendant “reject[ed] the [plaintiff’s] proposition that Article 1.1 had no effect until it was ‘actualised’ by the Transfer Agreement.”

In our view, the plaintiff’s complaints about the Majority’s chain of reasoning would be more appropriately framed as complaints of breach of natural justice (see [60] above), but none of the points made by the Tribunal went outside the range that could be expected when construing contractual provisions and comparing the terms of related agreements which were linked to the Transfer Agreement.

These Articles were cited as examples that illustrated how the expression “[defendant/Contractor]”, which was present in the Provisional Contract, was changed into “[defendant]” or “[Contractor]” when the change was needed. In contrast, Art 1.1 of the Supply Agreement retained the same language found in Art 1.1 of the Provisional Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiff submitted that the Majority had considered the use of the term “[defendant/Contractor]” in Arts 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 22.8.1 and 12.3.1 of the Supply Contract without hearing any arguments. It is true that these Articles were not specifically referred to in the course of the Arbitration.

The gist of the Insolvency Argument was that the plaintiff’s interpretation of the Transfer Agreement meant that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the defendant no longer had any payment obligation under Art 1.1 of the Provisional Contract; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) consequently, if the plaintiff terminated the Provisional Contract upon the Contractor’s insolvency, the plaintiff would not have recourse to the defendant when it most needs to have such recourse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The plaintiff submitted that the suggestion that the defendant had a payment obligation that survived the Transfer Agreement was not pleaded or argued. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 We accept that the Insolvency Argument was not pleaded or argued. However, to succeed on this ground, the plaintiff has to show that the Majority’s consideration of the Insolvency Argument had prejudiced its rights. We are not persuaded that the plaintiff’s rights have been prejudiced. The Insolvency Argument was one of several reasons given by the Majority in support of its interpretation of the Transfer Agreement. It is abundantly clear to us that even if the plaintiff had been invited to respond to, and was successful in rebutting, the Insolvency Argument, that would not have made a difference to the Majority’s interpretation of the Transfer Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Article 22.8 of the Supply Contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The Majority noted how Art 22.8 was treated in the Attachment (see [62(i)] above). Article 22.8 of the Provisional Contract provided that upon request by the defendant, the plaintiff was to provide an auditing certificate (to verify the comparability of the contract prices) to the “[<span class="font-italic">defendant/Contractor</span>]”. The Attachment clarified that Art 22.8 “shall apply to the [defendant] and [the plaintiff] only”.

The Majority did not make any finding that the Attachment was capable of amending the Supply Contract.

More importantly, the Majority’s statement clearly meant that the language in Art 22.8 of the Supply Contract was modified from that found in Art 22.8 of the Provisional Contract to reflect the clarification in the Attachment.

In our view, the Majority was referring to the parties’ submissions on the interpretation of the expression “[defendant/Contractor]” generally. The issue before the Tribunal was the interpretation of the Transfer Agreement, specifically, what were the rights and obligations that remained with the defendant. In connection with this, comparisons were made between specific Articles in the Provisional Contract and the Supply Contract to see how the expression “[defendant/Contractor]” had changed. It was in this context that para 461 of the Final Award considered certain specific Articles. It is clear to us that the parties’ submissions about the interpretation of the expression “[defendant/Contractor]” generally was relevant. After all, para 461 of the Final Award was part of the Majority’s explanation of “how its analysis interact[ed] with other aspects of the contractual framework.”

The calls and the 8 October 2021 email evidenced Prof Kim’s unhappiness with Dr Habegger’s dissemination of the Dissent, contrary to the ICC’s position that the Dissent should not form part of the Final Award. Further, the dissemination of the Dissent, the calls and the 8 October 2021 email were events that took place after the Final Award had been issued. We do not see how the calls and the 8 October 2021 email can be said to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias. We note as well that the plaintiff’s reliance on the agreed procedure in cl 5.8 of the Procedural Order No 1 (Amended 11 May 2020) (see [105(b)] above) was erroneous.
