AVS was survived by the plaintiff and the couple’s two sons and two daughters, all of whom are adults. It is not in dispute that the beneficiaries of the estate of AVS (“the Estate”) are the plaintiff and her four children (“the beneficiaries”). It is also undisputed that, under s 7 of the Intestate Succession Act (Cap 146, 2013 Rev Ed), the plaintiff is entitled to a 50% share in the Estate. Despite having made the relevant application on 29 July 2016, the plaintiff has yet to obtain the grant of letters of administration. The plaintiff’s eldest daughter, Chandana Anil Salgaocar, has filed a caveat against her application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 During his lifetime, AVS was a businessman engaged in a wide range of business interests across several jurisdictions. One of these business interests was Million Dragon Wealth Ltd (“MDWL”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”). AVS was the sole director and sole shareholder of MDWL. MDWL is, in turn, the sole shareholder of 22 BVI-incorporated companies (“the 22 subsidiaries”). AVS was also the sole director of the 22 subsidiaries. Each of the 22 subsidiaries owns a single unit in Newton Imperial, a condominium located in Singapore (collectively, “the 22 units”). These units are leased out to tenants. The rental income is paid to an escrow account held for MDWL as clients.

It is worth noting that at the time of AVS’ passing, the defendant had been working as the CEO of MDWL for about one and a half years. After the death of AVS, the defendant continued to act as the CEO of MDWL. MDWL was placed under receivership by a BVI court on 27 July 2016. The court-appointed receivers (“the Receivers”) terminated the defendant’s services as CEO on 10 August 2016 but subsequently appointed the defendant as a consultant to MDWL on 26 August 2016, with his appointment back-dated to 10 August 2016.

The relevance of this point will become clearer below. It is noted that the plaintiff’s claim is only in respect of MDWL and the 22 subsidiaries.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 30 June 2016, Shanmuga commenced High Court Suit No 689 of 2016 (“Suit 689”) against the Estate, SVE and Africean. By Suit 689, Shanmuga claimed that AVS had agreed to indemnify him from and against all liability arising in connection with certain arbitration proceedings. The amount claimed was very substantial. In connection with this claim, Shanmuga applied for an injunction restraining the defendants from dealing in certain assets up to the value of his claim (“the Singapore Injunction Application”). SVE and Africean were made defendants on the back of the claim that they were effectively used as the “personal wallets” of AVS.

The BVI freezing order application was brought in support of Suit 689 in Singapore. I pause to note that under BVI law, it is possible to obtain injunctive relief in support of foreign proceedings.

</div> Apart from the claim for breach of trust, the rest of the plaintiff’s pleaded causes of action are largely based on the same set of particulars: factual allegations relating to the defendant’s conduct around and after the time of AVS’ passing. Essentially, the plaintiff’s case was that the defendant acted in concert with Shanmuga to deprive the Estate of its assets by, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, misappropriating or seeking to misappropriate the rental income of the 22 subsidiaries of MDWL. As such, the assets of MDWL are purportedly “in jeopardy” due to the defendant’s conduct.

The MDWL documents had been seized by Sonali Sameer Salgaocar (“Sonali”), the director of SVE and the daughter-in-law of the plaintiff and AVS. Sonali deposed on affidavit that she “promptly retrieved” these documents from MDWL’s shared office premises with SVE “to prevent the defendant from getting access to them”.

</div> For context, reserve directors and deemed directors are creatures of statute under the British Virgin Islands Business Companies Act 2004 (No 16 of 2004) (“the BVI BCA”).

However, Mr Magintharan maintained that the defendant was also a “deemed director” under Section 109(6) of the BVI BCA, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) If at any time a company does not have a director, any person who manages, or who directs or supervises the management of, the business and affairs of the company is <span class="font-weight-bold">deemed to be a director</span> of the company for the purposes of this Act.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The defendant contends that as the deemed director, he was entitled to commence DC 2302, to enter into a tenancy agreement in respect of one of the 22 units (see [15(c)] above) and to direct the tenants of the 22 units to pay their rentals into the N&amp;M escrow account. With regard to the escrow arrangements, specifically, the defendant argues that it was necessary to set up the N&amp;M escrow account because Haridass was refusing to issue payments from the Haridass escrow account which were necessary for the operations of the subsidiaries and MDWL.

The defendant also denies that he “engineered” or “procured” his appointment as a consultant by the court-appointed Receivers of MDWL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The defendant further argues that he neither had a “close relationship” with NSMPL nor any involvement in the charter parties issued from Winter Meadow to NSMPL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Finally, in respect of the plaintiff’s claim for breach of trust, the defendant’s position is that AVS had handed the defendant his ATM card and the passcode, and had authorised the defendant to make deductions and reimbursements from his personal bank account as necessary. The defendant further claims that he had withdrawn the sum of $10,000 for the purpose of paying for AVS’ medical and funeral expenses, in the presence of AVS’ children and with the plaintiff’s acknowledgement.

The court was also given to understand that the BVI freezing order had been discontinued, but the Receivers had not yet been discharged because the matter of their fees had not been settled.

The defendant relied in the alternative on the inherent jurisdiction of the court. In an affidavit deposed in support of the striking out application, the defendant stated that the plaintiff “did not possess the capacity to act for the Estate” because she had not been duly appointed as an administrator of the Estate. The defendant also argued that since the assets (the 22 units and rental income) in question belong to MDWL and its subsidiaries, and not to the Estate, the correct party to bring this action was the Receivers, and not the plaintiff. Finally, the defendant alleged that the plaintiff had commenced the present Suit only to circumvent her inability to obtain the grant of letters of administration, with a view to gaining absolute control of the assets and property of MDWL and the 22 subsidiaries.

Even on the basis that the plaintiff had commenced this action as a beneficiary of the Estate, the Estate could be in no better a position than AVS himself would be if he were alive. If AVS were alive, he himself would not be able to sue the defendant for any wrongful dealings with the assets and property of MDWL or its subsidiaries, because AVS, MDWL and its subsidiaries were all separate legal entities. The assets and property had not automatically vested in the Estate upon AVS’ passing.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff had relied on the case of <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy (administratrix of the estate of Theng Chee Kim, deceased) v Soo Ah Choy </span>[1996] 3 SLR(R) 27 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>”). That was a case in which the Court of Appeal held that a beneficiary of an unadministered estate who had yet to extract letters of administration was entitled, in certain circumstances, to institute action to recover assets belonging to the estate. However, <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span> was distinguishable because the plaintiff there had already obtained the grant of letters of administration. Further, the claim in that case was that the respondent was holding the property on trust for the <span class="font-italic">deceased</span>, as opposed to the present case where the property is held in the name of the 22 <span class="font-italic">subsidiaries</span>, and not in the name of the deceased.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ arguments on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On appeal, the plaintiff argued that she had standing to bring this action as a beneficiary of the estate.

The AR had relied on the proper plaintiff rule, but that rule and its variant, the reflective loss principle, were subject to exceptions. On the authority of <span class="font-italic">Hengwell Development Pte Ltd v Thing Chiang Ching </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 454, a shareholder is not prohibited from suing in respect of a loss suffered by a company if there is no risk of double recovery.

</div> As such, AVS himself, and by extension, “the estate (represented by the beneficiary)” should be entitled to sue to protect the assets of the Estate. The plaintiff further claimed that there have been many instances in which the defendant himself had treated MDWL and its assets as being part of the Estate. Thus, the defendant could not now take an inconsistent position by relying on MDWL’s separate legal personality to dispute the plaintiff’s right to bring this action.

</div> The proper plaintiff to bring such an action would instead be the Receivers, or the company itself.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Broadly speaking, the issue to be determined was whether the AR was right to have struck out the plaintiff’s writ and statement of claim on the basis that the plaintiff lacked <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span><span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)">.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span>In this regard, the parties’ arguments were almost entirely focused on the following question: where an intestate deceased was the sole shareholder of a company in his lifetime, does a beneficiary of that deceased who has not yet obtained the grant of letters of administration have <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring an action to recover, preserve or protect property which belongs to that company or its subsidiaries? This line of argument was clearly based on, first, the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>line of authorities, which confers a beneficiary with the right to recover, preserve or protect the assets of an estate where special circumstances exist, and secondly, the exceptions to the proper plaintiff rule in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle</span>. Apart from this issue, the plaintiff also made brief written submissions on the claim for breach of trust (see [33] above). Thus based on the arguments raised before me, the issues to be determined were:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the plaintiff had <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue <span class="font-italic">qua </span>beneficiary and for the benefit of the Estate under the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>line of authorities; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether the plaintiff had <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue the defendant in respect of the claim for breach of trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Having dealt with these two issues, I will conclude my analysis on RA 13 with some observations. As I will explain, my decision was made purely on the basis that the plaintiff has chosen to frame her claim as no more and no less than “an action to recover, preserve or protect” the assets of the Estate. That, presumably, is why the arguments were so heavily focused on the applicability of the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>line of authorities. In my view, if the plaintiff had framed her claim differently, the issue of <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>could have been decided based on different considerations and it may be that the plaintiff would have been found to have <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> at least in respect of <span class="font-italic">some</span> of her pleaded causes of action. Even then, however, I would have reached the same conclusion and upheld the AR’s decision to strike out the plaintiff’s claim <span class="font-italic">in toto</span>, for reasons I will explain below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on striking out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It is settled law that the power to strike out a claim is considered a “draconian” one (<span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Weng v Lim Jit Ming Bryan and another </span>[2012] 1 SLR 457 at [110]) which should only be invoked in plain and obvious<span class="font-italic"> </span>cases (<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<span class="font-italic">Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [18]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 With respect to O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules, the words “frivolous or vexatious” have been interpreted to refer to cases which are “obviously unsustainable or wrong” (see <span class="font-italic">Riduan bin Yusof v Khng Thian Huat and another </span>[2005] 2 SLR(R) 188 at [29], citing <span class="font-italic">Afro-Asia Shipping Co (Pte) Ltd v Haridass Ho &amp; Partners </span>[2003] 2 SLR(R) 491 at [22]).

Shortly before, however, Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) had forerun <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span> in the case of <span class="font-italic">Omar Ali </span>in 1995. The plaintiffs in that case were the children of a man who had died intestate, and the beneficiaries of his estate. The deceased had been entitled in his lifetime to the unexpired term of a 999-year leasehold interest in a Singapore property. The first four defendants were the trustees of the estate of the reversion holder of the property. They purported to terminate the lease of the property, and purported to sell the unexpired term of the leasehold interest to the fifth defendant without the plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent. The plaintiffs thus commenced proceedings seeking a declaration that the unexpired residue of the leasehold interest in the property vested in the estate of the intestate deceased, as well as a declaration that the purported sale was null and void. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs had no <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>; no one had the legal authority to act on behalf of the estate because letters of administration had not been granted to anyone.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Chao J disagreed and held that the plaintiffs had <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring the action (<span class="font-italic">Omar Ali </span>at [28]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Here the plaintiffs are not in the position of residual legatees. Neither are they suing in a representative capacity. They come as beneficiaries of the estate of the intestate seeking a declaration that the property (the unexpired term of the leasehold interest) belongs to the estate. They do not seek to claim any asset for themselves. They clearly have an equity in the estate as demonstrated in the Australian case <span class="font-italic">Re Atkinson, deceased </span>[1971] VR 612…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Chao J cited the following remarks from <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Atkinson, deceased </span>[1971] VR 612 (<span class="font-italic">“Re Atkinson, deceased</span>”) at p 617:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The basis of such proceedings is they are taken on behalf of the estate and if they are successful, they can only result in the lost property being restored to the estate for use in the due course of administration.

The plaintiff in that case claimed to be the lawful widow of the deceased, Theng, having married him in 1952. The defendant was the second wife whom Theng had married in 1964. After Theng passed away, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking a declaration that certain property which was in the name of the defendant was held on trust for the deceased. Since the properties had been sold, the claim was directed at the proceeds of the sale. The defendant applied to the High Court to strike out the plaintiff’s writ of summons and statement of claim, arguing that the plaintiff lacked <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue in her capacity as administratrix as she had yet to extract the letters of administration. Even when the plaintiff subsequently sought to bring the action in her capacity as a beneficiary of the estate, the claim was struck out in the High Court. On appeal, however, the Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff had <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to bring the claim. The Court set out the following principles:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The beneficiaries of an unadministered estate have no equitable or beneficial interest in any particular asset comprised in an unadministered estate (at [11]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, in certain special circumstances, the beneficiary may institute an action to recover the assets of the estate (at [12]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) What may constitute  “special circumstances” depends on all the circumstances of each case, including the nature of the assets, the position of the personal representative, the reason for the default of the personal representative, or whether any circumstances made it “impossible or at least seriously inconvenient for the representatives to take proceedings” (at [27]–[28]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>, the court found that “special circumstances” existed because the plaintiff had already done all she could to obtain the letters of administration, but had been prevented by circumstances not within her control from extracting the grant of administration. The beneficiary had in fact obtained grant of letters of administration but was unable to extract the grant because she had not been able to obtain the necessary clearance from the Commissioner of Estate Duty (at [30]). These “special circumstances” entitled her to bring the action <span class="font-italic">qua </span>beneficiary and on behalf of the beneficiaries of the estate of Theng (at [35]–[36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Both <span class="font-italic">Omar Ali </span>and <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>were subsequently considered in the 2009 decision of <span class="font-italic">Ching Chew Weng </span>by Steven Chong JC (as he then was). <span class="font-italic">Ching Chew Weng </span>was a case in which the plaintiff brought an action against the defendants, claiming that they held certain shares either on trust for him, or, in the alternative, on trust for his deceased’s father’s estate. With regard to the latter alternative, the fourth defendant claimed that the plaintiff had no <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to seek a transfer of the shares to the estate because he was not entitled to act in place of the executors of his father’s estate. Citing <span class="font-italic">Omar Ali </span>and <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy,</span> Chong JC concluded that the plaintiff had <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>, and further that he was not confined to declaratory reliefs and may claim <span class="font-italic">any </span>reliefs on behalf of the estate (at [58]-[59]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">58 What [<span class="font-italic">Omar Ali </span>and <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>] establish is that the beneficiary is not confined to declaratory reliefs. They are able to claim any reliefs on behalf of the estate. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">59 I, therefore, determine that the plaintiff has the <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to seek an order that the Trust Assets be transferred to the estate and the consequential orders to account for dividends, income, interest and other payments, if any, to the estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The plaintiff thus urged me to find, on the strength of these authorities, that she was entitled to bring this cause of action as a beneficiary and for the benefit of the other beneficiaries of the Estate. Apart from these local decisions, another case cited and heavily relied on by the plaintiff was an English decision, <span class="font-italic">Caudle v LD Law Ltd </span>[2008] 1 WLR 1540 (“<span class="font-italic">Caudle</span>”). <span class="font-italic">Caudle </span>was slightly different from the local cases discussed above insofar as it specifically concerned the issue of <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>for a claim in conversion, which, I note, was also one of the causes of action pleaded by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Caudle</span> was a man whose former wife had died intestate, leaving their 11-year-old son as the sole beneficiary of her estate. The deceased’s parents consulted the defendant company, a law firm which had provided legal services to the deceased when she divorced the plaintiff and which had an outstanding judgment debt against the deceased. The deceased’s parents also handed the defendant certain papers which were believed to include the deceased’s death certificate, bank statements, credit card statements, wage slips, utility and other bills, and documents relating to her insurance policies, pension plan and other assets (“the papers”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the defendant to tell them that he intended to apply for letters of administration as his son’s legal representative, and to ask the defendant to deliver up the papers. The defendant refused, asserting that it had a lien over the papers in respect of the judgment debt. The question was whether or not the claimant, as the person entitled to the grant of letters of administration, was entitled to immediate possession of the papers and entitled to bring an action for wrongful interference with them, notwithstanding the fact that he had not obtained any letters of administration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Wyn Williams J held as follows (<span class="font-italic">Caudle </span>at [36]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is clear, in my judgment, that a person who is entitled to the grant of letters of administration <span class="font-italic">has an immediate right to possession of personal property formerly owned by a deceased </span>if it is necessary that he takes possession to safeguard the estate. As I have found, such a person also has the right to take legal action to enforce that right.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I took special notice of these remarks concerning “an immediate right to possession” because, as mentioned, one of the plaintiff’s pleaded causes of action is in the tort of conversion. It is well established that, in order to have <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue in conversion, a plaintiff must have actual possession or a right to immediate possession of the property in question (<span class="font-italic">Antariksa Logistics Pte Ltd and others v McTrans Cargo (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2012] 4 SLR 250 at [44]). There was no suggestion that the plaintiff had actual possession of either the rental income or the MDWL documents at the material time. The rental income has at all material times been paid into escrow accounts maintained on behalf of MDWL as client. As for the MDWL documents, it appears they were in the possession of MDWL until such time they were taken into the possession of Sonali and/or SVE, against whom DC 2302 was commenced (see [15(a)] above). Since the plaintiff did not have actual possession of the MDWL documents or rental income, the only way in which the plaintiff could have <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue in conversion was if she had the right to immediate possession. I thus considered whether the plaintiff might be able to establish such a right by bringing herself within the principle in <span class="font-italic">Caudle</span>. As I shall explain, however, I found that <span class="font-italic">Caudle</span>, like all of the other cases in the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>line of authorities, was inapplicable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span> line of authorities is inapplicable to the present case</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 What is clear about the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>line of authorities is that none of these cases involves a beneficiary seeking to assert an interest in income or assets which belongs <span class="font-italic">to a company</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Omar Ali</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the claim was that the leasehold interest in question had belonged to the deceased and had vested in the estate upon his death. In <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy,</span> the claim was that the defendant’s property was held on a resulting trust for the deceased, and thereby the sale proceeds were held by the respondent on a resulting trust for the estate. In <span class="font-italic">Ching Chew Weng</span>, the claim was that the defendants held shares on trust for the estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The present case is different. The plaintiff is seeking “an account of all money due to the beneficiaries of the Estate which was received by the defendant” and “a declaration that the defendant is personally liable to make good all sums received by him as trustee or agent for the beneficiaries of the Estate”, but it is clear that the claims are based on allegations that the defendant has dealt with the funds and assets of <span class="font-italic">MDWL and its 22 subsidiaries </span>without authority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Unlike <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>and <span class="font-italic">Ching Chew Weng</span>, what stands between the beneficiaries of the Estate and the MDWL documents, rental income and the 22 units themselves is not a trust but the corporate forms of MDWL and the 22 subsidiaries. Indeed, in her own statement of claim, the plaintiff’s complaint under “Conversion” is that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…the Defendant has converted the property <span class="font-italic">of MDWL and/or the 22 BVI companies and/or procured the transfer the property </span>[<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] <span class="font-italic">of MDWL and/or the 22 BVI companies </span>to himself and/or Shanmuga and on either or both of their directions …

</div> which are legal entities separate from AVS. The title in the 22 units and the rental income they generate did not belong to AVS, nor have they vested in the Estate by virtue of AVS’ passing. The plaintiff’s claim that the defendant has “deprived the Estate of its Assets” and “dissipate[d] or siphon[ed] the assets of AVS including the rental income of the 22 BVI companies” is therefore incorrect. Strictly speaking, the assets of the Estate are only the assets that belonged to AVS prior to his demise – the shares in MDWL. Even upon the grant of letters of administration, the administrator will not automatically gain title to the 22 units or to their rental income. He or she will instead gain title to the <span class="font-italic">shares</span> which, upon distribution, will entitle the beneficiaries to participate in the company as shareholders. They may then gain control of (and eventually, title to) the assets and income of MDWL, for example, by resolving to liquidate the company and distributing its assets. Their entitlement to deal with the assets and income of MDWL (including the rental income) would of course be subject to any competing claims or applicable rules of company law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Thus, an application of the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>authorities can only bring the plaintiff so far as entitling her to sue to recover, protect or preserve the <span class="font-italic">shares </span>in MDWL, but not MDWL’s income or assets.<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>I note that the plaintiff has tried to get around this by arguing that MDWL’s assets were in substance AVS’ assets.

</div> The argument hangs very much on the fact that Shanmuga had sought a BVI freezing order in respect of MDWL’s assets to support his claim for an oral indemnity which AVS gave him personally. The plaintiff says this shows that Shanmuga treated MDWL as the corporate manifestation or the alter ego of AVS. Further, the plaintiff argues that the defendant cannot now take an inconsistent position from Shanmuga by arguing that MDWL and AVS are separate legal entities, because he filed an affidavit in support of Shanmuga’s BVI freezing order application in which he stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is my understanding that the shares held by Million Dragon in the Million Dragon Subsidiaries were held by Million Dragon as nominee or on trust for Mr Salgaocar as beneficial owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I pause to note that what the defendant says in the quote above is that the <span class="font-italic">shares </span>in the 22 subsidiaries were held on trust for AVS as beneficial owner. He does <span class="font-italic">not </span>say that MDWL’s rental income or the subsidiaries’ assets are AVS’ assets. I was also unpersuaded by arguments that the defendant must be estopped from approbating and reprobating because he has pursued a counterclaim in this action in which he sues the plaintiff as the executor or representative of AVS’ estate.

</div> The key portion of the defence and counterclaim states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Further and <span class="font-italic">in the alternative</span>, <span class="font-italic">if which is denied</span>, the Defendants [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] is held liable to the Plaintiff, he will seek to set-off against sum awarded to the Defendant in his counterclaim in diminution or to extinguish the Plaintiffs [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] claim.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I do not think that the defendant can be faulted for having pursued the counterclaim in the <span class="font-italic">alternative</span>. Neither this counterclaim nor the fact that the defendant filed an affidavit in support of Shanmuga’s BVI freezing order application provided sufficient reason to simply disregard the separate legal identity of MDWL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Quite apart from any positions Shanmuga or the defendant may have taken in other proceedings, the point remains that the property and the profits of a company, even a single-shareholder-cum-single-director company like MDWL, belong to the company, and not to its shareholder (<span class="font-italic">Lee v Lee’s Air Farming Ltd </span>[1961] 1 AC 12 at p 30). There being no basis for treating AVS’ assets as MDWL’s assets, I do not think the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>line of authorities will assist the plaintiff to obtain the reliefs she seeks. Indeed, there is the further question (on which I make no decision) as to how much weight should be attached to the fact that in <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span> letters of administration had in fact been granted already to the beneficiary. I note however that in <span class="font-italic">Omar Ali</span>, Chao J (as he then was) made the following statement at [31]: “Of course in the present case, no letters of administration to the estate of the intestate have yet been granted to anyone. But I did not think this difference was in any way material ...”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For similar reasons, I found that the plaintiff could not rely on <span class="font-italic">Caudle </span>to establish <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue in conversion. As is clear from the quote at [51] above, the principle in <span class="font-italic">Caudle</span> is limited to “personal property formerly owned<span class="font-italic"> by a deceased</span>” [emphasis added]. It does not allow the plaintiff to bring an action for conversion in respect of property belonging to MDWL and/or the 22 subsidiaries.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">The exceptions to the proper plaintiff rule do not assist the plaintiff</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In urging this court to find that the plaintiff has the requisite <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue in respect of MDWL’s property, the plaintiff has argued at length that there are exceptions to the proper plaintiff rule in <span class="font-italic">Foss v Harbottle</span> which are applicable to the present case. In particular, the plaintiff emphasises that there is no risk of double recovery because “the Estate is the only shareholder” in MDWL, and there is no risk of prejudice to creditors because allegedly there are none (no evidence was offered in support of this claim). In any event, the plaintiff argued, whether there would be a breach of the rule against reflective loss is a fact-sensitive matter that can only be determined at trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 What the plaintiff is essentially seeking to do is to combine the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>line of authorities with the exceptions to the proper plaintiff rule into a new principle. The “principle” the plaintiff contends for might be stated as follows: As an extension from <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>, a beneficiary may sue to recover not only the assets of an Estate, but also to recover <span class="font-italic">assets belonging to a company in which </span><span class="font-italic">the Estate is a sole shareholder</span>. Another way of expressing the “principle” contended for, is that, as an extension from the exceptions to the proper plaintiff rule, it is not only a <span class="font-italic">shareholder </span>who<span class="font-italic"> </span>may sue in respect of a loss suffered by the company, but also the <span class="font-italic">beneficiaries of a deceased former shareholder’s unadministered estate</span>. To this, the response is that, the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>line of authorities and the line of authorities which have departed from the proper plaintiff rule, both represent principles which are, in and of themselves, exceptional and applicable only in special and limited circumstances. In my view, it is plain and obvious that the plaintiff cannot hope to establish <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>simply by grafting either one of these principles onto the other. Indeed, the plaintiff can point to no precedent in which the two disparate strands of case law have been woven together and applied holistically to an individual in her position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The analysis might be different if, for example, the letters of administration had been granted and extracted, and the plaintiff was able to sue <span class="font-italic">qua sole shareholder </span>in a representative capacity. That is not, however, the situation at hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the plaintiff has no <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to sue <span class="font-italic">qua</span> beneficiary or for the benefit of the beneficiaries under the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span> line of authorities. For this reason, I affirm the AR’s decision to strike out the writ and the statement of claim under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and/or O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Rules. I note, however, that paras 21–24 of the statement of claim deal with the claim for breach of trust. I agreed with the plaintiff that, unlike the other pleaded causes of action, this “had nothing to do with MDWL” and should be dealt with separately.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The right to sue in respect of this alleged wrong, therefore, falls within s 10 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Subject to this section, on the death of any person, all causes of action subsisting against or vested in him shall survive against, or, as the case may be, for the benefit <span class="font-italic">of his estate</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The question, however, is who is entitled to sue in respect of this cause of action for the benefit of the estate? In my view, it is clear that, apart from the Public Trustee, only a person who has obtained the grant of letters of administration is so entitled.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The same question was considered in the case of <span class="font-italic">Krishnasamy</span>. There, the plaintiff, one Maran, sued the defendant in the tort of personal injury after having sustained severe injuries in a motor vehicle accident. The defendant admitted partial liability and made an offer to settle the claim (“the Offer to Settle”). The Offer to Settle remained open for acceptance when Maran passed away from his injuries. Two weeks later, before making any application for the grant of letters of administration, Maran’s mother obtained an order to be made party to the proceedings as the legal representative of Maran’s estate, and purported to accept the Offer to Settle. The defendant argued that the Offer to Settle was not capable of being accepted upon Maran’s death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The Court of Appeal held that Maran’s mother could not have accepted the Offer to Settle because she had no capacity to act for the estate. Since Maran had died intestate, under s 37(1) of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap 251, 2000 Rev Ed) read with s 10 of the Civil Law Act, his real and personal estate, including any cause of action which accrued while he was alive and which survived his death, had vested in the Public Trustee (at [21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thus, upon Maran’s death, only the Public Trustee could act for Maran’s estate in any matter until there was a grant of administration. Indeed, it is only when the grant is extracted that the person to whom the grant is made is finally clothed with the authority to deal with the estate …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 These comments are similarly applicable to the claim for breach of trust in the present case. Insofar as it is a cause of action that accrued before AVS’ death, it has vested in the Public Trustee. No other person is entitled to pursue the claim until the grant of letters of administration. The plaintiff’s claim for breach of trust is thus unsustainable and I strike it out under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">An aside</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Before concluding my analysis of RA 13, I pause here to make some observations. As I have mentioned, the plaintiff has chosen to frame her claim as no more and no less than “an action to recover, preserve or protect” the assets of the Estate. Mr Liew was at pains to emphasise to me that the words used in the Statement of Claim were “taken from cases like <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span>”.

</div><span class="font-italic"> </span>Clearly, the plaintiff sought to establish her standing to sue <span class="font-italic">qua </span>beneficiary and for the benefit of the other beneficiaries of the Estate by relying on the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>line of authorities. In light of this, it made sense that both parties treated the applicability of that line of authorities as being the decisive issue that would determine the plaintiff’s <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>. Accordingly, I have made my decision on that basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Nevertheless, I make the passing observation that if even if the plaintiff did not have <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to sue under the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy</span> line of authorities, this might not be the end of the inquiry. The plaintiff may have <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue in her <span class="font-italic">personal, individual </span>capacity. The issue of the plaintiff’s standing would then have been assessed by reference to the specific causes of action pleaded – <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>conspiracy, conversion and breach of fiduciary duty – each of which have different rules governing <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span>. The issue of <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>may well have been decided differently in that scenario. For example, the plaintiff may have <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue in unlawful means conspiracy because all that is required for a plaintiff to establish <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>for unlawful means conspiracy is an alleged intention by the defendants to harm him/her through unlawful means (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group Pte Ltd and another v OSIM International Ltd and others and another suit </span>[2016] 3 SLR 729 at [218]–[219]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 However, I concluded that it was unnecessary for me to consider whether I should refrain from striking out the plaintiff’s claim on this basis. The plaintiff <span class="font-italic">did not </span>frame her claim as one brought in her personal, individual capacity. This is clear from the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In the statement of claim, the plaintiff’s grievance was not that any wrong had been done to her <span class="font-italic">personally</span> but that wrongs had been done to the <span class="font-italic">Estate</span>. For example, under the claims for unlawful and lawful means conspiracy, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant and Shanmuga had taken steps to deprive <span class="font-italic">the Estate </span>of its assets, or interfered with the administration of <span class="font-italic">the Estate.</span>

</div> Indeed, when I queried Mr Liew on whether it would be more appropriate for the plaintiff to frame her case as one to protect her own interest in the Estate, the answer, ultimately, was that the plaintiff “feels she’s entitled to bring this action for the benefit of the beneficiaries [as a] whole”.

These remedies are clearly remedies for the benefit of the beneficiaries <span class="font-italic">as a whole</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 For those reasons, it was not necessary for me to consider whether, apart from the <span class="font-italic">Wong Moy </span>line of authorities, the plaintiff might have <span class="font-italic">locus standi </span>to sue the defendant in her personal and individual capacity.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Nevertheless, and for the sake of completeness, I note that even if I had found that the plaintiff individually had <span class="font-italic">locus standi</span> to sue in respect of any of her pleaded causes of action, I would still have upheld the AR’s decision to strike out the claim in its entirety. In my view, the plaintiff’s claims are unsustainable and frivolous or vexatious simply because they are premised on a misconceived assumption that the defendant had no authority to handle the affairs and assets of MDWL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The claims in conspiracy, conversion and breach of fiduciary duty are based on conduct which seem wholly unremarkable for any CEO of a company running its business as a going concern, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, commencing an action to obtain the company’s documents after they had been seized from the company office, directing its rental income into a new escrow account so as to enable the making of payments out of that account, renting out a unit held by one of the 22 subsidiaries, and instructing Haridass to pay brokerage fees, a refund and repair charges from the Haridass escrow account. This otherwise unremarkable conduct takes on a sinister hue in the plaintiff’s estimation only because she takes the position that the defendant had no authority to continue running the affairs of MDWL upon AVS’ demise (see [16] above). When Mr Liew was queried on the basis for this position, he simply pointed to the fact that AVS was the sole shareholder and registered director of MDWL. Therefore upon his death, “the affairs of the company came to a standstill” and the defendant no longer had authority to deal with the affairs of the company.

I would be very surprised if that were the position under <span class="font-italic">any </span>applicable law. Where the company is operating as a going concern, which regularly incurs costs, enters transactions and receives payments from clients or customers or tenants, the consequences of such a rule would be drastic if not catastrophic. There was, furthermore, no suggestion that the terms and provisions of the contract appointing the defendant as CEO of MDWL provided that such appointment would cease upon the death of AVS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Further, the plaintiff’s position that the defendant did not have authority to deal in the affairs and assets of MDWL appears to be contradicted by s 109(6) of the BVI BCA (see [20] above), which I reproduce here for convenience:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) If at any time a company has no director, any person who manages, or who directs or supervises the management of, the business and affairs of the company is deemed to be a director of the company for the purposes of this Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 That section seems directly applicable for the scenario that arose upon the death of AVS. As for what being deemed a director “for the purposes of this Act” entails, I note that s 109(6) appears within s 109 of the BVI BCA, which sets out the general powers of directors <span class="font-italic">to manage and supervise</span> the business and affairs of a company (see s 109(1) of the BVI BCA).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Of course, the precise impact of s 109(6) of the BVI BCA upon the defendant’s authority to deal in MDWL’s affairs as a director is a matter of BVI law, and, strictly speaking, not an issue before me.

As regards the fact that the defendant’s solicitors had sent the Draft Order to the plaintiff’s solicitors by post, under s 2(5) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed), service of the Draft Order was deemed to have been effected “at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post”. In this case, that would have been 16 January 2017, a Monday.

When faced with a procedural irregularity such as that in the present case, the court is entitled to set aside the order, or exercise its powers to allow any amendments, or to make such order dealing with the proceedings generally as it thinks fit. One key (though not necessarily decisive) consideration in the court’s exercise of its discretion is whether or not the opposing party has suffered prejudice by reason of the procedural irregularity (<span class="font-italic">Metroinvest Ansalt v Commercial Union Assurance </span>[1985] 1 WLR 513<span class="font-italic"> </span>at p 521, cited by the Singapore Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">The “Melati” </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 7 at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Having considered the substance of the plaintiff’s objection to the Order, AR Lee exercised his discretion by refusing to set the Order aside, but also granted the plaintiff leave to make an application for amendment. I see no reason to disturb that decision. Accepting that the Order had been extracted prematurely, the only prejudice suffered by the plaintiff, as I saw it, was that the plaintiff’s solicitors might otherwise have had an opportunity to object to the Draft Order and to write to the defendant’s solicitors proposing their amendments. However, the defendant has resisted RA 31 and argued that the plaintiff’s substantive objections to the preamble of the Order are without merit.

</div> From that I gather that the parties would not likely have been able to agree on the plaintiff’s solicitors’ proposed amendments. In that event, under O 42 r 8(3) and O 42 r 8(4) of the Rules, the terms of the Order would have to be settled by the Registrar. If that has not already taken place in some sense through the plaintiff’s correspondence with the court (see [85]–[86] above), AR Lee further suggested that the plaintiff may apply to amend the preamble to the Order if she wished. The plaintiff, instead of filing such an application and making the appropriate arguments therein, filed RA 31.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In my view, the procedural irregularity in this case did not cause any material prejudice to the plaintiff, and AR Lee was fully entitled to refuse to set aside the judgment. Even if the defendant’s failure to abide by O 42 r 8(1) did cause any to the plaintiff prejudice, such prejudice was fully addressed by AR Lee’s direction that the plaintiff could file an application for amendment if it so wished. Not having taken this up, the plaintiff cannot now insist that the Order ought to have been set aside because of non-compliance with O 42 r 8(1). Thus, in my view, the appeal should be dismissed. I recognise, however, that the problem began with the defendant’s failure to abide by the aforesaid rule. I, therefore, make no order as to costs. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">George Wei<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Liew Teck Huat and Dafril Phua (Niru &amp; Co LLC) for the plaintiff;<br/>S Magintharan and Vineetha Gunasekaran (Essex LLC)<br/>for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
