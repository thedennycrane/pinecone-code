        Jay Lee Yuxian AR:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was the Defendant’s application to
                    (a) set aside the Plaintiff’s admiralty writ <em>in
                        rem</em> for want of admiralty jurisdiction under the High Court
                    Admiralty Jurisdiction Act (“HC(AJ)A”) and/or (b) to strike out
                    the admiralty writ <em>in rem</em> and the statement of
                    claim pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Ed)
                    (“ROC”) or the Court’s inherent jurisdiction. Although not
                    specifically prayed for in the original summons, the Defendant submitted at the
                    hearing that as an alternative prayer, they sought to set aside the arrest of
                        <em>The “Vinalines Pioneer”</em> on the
                    ground of material non-disclosure in the hearing of the Plaintiff’s
                    application for the Warrant of Arrest (“Arrest hearing”) as well
                    as in the Plaintiff’s affidavit supporting its application for the Warrant
                    of Arrest (“Arrest Affidavit”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Defendant’s further prayed that the
                    Plaintiff be ordered to return to the Defendant the Letter of Undertaking dated
                    11 June 2013 and also for the Plaintiff to pay the Defendant damages for the
                    wrongful arrest of the vessel <em>The “Vinalines
                        Pioneer”</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overview </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background facts leading to the arrest of The “Vinalines
                Pioneer”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The tragic incident at the heart of this
                    application was the sinking of the vessel “Phu Tan” in the Tonkin
                    Gulf on or around 16 December 2010 which lead to the loss of lives and property
                    on board the “Phu Tan”. The relevant events leading up to the
                    arrest which is the subject matter of this application are set out
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Plaintiff is Hung Dao Container Joint Stock
                    Company (“HD”), a Vietnamese incorporated company who had supplied
                    the containers which were used on the “Phu Tan”. The Defendant is
                    Vietnam National Shipping Lines, (“Vinalines”), the owner of
                    “Phu Tan” and ‘<em>The “Vinalines
                        Pioneer”</em>’. They are a state owned company
                    incorporated in Vietnam, and are said to be in the commercial business of
                    shipping, port operations and <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    provision of coastal and ocean-going freight transportation
                services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Defendant has a branch office known as
                    Vinalines Container Shipping Company (“VCSC”). The
                    Plaintiff’s case is that in or around June 2010 the Plaintiff and the
                    Defendant (through their branch office VCSC) entered into a Container Lease
                    Agreement no. 500710T/2010/HD-VCSC (the “2010 CLC”). It was
                    conceded by the Defendant for the purposes of the present application, that
                    Vinalines was the party to the 2010 CLC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       According to the Plaintiff, under the 2010 CLC,
                    the Plaintiff agreed, <em>inter alia</em>, to lease
                    containers to the Defendant for shipping their goods. I would note here that in
                    the course of the hearings, there arose a dispute as to whether the 111
                    containers were in fact leased pursuant to the 2010 CLC. The parties also
                    crossed swords on what was the correct translation of Article 1.1 of the 2010
                    CLC. These issues are addressed at [53] to [61] below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Sometime in and around December 2010, the 111
                    containers which were on lease to the Defendant were loaded on the
                    Defendant’s vessel “Phu Tan” for carriage from Ho Chi
                    Minh/Danang to Hai Phong. On 16 December 2010, the Defendant’s vessel
                    “Phu Tan” capsized and sank. The sinking of the “Phu
                    Tan” resulted in the loss of lives as well as all containers on board,
                    including the 111 containers which are the subject of contention in the present
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Plaintiff was informed by the Defendants by
                    way of a letter dated 10 March 2011 that the “Phu Tan” had sank
                    with all containers on board and that the 111 containers were a total loss. The
                    Plaintiff alleged that following the incident, they made numerous attempts to
                    recover compensation for the loss of the containers but were unsuccessful. The
                    Plaintiff filed proceedings in Vietnam on 7 August 2012 but allege that there
                    has been little progress in the Vietnamese proceedings save that the Defendant
                    had on 16 May 2013 belatedly filed a “purported Explanation” which
                    I surmise is a court document to be filed in the normal course of court
                    proceedings in Vietnam.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Plaintiff subsequently filed proceedings in
                    Singapore on 4 June 2013. On 7 June 2013, the Plaintiff applied for and obtained
                    the warrant of arrest (at the “Arrest Hearing”) and they arrested
                    the vessel <em>The “Vinalines Pioneer”</em>
                    (“the Arrested Vessel”) on 9 June 2013. The Arrested Vessel was
                    released on 11 June 2013 upon security being furnished. Subsequently, the
                    Defendant entered appearance on 20 June 2013. The Plaintiff filed their
                    Statement of Claim (“SOC”) on 12 June 2013 and the amended SOC was
                    served on the Defendant on 25 July 2013. The Defendant then brought the present
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural history of the application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The present application was initially heard on
                    27 September 2013 and then 31 October 2013. A further set of dates were taken in
                    January 2014 in order to complete the hearing. Thereafter, the following series
                    of procedural skirmishes, briefly set out below, ensued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Prior to the adjourned hearing in January
                    2014, the Defendants filed a further affidavit by Tran Phuong Thuy dated 2
                    January 2014 and essentially sought to adduce further evidence which they
                    alleged was relevant to their case on whether admiralty jurisdiction was
                    properly invoked under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A and whether there was
                    material non-disclosure by the Plaintiff. Given the seriousness of the
                    allegations and the potential significance of the further evidence to the
                    determination of the issues, I granted leave for the further affidavit to be
                    admitted and allowed parties the opportunity to file further affidavits to
                    address the further points of contention raised. In the course of events,
                    parties subsequently filed further affidavits and provided discovery of further
                    documents. The further evidence essentially comprised documents known as the
                    Equipment Interchange Receipts (“EIRs”) and booking orders which
                    were essentially documents exchanged between the parties to evidence the supply
                    of a container from the Plaintiff to the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The hearing resumed in end April 2014 and at
                    the end of the hearing, parties were given leave to file written supplemental
                    submissions to address some points which had not been fully addressed during the
                    course of the hearing. However, the Plaintiff subsequently filed an application
                    for leave to admit a further affidavit from their Vietnamese law expert, Luu
                    Tien Dzung to address the issue of whether the Plaintiff’s claim was
                    time-barred. I allowed the admission of the Plaintiff’s further affidavit,
                    in the interests of the overall justice of the matter, given that it had
                    potential significance to the time-bar issue which was being relied upon by the
                    Defendant both as a ground for striking out and as a basis for setting aside the
                    arrest for material non-disclosure. The Defendant was also given the opportunity
                    to file reply affidavits on this issue. Another minor skirmish arose when the
                    Defendant subsequently applied to strike out the further affidavit filed by the
                    Plaintiffs’ Vietnamese law expert and this was resolved in favour of the
                    Plaintiff. The parties eventually returned before me in end August 2014 and made
                    their final arguments in the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     At this juncture, it would be useful to
                    broadly outline the parties’ respective arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Parties’ Arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Defendant’s grounds for the setting
                    aside were two-fold. First, they contended that the admiralty writ should be set
                    aside as the Plaintiff’s claim did not fall within the jurisdictional
                    limbs which the Plaintiff sought to rely on under section 3(1) of the HC(AJ)A.
                    Separately, and as an independent ground for setting aside the arrest, they
                    alleged that there was material non-disclosure in the Arrest Hearing and in the
                    Plaintiff’s arrest affidavit filed by Tran Van Hung on 7 June 2013
                    (“Arrest Affidavit”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Defendant’s case on striking out was
                    premised on O18 r 19(1)(b) of the ROC and the inherent jurisdiction of the
                    court, and based on the grounds that first the Plaintiff’s claim was
                    time-barred and second that so far as the non-contractual claims were concerned,
                    there was “not a shred of evidence” to support these claims, and
                    that there is no evidence of “double actionability”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Defendant further asserted that this was a
                    case where damages for wrongful arrest should be awarded as the claim was
                    entirely without substance or foundation and that there was material
                    non-disclosure by the Plaintiff in the Arrest Hearing as well as in the Arrest
                    Affidavit filed by Tran Van Hung dated 7 June 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In response, the Plaintiff contended that
                    their present claim did fall within section 3(1), in particular sections
                    3(1)(d), (g) and/or (l) of the HC(AJ)A such that Admiralty jurisdiction was
                    properly invoked. The Plaintiff argued that the nature of their claim was fully
                    set out in the Arrest Affidavit as well as in the Indorsement of Claim. In
                    particular, the Plaintiff asserted that they had provided sufficient information
                    on, <em>inter alia</em>, the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     The details of the 2010 CLC between
                        the parties and the material terms therein;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     the subject matter of the claim i.e. the loss of
                        the 111 containers,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Plaintiff’s locus to sue, i.e. as the owners and/or lessors
                        and/or bailors and/or persons entitled to immediate possession or having a
                        reversionary interests in respect of the 111 containers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_d"></a>(d)     The basis upon which the claim was
                        brought against the Defendant i.e. as the bailees and/or carriers of the
                        containers;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_e"></a>(e)     That the 111 containers were carried on board the Defendant’s vessel
                        “Phu Tan” in or around December 2010 from Ho Chih Minh City
                        and/or Danang to Hai Phong;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_f"></a>(f)     That the 111 containers were for the vessel’s
                        operation or maintenance or were equipment of the “Phu
                        Tan”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_g"></a>(g)     That the 111 containers were lost when the Defendant’s vessel
                        ”Phu Tan” sank on 16 December 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As to the striking out, the Plaintiff asserted
                    that there were merits to their present claim and it was a legally and factually
                    sustainable claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Finally, the Plaintiff asserted that there was
                    no material non-disclosure on their part and that in any event there was no
                        <em>mala fides</em> or <em>crassia
                        negligentia</em> which would justify an award of damages for wrongful
                    arrest being made against them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Distilled to its core, the issues before this
                    court can be set out as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     The invocation of the admiralty in
                        rem jurisdiction of the court: whether the Plaintiff’s claim falls
                        within section 3(1)(d), (g) and/or (l) of the HC(AJ)A such that admiralty
                        jurisdiction was properly invoked;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     The sustainability of the Plaintiff’s claims:
                        whether the Plaintiff’s claim should be struck out under O 18 r 19 of

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I begin by examining the various steps and
                    standards of proof involved in invoking admiralty jurisdiction under the
                    HC(AJ)A. As set out by the Court of Appeal in <em>The
                        “Bunga Melati 5”</em> [2012] 4 SLR 546
                        (“<em>The Bunga Melati</em> 5”) at [112],
                    the Plaintiffs have to satisfy a 5 step test when challenged, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     prove, <em>on the
                            balance of probabilities</em>, that the jurisdictional facts under
                        the limb it is relying on in s 3(1)(d) to (q) of the HC(AJ)A exist; and show
                            <em>an arguable case</em> that its claim is of the
                        type or nature required by the relevant statutory provision (“step
                        1”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     prove, <em>on the balance of probabilities</em>, that
                        the claim arises in connection with a ship (“step
                    2”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     identify, <em>without having to show in argument</em>,
                        the person who would be liable on the claim in an action in personam
                        (“step 3”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_d"></a>(d)     prove, <em>on the balance of
                            probabilities</em>, that the relevant person was, when the cause
                        of action arose, the owner or charterer of, or in possession or in control
                        of, the ship (“step 4”); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_e"></a>(e)     prove, <em>on the balance of
                            probabilities</em>, that the relevant person, was at the time when
                        the action was brought: (i) the beneficial owner of the offending ship as
                        respects all the shares in it or the charterer of that ship under a demise
                        charter; or (ii) the beneficial owner of the sister ship as respects all the
                        shares in it (“step 5”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     For the purposes of the present application,
                    the Defendant was content not to dispute steps 2 to 5. The challenge on
                    jurisdiction was thus focused solely on step 1 of the 5-step test as laid down
                    in <em>The Bunga Melati 5</em>. There are two aspects to
                    step 1. First, it must be proven on a balance of probabilities that the
                    requisite jurisdictional facts exist. The second essential question is whether
                    the Plaintiff’s claim is of the legal character contemplated by the
                    jurisdictional limb relied upon in section 3(1) of the HC(AJ)A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     For the present application, the Plaintiff
                    asserted that their claim fell within sections 3(1)(d), (g) and/or (l) of the
                    HC(AJ)A. Although the arrest was initially premised additionally on the
                    jurisdictional limb under section 3(1)(m) of the HC(AJ)A, Plaintiff’s
                    counsel clarified that for the present application they were no longer relying
                    on section 3(1)(m) of the HC(AJ)A as a basis for invoking admiralty jurisdiction
                    of the court. The Plaintiff’s counsel also submitted, rightly in my view,
                    that if their claim was found to come within one of the jurisdictional limbs
                    under section 3(1)(d), (g) or (l), it would suffice to bring the claim within
                    the admiralty jurisdiction of the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The following analyses assesses if the
                    Plaintiff’s claim falls within the jurisdictional limbs under section
                    3(1)(d), (g) and/or (l) of the HC(AJ)A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 3(1)(d) – Any claim for Damage done by a Ship</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Section 3(1)(d) provides that the admiralty
                    jurisdiction of the court shall extend to “any claim for damage done by a
                    ship”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The main jurisdictional facts relied upon here
                    are uncontroversial. It is not disputed that the “Phu Tan” sank
                    and the 111 containers supplied by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants which were
                    on board the “Phu Tan” were lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, there appeared to be some dispute on
                    whether the sinking of the “Phu Tan” and the loss of the
                    containers was caused by those engaged in the navigation or management of the
                    ship. The Plaintiff submitted that the Investigation Conclusion No/
                    256/BCDTCVHHHP dated 15 March 2011 (“Investigation Conclusion”)
                    issued by the Hai Phong Port Authority revealed in its conclusions, <em>inter alia</em> that the poor navigation of the ship and
                    inappropriate actions taken by the master and crew in the navigation or
                    operation of the ship led to the sinking and loss of the containers. The
                    Defendant’s counsel on the other hand, brought to my attention a
                    subsequent letter from the Hai Phong Port Authority dated 9 May 2011 which, they
                    submitted, clarified that the bad weather condition was “the proximate
                    cause of the incident, other contributing factors only considered as results of
                    the bad weather condition”. In my view, the letter from the Hai Phong
                    Port Authority dated 9 May 2011 was unclear. Whilst it stated that the bad
                    weather condition was “the proximate cause of the incident”, it
                    nevertheless still referred to the other factors as “contributing
                    factors” and it did not expressly reject any of its earlier findings in
                    the Investigation Conclusion. Having considered the totality of both documents,
                    I would accept that the loss was caused by those engaged in the navigation or
                    management of the ship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The main issue argued before me by parties was
                    whether the claim was of the legal character contemplated under section 3(1)(d)
                    of the HC(AJ)A. Citing various authorities including the English authorities of
                        <em>The “Rama”</em> [1996] 2
                    Lloyd’s Rep 291 (“<em>The Rama</em>”),
                        <em>The “Escherscheim”</em> [1976] 2
                    Lloyd’s Rep 1 (“<em>The
                    Eschercheim</em>”), <em>The
                        “Escherscheim”</em>[1976] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 81 (Court
                    of Appeal) (“<em>The Eschercheim (CA)</em>”),
                    the Hong Kong decision of <em>The “Asian
                        Atlas”</em> [2008] 3 HKC 169 (“<em>The
                        Asian Atlas</em>”), as well as passages from <em>Admiralty Law and Practice</em> 2<sup>nd</sup> Ed.,
                    Toh Kian Sing SC (<em>“Admiralty Law and
                        Practice”</em>), Defendant’s counsel forcefully argued
                    that it was settled law that the ship which causes damage under section 3(1)(d)
                    does not refer to the carrying ship, which in the present case was the
                    “Phu Tan”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Underpinning this submission was the
                    Defendants’ further contention that it was also well settled that the 3 -
                    criteria test as set out in <em>The Rama</em> (at 293)
                    would apply. In <em>The Rama</em>, Clarke J opined that in
                    order for there to be “damage done by a ship”, 3 criteria must be
                    satisfied:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     The damage must be caused by
                        something done by those engaged in the navigation or management of the ship
                        in a physical sense;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     The ship must be the actual or noxious instrument by which the damage
                        is done; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     The damage must be sustained by a person or property external to the ship.
                        (“externality requirement”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Specifically, the Defendant’s counsel contended that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> criterion (i.e. the externality requirement -
                    that the damage must be sustained by a person or property external to the ship)
                    was not met in the present case where the “Phu Tan” sank with the
                    containers on board (and not external) to the ship. Defendant’s counsel
                    further submitted, as a secondary point, that even if it was accepted that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> criteria of externality was not a
                    requirement, then on the facts of this case it was clear that the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> requirement of the ship being the noxious
                    instrument of damage was not satisfied as the “Phu Tan” merely
                    sank with the containers on board and was therefore only a passive environment
                    and not the instrument of damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Plaintiff’s counsel on the other hand
                    pointed out that it was by no means settled law that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> criterion of externality as set out in
                        <em>The Rama</em> was applicable to determine if
                    jurisdiction was validly invoked under section 3(1)(d). She argued that prior to
                        <em>The Rama</em>, 2 main requirements, were laid down
                    by the House of Lords in <em>The Eschercheim</em> at 926g:
                    (1) that the damage is the direct result or consequence of something done by
                    those in the navigation of the ship; and (2) the ship must be the actual
                    instrument by which the damage was done, with the important qualifier that
                    physical contact between the ship and the object damaged was not essential. In
                    her submission, insofar as the <em>Rama</em> had introduced
                    a 3<sup>rd</sup> criterion of externality, it seemed to be an
                    additional requirement to the 2 main propositions in <em>The
                        Eschercheim</em> and one which was not supported by strong authority.
                    The earlier English authorities such as <em>The
                        “Tolten”</em> [1946] P 135 (“<em>The Tolten”</em>) appeared not to insist on this
                        3<sup>rd</sup> requirement of externality, in <em>The Tolten</em> at 158, the court found that “cause of
                    damage” was not limited to cases involving collisions between ships but
                    that there could be jurisdiction “whenever …negligent navigation
                    caused damage with or without collision” and that such damage could
                    include damage to any property whether moveable or immoveable. There was no
                    externality requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Plaintiff’s counsel then argued that
                    there were Australian and New Zealand authorities to the effect that the
                        3<sup>rd</sup> criterion of externality was not a
                    requirement for there to be a claim within the ambit of section 3(1)(d). The
                    cases she relied on were - from Australia: <em>The
                        “Regis”</em> (1939 61 CLR 688 (“<em>The Regis”)</em>, <em>Union Steamship
                        Co of New Zealand Ltd v Ferguson</em> (1969)
                    (“Ferguson”) 119 CLR 191; and from New Zealand: <em>Fournier v The Ship “Margaret Z”</em> [1999] 3 NZLR 111
                    (“Margaret Z”). In essence, Plaintiff’s counsel argued that
                    based on these authorities, the Plaintiff had an arguable case that their claim
                    came was of the type and nature contemplated under section
                3(1)(d).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In <em>The Regis</em>,
                    the Australian High Court found that it had <em>in rem</em>
                    jurisdiction (under the equivalent jurisdictional limb) over a claim suffered by
                    a passenger against the vessel carrying him for negligent navigation resulting
                    in its capsizing and causing personal injury to him. In my reading, a key point
                    can be taken from <em>The Regis</em> that tells in favour
                    of the Plaintiff and it is this - the facts of the case there involved a
                    capsizing which caused injury to the claimant. This is analogous to the present
                    case where the “Phu Tan” sank with the 111 containers on board. I
                    do not agree with Defendant’s counsel’s suggestion that <em>The Regis</em> was a case where the ship was indeed found to
                    be the instrument of damage because it <em>struck</em> the
                    claimant (and not just because it capsized). Nothing in the judgment suggests
                    that the decision there turned on this fact. Rather, the court in the final
                    analysis (at 700) drew the distinction between:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     injury which “arises from
                        some defect in the condition of the ship considered as premises or as a
                        structure upon which the person injured is standing, walking or
                        moving…[such that] …the ship is treated as no more than a
                        potential danger of a <em>passive kind</em>”
                        [emphasis added]; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     injury which “is the result of the management or navigation of
                        the ship as a moving object or of the working of the gear or of some other
                        operation…[such that]…the damage is to be regarded as done by
                        the ship as …the “noxious
                    instrument””.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The court in <em>The
                        Regis</em> then held (in the penultimate paragraph of the judgment) on
                    the facts of that case that “the improper navigation of the ship caused
                    her so to behave that <em>she capsized</em> [making no
                    reference to the fact of the ship <em>striking</em> the
                    claimant]. <em>Her behaviour as an active agent was the direct
                        cause of the harm</em> and in that sense she was the noxious
                    instrument” [emphases added]. In my reading, this case supports the view
                    that a ship which capsizes and causes damage can be considered to be the
                    instrument of damage and not merely a passive environment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Another relevant authority for consideration
                    is the <em>Margaret Z</em> where the New Zealand High Court
                    at 122 - 123 considered the question whether an injured person or object must be
                    “external to the ship” and decided that it did not. Referring
                    directly to the 3rd criterion of externality prescribed in <em>The Rama</em>, Fisher J stated that he did not think “too much
                    could be read into Clark J’s use of the word
                    “external””. He acknowledged that there was a
                    “floodgates risk of bringing shipboard accidents into the scope of the
                    damage maritime lien. <em>Cargo damage claims, for example might
                        qualify</em>” [emphasis added] but concluded that “the
                    precedents seem too far advanced to put the clock back in this respect”
                    and that the main requirement was whether damage was “done by the
                    ship” rather than the location of the accident.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In response, Defendant’s counsel sought
                    to cast doubt on the decisions of <em>Margaret Z</em> and
                        <em>The Regis</em> by submitting that these cases were
                    doubted in another New Zealand authority, <em>Ultimate Lady Ltd v
                        The Ship “Northern Challenger”</em> AD 7/00 dated 10
                    August 2000 (“<em>Northern Challenger”</em>).
                    I agree with the Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendan’s counsel’s
                    submission was misconceived. In <em>Northern
                        Challenger</em>, Williams J cited the <em>Margaret
                        Z</em> and <em>The Regis</em> but did not reject
                    or doubt the legal propositions as stated in those cases. More significantly, at
                    the subsequent main trial on the merits <em>Ultimate Lady Ltd v
                        The Ship “Northern Challenger”</em> (No 2) AD7-SW2000 at
                    [165] – [171], Williams J <em>cited and applied The
                        Regis</em> and <em>Margaret Z</em> and did not
                    cast any doubt on those decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the final analysis, I find that the
                    Plaintiff has an arguable case that their claim is of the nature and type
                    contemplated under section 3(1)(d) of the HC(AJ)A. My analysis is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, I accept on the basis of the
                        Investigation Conclusion that the damage was caused by something done by
                        those engaged in the navigation or management of the ship in a physical
                        sense;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     On the
                        authority of <em>The Regis</em>, I am satisfied that,
                        as was the present case, a ship can be said to be the instrument of damage
                        or noxious instrument when it capsizes or sinks and as a result causes
                        injury or damage. To my mind, there is a clear difference between a ship
                        being a mere passive environment, premise or structure on which damage
                        occurred and a ship physically capsizing/sinking and causing the damage as
                        an active agent;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     The question of whether <em>The
                            Rama’s</em> 3<sup>rd</sup> criterion of
                        externality is a requirement to ground jurisdiction under section 3(1)(d)
                        appears <em>not</em> to have been conclusively
                        determined as a matter of Singapore law and neither party contended
                        otherwise before me;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     I agree with the Plaintiff’s submission that the earlier
                        English authorities, principally <em>The
                            Eschercheim</em>, had not insisted on this
                            3<sup>rd</sup> criterion of externality and had focused
                        the inquiry on whether the damage was the caused by something done by those
                        engaged in the navigation or management of the ship and on whether the
                        damage was done by the ship as an instrument of damage. It is significant to
                        note that based on <em>The Eschercheim</em>, physical
                        contact between the ship and the object damaged is not essential. Indeed in
                            <em>The Eschercheim</em>, the damage was caused by
                        the negligent beaching of the ship by the salvage tug leading to the ship
                        being exposed to the harmful effects of the elements;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_e"></a>(e)     The 3<sup>rd</sup>
                        requirement of externality stated in <em>The Rama</em>,
                        appears to be premised on two cases briefly referred to in the judgment:
                            <em>The “Victoria”</em> (1887) 12 PD
                        105 (“<em>The Victoria</em>”) and
                            <em>The “Igor”</em> [1956] 2
                        Lloyd’s Rep 271 (“<em>The
                        Igor</em>”). I would note however, that <em>The
                            Victoria</em> was decided prior to <em>The
                            Eschercheim.</em> In <em>The Victoria</em>,
                        the court appeared to readily accept, without elaboration or analysis, the
                        defendant’s contention that this jurisdictional limb only applied
                        “to damage done by a vessel to something <em>with
                            which it can come in contact</em>, and not to cargo on
                        board.” (emphasis added) In the light of the subsequent House of
                        Lords decision in <em>The Eschercheim</em> that
                        physical contact between the ship and the object sustaining the damage is
                            <em>not essential</em>, there is some doubt whether
                            <em>The Victoria</em> would have been decided in
                        the same manner. As for <em>The Igor</em>, it too was
                        decided prior to <em>The Eschercheim</em>, the judgment
                        appears to have been concerned with a claim for damage to goods carried in a
                        ship rather than a claim for “damage done by a ship” and in my
                        view, it is difficult to find therein any support for the
                            3<sup>rd</sup> requirement of
                    externality;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_f"></a>(f)     As to
                            <em>The Asian Atlas</em>, in my reading, the Hong
                        Kong Court of Appeal clearly applied <em>The Rama</em>.
                        However, it must be appreciated that the facts of that case did not require
                        the court to consider the issue of whether a claim for “damage done
                        by a ship” applies when the damage is suffered by property on board
                        the relevant ship. The externality requirement was applied to the question
                        of whether it was fulfilled when there was damage sustained by the ship
                        herself and this was plainly answered in the negative. Given that this issue
                        was not squarely before the court, unsurprisingly, it appears that the court
                        there was not referred to the other line of authorities in <em>The Margaret Z, The Regis</em> and <em>Ferguson</em> and did not hear arguments on the
                    issue;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_g"></a>(g)     The
                            3<sup>rd</sup> requirement of externality introduced by
                            <em>The Rama</em> would appear to unnecessarily
                        restrict the ambit of this jurisdictional limb and is not supported by
                        strong authority. I see no reason in principle why a claim should not come
                        within this jurisdictional limb just because the damage occurred on the ship
                        even though the ship was in fact the instrument of
                damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I am fortified in my views by the following
                    passages of the authoritative textbook <em>Admiralty Law and
                        Practice</em>, where the learned author astutely observed that
                        <em>The Rama</em> introduced an additional requirement
                    of externality, specifically referred to <em>The Regis, Margaret
                        Z</em>, and expressed the following views:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“the <em>additional requirement</em> of injury
                        or damage sustained <em>external</em> to a vessel
                            <em>is not always justifiable</em>, especially in
                        the context of personal injury caused by the instrumentality of the
                        ship” [emphases added] (see pg 56)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“In the decision of <em>The Rama</em>, Clarke
                        J <em>appeared to have added another</em> requirement
                        to the accrual of a damage lien, namely, that the damage must be sustained
                        by a person or property external to the ship. This would rule out a claim
                        for dmage or loss of cargo carried on board or for loss of life or personal
                        injury sustained on board a ship which was the instrument of damage. There
                        are authorities suggesting that a maritime lien does exist in respect of
                        personal injury sustained on board a ship. <em>While the
                            requirement of instrumentality of the ship is more evidently seen in the
                            case of damage caused to persons or property external to her, earlier
                            authorities have not insisted on such a requirement</em>.
                            <em>This additional requirement introduces an undesirable
                            element of fortuity and it is significant to note that the New Zealand
                            High Court [citing Margaret Z] has rejected it</em>.”
                        [emphases added] (see pg 257)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I would agree with the learned author’s view that as far as
                    the 3<sup>rd</sup> criterion of externality is concerned,
                        “<em>earlier authorities have not insisted on such a
                        requirement</em>. <em>This additional requirement
                        introduces an undesirable element of fortuity and it is significant to note
                        that the New Zealand High Court [citing Margaret Z] has rejected
                        it</em>.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For good measure, Plaintiff’s counsel
                    also brought my attention to a commentary in <em>The Law and
                        Practice of Admiralty Matters</em> (Oxford 2007), Sarah C. Derrington,
                    James M. Turner wherein at [4.22] the authors state, correctly in my view, that
                    the holding in <em>Margaret Z</em> was consistent with
                    Australian authority on the point that there is no requirement that the injury
                    or damage that is sustained has to be external to the vessel. In my view,
                    insofar as it can be said that <em>The Rama</em> represents
                    the English position on the issue, the law appears to have developed in a
                    different direction in Australia and New Zealand. Here I observe that the
                    Singapore courts have been quite prepared to depart from English decisions in
                    the realm of shipping and admiralty law to evolve its own jurisprudence in this
                    area. Decisions such as <em>The Permina 108</em> [1974
                    – 1976] SLR (R) 850 suffice to illustrate this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In the premises, I find that the
                    Plaintiff’s claim falls within section 3(1)(d) of the HC(AJ)A. As stated
                    earlier, I agree with counsel for the Plaintiff that as long as jurisdiction was
                    found under any of the limbs in section 3(1)(d), (g) or (l), it would suffice to
                    bring the claim within the admiralty jurisdiction of the court. Nevertheless,
                    for completeness, I turn now to set out my observations on whether the
                    Plaintiff’s claim falls within section 3(1)(g).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 3(1)(g) – Any claim for loss of or damage to goods
                carried in a ship</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Section 3(1)(g) provides that the admiralty
                    jurisdiction of the court shall extend to any claim in respect of “loss
                    or damage to goods carried in a ship”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The undisputed jurisdictional facts the
                    Plaintiffs relied on were that the “Phu Tan” sank and the 111
                    containers supplied by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants which were on board the
                    “Phu Tan” were lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The main dispute centered once more on whether
                    the Plaintiff’s had an arguable case that their claim fell within the
                    ambit of section 3(1)(g), HC(AJ)A. Counsel for the Defendant referring to The
                        “<em>Mezen”</em> [2006] SGHC 35,
                        <em>The Escherscheim (CA)</em> and passages from
                        <em>Admiralty Law and Practice</em>., argued that
                    section 3(1)(g) applies only in respect of “goods carried as
                    cargo” and “cargo” claims, the containers were not cargo
                    and therefore did not fall within the ambit of the phrase “goods carried
                    in a ship”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The key passage of <em>The
                        Mezen</em> at [18] states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“I decided that <em>The Eschersheim</em> was
                        correct that in the context of section 3(1)(g), “goods”
                        carried in a ship referred to goods carried as cargo on board a ship, in
                        other words, things or items carried on board a vessel for the purpose of
                        being conveyed or transported from one place to another.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Plaintiff’s counsel submitted before me
                    that the 111 containers fell within the definition of “goods”
                    under section 3(1)(g). Referring to the passage of <em>The
                        Mezen</em> as out above, she submitted that although the court
                    referred to the term “goods” as cargo carried on board a ship, the
                    court in <em>The Mezen</em> had further explained that
                    “cargo” referred to things or items carried on board a vessel for
                    the purpose of being conveyed or transported from one place to another.
                    Plaintiff’s counsel further referred to the Scottish decision of <em>“The Steve Irwin</em>” [2011] CSOH 112
                        (<em>“The Steve Irwin”</em>) where at
                    [26] the court was prepared to accept that the tuna and transportation cages
                    (although less plausibly so) which were on tow by the vessel and which suffered
                    damage should qualify as “goods carried in a ship”.
                    Plaintiff’s counsel’s final point was that in the context of a claim
                    under section 20(2)(m) of the UK Supreme Court Act 1981 (which is in <em>pari material</em> to section 3(1)(l) of our HC(AJ)A), the
                    House of Lords in <em>The “River Rima”</em>
                    [1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 193 (“<em>The River
                        Rima”</em>) held at pg 195 that “containers are
                    “goods” within the meaning of par. (m)”, therefore it was
                    submitted, there should be no difference in the meaning of “goods”
                    used in the context of section 3(1)(g) of the HC(AJ)A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     All things considered, I find that the
                    Plaintiff does <em>not</em> have an arguable case that
                    their claim is of the nature and type contemplated under section 3(1)(g):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     In my reading, although <em>The Mezen</em> did not deal with the issue of whether
                        containers can be considered as “goods” within the meaning of
                        section 3(1)(g), the court rightly accepted that <em>The
                            Eschercheim</em> was correct and that in the context of section
                        3(1)(g), “goods” referred to goods carried as cargo on board a
                        ship. It is clear that the court rejected the wide definitions of
                        “goods” to include “all chattels of which possession is
                        possible notwithstanding that they are not easily moveable”,
                        “whatever conveyed in a ship” or “the load carried in a
                        ship” (proposed by the plaintiff at [13]). The court’s
                        reference to “things or items carried on board a vessel for the
                        purpose of being conveyed or transported from one place to another”
                        must therefore be understood in the context of its clear finding that
                        “goods” referred to “goods <em>carried
                            as cargo</em> on board a ship”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     On a plain reading of the words
                        “goods carried in a ship” and in the historical context of
                        this jurisdictional limb (i.e. that it evolved from section 6 of the
                        Admiralty Court Act 1861) I agree that this jurisdictional limb should be
                        understood as being applied to cargo-owners claims against the ship to which
                        he has entrusted his cargo. It would be an extension to include under this
                        limb a claim for loss of containers used to store the cargo carried on a
                        container ship;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     I do not accept the Plaintiff’s submission that “goods”
                        was defined to include “containers” in section 3(1)(l) and so
                        should be accorded the same meaning in section 3(1)(g). It is clear to me
                        that the phrases in the various jurisdictional limbs are terms of art which
                        must be understood with reference to authority: see <em>The
                            Eschercheim</em> at 926g. In any event, section 3(1)(l) pertains
                        to “goods …supplied to a ship <em>for her
                            operation</em> and maintenance” and is therefore apt to
                        encompass containers on board for the operation of a container ship. Section
                        3(1)(g) on the other hand refers to “goods carried on a ship”
                        with no such interpretative flavour as provided by the words (appearing in
                        section 3(1)(l)) “supplied…for her operation and
                        maintenance”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_d"></a>(d)     The slender authority relied on by the Plaintiff’s counsel
                        appeared to be <em>The Steve Irwin</em> but I note that
                        the statements there were in <em>obiter</em>, without
                        detailed analysis and heavily qualified. I note that even there, the court
                        stated that it was “less plausibly so” that the transportation
                        cages carrying the tuna could fall within the scope of the phrase
                        “goods carried in a ship”. In my view, such slender authority
                        would not suffice to demonstrate that the Plaintiff has an arguable case
                        that its claim is of the type and nature contemplated under section
                        3(1)(g).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the premises, I would observe that the
                    Plaintiff’s claim <em>does not</em> fall within
                    section 3(1)(g) of the HC(AJ)A. I turn now to consider whether the
                    Plaintiff’s claim falls within section 3(1)(l) of the
                HC(AJ)A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Section 3(1)(l) – any claim in respect of goods or materials
                supplied to a ship for her operation and maintenance</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Section 3(1)(l) provides that the admiralty
                    jurisdiction extends to any claims in respect of “loss or damage to goods
                    carried in a ship”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     As I understand it, the Plaintiff’s
                    argument was premised on the following propositions, each of which, save for
                    (a), is disputed by the Defendant:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     The 2010 CLC was a contract entered
                        into with the Defendants, Vinalines;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     The translation of the 2010 CLC relied upon by the
                        Plaintiffs was not false and is correct;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_c"></a>(c)     The 2010 CLC expressly or impliedly provide for
                        the supply of containers for use on the Defendant’s
                    ships;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_d"></a>(d)     The 111
                        containers were supplied pursuant to the 2010 CLC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_e"></a>(e)     The container loading list by the Tan
                        Thuan Port Record database is authentic and shows that the 111 containers
                        were loaded onto the “Phu Tan” for the particular
                        voyage;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_f"></a>(f)     Containers have been held to be “goods” within the meaning of
                        section 3(1)(l) and the court in <em>The River
                            Rima</em> was prepared to accept without deciding the point that
                        the use of a container on board a ship designed to carry containers is a use
                        for the operation of such a ship;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_g"></a>(g)     To bring a claim under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A,
                        there is no need for the name of the ship on which the containers are to be
                        supplied to be identified in the contract of supply or even at the time of
                        performance of the contract of supply so long as at the time of actual
                        supply, the ship is identified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It would be useful at this point to recognise
                    that the matters set out in (a) to (e) can be seen as jurisdictional facts under
                    limb 3(1)(l) that the Plaintiffs have to prove on a balance of probabilities
                    whilst the matters set out in (f) and (g) go to the assessment of whether the
                    claim is of the type or nature envisaged under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A.
                    My analysis proceeds on this basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a) - The 2010 CLC was a contract entered into with the Defendants,
                Vinalines</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     This issue can be shortly dealt with. In the
                    affidavit of Tran Phuong Thuy filed on behalf of the Defendants on 31 July 2013,
                    the Defendant has stated that “they are willing to assume for the
                    purposes of the application, that the Defendants were a party to the Container
                    Lease Contract No. 500710T/2010/HD – VCSC … dated 1 June 2010 with
                    the Plaintiff…”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Even if a contrary position had been taken by
                    the Defendant, had I required to do so, I would have found that the Defendant,
                    Vinalines were the contractual counterparty to the 2010 CLC. The clear evidence
                    on this was the Explanatory Statement dated 8 May 2013, sent in the name of
                    “Vietnam Container Shipping Company – Branch of Vietnam National
                    Shipping Lines” to the Vietnamese Court stating, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“…VCSC only acted <em>on behalf of
                            Vinalines</em> to sign the lease contract with Hung Dao Container

                            obligations under the container lease contract will be at
                            Vinalines’ account</em>. In fact, Vinalines has sent to the
                        Court the document on appointment of its Authorized Representative to
                        participate in the proceedings as the Defendant in the above case.”
                        [emphases added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b) and (c) - The veracity of the Plaintiff’s translation of
                the 2010 CLC and whether the 2010 CLC expressly or impliedly provided for the supply
                of containers for use on the Defendant’s ships</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I deal with (b) and (c) together. The
                    Plaintiff’s translation of the 2010 CLC was disputed by the Defendant as
                    being false in two aspects. At the heart of the dispute was Art 1.1 of the 2010
                    CLC which, in the Plaintiff’s translation which appears in the Arrest
                    Affidavit, states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Party A agrees to lease the equipments (hereinafter abbreviated
                        “Containers”) <em>In Party A’s
                            possession</em> to Party B for shipping its goods <em>on Party B’s ships</em>”. [emphases
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The Defendants produced and relied on two
                    translations:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>First translation (1<sup>st</sup>
                            Affidavit of Ly Quang Long dated 16 July 2013)</u>

                        (hereinafter called “container”) which is being <em>owned by Party A</em> in order to transport the cargo
                            <em>by sea mode by Party B</em>”. [emphases
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<u>Second Translation (4<sup>th</sup>
                            Affidavit of Tran Phuong Thuy dated 22 January 2014)</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Party A [Hung Dao] agrees Party B [VCSC] to lease the equipment
                        (hereinafter referred to as “Container”) under the <em>ownership of Party A</em> to transport commodities
                            <em>on sea routes of Party B</em>”.
                        [emphases added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The Defendant contended that the
                    Plaintiff’s translation of the 2010 CLC was false as the phrase “In
                    Party A’s possession” should be translated as “owned by
                    Party A” and the phrase “Party B’s ships” should be
                    translated as either “by sea mode by Party B” or “on sea
                    routes of Party B”. The Defendant’s contention was underpinned by
                    their submission that the Plaintiff had deliberately procured a false
                    translation of Art 1.1 of the 2010 CLC to mislead the court into allowing an
                    arrest under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I am unable to agree with the
                    Defendant’s assertion. To begin with, I note that the Plaintiffs’
                    translation as well the Defendants’ two translations were all, on the face
                    of it, official certified translations produced by the Justice Office of Binh
                    Hanh District. There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that any of these
                    three official certified translations are unreliable. In my view, the
                    explanation for the differences in translations is that this simply reflects the
                    inexactitude inherent in the process of translating between different languages.
                    To put it another way, I accept that the Vietnamese contractual terms can be
                    correctly expressed in English within a range of literal to dynamic
                    translations, all of which can properly be said to capture the essence of the
                    terms in the original Vietnamese language.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The next question I consider is whether, based
                    on a holistic view of the 3 different translations of Art 1.1 of the 2010 CLC,
                    it can be said that the 2010 CLC provides for the supply of containers for use
                    on the Defendant’s ships. In my view, it does. My reasons are as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_a"></a>(a)     In the context of the scale of
                        dynamic to literal translations I have referred to earlier, the phrase
                        “on Party B’s ships” can be seen as a dynamic
                        translation whilst the phrases “by sea mode by Party B” and
                        “on sea routes of Party B” are apt to reflect a more literal
                        translation. In my view, the phrases that containers are to be used
                        “by sea mode by Party B” or “on sea routes of Party
                        B” can conceivably express the idea that the containers are to be
                        supplied for use on Party B’s ships;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Defendant’s further contention was
                        that according to their 2 “true translations”, the phrase
                        “by sea mode by Party B” or “on sea routes of Party
                        B” could also be wide enough to cover situations where the containers
                        were supplied for use on ships <em>not belonging to Party
                            B</em>. They further asserted in an affidavit filed by Nguyen Ngoc
                        Thuy Van on 7 Apr 2014 that “the containers are sometimes used on
                        trucks”. In my view, the documentary evidence available shows clearly
                        that the containers were indeed used on the Defendant’s ships. There
                        is no documentary evidence to show either that the containers were put onto
                        ships belonging to persons other than the Defendants or that the containers
                        were used for the carriage of goods on containers over land. I agree with
                        the Plaintiff’s counsel’s submission that the parties’
                        conduct reflected the nature of their agreement under the 2010 CLC. Based on
                        the available evidence, I am satisfied that the 2010 CLC did provide that
                        containers are to be supplied for use on Party B’s
                    ships.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(d) - Whether the 111 containers were leased under the 2010
                CLC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In the course of the hearing, evidence
                    surfaced that of the 111 containers, 99 were in fact in the possession of the
                    Defendants prior to the execution of the 2010 CLC between the parties. Further
                    evidence also emerged that there was a prior 2006 agreement between the parties
                    (which ended in 2007), that these 99 containers had been supplied to the
                    Defendants in 2007, 2008 and 2009, and that between August 2007 and May 2010
                    there was in fact no written agreement in place for the supply of the containers
                    between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Based on these revelations, the
                    Defendants’ contended that the 111 containers were not leased under the
                    2010 CLC but instead were supplied by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants under
                    another earlier 2006 agreement or at periods in time where there was no written
                    agreement between the parties. I note here that counsel for the Defendants had
                    also relied on this contention to further argue that this demonstrated that
                    paragraph 20 of the Arrest Affidavit was misleading and constituted material
                    non-disclosure but that is a separate issue which is addressed below at [109] to
                    [113].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Returning to the main question of whether the
                    111 containers were leased under the 2010 CLC. The Plaintiff accepted that the
                    99 containers were picked up by the Defendants before the execution of the 2010
                    CLC. However they argued that this did not detract from the fact that so far as
                    the Defendants continued to lease the containers for use on their ships, the 111
                    containers were leased pursuant to the 2010 CLC once the 2010 CLC had come into
                    effect between the parties. The Plaintiff relied mainly on the Defendant’s
                    letter dated 10 March 2011 wherein the Defendant themselves had written to the
                    Plaintiffs to inform them that their 111 containers leased under the 2010 CLC
                    had been on board the “Phu Tan” and were a “total
                    loss” as a result of the sinking of the “Phu Tan” on 16
                    December 2010. The Plaintiff further contended that the Defendant had by their
                    conduct all along accepted that the 111 containers were leased pursuant to the
                    2010 CLC and had only now belatedly raised this as an issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     On the available evidence, I am satisfied that
                    the 111 containers were leased under the 2010 CLC. The clearest evidence in my
                    view, is the Defendant’s own letter dated 10 March 2011 informing the
                    Plaintiff that the 111 containers leased under the 2010 CLC and which were on
                    board the “Phu Tan” were a total loss as a result of the sinking
                    of the “Phu Tan”. The fact that 99 of the 111 containers were
                    already in the Defendant’s possession prior to the execution of the 2010
                    CLC is equivocal at best. It does not conclusively prove that the 99 containers
                    did not come within the scope of the 2010 CLC. On the contrary, the
                    Defendant’s letter dated 10 March 2011 pointed clearly to the
                    parties’ intentions and understanding that the 111 containers did come
                    within the ambit of the 2010 CLC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(e) - Whether the container loading list of the Tan Thuan Port record
                database in Tab 10 of the Arrest Affidavit is authentic</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The dispute here was on the authenticity of
                    the container loading list which was exhibited at Tab 10 of the Arrest Affidavit
                    (“Container Loading List”). In the Arrest Affidavit, the Plaintiff
                    had relied on this Container Loading List to show that the 111 containers were
                    carried on board the Phu Tan on that ill-fated voyage. The Defendant argued that
                    the Container Loading List was not an authentic document. In the affidavit of
                    Nguyen Ngoc Thuy Van dated 7 April 2014, the Defendant exhibited a letter from
                    one Mr Mai Van Cu, who is said to be a director of the Tan Thuan Port
                    authorities and in this letter, Mr Mai stated that the Tan Thuan Port
                    “didn’t supply the container Loading List that loaded on the M.V
                    Phu Tan to Hung Dao Container Joint Stock Company”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Plaintiff argued in response that the
                    Container Loading List exhibited at Tab 10 of their Arrest Affidavit was
                    authentic and was supplied by the Tan Thuan Port Authorities. They referred to
                    the email correspondence found at pg 124 of the Arrest Affidavit which shows an
                    email sent from the “Tan Thuan Port, Container Operation
                    Department” to the Plaintiff’s operation manager Mr Hieu, which
                    purports to enclose the Container Loading List as an attachment. The Plaintiff
                    further contended that taken at face value, the letter from Mr Mai which the
                    Defendants’ relied on does not clearly show whether it was speaking in
                    relation to the Container Loading List for the particular voyage of the
                    “Phu Tan” on which it sank or for some other voyage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     On the available evidence, I am prepared to
                    accept that the Container Loading List exhibited in the Arrest Affidavit was
                    provided by the Tan Thuan Port and is authentic for the following reasons.
                    First, the Defendant’s own 10 March 2011 letter sent to the Plaintiff
                    identified the 111 containers and these 111 containers correspond to the records
                    in the Container Loading List. Second, there is no forensic evidence to suggest
                    that the email from “Tan Thuan Port, Container Operation
                    Department” or the attached Container Loading List was falsified. As for
                    the letter from Mr Mai (relied upon by the Defendant), I would agree with the
                    Plaintiff that is unclear as to whether it related to the particular voyage of
                    the “Phu Tan” on which it sank. Even if I accepted, for the
                    benefit of the Defendant, that the letter from Mr Mai was in relation to the
                    particular ill-fated voyage of the “Phu Tan”, then the Defendant
                    has at best raised conflicting affidavit evidence on this point before me and
                    all things considered I would find that the Container Loading List exhibited at
                    Tab 10 of the Plaintiff’s Arrest Affidavit is authentic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Having addressed, what is in my view, the
                    relevant jurisdictional facts the Plaintiff relied upon to establish admiralty
                    jurisdiction under section 3(1)(l), I turn now to examine the centrepiece of the
                    Plaintiff’s arguments on the invocation of admiralty jurisdiction under
                    section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(f) and (g) – Is the Plaintiff’s claim arguably of the
                type and nature contemplated under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The parties’ arguments centred on
                        <em>The “River Rima”</em>[1988] 2
                    Lloyd’s Rep 193 (<em>“The River
                        Rima”</em>) where the House of Lords examined section 20(2)(m)
                    of the Supreme Court Act 1981 which is in <em>pari
                        materia</em> to section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A). The other key
                    authorities relied upon by the Plaintiff’s counsel were the Australian
                    authorities of <em>The “Bass Reefer”</em>
                    [1992] FCA 378 (<em>“The Bass Reefer”</em>)
                    and <em>Patrick Steverdores No 2 Pty Ltd v MV
                        “Turakina”</em> [1998] FCA 16900 (<em>“The Turakina”)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     As to proposition (f), the Plaintiff’s
                    counsel submitted that containers have been held to be “goods”
                    within the meaning of section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A and that the court in
                        <em>The River Rima</em> (at 763B) was prepared to
                    accept without deciding the point that the use of a container on board a ship
                    designed to carry containers is a use for the operation of such a ship. The
                    Defendant did not dispute this and I accept this as correct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The main dispute was in relation to
                    proposition (g). In essence, Plaintiff’s counsel’s submission was
                    premised on the legal proposition that to bring a claim under section 3(1)(l) of
                    the HC(AJ)A, there is no need for the ship to which the containers are to be
                    supplied to be identified in the contract of supply <em>or even
                        at the time of performance of the contract of supply</em> so long as
                        <em>at the time of the actual supply to the ship, the ship is
                        sufficiently identified</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I set out the key passage in <em>The River Rima</em> (at 763C) for consideration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“It is clear that paragraph (m) contemplates a contract of supply,
                        whether by sale or hire, between the claimant and a shipowner. But the
                        expression used in paragraph (m) is “supplied to a ship” and
                        not “supplied to a shipowner”. The question is what meaning
                        should be given to the former expression. There are two main kinds of
                        contract pursuant to which goods or materials required for the operation of
                        a ship may reach her. The <em>first kind of
                            contract</em> is one which <em>expressly
                            provides</em> that the goods or materials are required for the use
                        of <em>a particular ship</em>, the identity of which is
                            <em>specified in the contract</em> or <em>will be specified</em> by the <em>time the
                            contract comes to be performed</em>. The <em>second
                            kind of contract</em> is one which contains no reference to a
                        particular ship for the use of which goods or materials are required,
                        leaving the shipowner to make his own decision about that later. The first
                        kind of contract is, in my opinion, a contract under which goods or
                        materials are “supplied to a ship” within the meaning of par.
                        (m)”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphases added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In my understanding, the Plaintiff’s
                    counsel’s arguments proceeded as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>The River
                            Rima</em> requirement (at 763C) was that for there to be goods
                        “supplied to a ship” within the meaning of the jurisdictional
                        limb, the identity of the particular ship should be specified in the supply
                        contract or <em>will be specified by the time when the
                            contract comes to be performed</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     The court in <em>The Bass
                            Reefer</em> considered <em>The River
                            Rima</em> and concluded that the specification of the ship need
                        not be express but <em>could be implied from the
                            circumstances</em> at the <em>time when the supply
                            was actually made to the ship</em>. The matter must be looked at
                        the time the services were supplied and the question determined at that
                        time, whether as a question of fact there was a supply to a ship within the
                        meaning of the jurisdictional limb.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_c"></a>(c)     The court in <em>The Turakina</em>
                        applied the approach of implied identification of the ship as set out in the
                            <em>The Bass Reefer</em> and agreed that the
                        question was whether <em>at the time the services are
                            provided</em> (and not at the time the contract is entered into),
                        there was sufficient identification of the ship.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_d"></a>(d)     It did not matter that the 2010 CLC
                        did not specifically identify the “Phu Tan” or that the
                        containers were earlier loaded onto other ships, as at the material time,
                        the “Phu Tan” was in fact identified as the ship on which the
                        111 containers were supplied to and this is evidenced by the Container
                        Loading List from the Than Thuan Port authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Plaintiff’s claim did not
                        fall within <em>The River Rima</em> situation and on
                        the authority of <em>The Bass Reefer</em> and <em>The Turakina</em>, the claim arguably is one in respect
                        of goods “supplied to a ship”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The Defendant’s counsel disagreed with
                    Plaintiff’s submissions. His key argument was that the 2010 CLC was always
                    a contract of the second kind as described in <em>The River
                        Rima</em>. He further argued that even in the implied identification
                    test employed in <em>The Bass Reefer</em>, it remained a
                    requirement that the supply was to be limited to “a particular
                    ship” and would not avail the Plaintiff as their 2010 CLC was, even by
                    their own translation, a contract for the supply of containers to the
                    Defendants’ ships and not limited specifically to the “Phu
                    Tan”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     On this issue, I hold that the Plaintiff
                        <em>does not</em> have an arguable case that their
                    claim falls within the ambit of section 3(1)(d) of the HC(AJ)A. My analysis
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>The River
                            Rima</em> essentially distinguished between services rendered to a
                        shipowner and services rendered to the ship itself. The court there first
                        recognised that this jurisdictional limb contemplated a contract of supply,
                        it then drew the distinction between a supply contract which was a contract
                        for the provision of services to a ship (the first kind of contract) and a
                        supply contract which was in reality a contract for the provision of
                        services to a shipowner (the second kind of contract). In analysing when the
                        first kind of contract existed, the court explained that this would be the
                        case where the ship was specifically identified in the supply contract
                        itself or where the identity of the ship was specified by <em>the time the supply contract came to be performed</em>. It should
                        be noted that the Singapore courts have, in <em>The
                            “Alexandrea”</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 812 at [29]
                            (<em>“The Alexandrea”</em>),
                        specifically referred to <em>The River Rima</em>
                        analysis on the first kind of contract and accepted it as
                    correct;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_b"></a>(b)     In my
                        reading, <em>The Bass Reefer</em> and subsequently
                            <em>The Turakina</em> accepted the distinction
                        observed in <em>The River Rima</em> and added that the
                        specification of the ship need not be expressly specified as between the
                        contracting parties but could be <em>implied from the
                            circumstances</em> which existed <em>at the time of
                            performance of the supply contract</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_c"></a>(c)     It appears to me that the error in the
                        Plaintiff’s arguments was that it misunderstood the <em>The Bass Reefer</em> and <em>The
                            Turakina</em> to stand for the proposition that the implied
                        identification was to be assessed at the time when <em>the
                            containers was supplied to the ship</em> as opposed to the
                            <em>time of performance of the supply
                        contract</em>. In my reading, it was clear in <em>The
                            Bass Reefer</em> that the inquiry into whether there was implied
                        identification still remained to be assessed at “the time of
                            <em>performance of the contract of
                        supply</em>” and the other statements by the court such as
                        “when supply was actually made to the ship” or “was
                        there supply to a ship” must be understood in this context. In
                        particular, the court there stated at [38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“His Lordship’s use of the expression “or will be
                            specified by the time the contract comes to be performed” does
                            not, in my respectful opinion, mean that his Lordship was laying down a
                            requirement that there should be some express specification by the
                            contracting parties of the identity of the ship <em>at
                                the time of performance of the contract of supply</em>. Such
                            specification could occur by way of implication from the circumstances
                            obtaining at the time when supply was actually made to the ship,
                            especially where the act of supplying was performed by the supplier
                            himself and not, as in The River Rima, by the other party to the
                            contract in exercise of an independent discretion”</p>

                            time of performance of the contract to supply <em>services</em>. This is different from the Plaintiff’s
                            case which pertains to a contract for the supply of goods (i.e.

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_e"></a>(e)     On the Plaintiff’s case, the 2010 CLC is a
                        contract for the supply of containers. The key question therefore is when is
                        the <em>time of performance of this contract of
                            supply</em>? In my view, the evidence is clear that the time of
                        performance of the contract of supply is the point in time when the
                        containers are supplied to and collected by the Defendant from the
                        Plaintiff’s depots and not at the time when the collected containers
                        are subsequently physically loaded onto any of the Defendant’s ships
                        for various voyages during the period of their lease. The terms of the 2010
                        CLC bear this out:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_72-p2_e-p3_i"></a>(i)       Art 1.4 of the 2010 CLC (as
                            translated by the Plaintiff) states “Delivery location: At Party
                            A’s depots”. This indicates that the point of delivery and
                            supply is at the Plaintiff’s depots.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_72-p2_e-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       This is fortified by Art 2.2 which
                            provides that the Plaintiff would charge the leasing fee when the
                            Defendant picked up the containers out of the Plaintiff’s depots.
                            In other words, the Plaintiff would charge the Defendant for the lease
                            of the containers as soon as they were picked up from its depots and not
                            only when they were placed on the Defendant’s ships. Logic
                            dictates the Plaintiff can only charge the leasing fee for their
                            containers at the point when the Plaintiff has first performed its key
                            obligation under the 2010 CLC to supply the containers to the
                            Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_f"></a>(f)     There was no evidence to show that there was implied
                        identification of the <em>“Phu Tan”</em>
                        under the 2010 CLC at <em>the time of performance of the 2010
                            CLC</em>. Rather, at the time the containers were supplied to the
                        Defendant and picked up from the Plaintiff’s depots, it was recorded
                        in the majority of the EIR and booking orders that the containers would be
                        used on various ships (including the “Phu Tan”) belonging to
                        the Defendant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_g"></a>(g)     I agree with the Defendant’s counsel that the 2010 CLC was clearly a
                        contract of the second kind contemplated in <em>The River
                            Rima</em>, i.e. a contract for the supply of goods to a shipowner
                        i.e. the Defendant. The evidence showed that once the containers are picked
                        up by the Defendant, they are then put onto various ships on various voyages
                        at the discretion of the Defendant. True it was that the 111 containers
                        ultimately were loaded onto the Phu Tan on the ill-fated journey, but that
                        does not change the fact that it was loaded on the Phu Tan at the discretion
                        of the Defendant and that these same containers had in the past been loaded
                        onto various other ships also at the discretion of the
                    Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Based on the foregoing analysis, I find that
                    the Plaintiff’s claim <em>does not</em> fall within
                    section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     As I earlier observed, so long as jurisdiction
                    was found under any of the limbs in section 3(1)(d), (g) or (l), it would
                    suffice to bring the claim within the admiralty jurisdiction of the court. I
                    have found that the Plaintiff’s claim falls within section 3(1)(d) of the
                    HC(AJ)A and in the final analysis, I find that the admiralty jurisdiction of the
                    court was properly and validly invoked.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Whether the Plaintiffs’ claim should be struck out
                under O 18 r 19 of the ROC and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I turn to examine the Defendant’s
                    application for striking out. The Defendant contended that the Plaintiffs’
                    claim was frivolous and vexatious and is liable to be struck out under O 18 r
                    19(1)(b) or under the court’s inherent jurisdiction on the grounds
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a>(a)     first the Plaintiff’s claim
                        was time-barred; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a>(b)     second that so far as the non-contractual claims were concerned,
                        there was “not a shred of evidence” to support these claims,
                        and there is no evidence of “double
                    actionability”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The interplay of legal principles involved in
                    setting aside an arrest, striking out and material non-disclosure was explained
                    with admirable clarity by the High Court in <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em> [2010] 3 SLR 294 (<em>“The Eagle
                        Prestige”</em>) and <em>The Bunga Melati
                        5</em> [2011] 4 SLR 1017 (<em>“The Bunga Melati
                        5 (HC”</em>). These principles were endorsed by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>The Bunga Melati 5</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“96. …when a plaintiff’s invoking of admiralty
                        jurisdiction or its arrest of the defendant’s vessel was subsequently
                        challenged, the plaintiff would need to show (on tope of the requirements of
                        ss 3 and 4 of the HCAJA being satisfied) a <em>good arguable
                            case on the merits of its claim as well, in order to avoid having its

                            obviously unsustainable pursuant to the normal rules in civil
                            procedure</em>. Should the plaintiff’s cause of action be so
                        unsustainable on the merits, as was the case in <em>The
                            Vasiliy Golovnin (HC)</em>, a court would on an application being
                        made have to strike out the Plaintiff’s action at an early stage under
                        O 18 r 19 of the ROC or the inherent jurisdiction of the
                        court…</p>

<em>98.</em> Indeed, <em>there is much
                            to commend the clear distinction drawn by the Judge between challenging
                            admiralty jurisdiction under O12 r 7 of the ROC vis-à-vis striking out a
                            plaintiff’s claim under O 18 r 19 of the ROC or the inherent
                            jurisdiction of the court.</em> Drawing this distinction
                        solidifies the established position that a plaintiff need not prove who
                        “the person who would be liable on the claim in an action in
                        personam” is (i.e. the “in personam liability
                        requirement” under s 4(4)b of the HCAJA) for the purposes of
                        establishing admiralty jurisdiction until the defendant subsequently
                        challenges the plaintiff’s action…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">100. This distinction can be logically defended and provides analytical
                        clarity to this area of law. As the Judge correctly recognised,
                        “[j]urisdictional disputes were necessarily separate from, and
                        logically prior to, the substantive, non-jurisdictional dispute between the
                        parties over the issue of the defendant’s liability (<em>ie</em>, the merits of the plaintiff’s
                        claim)”…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">104. To sum up the discussion above, we agree with the Judge that this
                        court in <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em> (CA) did not
                        introduce a new merits requirement before admiralty jurisdiction could be
                        invoked under the HCAJA. An admiralty plaintiff would, however, still need
                        to show a good arguable case on the merits of its claim if challenged; not
                        for the purposes of satisfying the HCAJA, but to prevent its action from
                        being struck out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC or the inherent jurisdiction of
                        the court.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphases added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     It is trite that the burden lies on the
                    applicant to show that a plaintiff’s case is so unsustainable on the
                    merits that it should be struck out. The authorities are also clear that this is
                    a heavy burden. In the context of a striking out of an admiralty claim, the High
                    Court in <em>The Eagle Prestige</em> noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“57. It is at this stage of striking out application that the court
                        is asked to assess the sustainability of the action. It is at this stage of
                        the striking out application that the validity or strength of the claim will
                        be relevant, and the <em>burden on the issue of non-liability
                            lies on the defendant</em> to show that the case is <em>wholly and clearly unarguable</em>. If there is <em>any arguable basis</em> put up by the plaintiff that the
                        action could succeed then the <em>court should not order the
                            striking out of the action</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     As to the question of when an action is
                    plainly or obviously unsustainable, the Court of Appeal’s guidance in
                        <em>The Bunga Melati 5</em> at [33] – [39] is
                    apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“39. In our view, this analytical, fact-law distinction can
                        similarly be applied to O18 r 19(1)(b) of the ROC or the inherent
                        jurisdiction of the court to strike out unsustainable actions. Such a
                        distinction helps to more clearly elucidate what a court means when it holds
                        than an action is “plainly or obviously” unsustainable.
                        Applying this conceptual prism, a “plainly or obviously”
                        unsustainable action would be one which is either:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>legally unsustainable</em>: If “it may be
                        clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party were to succeed
                        in proving all the facts that he offers to prove he will not be entitled to
                        the remedy that he seek”; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>factually unsustainable</em>: If it is

                        example, if it is] clear beyond question that the statement of facts is
                        contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Time Bar Defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The Defendant’s primary attack in
                    relation to its striking out challenge appeared to be its defence of time bar
                    and I examine this first. The following preliminary points should be dealt with
                    at the outset. First, the parties did not dispute that the substantive claims
                    and defences raised were subject to Vietnamese law. Secondly, it is trite that
                    matters of foreign law are treated as factual matters (see <em>The “H156”</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 419 at [27], endorsed
                    by the Court of Appeal in <em>Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace
                        (trading as Caesars Palace)</em> [2010] 1 SLR 1129), and I do not
                    understand parties to have contended otherwise. Thirdly, in relation to the
                    Defendant’s arguments on its time bar defence, it was also not disputed by
                    parties that under the Foreign Limitations Periods Act Rev. Ed. 2013 (cap.
                    111A), foreign time bars (in this case the time bar under Vietnamese law) are
                    applicable in relation to the Singapore actions or proceedings. <em>Insofar as the time bar defence is concerned, the question before
                        me is whether it is plain and obvious that the Plaintiff’s claim
                        commenced on 4 June 2013 is legally unsustainable because as a matter of
                        fact it is time-barred under Vietnamese law.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In essence, the Defendant argued, relying on
                    the evidence provided by their Vietnamese law expert, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Defendant had a complete defence
                        of time-bar in relation to the Singapore action;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Plaintiff’s expert’s
                        evidence was wrong, inconsistent and unreliable;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Plaintiff’s expert, Dr Luu
                        Tien Dzung was not objective and dishonest;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_80-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Defendant’s expert’s evidence on
                        the applicability of the time bar defence is cogent and “is to be
                        preferred”. The claim is time-barred and must be struck out unless
                        [the Plaintiff] can prove otherwise”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     According to the Plaintiff’s expert, the
                    Plaintiff’s claim was not time-barred as a matter of Vietnamese law. The
                    Plaintiff’s expert explained in two affidavits that the Plaintiff’s
                    claim was not time barred:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Plaintiff’s claim arising
                        out of the Defendant’s failure to make compensation for the 111
                        containers was not time-barred as the Plaintiff’s rights were
                        infringed on 3 April 2012 and the two year limitation period would therefore
                        expire on 3 April 2014 (Plaintiff’s first time bar argument”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_b"></a>(b)     under
                        Vietnamese law, the nature of the Plaintiff’s claim is for the return
                        of leased containers under the management and/or possession of the
                        Defendants and there is no time bar for such actions
                        (“Plaintiffs’ second time bar
                argument”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     I do not propose to enter into a minute
                    examination of each of the experts’ opposing views, or the documents and
                    the facts they rely on. The Court of Appeal in <em>Gabriel Peters
                        &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R)
                    649 at [18] explained that such an exercise was not appropriate in the context
                    of a striking out application. The Court of Appeal in <em>The
                        Bunga Melati 5</em>, after its illuminating analytical formulation of
                    the test of sustainability of an action, stated at [45] that “save in the
                    plainest of cases, a court should not in a striking out application choose
                    between conflicting accounts of crucial facts”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The conflicting evidence presented by the
                    parties’ experts raise in essence a factual dispute (evidence on foreign
                    law being matters of fact). The Defendant’s arguments essentially sought
                    to persuade this court to resolve this key factual dispute conclusively in their
                    favour and thereafter to find that the Plaintiffs’ action was therefore
                        <em>legally unsustainable</em>. I am unable to do so.
                    In my assessment, the Plaintiff’s expert as well as the Defendant’s
                    expert presented their evidence on the Vietnamese time bar with reasonable
                    clarity and with sufficient analysis of the supporting provisions of Vietnamese
                    law such as the various articles in the Vietnamese Civil Code (Art 427, 490.1,
                    303.1), Commercial law (Art 271.2), Supplemental Civil Procedure Code (Art
                    159.3), Art 23.3(b) of the Resolution 3 of the “Resolution of the
                    Justices’ Council of the Supreme People’s Court no.
                    03/2012/NQ-HDTP” (“Resolution 3”) as well as to the
                    underlying facts. A brief examination of the conflicting evidence presented to
                    the court in relation to the Plaintiff’s second time bar argument will
                    illustrate the above point:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Plaintiffs’ expert’s
                        evidence began with an analysis of Art 490.1 of the Civil Code, Art 271.2 of
                        the Commercial Law and Art 303.1 of the Civil Code. These provisions
                        state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Article 490.1 of the Civil Code:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">Article 490. Return of leased property</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">1. The lessee must return the leased property in the same
                                condition as when received, except for natural wear, or in the
                                condition agreed upon in the contract; if the value of the leased
                                property has decreased as compared with its original condition upon
                                receipt, the lessor shall be entitled to demand compensation for
                                damage, except for natural wear.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Article 271.2 of the Commercial Law:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">Article 271. Rights and obligations of lessees</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">2. To maintain and preserve leased goods in the lease duration and
                                return such goods to lessors upon the expiration of the lease
                                duration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Article 303.1 of the Civil Code:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">Article 303. Civil liability for failure to perform the obligation
                                to hand over objects</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">1. When the obligor fails to perform the obligation to hand over a
                                distinctive object, the obligee is entitled to demand the obligor to
                                hand over that exact object; if the object no longer exists or is
                                damaged, the obligor must pay for the value of the object</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Plaintiff’s expert’s evidence is that Art 490.1 of the Civil
                        Code and Art 271.2 of the Commercial Law demonstrate that as a matter of
                        Vietnamese law, the <em>nature</em> of the
                        Plaintiffs’ claim can be said to be one for the return of leased
                        property by the Defendants. He goes on to explain that Art 303.1 of the
                        Civil Code further provides that a plaintiff making a claim <em>in the nature</em> of the return of the leased property
                        is entitled to ask for <em>relief</em> in the form of
                        compensation of the value of the leased property where the leased property
                        no longer exists. As to the facts, he explained with reference, <em>inter alia</em>, to correspondence between the Plaintiffs
                        and the Defendants as well as the Statement of Claim filed in the Singapore
                        proceedings that the Plaintiffs’ had been claiming for a return of the
                        leased property or failing which compensation for the
                    same;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        Plaintiff’s expert’s further explained that, relying on Art
                        159.3 of the Supplemental Civil Procedure Code and Art 23.3(b) of Resolution
                        3 of the “Resolution of the Justices’ Council of the Supreme
                        People’s Court no. 03/2012/NQ-HDTP” (“Resolution
                        3”), there is no time bar in relation to claims for the return of
                        leased properties and that Example 2 of Resolution 3 makes clear the
                        distinction between disputes where the underlying claim is over contractual
                        terms of the property lease (which are subject to the statute of limitations
                        under Art 427 of the Civil Code) and disputes where the underlying claim is
                        for the return of leased property (which are not subject to any statute of
                        limitations). These provisions state:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-3">[emphases added]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_d"></a>(d)     To
                        the contrary, the Defendant’s expert contended that Art 490, Civil
                        Code and Art 271.2, Commercial Law were to be understood as referring only
                        to situations where there was a “dispute over rights to ownership,
                        possession or management of the 111 containers”, and that Art 303.1,
                        Civil Code, shows that the Plaintiffs’ claim is “for
                        compensation for the loss of containers” and not for “a claim
                        back” of leased property. Further. the Defendant’s
                        expert’s evidence was that Art 159.3 of the Supplemental Civil
                        Procedure Code only applied if there were no other provisions under
                        Vietnamese law which were applicable, and that Art 159.3(a) only applied
                        where the “dispute concerns ownership, possession or management
                        dispute and land rights”. He contended that the phrase
                        “disputes over claim back of the properties under others’
                        management or in others’ possession” as it appeared in Art
                        159.3(a) should be understood as limited to situations where there was an
                        underlying dispute over rights of ownership, management or
                        possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_e"></a>(e)     Ultimately, what can be said is that on the available evidence, the
                        parties’ experts’ views on the time bar defence under Vietnamese
                        law were diametrically opposed but each offered a <em>plausible</em> interpretation and explanation of the relevant
                        Vietnamese statutory provisions based on the plain words of the provisions.
                        It was not possible to decide conclusively in favour of one interpretation
                        or the other and I saw no compelling reasons to prefer the evidence of one
                        expert over the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In submissions, both counsel for the Plaintiff
                    as well as counsel for the Defendant sought to rebut and cast doubt on the
                    evidence of the opposing party’s experts. Much time was spent by counsel
                    arguing on the plausibility and implausibility of the opposing experts’
                    construction of the language in the Vietnamese statutory provisions in question.
                    Attempts were also made to discredit the respective experts. In particular,
                    Defendant’s counsel submitted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Plaintiffs’ expert was
                        lacking in <em>credibility</em> because his new
                        evidence on the Plaintiffs’ second time bar argument conveniently
                        emerged only by way of a subsequent affidavit filed after the initial close
                        of submissions in May 2014; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_84-p2_b"></a>(b)     insofar as the Plaintiff’s expert had explained
                        that he had, only after giving his first opinion (in his affidavit filed on
                        5 September 2013), come across these further Vietnamese regulations which
                        formed the basis for the Plaintiff’s second time bar argument, the
                        Defendants’ expert witness and the Defendant’s counsel cast
                        doubt on the <em>competency</em> of the
                        Plaintiff’s expert for not being aware of these regulations which had
                        been in force for more than a year before the Plaintiff’s expert
                        provided his first opinion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Even If I may be prepared to go so far as to
                    accept that there are elements of doubt in the competency of the
                    Plaintiffs’ expert or in the circumstances relating to the emergence of
                    the Plaintiffs’ expert’s evidence on the Plaintiffs’ second
                    time bar argument, I find that this is not the “plainest of cases”
                    such that a court should in a striking out application “choose between
                    conflicting accounts of crucial facts” (to paraphrase the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>The Bunga Melati 5</em> at [45]). The crucial fact
                    in dispute here was the applicability of the time bar defence as a matter of
                    Vietnamese law. This critical factual dispute as well as doubts/challenges as to
                    the competency or credibility of the expert witnesses are matters that should
                    properly be tested at trial and be decided, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, on the basis of cross-examination of the witnesses and/or
                    in light of further documentary evidence that may surface in discovery. In the
                    premises, I find that the Defendant has not shown that the Plaintiff’s
                    claim is plainly and obviously unsustainable because of the Defendant’s
                    complete time bar defence under Vietnamese law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     For completeness, I should say a word about
                    the Plaintiff’s first time bar argument. Although fairly extensive
                    arguments and opposing affidavit evidence was presented by parties in relation
                    to this issue, I saw no need, for the purposes of determining this particular
                    point, to examine the arguments in any great detail. Had I required to, I would
                    venture to say that, by comparison with the Plaintiff’s second time bar
                    argument, the Defendant’s counsel had perhaps raised more elements of
                    doubt in relation to the cogency of the Plaintiff’s first time bar
                    argument. Yet again, however, I would have found no compelling reasons to
                    conclusively prefer the evidence of one expert over the other and would see this
                    as a critical factual dispute that would more properly be reserved to be tested
                    at trial. In the final analysis, I am satisfied that there is a factual dispute
                    as to whether the Plaintiff’s claim was time-barred under Vietnamese law
                    and it cannot be said that the Singapore proceedings was legally
                    unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">There was“not a shred of evidence” to support the
                non-contractual claim, and there is no evidence of “double
                actionability”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The Defendant’s second ground for
                    striking out the Plaintiff’s action can be more briefly dealt with. The
                    Defendants’ argued that in relation to the non-contractual claims (i.e.
                    the claims for conversion, wrongful interference, negligence, breach of duty),
                    these were plainly unsustainable as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_a"></a>(a)     “the arrest
                        affidavit…did not provide any basis for these claims [and that]
                        [t]here is not a shred of evidence to support these non-contractual
                        claims”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_87-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Plaintiffs have provided no evidence to show that they satisfy the
                        “Double Actionability Rule” and insofar as the
                        Plaintiffs’ expert appeared to concede that these non-contractual
                        claims could not be made in Vietnam, then it followed that they could not be
                        brought in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The Defendant’s first argument appeared
                    to proceed on an incorrect understanding of the Court of Appeal’s
                    statements in <em>The Bunga Melati 5</em> at [115] which
                    read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“…although a court should address the sustainability of a
                        plaintiff’s action only upon a defendant’s application to
                        challenge the plaintiff’s writ or warrant of arrest, this does not
                        mean that the plaintiff should have a carte blanche right to arrest vessels
                        without having to show a shred of evidence justifying the connection between
                        the “relevant person” and the alleged defendant <em>prior to be being challenged</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The Defendant’s argued, based on the
                    above statement (at [115] in <em>The Bunga Melati 5</em>),
                    that “the arrest affidavit did not provide any basis for these
                    claims”, that “there is not a shred of evidence to support these
                    non-contractual claims” and further that “these non-contractual
                    claims are liable to be struck out on the <em>separate
                        grounds</em> stated by the CA” [emphasis added]. However, as
                    counsel for the Plaintiff rightly submitted, in the above passage as well as in
                    the preceding text in [114] of <em>The Bunga Melati</em> 5,
                    the Court of Appeal was discussing the <em>jurisdictional
                        requirement</em> and opining that <em>at an arrest
                        hearing</em>, a plaintiff would still have to show at least some basic
                    evidence to justify the connection between the “relevant person”
                    and the alleged defendant. The Court of Appeal in no way suggested that at the
                    arrest hearing or in the arrest affidavit, a plaintiff would have to adduce
                    evidence going to support the <em>merits</em> of its claim,
                    and that a failure to do so would be a “separate ground” to strike
                    out of the action. Accordingly, there is no basis for the Defendant’s
                    contention that the non-contractual claims are unsustainable because the
                    Plaintiff provided no evidence to support it in their Arrest
                Affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     It should be noted that the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>The Bunga Melati 5</em> had earlier on (in [33] to
                    [39]) set out, with clarity, its guidance on when an action was plainly and
                    obviously sustainable so as to justify a striking out, explaining when an action
                    was <em>legally unsustainable</em> and when an action could
                    be said to be <em>factually unsustainable</em>. Insofar as
                    the Defendant was contending that the Plaintiff’s non-contractual claims
                    are <em>factually unsustainable</em> (and this is not clear
                    from the Defendant’s submissions), then I would also reject this as, I
                    agree with the Plaintiff that there was sufficient evidence to support an
                    arguable case for the Plaintiff’s non-contractual claims:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, it is not disputed that the
                        111 containers were placed on board the Defendants’ ship and in their
                        care and custody when they were lost due to the sinking of the
                    ship;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_90-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, the
                        Investigation Conclusion dated 15 March 2011 issued by the Hai Phong Port
                        authority stated <em>inter alia</em> that the poor
                        navigation of the ship and inappropriate actions taken by the master and
                        crew in the navigation or operation of the ship led to the sinking and loss
                        of the containers. The Defendant may have put into dispute the contents of
                        the Investigation Conclusion by referring to a later letter issued by the
                        same authority which they asserted showed that the “proximate
                        cause” of the sinking was due to the bad weather, however the mere
                        raising of such a factual dispute does not show that there was no factual
                        basis for the claim. This is not a case where it can be said with confidence
                        before trial that the factual basis for the non-contractual claims are
                        entirely without substance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Defendant’s further argument on the
                    “Double Actionability Rule” is also misconceived. Parties did not
                    dispute that the “Double Actionability Rule” required a plaintiff
                    to show that their claims are actionable under both Singapore law and the law of
                    the other relevant jurisdiction (counsel for the Defendant citing <em>Low Tuck Kwong v Sukamto SIA</em> [2013] 1 SLR 1016 for this
                    proposition). The Defendant’s arguments really only amounted to this
                    – that the Plaintiff adduced no evidence to satisfy the “Double
                    Actionability Rule” and that the Plaintiff’s expert’s
                    evidence “appeared to say that non-contractual claims cannot be made in
                    Vietnam”. However, as rightly pointed out by counsel for the Plaintiff,
                    the Plaintiff’s expert Dr Luu Tien Dzung had in fact presented clear
                    evidence in his affidavit dated 5 Sep 2013 that the non-contractual claims
                    existed and were actionable under Vietnamese law. The relevant portion of his
                    affidavit read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“12. I further note that the claims made in the Singapore
                        proceedings includes claims which are contractual i.e. for breach of the
                        terms of the CLC. <em>It also includes claims which fall
                            outside the contract such as claims based on negligence, breach of duty,
                            bailment and conversion</em> … Insofar as the claims which
                        fall outside the contract are concerned, <em>Vietnamese law
                            classifies such claims generally as “non-contractual damage
                            claims</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphases added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     It is therefore clear to me that the
                    Defendant’s argument that there was no evidence showing that
                    non-contractual claims are actionable under Vietnamese law was misconceived and
                    its arguments in relation to the point on the “Double Actionability
                    Rule” are without merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: Was there material non-disclosure by the Plaintiffs in the
                Arrest Affidavit and at the Arrest Hearing so as to justify setting aside the
                admiralty writ</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     I turn now to the Defendant’s final
                    string in its legal bow. The Defendant’s counsel argued that the arrest
                    should be set aside on the basis of material non-disclosure by the Plaintiffs
                    both in the Arrest Affidavit as well as at the Arrest Hearing. By my count,
                    Defendant’s counsel set out a list of 8 alleged non-disclosures and
                    misleading/false statements and documents. I go first to the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It was not in dispute that material
                    non-disclosure is an independent ground for setting aside a warrant of arrest.
                    The duty to make full and frank disclosure to the court was an important bulwark
                    against the abuse of the arrest process.: <em>The “Rainbow
                        Spring”</em> [2003] 3 SLR (R) 362 (<em>“Rainbow Spring”</em>) at [37]. It is also settled law
                    that the court retains an overriding discretion whether or not to set aside an
                    arrest for non-disclosure: <em>The “Vasiliy
                        Golovnin”</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 (“<em>The Vasiliy</em>”) at [84] endorsing <em>The
                        “Ferbienti”</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 574 (<em>“The Ferbienti</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In <em>The Vasiliy</em>,
                    the Court of Appeal explained at [82] that the issue of material non-disclosure
                    should be examined from two aspects: <em>first</em>, what
                    ought to have been disclosed i.e. <em>content and scope of
                        disclosure</em>, and <em>second</em>, the
                    sufficiency of disclosure i.e. <em>the threshold of
                        disclosure</em>. As to the content and scope of disclosure, the Court
                    of Appeal stated at [87]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“87. The <em>test of materiality is always an
                            objective one</em>. In the words of Prakash J in <em>The Rainbow Spring</em>, the test is simply to ask
                            “<em>how relevant the fact is</em>”
                        [emphasis added](at [33]). However, <em>the duty imposed on
                            the applicant requires him to ask what might be relevant to the court in
                            its assessment of whether or not the remedy should be
                        granted</em>, and not what the applicant alone might think is
                        relevant. <em>This inevitably embraces matters, both factual
                            and legal, which may be prejudicial or disadvantageous to the successful
                            outcome of the applicant’s application.</em> It extends to
                            <em>all material facts that could be reasonably
                            ascertained and defences that might be reasonably raised by the
                            defendant</em>. It is important to stress, however, that the
                            <em>duty extends only to plausible, and not all
                            conceivable or theoretical defences</em>. For example, if there
                        have been unsuccessful prior proceedings, the context as well as the reasons
                        for the dismissal must be adequately disclosed. In short, the material facts
                        are those which are material to enable the judge to make an informed
                        decision”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphases added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em> at [72], the Honourable Justice Belinda Ang had occasion
                    to analyse the reference to “plausible defence” in <em>The Vasiliy</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“72. In my view, the expression “<em>plausible defences</em>” has to be understood in the light
                        of the realities of the situation in <em>The Vasiliy Golvnin
                            (CA)</em>. The claim was held to be “<em>really implausibl</em>e” and unsustainable; the point that
                        the cause of action was frivolous and vexatious could easily be taken and
                        determined summarily based on plainly cogent affidavit evidence. In a way,
                        the expression “<em>plausible
                        defences</em>” is being used loosely; the meaning of
                            “<em>plausible defences</em>” may be
                        culled from the context and surrounding circumstances. First, <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin</em> (CA) was a case falling under
                        Situation 2 where the merits of the claim including the defences to the
                        claim were examined. Second, from a broader perspective, <em>plausible defences are matters referable to objections (factual and/or
                            legal) to the claim being brought in the first place, or to the arrest
                            being mounted at all.</em> They are material facts which
                        objectively speaking, <em>are of such weight that their
                            omission, at the application stage, is tantamount to or constitutes an
                            abuse of process</em>. Such an abuse of process is strictly
                        speaking not a defence to the claim; it is <em>an objection
                            to the claim or arrest being brought an all.</em> In the context
                        of the duty to make full and frank disclosure, a failure to disclose
                        material facts that constituted the abuse, would be a ground for discharging
                        or setting aside the warrant of arrest for material non-disclosure</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73. I now come to the reasons for holding the view that in the context of
                        an application for a warrant of arrest, the duty to disclose
                        “plausible defences” is <em>not</em>
                        generally directed at defences to the claim that may be raised at the trial
                        in answer to the plaintiff’s claim but in a broader perspective to
                            <em>matters that constitute an abuse of the arrest
                            process</em> (see [72] and [74]). In a <em>case
                            falling under Situation 2, there will be matters (factual and/or legal)
                            of such weight as to deliver the “knock-out blow” to the
                            claim summarily</em>, <em>and</em>, <em>on any reasonable view, their omission, at the application
                            stage, is tantamount to or constitutes an abuse of process.</em>
                        These <em>matters are likely to be, or at the very least,
                            overlap with defences that deliver the “knock out blow” to
                            the claim summarily</em>, <em>and</em> it is
                            <em>their omission that is likely to or may mislead the
                            court in the exercise of its discretionary powers of
                        arrest.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">75. …In my view, the non-disclosure of defences that the defendant
                        could raise at the trial in answer to the plaintiffs’ claim (as that
                        pertains to the ultimate merits of the action and the question of who is
                        likely to win), <em>are generally not characterised as a
                            failure to give full and frank disclosure unless</em> (and this is
                        the qualification (ie, Situation 2) mentioned in <em>The St
                            Elefterio</em> (see [56] above) they are <em>matters that show up the claim as an abuse of process, or one that is
                            so obviously frivolous and vexatious as to be open to summary dismissal
                            and, on any reasonable view, their omission, at the application stage,
                            is tantamount to or constitutes an abuse of process</em>. From a
                        broader perspective, failure to disclose matters showing that the claim or
                        arrest should not have been brought at all, are material facts that
                        constitute the abuse of process. Simply put, <em>they
                            constitute matters of such weight that their omission is likely to or
                            may mislead the court in the exercise of its discretionary power of
                            arrest</em> (see [72] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphases added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In essence, the point made by the learned
                    Judge was that the duty to disclose “plausible defences” was not
                    generally directed at defences on the merits that may be raised at the trial but
                    referred to matters, which if not disclosed, would be tantamount to an abuse of
                    the arrest process. A clear example of such matters, if omitted at the
                    application stage, which would constitute an abuse of the arrest process were
                        “<em>matters (factual and/or legal) of such weight as
                        to deliver the “knock-out blow” to the claim
                        summarily</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The learned Judge went on to conclude:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“84. To summarise, in the light of the low threshold of the merits
                        enquiry (ie, typically Situation 1 as in [54] above), <em>the
                            omission to refer to defences on the merits which the defendant may seek
                            to raise in opposition of the plaintiff’s claim would not
                            generally be characterised as a failure to make full and frank
                            disclosure</em>. This is the position <em>so long
                            as it cannot be said that the action is an abuse of process, or that it
                            is obviously frivolous and vexatious so as to be open to summary
                            dismissal.</em> Once this <em>tipping point exists
                            (as was the case in The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)), there will be matters
                            (factual and/or legal) which are of such weight as to deliver the
                            “knock-out” blow to the claim summarily</em>, and
                        their omission is likely to or may mislead the court in the exercise of its
                        discretionary powers of arrest, then these matters are material facts that
                        will have to be disclosed (ie, Situation 2 as in [54] above). Equally, a
                        failure to disclose facts which constituted the abuse of the arrest process
                        would be ground for discharging or setting aside the warrant, whether under
                        Situation is 1 or 2 (see [72], [74] and [75] and instances of abuse of the
                        arrest process at [77] and [83] above).”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Cautioning against the undesirable practice of
                    parties attempting to meticulously dissect the factual matrix to
                    “invent” missing material facts upon which to mount non-disclosure
                    challenges, the Court of Appeal in <em>The Vasiliy</em>
                    astutely observed at [88] and [90] that the assessment of what is material is
                    ultimately a matter of <em>common sense</em> and
                    “the scope of disclosure should be what is reasonable in the given
                    circumstances at the time of the arrest”. This point was echoed by the
                    High Court in <em>The Eagle Prestige</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">85. Paragraph [88] of <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin
                            (CA)</em> warns against the “meticulous dissection of the
                        factual matrix to ‘invent’ missing material facts”. Each
                        case is fact-sensitive in terms of material facts advanced for consideration
                        by the court. As Rajah JA observed, applying common sense, the scope of
                        disclosure is based on <em>“what is reasonable given
                            the circumstances at the time of the arrest”</em> (at
                        [90])…”</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In the final analysis, the approach of the
                    Singapore courts as explained by the Court of Appeal in <em>The
                        Bunga Melati 5</em> at [116] and [117], is to strike an optimal
                    balance between two equally important policy concerns of (i) <em>allowing the liberal invoking</em> of admiralty jurisdiction and (ii)
                        <em>preventing the abuse</em> of the ship arrest
                    process:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“116. The position which we have reached here strikes an optimal
                        balance between allowing the <em>liberal invoking of
                            admiralty jurisdiction (</em>as the authorities helpfully cited by
                        the Judge suggest) and <em>preventing “the abuse of
                            the [ship] arrest process”</em> (<em>The
                            Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> at [105]). The latter is as important a
                        policy concern as the former. <em>Prior to</em> the
                        defendant successfully applying to strike out the plaintiff’s claim,
                        the defendant could in the interim be inflicted by substantial financial
                        losses due to the plaintiff’s completely unjustifiable arrest of its
                        vessel. While these losses might subsequently be the subject of a wrongful
                        arrest claim by the defendant, it is important to keep in mind that not all
                        wrongful arrests, based on the current state of the law, warrants liability
                        and damages (see <em>The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)</em> at
                        [128]); and even if damages are awarded, a plaintiff might not always be in
                        a sound financial state to pay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">117. For that reason an assistant registrar hearing an application for
                            <em>a warrant of arrest</em> must act as the first
                        “gatekeeper”
                        <em>against a completely unmeritorious claim</em>, by
                        refusing to grant the warrant should the plaintiff’s claim be
                        supported by <em>obviously insufficient or contradictory
                            documentary evidence</em>. However, we also caution that as it is
                            <em>not the role</em> of the assistant registrar
                            <em>at that stage</em> to determine the <em>sustainability</em> of the plaintiff’s action, he
                        or she should refuse to grant leave in only <em>plain cases
                            of processoral abuse.</em>”</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    I now turn to examine the parties’
                    arguments. Underpinning the Defendant’s list of alleged material
                    non-disclosures, misleading/false statements and documents was the
                    Defendant’s case theory (“Case Theory”) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_a"></a>(a)     although they purported to rely on
                        section 3(1)(d), (g) and (l) of the HC(AJ)A, the Plaintiff knew all along
                        that they had no basis to arrest the Defendant’s vessel under sections
                        3(1)(d) and 3(1)(g) of the HC(AJ)A and the claim was always one based on the
                        need to satisfy the requirements of <em>The River
                            Rima</em> under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Plaintiff knew that to come
                        within section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A, they would have difficulty satisfying
                        the requirements of <em>The River
                    Rima</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Plaintiff therefore concocted a case of false documents and misleading
                        statements in the Arrest Affidavit to try and meet the requirements of
                            <em>The River Rima</em> in order to induce the
                        arrest of the ship under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_101-p2_d"></a>(d)     the Plaintiff
                        therefore deliberately avoided bringing <em>The River

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendants’ Case Theory – fact or fiction?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Before turning to address each of the
                    alleged non-disclosures and/or misleading/false statements and documents. It
                    would be appropriate to first address the Defendants’ Case Theory set out
                    at [101] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    I begin by noting that there was simply no
                    evidence which could be found in the Notes of Evidence (“NE”) of
                    the Arrest Hearing that the Plaintiffs’ counsel had made any such
                    submissions as characterised in paragraph [101] above. As I understood the
                    Plaintiff’s counsel’s arguments on section 3(1)(l), there was never
                    any attempt to bring the Plaintiff’s case within <em>The
                        River Rima</em> test. This was also the Plaintiff’s position
                    right from the start of the hearings for the present application. As was
                    recorded in my NE, the following submissions were made by Plaintiffs’
                    counsel:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Defendants accuse Plaintiffs of false translation because they try
                        to argue that Plaintiffs required such a translation to bring the claim
                        within s 3(1)(l) of the HCAJA</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">we accept that the CLC does not identify any particular ship. Don’t
                        understand why Defendant makes such an argument. <em>Plaintiffs rely on Bass Reefer</em>. Shows 2 things (1)
                        don’t need to expressly specify the ship and (2) don’t need
                        express wording in the contract that the ship will be specified by the time
                        of performance of the contract. <em>Only question is to look
                            at situation at the time, implication of the
                        circumstances</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Because of this authority</em>, no need for
                        Plaintiffs to massage the translation to bring it into the s 3(1)(l) as my
                        learned friend has suggested. <em>This is authority that
                            disagrees with River Rima, observes on authority.</em> We have
                        based our arrest on s 3(1)(l) which we have researched and <em>conclude that our case is not a River Rima type case</em>
                        and <em>therefore we do meet requirements under s
                            3(1)(l)”</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphases added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    As I pointed out earlier at [70] and [72]
                    above, the Plaintiff’s case on section 3(1)(l), HC(AJ)A was premised on an
                    erroneous reading of <em>The Bass Reefer</em> - that it
                    would be sufficient to identify the ship by implication, assessing the matter
                        <em>at the time the containers were supplied to the
                        ship</em> (relying on the Container Loading List to evidence this) as
                    opposed to identifying the ship at the <em>time of performance of
                        the contract of supply</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    In the course of arguments, the
                    Defendant’s counsel found it necessary to further allege that this was a
                    case “where having been caught by the Defendant, the Plaintiffs are
                    trying to pull back and claim that they are not relying on the EIRs and the
                    booking order to fulfil “THE RIVER RIMA” test now that their
                    fraudulent position regarding the documents have been exposed by the revelation
                    of the Defendants”. I disagree. There is simply no evidence in the NE of
                    the Arrest Hearing that the Plaintiff’s counsel had made any such
                    submissions that they relied on the EIRs and the booking order to fulfil the
                    test in <em>The River Rima</em> in the first
                place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I would make one last observation on this
                    point and it is this. The Defendant’s Case Theory is less compelling once
                    it is appreciated that the Plaintiff had an arguable case that their claim was
                    of the character contemplated under sections 3(1)(d) of the HC(AJ)A (see my
                    earlier analyses at [27] to [40]). That being so, the alleged <em>motive</em> for the Plaintiffs’ alleged manipulation of their
                    facts and evidence to bring their case within the ambit of section 3(1)(l) of
                    the HC(AJ)A is certainly questionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    All things considered, the Defendant’s
                    case theory is more fiction than fact. I turn now to address each of the
                    allegations of non-disclosure and/or false statements and
                documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Disclosure (a) &amp; (d) - misleading and false statement in
                paragraph 20 of the Arrest Affidavit &amp; the Container Loading List of the Tan
                Thuan Port authority exhibited at Tab 10 of the Arrest Affidavit is a false
                document</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    I address the arguments on Disclosure (a)
                    and (d) together as they are said to be related. Disclosure (a) pertained to
                    paragraph 20 of the Arrest Affidavit which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“20. <em>Some time in December 2010</em>, the
                        Plaintiffs supplied 111 containers to the Defendants <em>pursuant to the Container Lease Contract</em> for carriage on
                        board the Defendants’ vessel “Phu Tan” (the
                            “<b>Vessel</b>”) at Ho Chi Minh for
                        carriage to Hai Phong. A copy of the Container Loading List provided by the
                        Tan Thuan Port record database evidencing the shipment of the 111 containers
                        on board the Vessel is annexed hereto at [Tab 10]”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The Defendant alleged that paragraph 20 was
                    misleading and there was material non-disclosure as (i) the 111 containers had
                    actually been supplied to the Defendant <em>before December
                        2010</em> and not “[s]ometime in December 2010”; (ii)
                    the bulk of the 111 containers were not supplied “pursuant to the 2010
                    CLC” but were initially supplied to the Defendant under an earlier
                    container leasing agreement in 2006; and (iii) there was no written agreement
                    between the parties between 2007 and up to the execution of the 2010 CLC. The
                    Defendant’s allegation in relation to Disclosure (d) was that the
                    Container Loading List provided by the Tan Thuan Port record database (exhibited
                    at Tab 10 of the Arrest Affidavit) was a false document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In response, Plaintiff’s counsel
                    submitted that (i) the 111 containers were leased to the Defendant pursuant to
                    the 2010 CLC. The earlier 2006 lease agreement referred to by the Defendant had
                    ended in 2007 and was therefore irrelevant; (ii) at the time of the loss, the
                    only contract in force between the parties was the 2010 CLC; and (iii) that the
                    Defendant had themselves informed the Plaintiffs, by their letter dated 10 March
                    2011 (disclosed in the Arrest Affidavit), that all of the 111 containers carried
                    on board the vessel “Phu Tan” which were leased pursuant to the
                    2010 CLC had been lost when the “Phu Tan” sank. Plaintiff’s
                    counsel submitted that in the circumstances, the object of paragraph 20 of the
                    Arrest Affidavit was to state the point that the 111 containers had been leased
                    under the 2010 CLC and were loaded on the Defendants’ vessel “PHU
                    TAN” sometime in December 2010 when thereafter the vessel
                sank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    I do not accept the Defendants’
                    argument that there was material non-disclosure of the facts that (i) the 111
                    containers were not leased under the 2010 CLC but under a different lease
                    agreement in 2006, and (ii) there was no written agreement between the parties
                    between 2007 and up to the execution of the 2010 CLC. In this regard, I find the
                    observations of Rajah JA in <em>The Vasiliy</em> at [88]
                    and [90] instructive i.e. that the matter was to be assessed applying common
                    sense, based on <em>what is reasonable given the circumstances at
                        the time of the arrest</em>. I have earlier noted at [58] to [61] that
                    on the existing evidence before me, in particular, the Defendant’s letter
                    to the Plaintiffs dated 10 March 2011, I would accept that the 111 containers
                    were leased pursuant to the 2010 CLC. In my view, the contents of the
                    Defendant’s 10 March 2011 letter clearly show that the Defendant had
                    informed the Plaintiff that the 111 containers which were leased under the 2010
                    CLC were on board the “PHU TAN” and the containers were lost when
                    the “PHU TAN” sank. In these circumstances, there was no objective
                    basis for the Plaintiff to consider that the court at the Arrest Hearing might
                    deem it relevant to know if the 111 containers had been leased pursuant to any
                    agreements other than the 2010 CLC or that the Plaintiff had entered into any
                    earlier lease agreements with the Defendants, or that there were no written
                    agreements from 2007 to June 2010. What would have been relevant to the court at
                    the Arrest Hearing was really the matter of whether the 111 containers were
                    leased pursuant to the 2010 CLC which formed the basis of the Plaintiff’s
                    claims. As to this matter, the Plaintiff had provided adequate explanation in
                    the Arrest Affidavit, and exhibited the Defendant’s letter dated 10 March
                    2011 (at Tab 11) in support. Indeed the NE of the Arrest Hearing show that
                    Plaintiff’s counsel specifically referred the court to “[p]age 137
                    of 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit” which was where the
                    Defendant’s 10 March 2011 letter was exhibited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    The most that could be said for the
                    Defendant at this juncture was that, whether or not the 111 containers was
                    leased under the 2010 CLC was a factual dispute that they had raised post-arrest
                    and which had not been determined in their favour. It follows that it is not
                    open to them to contend that paragraph 20 of the Arrest Affidavit was false or
                    misleading in this respect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    I also find no substance in the
                    Defendant’s argument that there was non-disclosure of the fact that the
                    111 containers were supplied “before December 2010” and not
                    “[s]ome time in December 2010”. Given the circumstances prevailing
                    at the time of the arrest, in particular the Defendants’ letter to the
                    Plaintiffs dated 10 March 2011, there was no objective basis for the Plaintiff
                    to consider that the court at the Arrest Hearing might deem it relevant to know
                    the dates when the 111 containers were picked up by the Defendant. What would
                    have been relevant to the court at the Arrest Hearing was really the matter of
                    whether the 111 containers were leased pursuant to the 2010 CLC which formed the
                    basis of the Plaintiff’s claims and whether these were the 111 containers
                    lost on the “Phu Tan”. Further, the words “[s]ome time in
                    December 2010” when read in the context of paragraph 20 and 21 of the
                    Arrest Affidavit, refers back to the material time period when the 111
                    containers were supplied “for carriage on board the Defendants’
                    vessel “PHU TAN” and which were lost when the “Phu
                    Tan” sank. I accept the Plaintiff’s submission that paragraph 20
                    was meant to state that the 111 containers was supplied <em>to
                        the Defendants’ vessel “PHU TAN”</em> sometime in
                    December 2010 when thereafter the vessel sank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    As for the allegation that the Container
                    Loading List from the Tan Thuan Port records database was false. I have earlier
                    found otherwise (see [62] to [65] above). The most that could be said for the
                    Defendant was that, the authenticity of the Container Loading List was a factual
                    dispute that had not been determined in their favour and it was not open to them
                    to contend that the Container Loading List exhibited at Tab 10 of the Arrest
                    Affidavit was a false document so as to constitute material
                    non-disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Disclosure (b) - the misleading and false statement in paragraph 64

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Disclosure (b) pertained to paragraph 64 of
                    the Arrest Affidavit which stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“64. On 21 February 2013 at 9:59pm, the Plaintiffs responded to
                        state that the proof is in the “Leasing Container Agreement and the
                        Equipment Interchange receipt (EIR)” [Tab 35]. I attach by way of
                        example a copy of one of the many EIRs together with the booking order from
                        VCSC requesting us to supply containers for loading on “PHU
                        TAN” for carriage from Tan Thuan, Ho Chi Minh to Hai Phong. <em>This shows that we supplied the container and that the
                            Defendants received it</em>”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Defendant’s counsel submitted that by
                    paragraph 64, the Plaintiff had sought to present a picture that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_a"></a>(a)     VCSC would request for containers
                        by the booking order and would name the ship in the document and that the
                        name of the ship would be found in the corresponding EIR. The two documents
                        exhibited at Tab 35 were presented as an example of all the other booking
                        orders and EIRs that were issued between the Plaintiffs and the
                        Defendants;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_b"></a>(b)     The effect was that in each case the Defendant had identified the specific
                        ship to which the containers should be sent to as the “Phu
                        Tan” and the Plaintiff had accepted the identification by sending the
                        containers requested to that specific ship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Defendant’s counsel then argued
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_a"></a>(a)     paragraph 64 was false as the
                        booking orders and EIRs that were produced by both parties subsequently
                        showed that there was a total of 7 different ships mentioned in these
                        documents and not just the “PHU TAN”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_118-p2_b"></a>(b)     the false statement at paragraph 64
                        was designed to allow the Plaintiff’s counsel to later argue in court
                        that even though the 2010 CLC did not refer to any particular ship,
                        nonetheless, because all the booking orders and EIRs referred to the
                        “PHU TAN”, therefore the “PHU TAN” was the
                        identified vessel so as to satisfy <em>The River
                            Rima</em> test and establish admiralty jurisdiction under section
                        3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Plaintiff’s counsel submitted in
                    response that reading paragraph 64 of the Arrest Affidavit in context together
                    with paragraphs 63 and 65, it was clear that the sample of the EIR and booking
                    order was exhibited simply to show that “[the Plaintiffs] supplied the
                    container and that the Defendants received it”. The proper context of
                    paragraph 64 was that it referred to an email sent from the Plaintiff in
                    response to the Defendant’s earlier email query for proof of ownership of
                    the containers. Plaintiff’s counsel’s contended, in essence, that
                    the Defendants’ had read paragraph 64 out of context and constructed a
                    misconceived allegation of non-disclosure around it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I agree entirely with the Plaintiff’s
                    submissions. Read in its proper context, there is no doubt that the purpose of
                    paragraph 64 of the Arrest Affidavit was to respond to the Defendant’s
                    earlier email query for proof of ownership of the Containers at the relevant
                    time. In my view, the Defendants’ theory set out at [117] to [118] above
                    was interesting but far-fetched as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_a"></a>(a)     it ignored the plain words of the
                        last sentence at paragraph 64 which read “This shows that we supplied
                        the container and that the Defendants received
                    it”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_b"></a>(b)     it
                        ignored the clear context of paragraph 64 read together with paragraphs 63
                        and 65 of the Arrest Affidavit;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_120-p2_c"></a>(c)     there was no evidence in the NE of the Arrest Hearing
                        that the Plaintiff’s counsel had made any such submissions as
                        characterised in paragraph [118(b)] above. Further, as I understood the
                        Plaintiff’s counsel’s arguments on section 3(1)(l), there was
                        never any attempt to bring the Plaintiff’s case within <em>The River Rima</em> test. Rather, as I pointed out
                        earlier at [71] to [72] above, the Plaintiff’s case was premised on an
                        erroneous reading of <em>The Bass Reefer</em> - that it
                        was sufficient to simply identify the ship at the time of <em>supply of the containers to the ship</em> (relying on the
                        Container Loading List (Tab 10, Arrest Affidavit) to evidence this) as
                        opposed to identifying the ship at the <em>time of
                            performance of the contract of supply</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Disclosure (c) – the false translation of the 2010
                CLC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    I have dealt with the Defendant’s
                    contentions on this point earlier at [53] to [56] above. For the reasons set out
                    at [56], I found this allegation to be without substance and accepted that the
                    Plaintiff’s translation was authentic. The most that could be said for the
                    Defendant was that they have, post-arrest, raised a factual dispute on the
                    translated wordings of the 2010 CLC. It is not open for them to argue that the
                    translation of the 2010 CLC exhibited in the Arrest Affidavit was false as this
                    factual dispute had not been determined in their favour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Disclosures (e) &amp; (f) - non-disclosure of the time bar defence
                &amp; the force majeure defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    It is useful to recapitulate at this
                    juncture the analysis on the extent of disclosure required in respect of
                    “plausible defences”: <em>The Eagle
                        Prestige</em> at [72] - [75], [84]. The duty to disclose
                    “plausible defences” was not generally directed at defences on the
                    merits that may be raised at the trial but referred to matters, which if omitted
                    from disclosure, would be tantamount to an abuse of the arrest process. This was
                    the position so long as it cannot be said that the action is an abuse of
                    process, or that it is obviously frivolous and vexatious so as to be open to
                    summary dismissal. <em>Once this tipping point exists</em>,
                    there would be <em>matters of such weight as to deliver the
                        “knock-out blow” to the claim summarily</em> and their
                    omission is likely to or may mislead the court in the exercise of its
                    discretionary powers of arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    The starting point here is that in the
                    present action, the Plaintiff’s claim was <em>not</em> obviously unsustainable and is not one which could be struck
                    out or “knocked-out” summarily on the basis of the
                    Defendants’ time bar defence (see my earlier analysis at [79] to [86]
                    above). It follows that the omission to disclose the plausible time bar defence
                    or matters overlapping with the plausible time bar defence does <em>not</em> equate to an abuse of the arrest process which may
                    justify setting aside an arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    As I understand it, Defendant’s
                    counsel sought to contend that a time bar defence, by its very nature, would be
                    considered as <em>potentially</em> a “knock - out
                    blow” defence and should therefore have been disclosed. There appears to
                    be some attraction to this submission at first blush. However, in my view,
                    adopting the analysis in <em>The Eagle Prestige</em>, in
                    the context of alleged non-disclosure, “plausible defences” should
                    be understood as matters (factual and/or legal) of such weight as to deliver the
                    “knock-out blow” to the claim summarily and not merely a defence
                    to the claim which <em>by their nature</em> would <em>potentially</em> deliver a “knock out” blow to
                    the claim. Adopting the approach of Defendant’s counsel may bring the
                    court closer to an impermissible exercise of undertaking an assessment of the
                    merits and sustainability of a plaintiff’s action at the stage of the
                    arrest hearing. In this regard, the guidance laid down by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>The Bunga Melati 5</em> (at [117]) is apposite and
                    it is this:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_a"></a>(a)     at the arrest hearing, the court
                        acts as a “gatekeeper” against a “completely
                        unmeritorious claim”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_b"></a>(b)     a warrant to arrest may be refused if the
                        plaintiff’s claim is supported by “obviously insufficient or
                        contradictory <em>documentary</em> evidence”
                        (“emphasis added”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_c"></a>(c)     it is not the role of the court at the arrest stage to
                        determine the sustainability of the plaintiff’s action, and leave
                        should be refused only in “plain cases of processoral
                        abuse”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Ultimately, the Defendant did not point to
                    any circumstances which demonstrated that the non-disclosure of the potential
                    time bar defence amounted to an abuse of process. There was, for example, no
                    allegation or evidence to show that the Defendant had communicated to the
                    Plaintiff that they relied on the time bar defence. I have earlier concluded
                    that there is a legitimate dispute of fact whether or not the Plaintiff’s
                    claim is time-barred under Vietnamese law. At this juncture, the most that can
                    be said for the Defendant is that this remains a point of controversy.
                    Accordingly, the time bar defence is not a “plausible defence”
                    which if not disclosed would amount to an abuse of process and justify setting
                    aside the arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    For completeness, I note that had I
                    concluded otherwise that there was material non-disclosure of the time bar
                    defence, I would still not have exercised my discretion to set aside the arrest
                    because I would have regarded such a step as a disproportionate response to the
                    omission. In this regard, the courts apply the principle of proportionality to
                    assess the sin of omission against the impact of such default: <em>The Vasiliy</em> at [84]. Based on the evidence before me and
                    the circumstances in which the arrest was made, I would not think there was any
                    deliberate suppression of the time bar defence on the part of the Plaintiff.
                    There was no allegation or evidence to show that the Defendant had communicated
                    to the Plaintiff that they relied on the time bar defence. Further, I would not
                    think that the impact of the default was so significant as I have noted earlier
                    that there exists in the present action a legitimate dispute of fact as to
                    whether or not the Plaintiff’s claim is time barred under Vietnamese
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    The Defendant’s arguments that there
                    was non-disclosure of the <em>force majeure</em> defence go
                    this way. They contend that it was clear “since day one” that the
                        <em>force majeure</em> defence was a live issue and
                    referred to the Defendant’s 10 March 2011 letter to support this argument.
                    Defendant’s counsel pointed to the following statement found in the
                    letter:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“As you are well aware, MV “Phu Tan” encountered the
                        very heavy weather and sank with all containers onboard on 16 December 2919
                        in Tonkin Gulf although our crewmembers tried their best to take all
                        possible necessary and admissible measures to remedy. As a consequence of
                        this sinking incident, your containers listed below are a total
                        loss…”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>I am unable to agree with Defendant’s counsel’s
                    submissions which were premised on a rather strained construction of the letter.
                    Read as a whole, the letter certainly did not clearly indicate that the
                    Defendant intended to rely on a <em>force majeure</em>
                    defence. The last paragraph of the same letter makes it clear that the Defendant
                    had informed the Plaintiff that they were still waiting for the competent
                    authority to issue the investigation conclusion on <em>the
                        cause</em> of the sinking incident:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“We will consider and settle termination and liquidation of lost
                        containers upon the receipt of a final investigation conclusion issued by
                        the competent authority on <em>the cause</em> of
                        sinking incident and in accordance with the existing provisions of Vietnam
                        laws”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Further, I have earlier found (at paragraph
                    [28]), based on the Investigation Conclusion issued by the Hai Phong Port
                    authority that the sinking of the ship (and consequently the loss of the
                    containers) was attributable to those engaged in the navigation or management of
                    the ship. At this juncture, the most that can be said for the Defendant is that
                    they have raised the <em>force majeure</em> defence as a
                    point of dispute which has not been determined in their favour. I also note that
                    the Defendant had not sought to rely on the <em>force
                        majeure</em> defence for the purposes of their striking out
                    application. In my view, the <em>force majeure</em> defence
                    is not a “plausible defence” which if not disclosed would amount
                    to an abuse of process and justify setting aside the arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Disclosure (g) - non - disclosure of matters relating to the
                Plaintiffs’ claims under section 3(1)(d), (g) and (l) of the HC(AJ)A and
                deliberate avoidance of The River Rima at the Arrest Hearing</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The Defendant submitted that there was
                    material non-disclosure of matters relating to the Plaintiffs’ claims
                    under section 3(1)(d), (g) and (l) of the HC(AJ)A. The non-disclosures
                    essentially relate to matters of law or legal principles which the
                    Defendant’s submitted were such settled principles and so integral to the
                    court’s assessment of whether or not the jurisdictional limbs could be
                    invoked that they ought to have been disclosed at the Arrest Hearing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_a"></a>(a)     In relation to section 3(1)(d), the
                        Defendant’s complaint was that the Plaintiff did not disclose to the
                        court that the section “was not for claims against the carrying
                        ship” and that “[they] did not think anyone can credibly claim
                        that they did not know s 3(1)(d) does not apply to claims against carrying
                        ship”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_b"></a>(b)     In relation to section 3(1)(g), it was alleged that the “AR was not
                        advised that s 3(1)(g) was for cargo claims and that the containers were not
                        cargo but claimed as equipment”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_129-p2_c"></a>(c)     In relation to section 3(1)(l), the heart of
                        the complaint was that the Plaintiffs had not referred the court to
                            <em>The River Rima</em> which was the leading
                        case.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>I would note here that the above allegations of material
                            non-disclosure were also made in the context of the Defendants’
                            Case Theory (which I have rejected at [103] to [108]
                        above)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    I will first address the complaints in
                    relation to sections 3(1)(d). I have earlier found (at [27] to [40] that the
                    Plaintiff had an arguable case that their claim was of the type and nature
                    contemplated under section 3(1)(d). The Defendant’s complaints of
                    non-disclosure however appear to be premised on their perception (which I have
                    disagreed with) that the Plaintiff did not have any arguable case that their
                    claims were of the type and nature to fall within sections 3(1)(d). In relation
                    to section 3(1)(d), Plaintiff’s counsel relied on Australian and New
                    Zealand authorities to show that they had an arguable case that their claim came
                    within the ambit of this jurisdictional limb. I also earlier noted (at [38])
                    that the learned author in the authoritative local textbook <em>Admiralty Law and Practice</em> expressly recognised that there was
                    differing authority on the scope of section 3(1)(d). In these circumstances, it
                    could not be said that the alleged non-disclosure that this jurisdictional limb
                    “was not for claims against the carrying ship” amounted to
                    material non-disclosure;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In relation to section 3(1)(g), it was clear
                    from the NE of the Arrest Hearing that the court was in fact referred to the
                    “issue regarding whether containers amount to “goods”
                    within the meaning of the limb. The NE recorded that the court was in fact
                    referred to the case of <em>The Mezen</em> and that the
                    Plaintiff in arguing their case, submitted to the court that the
                    “[c]ontainers were being transported from one place to another”.
                    Significantly, the NE also further recorded that in submitting to the court on
                    section 3(1)(l), Plaintiff’s counsel stated “Section 3(1)(l)
                        <em>if containers are not cargo</em> because the
                    containers were for the operation of the ship which was a container ship”
                    [emphasis added]. It is reasonably clear therefore that the issue of whether the
                    containers were cargo within the meaning of section 3(1)(g) was in fact
                    disclosed and brought to the court’s attention. There is therefore no
                    substance in the Defendant’s complaint that “the court was not
                    advised that section 3(1)(g) was for cargo claims and that the containers were
                    not cargo but claimed as equipment” and that this amounted to material
                    non-disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The Defendant’s main complaints really
                    centred on section 3(1)(l) and the allegation that the Plaintiff had not
                    referred the court to <em>The River Rima</em> which was the
                    leading case. Underpinning these complaints was the Defendant’s
                    (untenable) Case Theory. I am unable to agree with the Defendant that there was
                    non – disclosure of <em>The River Rima</em> at the
                    Arrest Hearing. My reasons are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_a"></a>(a)     The NE of the Arrest Hearing
                        records that the Plaintiff’s counsel brought the court’s
                        attention to the Singapore case of <em>The
                            “Alexandrea”</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 812 (<em>“The Alexandrea”</em>);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>The
                            Alexandrea</em> discussed the case of <em>The River
                            Rima</em> at [29], [30], [31], [36] and set out, in brief, at
                        [29], the <em>River Rima</em> test of identification of
                        the ship which was supplied; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_132-p2_c"></a>(c)     Plaintiffs’ counsel affirmed to the court that she
                        had brought the court’s attention to <em>The River
                            Rima</em> in the course of her submissions on <em>The Alexandrea.</em> There was no evidence to suggest this was
                        not the case. Plaintiff’s counsel further explained that she had
                        referred to <em>The Alexandrea</em> as the comments
                        therein, that section 3(1)(l) applied to claims in tort, were pertinent to
                        the Plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In the course of the hearings, the
                    Defendant’s counsel sought clarification, by way of a letter, from the
                    Assistant Registrar (“AR”) presiding over the Arrest Hearing
                    whether or not Plaintiff’s counsel had referred the court to the case of
                        <em>The River Rima</em>. The AR’s response was
                    “nothing further to add to the certified notes of evidence”.
                    Flowing from the AR’s response, the Defendant’s counsel contended
                    that because the clarification of the AR was that there was “nothing
                    further to add to the certified notes of evidence”, and insofar as the NE
                    of the Arrest Hearing did not expressly record the reference to
                        “<em>The River Rima</em>”, this meant
                    that the Plaintiff’s counsel had in fact not referred the AR to <em>The River Rima</em>, even though she claimed she had. This
                    was, by all accounts, a relatively serious accusation levelled against
                    Plaintiff’s counsel, and one which I would dismiss as without any
                    evidential basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    To conclude on this point, I find, based on
                    the foregoing analysis, that there is no merit in the Defendant’s
                    submissions that there was non-disclosure in respect of matters relating to
                    section 3(1)(d), (g) and (l).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Before proceeding further, for completeness,
                    I would make the further observations on a point of law that was raised by the
                    Plaintiff’s counsel in the course of her arguments. Plaintiff’s
                    counsel submitted that a distinction should be made between matters of fact and
                    “pure questions of law” as regards the test for disclosure and
                    that a plaintiff should bear a higher burden in relation to the disclosure of
                    facts. The argument was premised on the proposition that the court on an
                        <em>ex parte</em> application is reliant on the
                    applicant to produce all material facts and evidence whereas in relation to
                    “pure questions of law”, the court was better placed to make its
                    own assessment and would not be so reliant on the applicant. Plaintiff’s
                    counsel submitted that in cases such as <em>The Vasiliy, The
                        Eagle Prestige</em> and <em>The Bunga Melati
                        5</em>, the courts had hitherto focused on non-disclosure of <em>material facts</em> either relevant to a jurisdictional issue
                    or in support of “plausible defences” and had not dealt with
                    disclosure of matters of pure law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In my view there is no need or basis to draw
                    such a distinction between matters of fact and “pure questions of
                    law”. The statements found in <em>The Vasiliy</em>,
                        <em>The Eagle Prestige</em> and <em>The
                        Bunga Melati 5</em> discussed the disclosure of both factual and legal
                    matters/objections and the courts there did not express any intention to lay
                    down different tests to govern disclosures of fact and disclosures of
                    “pure questions of law”. As stated by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>The Vasiliy</em>, the test of materiality:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87. …embraces matters <em>both factual and
                            legal</em>, which may be prejudicial or disadvantageous to the
                        successful outcome of the applicant’s application. It extends to all
                        material facts that could be reasonably ascertained and defences that might
                        be reasonably raised by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    The Court of Appeal in <em>The Bunga Melati 5</em> (at [116]) issued the salutary reminder that
                    our courts ultimately seek to strike the balance between the twin policy
                    concerns of allowing a liberal invoking of the admiralty jurisdiction and
                        <em>preventing the abuse of the ship arrest
                        process</em>. Whether or not there was material non-disclosure in the
                    circumstances is ultimately to be assessed with reference to the question of
                    whether the alleged non-disclosure amounted to <em>an abuse of
                        the arrest process</em>. The (common)sensible guidance in <em>The Vasiliy</em> (at [90]) is that the scope of disclosure
                    should be what is reasonable in the given circumstances at the time of the
                    arrest, assessed as a matter of common sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    In my observation, whether it is a
                    “pure question of law” or otherwise, the test of materiality would
                    remain the same. In the context of disclosing matters of “pure questions
                    of law” to the court at an arrest hearing, the policy concern is whether
                    the alleged non-disclosure is tantamount to an abuse of the arrest process. I
                    venture to illustrate this briefly. Under the various jurisdictional limbs of
                    the HC(AJ)A, had there been Singapore authorities which <em>conclusively</em> determined the ambit of these provisions, then any
                    applicant intending to contend for an interpretation of sections 3(1)(d) or
                    3(1)(g) which went against the grain of <em>conclusive</em>
                    Singapore authorities would have the duty to disclose these <em>conclusive</em> Singapore authorities for the court’s
                    consideration failing which there would be strong suggestion that such
                    non-disclosure amounts to an abuse of process which may warrant a setting aside
                    of the arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Disclosure (h) – non-disclosure of the jurisdiction clause in
                the 2010 CLC and the letter at page 137 of the Arrest Affidavit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    I come now to the Defendant’s final
                    allegations of non-disclosure. The Defendant argued that the jurisdiction clause
                    in the 2010 CLC and the letter at page 137 of the Arrest Affidavit were not
                    disclosed to the court at the Arrest Hearing. However, the evidence indicates
                    otherwise. The NE of the Arrest Hearing records:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“PC: …Page 137 of 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit
                        is a document showing that 111 containers belonging to the Plaintiff were
                        lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Goes through paragraphs 4 to 99 of 1<sup>st</sup>
                        affidavit and exhibits]”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    It is clear from the record that the letter
                    at page 137 of the Arrest Affidavit was in fact disclosed and referred to the
                    court <em>specifically</em>. As for the jurisdiction clause
                    at Art 6 of the 2010 CLC, this was set out in the text of the Arrest Affidavit
                    at paragraph 12 under a section listing out the relevant terms of the 2010 CLC.
                    It was recorded in the NE that the Plaintiffs’ counsel (i.e.
                    “PC”) went through paragraphs 4 to 99 with the court. Evidently
                    this exercise would have included taking the court through paragraph 12 of the
                    Arrest Affidavit. In short, there is no factual basis for the Defendant to
                    allege non-disclosure of these matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    For all the foregoing reasons, the
                    Defendant’s application is dismissed. I will hear parties on
                costs.</p>
