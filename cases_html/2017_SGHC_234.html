The plaintiff also claimed unjust enrichment against the defendants in the sum of US$3m. The Suit was also filed against Chang Tsuei-Yun (“the second defendant”) who is a director of the first defendant, the vice chairman of TCC, the legal representative of ZCC as well as a majority shareholder of TCC. The plaintiff alleged that the second defendant is the prime mover and ultimate controller of the Chi Cheng group of companies and is responsible for the business and management of the companies in the group.

The plaintiff expressed an interest in acquiring the shares because ZCC held an anodising licence in China.

He thought the best way to do the transfer was to acquire the owner of the licence, namely the first defendant. Chee was reassured by the fact that ZCC’s majority shareholder was the first defendant, a Singapore registered company which held substantial and real assets including receivables of more than S$5m, fixed deposits of more than S$1m and cash or cash equivalent close to S$17,000. Additionally, Chee noted that the first defendant had a viable business as it provides manufacturing and repair services for industrial and commercial electronic products.

The sale price of KCC’s shares to the buyers was around RMB170,000,000 of which RMB132,500,000 was then outstanding. The sale was effected pursuant to an Equity Transfer Agreement dated 19 October 2015 (“the ET Agreement”). The balance of RMB132,500,000 was booked as an account receivable in the books of ZCC.

She added that if the plaintiff was still interested in purchasing ZCC’s shares, it would have to pay US$500,000 (or its equivalent in RMB) as earnest money to Guangdong Jiatong by that day. The plaintiff would also have to sign a share transfer agreement providing for a purchase price of not less than US$10m and pay a deposit of US$3m by 5 August 2016.

By Bill Lu’s email dated 30 September 2016, ZCC shareholders indicated they were prepared to compromise on this issue by bearing certain specific expenses incurred by ZCC in the period July to September 2016.

He opined that the issue of whether the deposit of US$3m should be repaid to the plaintiff is a matter between two Singapore companies, one being the payer and the other the payee of the amount.

In this regard, the court took into account the following factors:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The plaintiff intended to purchase a Chinese company ZCC;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) All meetings and/or negotiations leading to and the signing of the LOI (which is in Mandarin) were done in Zhuhai; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The plaintiff’s lawyers Dentons are from Zhuhai and so too are the defendants’ lawyers Guangdong Jiatong;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Due diligence on ZCC was done in Zhuhai;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The plaintiff appointed a firm of valuers from Zhuhai called Dongguan Hualien Asset Appraisal to value the assets of ZCC and the Hong Kong branch of DBS as its advisers;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The aborted share transfer agreement was drafted in Mandarin and clause 11 therein (at [36]) contemplated that the applicable law would be PRC law with the venue for resolution of disputes by arbitration being Shenzhen;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) The alleged Representations and Further Representations by Leon Chen and Bill Lu were made in China;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) The key witnesses for the parties who would testify in court proceedings would be Chee, Leon Chen, Bill Lu, Xue and the second defendant. Save for Chee, the other material witnesses are all based in China; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Other possible witnesses such as the buyers and the plaintiff’s valuers are all from China whilst representatives from DBS are from Hong Kong.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Against all the above factors pointing to China as the place where all the connecting factors took place and hence PRC law was the applicable law by implication, the plaintiff could only point to one tangible fact connected to Singapore – the US$3m deposit was paid by the plaintiff into the first defendant’s bank account in Singapore. That factor was not significant when viewed in the light of all the factors in [57] that pointed overwhelmingly to China as the more appropriate forum for the determination of this dispute. The twelve factors proffered by the plaintiff in [51] above as pointing to Singapore as the more appropriate forum were unconvincing. Moreover, as was pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight</span> (at [70]), “it is the <span class="font-italic">quality</span> of the connecting factors that is crucial in this analysis, rather than the quantity of factors on each side of the scale”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As the defendants had crossed the threshold of the first stage of the <span class="font-italic">Spiliada </span>test (at [55](a)) in satisfying the court that <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> China was a more appropriate forum, the burden shifted to the plaintiff under the second stage of <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> (at [55](b)) to convince the court that notwithstanding that China was a more appropriate forum, justice required that a stay should nonetheless not be granted.  The plaintiff was unable to satisfy the second stage of the test in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> or the third prong of the approach in <span class="font-italic">JIO Minerals </span>and it could not persuade this court that Singapore should be the appropriate jurisdiction for this dispute.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The plaintiff had argued that it would be deprived of juridical advantages available in Singapore proceedings in the form of the discovery and witness testimony if a stay was granted in favour of Chinese courts.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It was contended that the juridical advantages were of particular importance as the misrepresentations were made verbally by the first defendant to the plaintiff. However, it is noteworthy that the plaintiff’s own legal expert Dong had opined (see [41]) that the plaintiff’s claims in misrepresentation and unjust enrichment are actionable under PRC law while the supplementary opinion of the defendants’ expert Peng stated that the lack of common law discovery under PRC law is mitigated by Article 63 of the CP Law (at [48]) which stipulates that other types/forms of evidence receivable by the Chinese courts include witness testimony.  In any case, the appellate court in <span class="font-italic">Accent Delight</span> had this to say (at [109]) on the issue of juridical advantage:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The fact that a plaintiff would have a “legitimate juridical advantage” if it is allowed to proceed in Singapore is not a decisive factor (see <span class="font-italic">Brinkerhoff</span> at [35(f)]). Prof Yeo Tiong Min states in <span class="font-italic">Halbury’s</span> (at para 75.097) that “differences in procedure and remedies will generally be irrelevant and not having the benefit of the procedures or remedies of the forum will not by itself amount to denial of substantial justice”.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As was indicated earlier (at [49]), I return now to Article 532. It states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where a foreign-related civil case simultaneously meets all the following conditions, a people’s court may rule to reject the lawsuit and instruct the parties to file the lawsuit with a foreign court which is more convenient:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) the defendant raises a request that the case shall be under the jurisdiction of a foreign court which is more convenient, or raises an objection to the jurisdiction;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) there is no agreement on the choice of jurisdiction of a court of the People’s Republic of China between the parties involved;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) the case is not under the exclusive jurisdiction of a court of the People’s Republic of China;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) the case does not involve the interests of the State, citizens, legal persons or other organizations of the People’s Republic of China;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) the major facts over which the case has disputes did not occur within the territory of the People’s Republic of China, and the laws of the People’s Republic of China are not applicable to the case, as well as there are significant difficulties in the determination of facts and application of laws; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(6) a foreign court has jurisdiction of the case, and it is more convenient for the foreign court to hear the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It cannot be disputed that the requirements in (4) and (5) of Article 532 are not met here as: (i) the case does involve the interests of an organization of the PRC, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ZCC; (ii) the major facts in the dispute all occurred within the territory of the PRC, and (iii) it is this court’s view that by implication, the laws of the PRC are applicable to the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 At this juncture, I will also address one issue that was raised in the first defendant’s arguments – that the plaintiff should have but did not join the remaining shareholders of ZCC to the Suit. The plaintiff’s answer to this argument was that there was no necessity to do so because:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The other shareholders were not party to the LOI;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There was no evidence that the other shareholders received any portion of the deposit of US$3m; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) According to the first defendant’s own evidence (that of Leon Chen in his first affidavit), the second defendant, being the legal representative of the first defendant, had the mandate from ZCC’s shareholders to represent them in the intended disposal of their shares to interested buyers. Further, the other two minority shareholders (Zhuhai Guanyao Paper and Kunshan LitaXiang) had given a power of attorney to the first defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 It is not necessary for this court to determine this issue for the defendants’ application as it should more appropriately be decided by the Zhuhai courts under PRC law, although I would have thought that all shareholders of a takeover target should properly be party to proceedings involving a dispute between the seller(s) and the buyer(s). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The plaintiff had also submitted that a transfer of the Suit to the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) would be appropriate as the transfer requirements under O 110 r 12(4) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) were met.

Like all arguments on <span class="font-italic">forum non conveniens,</span> a submission that the possibility of a transfer to the SICC weighs in favour of an exercise of jurisdiction by the Singapore courts must be grounded in specificity of argument and proof by evidence. A plaintiff must articulate the particular quality or feature of the SICC that would make it more appropriate for the dispute to be heard in Singapore by the SICC, as well as prove that the dispute is of a nature that lends itself to the SICC’s capabilities. It is also relevant for the court to consider whether the Transfer Requirements are likely to be satisfied. <span class="font-weight-bold">If, for example, the plaintiff fails even to show a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prima facie </span><span class="font-weight-bold">case that the dispute is of an </span><span class="font-weight-bold">“international and commercial” nature, we do not think its reliance on the possibility of a transfer to the SICC should be given any weight whatsoever.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(emphasis in bold)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Quite apart from the defendants’ objection, this court could not see any “international” flavour in a commercial dispute that involved two Singapore entities and a Taiwanese national. Moreover, there is no judge in the SICC who is familiar with or well versed in Chinese law. Further, the documentation in this case is largely in Chinese.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 To conclude, the determinant for the defendants’ application was whether any of the connecting factors pointed to a jurisdiction “in which the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice” (per Lord Goff in <span class="font-italic">Spiliada</span> at 476).  It was this court’s view that in applying the test, the appropriate jurisdiction in this case would be China, not Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lai Siu Chiu <br/>Senior Judge</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Koh Kia Jeng and Geraldine Yeong Kai Jun (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Tan Teng Muan and Loh Li Qin (Mallal &amp; Namazie) for 1st defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Anna Oei Ai Hoea and Deannier Yap (Tan, Oei &amp; Oei LLC) for 2nd defendant.</div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
