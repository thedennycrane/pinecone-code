        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal arises from a decision of a High
                    Court judge (“the Judge”) dismissing an appeal against a domestic
                    arbitration award (see <em>Motor Image Enterprises Pte Ltd v SCDA
                        Architects Pte Ltd</em> [2011] 1 SLR 497 (“the
                    Judgment”)). In dismissing the appeal, the Judge held that it was not
                    appropriate for her to make a ruling on a question of law for which she had
                    earlier granted leave to appeal under s 49(5) of the Arbitration Act
                    (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“AA”). The Judge had also held
                    that the question of law had not properly arisen as it had not been premised on
                    the facts that the arbitrator had found.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This appeal presents an opportunity to this
                    Court to clarify the statutory regime for appealing against domestic arbitration
                    awards under s 49 of the AA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts and procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The dispute before the arbitrator</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The appellant, Motor Image Enterprises Pte Ltd
                    (“Motor Image”), is in the business of distributing and selling
                    motor vehicles and spare parts and providing workshop services for motor
                        vehicles.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The respondent, SCDA Architects Pte
                    Ltd (“SCDA”), supplies architectural services.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Motor Image engaged SCDA to provide
                    architectural services for retrofitting and alterations works at Motor
                    Image’s premises at 25 Leng Kee Road (“the
                        Project”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>
                    The contract between SCDA and Motor Image (“the Architectural
                    Contract”) was subject to the Singapore Institute of Architects
                    Conditions of Appointment and Architects Services and Mode of Payment
                    (“the SIA Terms”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Project was never completed
                    because Motor Image abandoned it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       SCDA then commenced arbitration proceedings
                    against Motor Image for the balance of the fees allegedly due to it. Motor Image
                    counterclaimed for a refund of interior design fees and damages for SCDA’s
                    alleged breach of contract, negligence, breach of statutory duties, professional
                    duties and/or ethical duties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The counterclaim was based on SCDA’s
                    alleged failure to ensure that its drawings complied with relevant laws and
                    regulations, and its failure to properly advise Motor Image on whether its
                    intended designs complied with the Use Quantum Requirement prescribed by the
                    Urban Redevelopment Authority (“the URA”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Use Quantum
                    Requirement was that “only 40% of [Motor Image’s] premises could be
                    used as a showroom or for ancillary purposes such as for offices or
                    storerooms” (see the Judgment at [7]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       SCDA had submitted three sets of drawings to the
                    URA for approval. The first and second submissions to the URA were rejected
                    because they did not comply with the URA’s Use Quantum
                        Requirement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> However, the URA
                    accepted the third set of drawings that SCDA submitted to it (“the Third
                    URA Submission”). To complicate matters, SCDA sent a <em>different</em> set of drawings (“the 29 June 2005
                    Drawings”) to Motor Image just one day after it submitted its second
                    submission to the URA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In a detailed written award dated
                    9 February 2009 (“the Award”), the arbitrator, who was a
                    practising architect at the time of the arbitration, allowed SCDA’s claim
                    for its fees for architectural services but disallowed its claim for interior
                    design fees. The arbitrator also dismissed Motor Image’s
                    counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was not disputed during the arbitration
                    proceedings that the parties had fixed the architectural fees at 8.5% of the
                    “total construction costs” (as defined in the SIA Terms) with a
                    minimum lump sum of $200,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Motor Image had, however, abandoned
                    the Project <em>before</em> a contract was awarded to
                    building contractors but after tenders were called and received. In such a
                    situation, condition 1.3(3)(b) of the SIA Terms provides that the
                    “total construction costs” for the purpose of determining the
                    architect’s fees was the “lowest <em>bona
                        fide</em> tender received by the [a]rchitect”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Another provision of the SIA Terms
                        (condition 2.3(3)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>) states that where
                    a project is abandoned, the architect’s fees would be
                    “commensurate” with the services that he provided. It was also not
                    disputed that, at the time when Motor Image abandoned the Project, SCDA had
                    completed 57.5% of the works it was obliged to complete under the Architectural
                        Contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, reading condition 1.3(3)(b)
                    with condition 2.3(3), SCDA was entitled to architectural fees according to
                    the following formula:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.5% x 57.5% x lowest <em>bona </em><em>fide</em> tender</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     SCDA called for two tenders after the URA
                    approved the Third URA Submission:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     The lowest tender under the first
                        tender exercise (“the First Tender”) was $9,480,000. The
                        arbitrator found that the First Tender was based on the 29 June 2005
                        Drawings, which had an “expanded scope of works”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> According to the arbitrator, SCDA was
                        balancing two concurrent processes: SCDA was making submissions to the URA
                        for approval while, at the same time, preparing drawings (<em>ie</em>, the 29 June 2005 Drawings, which were used for the
                        First Tender) to achieve Motor Image’s desired design. The arbitrator
                        held that it is “<em>common
                        practice</em>” for drawings on which tenders are called to be
                        different from the drawings submitted to the URA for approval.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                        The project could have been regularised at a later stage by submitting an
                        amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        lowest tender under the second tender exercise (“the Second
                        Tender”) was $3,782,912. The arbitrator found that the Second Tender
                        was based on a “reduced scope of works” after Motor Image
                        found out that the scope envisaged in the First Tender was not cost
                            effective.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Unsurprisingly, SCDA contended that the lowest
                        <em>bona </em><em>fide</em> tender
                    for the purpose of computing its fees was $9,480,000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Motor Image
                    disagreed. It argued that the lowest <em>bona fide</em>
                    tender was $3,782,912.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The arbitrator found that <em>both</em> tenders were <em>bona fide</em>
                    because they were both carried out with Motor Image’s knowledge and
                        consent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The arbitrator also agreed with SCDA
                    that the First Tender ought to be used for calculating the fees due. The
                    arbitrator’s reasons for reaching that conclusion are set out at p 15
                    of the Award:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In arriving at my decision, I had taken into consideration that [Motor
                        Image] did agreed [<em>sic</em>] with all the
                        submissions including calling of [the First Tender] and [the Second Tender].
                        At no time was [SCDA] stopped for unsatisfactory service. And as [the Second
                        Tender] was what [Motor Image] wanted and which could be legally
                        constructed. [<em>sic</em>] It is not reasonable for
                        [Motor Image] having agreed to [the Second Tender], having obtained what
                        they wanted and that could be legally constructed and that cost was not an
                        issue, then decided [<em>sic</em>] not to proceed with
                        the works and to use the lowest tender to argue the bases [<em>sic</em>] for computing the fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, what the arbitrator was saying in this paragraph is that
                    SCDA had done what Motor Image had requested it to do in terms of providing
                    architectural services and that having got what it wanted and “that could
                    be constructed” it was unfair of Motor Image to deprive SCDA from
                    claiming a higher fee simply because it had decided to abort the
                works.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Dissatisfied with the arbitrator’s
                    decision, Motor Image sought leave from the High Court to appeal a question of
                    law arising out of the Award<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. Motor Image framed the question

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     SCDA argued, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the question of law that Motor Image had framed was
                    flawed because it was premised on a finding of fact that the arbitrator had not
                    made; the question had wrongly assumed that SCDA agreed with Motor Image to call
                    for tenders based only on drawings that had been approved or would be approved
                    by the URA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Judge granted leave to appeal but

                    decided by the arbitrator when it had not.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> These

                    appeal the Judge’s decision at the Leave Stage on the ground that leave
                    should not have been granted on the modified Contractual Interpretation Question
                    because it failed to state correctly the factual basis of the arbitrator’s
                    Award. The Judge heard and dismissed SUM 5332/2009 without providing any

                    the Judgment that she dismissed this application because she followed English
                    authorities which took the view that leave to appeal under the English
                    equivalent of s 49(7) of the AA should only be granted if the statutory
                    guidelines under the equivalent of s 49(5) of the AA required elucidation

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The modified Contractual Interpretation
                    Question was later placed before the Judge. At this stage, SCDA raised the
                    Erroneous Factual Premise Argument (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>
                        above).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> In response, Motor Image made
                    three preliminary objections.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> First, issue estoppel
                    prevented SCDA from raising issues that were considered at the Leave Stage.
                    Second, a respondent to an appeal under s 49 of the AA could not challenge
                    the factual premises of a question of law for which leave had been granted.
                    Third, it would be an abuse of process to allow SCDA to make arguments it had
                    already raised during the hearing of SUM 5332/2009 (<em>ie</em>, the application for leave to appeal against the
                    Judge’s decision to grant leave to appeal on the modified Contractual
                    Interpretation Question, see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Judge rejected all of Motor Image’s
                    preliminary objections. The Judge considered that the doctrine of issue estoppel
                    was not applicable because she did not make a final and conclusive judgment on
                    the merits of the Erroneous Factual Premise Argument at the Leave
                        Stage.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>
                    Next, the Judge rejected the argument that SCDA was not permitted to challenge
                    the factual premises of the modified Contractual Interpretation Question at the
                    Appeal Stage. In the Judge’s view, the court at the Appeal Stage may have
                    to revisit the factual premises of the question referred to it in order to
                    determine whether the award manifests an error of law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Judge also felt that
                    the objective of the Leave Stage would be undermined if the court at the Leave
                    Stage had to make a final and conclusive determination of the factual premises
                    underlying the questions of law.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> As
                    for Motor Image’s argument on abuse of process, the Judge held that there
                    was no abuse of process in raising the Erroneous Factual Premise Argument at the
                    Appeal Stage even though it was raised at the hearing of SUM 5332/2009
                    (which had been dismissed on the ground that it was not necessary for the Court
                    of Appeal to elucidate s 49(5) of the AA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s decision at the Appeal Stage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Having rejected Motor Image’s
                    preliminary objections, the Judge proceeded to consider whether the modified
                    Contractual Interpretation Question had properly arisen on the basis of the
                    facts found by the arbitrator. The Judge observed that the modified Contractual
                    Interpretation Question was premised on the fact that SCDA used a different set
                    of drawings (<em>ie</em>, the 29 June 2005 Drawings)
                    for the First Tender from those which the parties had agreed to use (<em>ie</em>, the Third URA Submission).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> The Judge next reviewed the Award in
                    detail and found that the arbitrator had not found that the Third URA Submission
                    was to be used for the First Tender.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> She accordingly found that
                    the modified Contractual Interpretation Question was not appropriate because it
                    was premised on facts that were not found by the arbitrator and ignored his
                    factual findings. As a result, the Judge dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision to grant leave to appeal to the Court of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     After the dismissal of Motor Image’s
                    appeal on the question of law arising out of the Award (in particular, the
                    modified Contractual Interpretation Question), Motor Image applied via Summons
                    No 4555 of 2010 for leave under s 49(11) of the AA to appeal to the
                    Court of Appeal on two <em>new</em> questions of law. The
                    first question is reproduced as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    “Where, under section 49(5) of the
                            Arbitration Act (Cap. 10), the High Court determines that a
                            question of law arises out of an award and is a question which the
                            arbitral tribunal was asked to determine (“Finding”) and
                            grants leave to appeal, does the High Court, on hearing the appeal
                            against the award, have the power to review and overturn the Finding
                                <em>on the basis that the question of law does not
                                arise out of the award and was not a question which the arbitral
                                tribunal was asked to determine</em>?” [original

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The second question was essentially a redraft
                    of the modified Contractual Interpretation Question:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    “Where an architect who is engaged under
                            the Singapore Institute of Architects Conditions of Appointment and

                            of Appointment”) has agreed with his client to call for tenders
                            based on [an] agreed set of drawings but instead calls for and receives
                            tenders (“Tenders”) based on a different set of drawings,

                            Appointment?”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     With respect to the first question, the Judge
                    granted leave to appeal the question as modified by removing the italicised
                    words shown at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above (“the
                    Referred Question”), reproduced as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Where, under section 49(5) of the Arbitration Act

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     With respect to the second question, the Judge
                    refused leave to appeal on the ground that it would be a hypothetical question
                    as it was contingent upon the Court of Appeal ruling in favour of Motor Image on
                    the Referred Question. She felt that referring both questions would
                    unnecessarily increase the costs of the appeal and suggested that this Court
                    remit the case to her if we found in favour of Motor Image on the Referred
                        Question.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Referred Question seeks this court’s
                    decision on whether in a case where the High Court, having determined under
                    s 49(5) of the AA that a question of law has arisen out of an award which
                    the arbitral tribunal was asked to determine (“Finding”) and
                    having granted leave to appeal, had the power, on hearing the appeal against the
                    award, to review and overturn the Finding on the basis that the question of law
                    does not in fact arise out of the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In this appeal, counsel for Motor Image
                    contended that the High Court does not have any such power because when leave is
                    granted, even erroneously, it vests an irrevocable right of appeal in the
                    applicant. Counsel for SCDA contended the contrary. Before we consider their
                    respective arguments, we should first set out the scope of s 49 of the AA

                    four conditions have to be satisfied before the High Court may grant leave to
                    appeal. For the purposes of the present case, only two considerations are
                    material. They are: (a) whether the question of law is one which the
                    arbitral tribunal was asked to determine; and (b) whether on the basis of
                    the findings of fact in the award – (i) the decision of the arbitral
                    tribunal on the question is obviously wrong, or (ii) the question is one of
                    general public importance and the decision of the arbitral tribunal is at least
                    open to serious doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     With respect to condition (a), the Judge found
                    that this condition was not satisfied in that the question of law, <em>ie</em>, the modified Contractual Interpretation Question,
                    was not a question that the arbitrator was asked to determine. She made no
                    comment in her Judgment on her finding at the Leave Stage that condition (b) was
                    satisfied, but it seems to us that on the facts found by the arbitrator on the
                    basis of which he made the award, we would have found it difficult to conclude
                    that the award was obviously wrong, if we had to decide this question, or that
                    the question of law was one of general importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Motor Image’s arguments on the Referred Question</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The case for Motor Image on the Referred
                    Question ran as follows. The grant of leave of the High Court to appeal against
                    an arbitrator’s award under s 49(5) of the AA (<em>ie</em>, at the Leave Stage) vests the applicant with an
                    unconditional right of appeal, and that once the Court has conferred on him such
                    a statutory right (<em>ie</em>, by giving him leave to
                    appeal), that right cannot be taken away by the Court unless the statute gives
                    the Court the power to do so. Counsel referred to the following decisions in
                    support of this argument, <em>viz</em>, <em>Moore, Nettlefold &amp; Co v The Singer Manufacturing Company</em>
                    [1904] 1 KB 820 at 823 (“<em>Moore</em>”), <em>John Robinson and Company Limited
                        v The King</em> [1921] 3 KB 183 (“<em>John Robinson</em>”) at 204; and <em>Wan Sagar
                        bin Wan Embong v Harun bin Taib &amp; Ors</em> [2008]
                    4 MLJ 474 (“<em>Wan Sagar</em>”) at
                        [7]. For convenience, we shall call
                    this the <em>Moore</em> principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It was further argued that this right of
                    appeal, once vested, will subsist until and unless the matter is resolved by the
                    Court of Appeal on an appeal against the High Court decision at the Leave
                    Stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Counsel’s argument based on the
                        <em>Moore</em> principle in relation to the present
                    case is novel and ingenious. In <em>Moore</em>, the issue
                    was whether the appellant had a right of appeal under the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature (Procedure) Act 1894 (57 &amp; 58 Vict. c 16) (UK) (“the
                    1894 Act”). The Court of Appeal held that as the appellant had been given
                    leave to appeal by the judge, the grant of leave created a right of appeal under
                    the 1894 Act. Mathew LJ said (at 823):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think there are two classes of cases coming within the sub-section (of
                        the 1888 Act): those in which leave to appeal was not necessary, and those
                        in which it was necessary; <em>but, leave having been
                            obtained, the case stands on the same footing as if there had been a
                            right of appeal ab initio</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the other two more senior judges of the Court did not express
                    themselves in the same way, the italicised words do suggest that a right of
                    appeal is crystallised upon the granting of leave to appeal. If such a right of
                    appeal (by leave) is the same as an ordinary right of appeal, then there should
                    be no reason why if the latter cannot be taken away except by the statute (see
                        <em>John Robinson</em> and <em>Wan
                        Sagar</em>), the former can be “taken away”, <em>ie</em>, revoked by the Court without a hearing on the merits
                    of the appeal. Counsel for Motor Image also pointed out that if the High Court
                    makes a mistake in granting leave to one party, the other party should appeal
                    against the order under s 49(7) of the AA. In the present case, SCDA could
                    have applied for leave to appeal under s 49(7). It had in fact done so but
                    leave was denied (see <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We find counsel’s argument to be
                    persuasive and cogent and we accept the <em>Moore</em>
                    principle that ordinarily a right of appeal cannot be revoked, even where the
                    right has accrued by reason of leave having been given. However, our acceptance
                    of the <em>Moore</em> principle does not conclude this
                    appeal in favour of Motor Image. Two further questions arise. The first is
                    whether the Motor Image’s right of appeal was abrogated by the Judge
                    revisiting the basis on which she had granted leave to appeal, and declining to
                    decide the modified Contractual Interpretation Question that was before her. If
                    Motor Image’s right of appeal was not abrogated by the Judge’s
                    decision, then its whole argument of having acquired a vested and irrevocable
                    right of appeal would not be relevant. Second, if she had, then it may be
                    necessary to consider whether the <em>Moore</em> principle,
                    which was established for court actions, would be applicable to arbitrations
                    where issues of jurisdictional facts are relevant as they are the basis on which
                    leave may be granted to appeal against an arbitrator’s
                award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">What exactly did the Judge decide?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Before we turn to consider SCDA’s
                    arguments, it is necessary to examine closely what the Judge actually decided.
                    First, she decided that she was not estopped from revisiting, at the hearing of
                    the substantive appeal, the factual basis of the award to determine whether it
                    was the same basis on which she granted leave to appeal for the question of law,
                        <em>ie</em>, the modified Contractual Interpretation
                    Question. At [26]–[28] of the Judgment, she held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    The discussion in relation to estoppel has,
                            however, established that the arguments and issues relevant at the leave
                            to appeal stage can still be relevant at the substantive appeal stage.
                            It all depends on the circumstances. Whilst the task of the judge on
                            hearing the appeal is to decide whether, as <em>Thomas</em> states, the award manifests an error of law - in
                            order to make that determination, the appellate judge has to be
                            satisfied regarding the factual basis from which the alleged error
                            stems. Therefore, the appellate judge may, depending on the arguments,
                            need to relook at the factual premises of the question. Further, while
                            the judge at the leave to appeal stage forms provisional views on
                            merits, the appellate judge must form final and conclusive views on the
                            merits. Therefore, the arguments on issues at the leave stage may very
                            well be relevant at the appeal stage as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27    There is a precedent for this approach in the case
                            of <em>Ng Huat Foundations Pte Ltd v Samwoh Resources Pte
                                Ltd</em> [2006] SGHC 43 ("<em>Ng Huat
                                Foundations</em>") which I decided. In that case, I allowed
                            challenge of the factual premises of the question of law which the
                            appellant was granted leave under s 49(3)(<em>b</em>) to appeal on. I noted at [16] that "the parties took
                            different positions on what had been found by the Arbitrator as a
                            question of fact", as is the case here, and went on to find at [29] that
                            the question of law was "misconceived" because it was premised on facts
                            that had not been found by the arbitrator and ignored both his views on
                            the facts and his factual findings. Although there were no arguments on
                            this point in <em>Ng Huat Foundations</em>, I
                            consider that the approach taken there was correct. If Motor Image was
                            right, it would mean that the court is asked at the leave stage to make
                            final and conclusive determinations at least regarding the factual
                            premises underlying the questions of law which the court gives leave to
                            appeal on. It is not appropriate to ask this of the court at the leave
                            stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">28    The leave stage functions as a time and cost-saving
                            filter against cases which are not even open to serious doubt. (See
                                <em>Antaios Compania Naviera SA v Salen
                                </em><em>Rederierna AB</em>
                            [1985] AC 191 ("<em>The Antaios</em>") at
                            206G-207C, where Lord Diplock holds up the practice of the House of
                            Lords in dealing with petitions for leave to appeal from judgment of the
                            Court of Appeal in civil actions as an example to be followed:
                            "[G]enerally a brief oral hearing inter partes is permitted of which the
                            average duration is ten to fifteen minutes; the parties are not allowed
                            to use the hearing as an opportunity to argue the appeal that is the
                            subject of the petition.") Whilst arguments for leave in the courts here
                            generally take somewhat longer than 15 minutes, the court should hear
                            only enough at the leave stage to adopt a provisional view on the merits
                            which allows it to decide whether a full-dress hearing is warranted. To
                            ask the court to hear enough at the leave stage to make final and
                            conclusive determinations would undermine the utility of the leave stage
                            as a filter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Secondly, upon revisiting the basis on which
                    she granted leave to appeal, she found that the factual premise of the modified
                    Contractual Interpretation Question was not the same factual premise on which
                    the arbitrator made his award. The Judge held at [49]–[51] as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49    Having mined the Award several times, I am unable
                            to find a finding of fact that would support the premise of the
                            [modified Contractual Interpretation] Question. On the hearing of the
                            leave to appeal application, whilst this issue was raised, I was more
                            concerned with the proper interpretation of Condition 1.3(3)(b) and
                            this concern was part of the reason for allowing the
                        application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    Having now had the time and opportunity to consider
                            the position and the Award in more detail, I am satisfied that the
                            [modified Contractual Interpretation] Question is not appropriate
                            because it is premised on facts that were not found by the Arbitrator
                            and ignores his factual findings as well as his view of the facts. The
                            difficulty that Motor Image faced on the appeal is that the case it now
                            seeks to run was not foreshadowed in its pleadings and submissions for
                            the arbitration. Indeed, some of the points it made before the
                            Arbitrator are inconsistent with its present stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Conclusion</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    In the event this appeal must be dismissed with
                            costs. I do not express any opinion on the substantive questions of
                            interpretation raised in the course of the appeal as an interpretation
                            exercise can only be conducted in the light of relevant facts. There are
                            no such facts at present.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">SCDA’s arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Before us, counsel for SCDA, in addition to
                    referring to <em>Ng Huat Foundations Pte Ltd v Samwoh Resources
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2006] SGHC 43, supported the Judge’s
                    decision and referred to three judicial and textbook authorities in support of
                    the Judge’s decision. In <em>The “Ocean
                        Crown”</em> [2010] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 468, Gross J
                    commented that the court at the appeal stage might conclude that “in
                    reality there is no question or error of law at all” (at [53]). In
                        <em>Commercial Arbitration Law and Practice</em>
                    (Marcus Jacobs) (Lawbook Co, Looseleaf Ed, Update 105, 2010) it is suggested all
                    “jurisdictional facts”, including a determination of whether or
                    not a question of law arises from the award, may be revisited at the appeal
                    stage (at [35.621]). In our view, the reference to this issue as a
                    “jurisdictional fact” issue correctly suggests this issue goes to
                    the very heart of the jurisdiction of the court to grant leave to appeal (at
                    [35.620]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The third authority is the unreported decision
                    of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in <em>Warley Pty Ltd v
                        Adco Constructions Pty Ltd</em> (No 359 of 1988). In that case,
                    the Court revisited the issue of whether it had properly granted leave on
                    whether there was a question of law arising from the award in that case.
                    Ultimately, the Court found that the question that it had earlier given leave to
                    appeal was a question of fact, and accordingly dismissed the appeal, with the
                    implication that there was no appealable issue before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision on the Referred Question</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In our view, the issue of whether the
                    Judge’s decision to dismiss the substantive appeal for the reasons she had
                    given has abrogated or “taken away” Motor Image’s vested
                    right of appeal requires us to determine the threshold question as to whether
                    there was a valid appeal in the first place. If the Judge had no jurisdiction to
                    grant leave to appeal under s 49(5) of the AA with respect to the modified
                    Contractual Interpretation Question, then there would be no vested right of
                    appeal to abrogate. Under s 49(5) of the AA, leave to appeal <em>shall</em> be given only if the Court is satisfied that the
                    question is one which the arbitral tribunal was asked to determine. The Judge
                    was satisfied that this requirement was met when she gave leave, but, in our
                    view, she was mistaken as to that jurisdictional fact. At the Appeal Stage, she
                    realised that the arbitrator was not asked to determine the modified Contractual
                    Interpretation Question. Similarly, at the Leave Stage, she was satisfied that
                        <em>on the basis of the finding of facts in the
                        award</em>, the decision of the arbitral tribunal on the question was
                    obviously wrong, or that the question was one of general public importance and
                    the decision of the arbitral tribunal was at least open to serious doubt. It is
                    implicit in this jurisdictional fact that the question of law for which leave is
                    granted must be premised on the same facts on which the arbitrator made his
                    award. The Judge only appreciated at the Appeal Stage that this was not the
                    case. In other words, she had earlier mistakenly given leave to appeal a
                    question of law which the arbitrator did not decide on the facts found by him in
                    the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In our view, if the modified Contractual
                    Interpretation Question was not the question which the arbitrator was asked to
                    determine, then it was a question on which no appeal could have been brought
                    under s 49(5) of the AA, and the Judge had no jurisdiction to grant leave
                    to appeal on such a question on the basis that it was an appealable question.
                    The Judge had mistakenly conferred upon herself a jurisdiction on a question of
                    law which did not arise from the award. The modified Contractual Interpretation
                    Question was not an appealable question because the question was not one which
                    the arbitral tribunal was asked to determine. It follows from this conclusion
                    that the Judge, in refusing to determine the modified Contractual Interpretation
                    Question, did not abrogate any right of appeal vested in Motor Image because no
                    such right could have been properly vested in it by reason of the Judge’s
                    earlier jurisdictional error.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     For these reasons, we answer the Referred
                    Question in the affirmative to the extent that the High Court may, on hearing an
                    appeal on a question of law with respect to which it has granted leave to
                    appeal, review the factual premise on which such leave was granted, and to
                    dismiss the appeal if it finds that the leave was granted as a result of a
                    jurisdictional error, as in that case, there is no proper or valid appeal before
                    the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     If the Referred Question were answered in the
                    negative, it would be a travesty of the judicial process and lead to an absurd
                    result. It would mean that where an arbitrator makes an award in favour of a
                    party, on the basis of facts 1, 2 and 3, the Judge is compelled to answer a
                    question of law arising from such an award on the basis of facts 4, 5 and 6
                    which were never found by the arbitrator. In our view the High Court has no
                    jurisdiction under s 49(5) of the AA to give leave to appeal against an
                    arbitrator’s award on the basis of facts which were not found by the
                    arbitrator and which did not form the basis of his award. Otherwise, this would
                    allow the High Court to arrogate to itself the jurisdiction to decide on the
                    correctness or legality of an arbitrator’s award on a factual premise
                    different from that on which the award was made. We are unable to accept that
                    this is what is contemplated by s 49(5) of the AA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     It would follow from this conclusion that it
                    is not necessary for us to decide whether the <em>Moore</em> principle is applicable to the Judge’s decision to
                    dismiss Motor Image’s appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For the above reasons, this appeal is
                    dismissed with costs. Save that there should be no order for the costs of the
                    High Court proceedings in respect of the application for leave to appeal under
                    s 49(11) of the AA, the Judge’s costs order at [51] of the Judgment
                    is to stand. The usual consequential orders are to follow.</p>
