<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiffs and the defendant are members of
                    the Char Yong (Dabu) Association (“CYA”). This dispute relates to
                    the plaintiffs’ allegation that the defendant had made certain defamatory
                    statements about them during the election of the 35th Management Council for CYA
                    in December 2012. They claim that the statements had the effect of lowering the
                    plaintiffs’ standing in the eyes of the right thinking members of the
                    public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the close of the plaintiffs’ case, the
                    defendant’s counsel, Mr Quek Mong Hua (“Mr Quek”) submitted
                    that there was no case to answer. He argued that the statements in question were
                    not defamatory. Alternatively, the defendant sought to rely on the defences of
                    fair comment and qualified privilege if the statements were found to be
                    defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Implication of the defendant’s submission of no case to
                answer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Before I deal with the above issues, I would
                    like to address the implication of the defendant’s submission of a no case
                    to answer at the close of the plaintiffs’ case. I had previously dealt
                    with the principles applicable to a no case to answer submission in <em>Lena Leowardi v Yeap Cheen Soo</em> [2014] SGHC 44 at
                    [18]–[22]. When the defendant mounted a no case to answer submission, he
                    in effect elected not to call evidence. The result is that the plaintiffs only
                    need to make out a <em>prima facie</em> case to succeed in
                    the suit. Furthermore, I must assume that any evidence led by the plaintiffs is
                    true, unless it is inherently incredible or out of all common sense or
                    reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Nevertheless, this does not free the plaintiffs
                    from their burden of proof. They must still prove all the essential elements of
                    their claim based on the totality of their evidence although this is subject to
                    the court’s minimum evaluation. Bearing these principles in mind, I shall
                    proceed to deal with the substantive issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The background of this case is important for a
                    full appraisal of the issues which I shall deal with shortly. The origin of the
                    dispute arose from the affairs of the Hakka Clan Association in the course of
                    the election of office bearers for the 35th<sup></sup>CYA Management Council.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Char Yong (Dabu) Association</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       CYA is a Hakka Clan association founded in 1858
                    to benefit and educate its Hakka members. This includes the provision for needy
                    Hakka elders and the award of scholarships for Hakka students. CYA also engages
                    in other charitable and educational causes.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> CYA established Char Yong (Dabu)
                    Foundation (“CYF”), a separate entity registered as a charity to
                    administer these charitable activities.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As stated in the CYA’s Constitution,
                    CYA’s members are restricted to Singaporean Hakkas whose ancestral home is
                    in Char Yong (Dabu) District, China.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> CYA’s
                    affairs are managed by its Management Council, which consists of 41 people. Out
                    of the 41 members on the Management Council, 35 of them are elected directly by
                    CYA members with the remaining 6 members co-opted by the elected
                        members.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Prior to the election of the 35th Management
                    Council in December 2012, the first, second and third plaintiffs, as well as the
                    defendant, were all members of CYA’s 34th Management Council.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Char Yong (Dabu) Foundation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       CYF was established in 1995 with the primary
                    purpose of promoting educational and other charitable activities. It did so by
                    managing the assets of CYA, which it held on trust in furtherance of those
                    charitable activities. Since 30 June 2012, CYF held a sum of $91,611,554
                    (“the $90m fund”) under a charitable purpose trust created by
                    CYA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       CYF and its assets are managed by CYF’s
                    board of directors, which consists of 17 directors. All 17 directors were
                    initially appointed from CYA’s Management Council. However, after an audit
                    conducted in April 2010, it was recommended that for the purposes of good
                    governance, CYF’s board of directors should be restructured to include
                    independent directors who were not part of CYA’s Management Council. In
                    response to this, CYF’s management was restructured in 2011.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Out of 17
                    directors, 10 are now appointed from CYA’s Management Council
                    (“related directors”) and seven are independent directors who are
                    not members of CYA’s Management Council (“non-related
                        directors”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> These independent directors do not
                    necessarily have to be CYA members and Char Yong (Dabu) District, China, does
                    not necessarily have to be their ancestral home. During the December 2012
                    election, the first three plaintiffs and the defendant were all related
                    directors of CYF while the fourth plaintiff was a non-related director of
                        CYF.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The election of the 35th Management Council</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The election of the 35th Management Council
                    was held on 9 December 2012 and 56 CYA members were nominated as candidates.
                    They were to be elected by the other CYA members to fill 35 elected seats in the
                    35th Management Council.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Out of these 56 candidates, 39 were returning
                    members from the 34th Management Council which the first to third plaintiffs and
                    the defendant were part of.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Despite campaigning in teams, candidates had
                    to be elected individually. The plaintiffs and the defendant had initially
                    campaigned together as part of a team of returning members of the 34th
                    Management Council (“the 34th Management Council
                        team”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Later, a disagreement arose between the
                    defendant and some of the other returning members of the 34th Management Council
                    regarding the composition of the team. The third plaintiff was among the members
                    with whom the defendant disagreed. As a result, the defendant withdrew from the
                    34th Management Council team<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> and instead campaigned separately
                    as the leader of another group of candidates.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As a result, there were two teams competing in
                    the election. One was the 34th Management Council team led by the third
                    plaintiff which included the other plaintiffs. The other was led by the
                        defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> However as the
                    defendant’s team did not have enough candidates to fill up all 35 elected
                    seats in the Management Council, it also included the fourth plaintiff in its
                    list of 35 recommended candidates.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defamatory statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     During the course of the defendant’s
                    election campaign, a meeting was organised at the Nanyang Khek Community Guild
                    on 2 December 2012 for around 100 CYA members.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> The defendant spoke at this
                    meeting about the need to protect the $90m fund, which was held on trust by CYF
                    for the benefit of CYA, and to prevent it from falling “into the hands of
                        outsiders”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> A flyer was also distributed to the CYA
                    members present at the meeting which summarised the contents of the
                    defendant’s speech (“the Flyer”). It stated, in
                        Chinese:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On the day of the election, <em>ie</em>, 9 December 2012, the defendant, together with his team and
                    their supporters, distributed copies of a brochure (“the
                    Brochure”) together with copies of the Flyer to CYA members that were
                    present at the voting premises. The Brochure stated, in Chinese:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interview of the defendant by Shin Min Daily</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Subsequently, in an interview published in the
                    Shin Min Daily on 19 December 2012 (“the Interview”), it was
                    reported, in Chinese, that the defendant stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The defendant] said during an interview that when he said he didn’t

                        outsiders”, he was not making personal attacks on the seven
                        independent council members, but was merely saying that the main
                        directorship should remain within the Association.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is the plaintiffs’ case that the
                    statements which were made in the Flyer, the Brochure and the Interview were
                    defamatory. As a result, the plaintiffs’ standing in the eyes of
                    right-thinking members of the public was adversely affected. The defendant
                    submitted that those statements were not defamatory and that they did not refer
                    to the plaintiffs. He also submitted that if the court found the statements
                    defamatory, he should be protected under the defences of fair comment and
                    qualified privilege.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defendant argued that the first two
                    requirements were not fulfilled in relation to the statements in the Brochure,
                    the Flyer and the Interview. He also submitted that the requirement of
                    publication had not been met in relation to the statement made in the Flyer. As
                    such, I shall address the requirement of publication which he said was
                    unfulfilled only in relation to the statements made in the Flyer. Thereafter I
                    shall deal with the first two requirements which are common to the statements
                    made in the Brochure, the Flyer and the Interview.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the statement in the Flyer published or caused to be published by

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is trite law that anyone who participates
                    directly or vicariously in the publication of a defamatory statement is jointly
                    and severally liable for the statement regardless of the extent of his
                    involvement. This is succinctly explained in <em>Gatley on Libel
                        and Slander</em> (Alastair Mullis &amp; Richard Parker eds) (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2013) at paras 6.10 to 6.11:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The person who first spoke or composed the defamatory matter (the
                        originator) is of course liable, provided he intended to publish it or
                        failed to take reasonable care to prevent its publication. However, at
                        common law liability extends to any person who participated in, secured, or
                        authorised the publication (even the printer of the defamatory work)
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Thus in accordance with general principle, all
                    persons who procure or participate in the publication of the libel are jointly
                    and severally liable for the whole damage suffered by the claimant. In the case
                    of a newspaper, the journalist, editor and publisher are all joint
                    tortfeasors.</p>

                    speech on 2 December 2012 at the Nanyang Khek Community Guild. In that speech,
                    the defendant said that the $90m fund must not fall in the hands of outsiders:

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     PW1, Mr Joseph Liew, also said the Flyer was
                    distributed on the day of the election, <em>ie</em>, 9
                    December 2012, in the presence of the defendant while the Brochure was given to
                    PW3 by the defendant. The defendant did not take steps to dissociate himself
                    from the Flyer. The contents of the Interview were similar to the statements in
                    the Flyer and Brochure. The above showed that the defendant intended to convey
                    the message of the statements to CYA members during the electoral campaign.
                    Thus, the plaintiffs submitted there is a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case that the statements in the Flyer were published on
                    behalf of the defendant and his team for the purpose of their electoral
                    campaign.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The defendant does not dispute the requirement
                    of publication in relation to the Brochure. However, he submitted that the
                    plaintiffs had failed to prove the requirement of publication in relation to the
                    distribution of the Flyer on 2 December 2012. He denied that he had published
                    the Flyer or caused it to be published. He also submitted that he did not
                    authorise, procure or participate in the publication of the Flyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In my view, the evidence indicated that the
                    defendant had knowledge of the Flyer and its contents. Moreover, the alleged
                    defamatory statements in the Brochure and the Flyer were also similar. The
                    defendant also did not dispute the issue of publication for the
                Brochure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     My finding that the Flyer had been published
                    by the defendant is also supported by the testimonies of the plaintiffs’
                    witnesses. PW3 testified that the defendant gave him the Flyer. PW1 said the
                    Flyer and Brochure were distributed on the day of the election <em>ie</em>, 9 December 2012, in the presence of the defendant.
                    No effort was made by the defendant to dissociate himself from the contents of
                    the Flyer (see [23] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Moreover, the contents of the Interview were
                    also similar to the statements in the Flyer and Brochure. This showed that the
                    defendant intended to convey the message of the statements to CYA members during
                    the electoral campaign. Thus, there is a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case that the Flyer was also published on behalf of the
                    defendant and his team for the purpose of their campaign for votes. I am unable
                    to accept that the defendant did not authorise, procure or participate in the
                    publication of the flyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the statements refer to the plaintiffs?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The next issue I have to decide is whether the
                    statements made in the Flyer, the Brochure and the Interview referred to the
                    plaintiffs. In the course of the proceedings, from the testimonies of the
                    witnesses, I found that the plaintiffs’ position at trial was different
                    from their pleaded case. In their statement of claim, they stated that the
                    context of the statements meant that the plaintiffs were remiss in their duties
                    while serving on the CYF’s Board of Directors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> However at trial,
                    they appeared to suggest that the election was a contest between the
                    defendant’s team and the plaintiffs’ team and the statements
                    referred to them in the context of the elections. This latter version is not the
                    plaintiff’s pleaded case. Moreover, the fourth plaintiff was also in the
                    defendant’s team. The premise on which I will proceed is on the
                    plaintiffs’ pleaded case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The law on the issue that the defamatory
                    statements must refer to the plaintiff is settled and the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong
                        and another appeal</em> [2010] 1 SLR 52 (“<em>Review Publishing</em>”) at [48]–[49] held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48    It is trite law that, to succeed in an action for
                            defamation, the plaintiff must prove not only that the defendant

                                <em>of the plaintiff

                                Pillay</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 462 ("<em>A Balakrishnan</em>"), this court held that, having regard to
                            the article which contained the offending words and the publicity given
                            to the plaintiffs as members of an organising committee that had
                            organised an event called "Tamil Language Week" (which was the subject
                            matter of that article), a reasonable person who was acquainted with the
                            plaintiffs, on reading the article, would come to the conclusion that
                            the offending words referred to the plaintiffs even though the
                            plaintiffs were not expressly identified in the article. It follows from
                            the decision in <em>A Balakrishnan</em> that
                            the plaintiff need not be expressly referred to by name in the offending
                            words; it is also immaterial whether or not the defendant intended to
                            refer to the plaintiff …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The court has to apply the objective test as advocated by the
                        Court of Appeal in <em>Review Publishing</em> to
                        determine whether “the ordinary reasonable person who, at the

                        by” the statements in the Flyer, Brochure and the
                    Interview.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The statements were part of the
                    defendant’s election campaign manifesto to appeal to the CYA
                    members’ conscience to safeguard and protect CYA’s assets. This was
                    to ensure that the $90m fund would not fall into the hands of outsiders. The
                    statements also made no reference to the CYF Board of Directors or the
                    CYA’s Management Council. In such circumstances, could the statements
                    indirectly or by inference point to the plaintiffs as CYF’s board of
                    directors. Could the statements suggest that they had breached, neglected and/or
                    abdicated their duties as pleaded in the Statement of Claim?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I find that the plaintiffs’ submission
                    that the statements were directed at the incumbent CYF board is not supported by
                    the evidence. Firstly, the defendant and six of his endorsed candidates formed
                    the majority of the ten main CYF board members.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> In the circumstances, it would seem
                    incredible for the defendant to defame himself with the statements especially
                    since the plaintiffs’ case was that the statements alleged that they were
                    in “breach of, neglected and/or abdicated their
                        duties”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Secondly, eight board members and the fourth
                    plaintiff who was the independent director were elected to the 35th CYA
                    Management Council. This indicated that CYA members could not have interpreted
                    the statements as defamatory against the incumbent CYF board. Nine out of the
                    eleven board members who stood for the election were elected. PW1, the treasurer
                    of the board, had secured the highest number of votes. The overwhelming results
                    showed that the statements did not have any defamatory effect and could not have
                    referred to the CYF board.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     For the purpose of addressing whether the
                    statements were directed at the plaintiffs expressly or impliedly, I am of the
                    view that the statements referred to the possible risk that the $90m fund might
                    fall into the hands of outsiders if no positive action is done to avert it. No
                    ordinary reasonable member of CYA who was aware of the circumstances would
                    reasonably understand or conclude that the statements referred to the
                    plaintiffs. In fact, the defendant in the Interview had clarified that the
                    statements were not personal attacks against the seven independent directors.
                    Thus the plaintiffs have failed to prove on a <em>prima
                        facie</em> basis that the statements referred to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On this ground alone, the plaintiffs’
                    case can be dismissed. Nevertheless, I shall proceed to ascertain whether the
                    statements are defamatory in their natural and ordinary sense as well as to give
                    my findings on the other issues in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">What was the meaning of the statements?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Whether a statement is defamatory depends on
                    its natural and ordinary meaning assessed objectively. For this, reference is
                    usually made to the ordinary, reasonable and reasonably interested person. In
                    this regard, the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Chan Cheng Wah
                        Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another appeal</em>
                    [2012] 1 SLR 506 (“<em>Bernard Chan</em>”) is
                    instructive as it also dealt with the scenario whereby statements were
                    distributed to members of an association. The Court of Appeal held at [19] and
                    [26] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    … the <em>class of
                                reader</em> is relevant in determining the scope of
                            possible meanings the publication may bear… For example,
                                in <em>Rees v Law Society
                                Gazette </em>(2003)…Gray J noted that a solicitor
                            reading the UK's Law Society Gazette is less prone to "loose
                            thinking" than the average ordinary reader. In the context of the
                            present case where the statements were contained in the minutes of the
                            Club's MC meetings and which were published principally to Club members,
                            the "ordinary reasonable person" would be, as the Judge had held at [29]
                            of the Judgment, <b>the ordinary reasonable and
                                interested Club member possessing general knowledge of the affairs

                                is <em>not</em> contested by the
                            Defendant in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>

                            likely have attended the Club's AGMs, or have at least acquainted

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Both the plaintiffs and the defendant accept
                    this legal proposition. They agree that the appropriate reference point to take
                    is that of the ordinary, reasonable and reasonably interested CYA member.
                    However, they differ as to what meaning such a CYA member would ascribe to the
                    statements in question. The plaintiffs urged the court “to take into
                    account inferences or implications that the ordinary reasonable person may draw
                    from those words in the light of his general knowledge, common sense and
                        experience”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> They
                    submitted that the statements in the Flyer, which called for CYA members to vote
                    for the defendant so that the $90m fund “[does] not fall into the hands
                    of outsiders”, suggested that the then CYF board of directors, which
                    included the plaintiffs, had mismanaged the $90m fund. They alleged that the
                    defamatory statements in the Flyer and Brochure therefore “cast doubt on
                    the competence, honesty and integrity of the then CYF Board.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In their submissions, the plaintiffs placed
                    special emphasis on the use of the word “conscience” which was a
                    translation of the actual Chinese word “liang zhi”. Although the
                    defendant disputed such a translation, I note that such a translation was
                    provided by the PW4, Mrs Chin-Paur Yow Hoy, a qualified translator. Hence I
                    accept PW4’s translation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     According to the plaintiffs, the defendant
                    urged CYA members to use their “conscience” to vote in the Flyer
                    suggested that there was some misconduct on the part of the directors of CYF in
                    managing the $90m fund. The third plaintiff even alleged that the statements
                    indicated that the $90m fund had already fallen into the hands of outsiders. He
                    further added that the funds had gone missing. These were the third

                                            It implied that the directors had failed in their

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiffs also argued that such a meaning
                    is further reinforced by contents of the Brochure, which contained the words
                    “to better safeguard the Association’s Ninety-Six Million in
                    Foundation Assets”. This seemed to suggest that the funds were either
                    lost or under threat. It was therefore the plaintiffs’ submission that the
                    words “do not fall into the hands of outsiders” meant that the
                    funds were already in the hands of outsiders. Therefore there was a need to
                    “better safeguard” the funds by recovering them. As a result, the
                    plaintiffs alleged that they were defamed as this suggested misconduct on the
                    part of CYF board of directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I find that the plaintiffs’
                    interpretation of the statements at trial, that the statements suggested that
                    the funds had already fallen into the hands of outsiders, is not only
                    unsupported by the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of but
                    it had also gone beyond their pleaded case (see below at [42] for their pleaded
                    case). The Court of Appeal in <em>Review Publishing</em>
                    stated that the plaintiff is bound by his pleadings (at [130]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For all of the above reasons, we prefer Diplock LJ's view in [<em>Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd [1968] 2 QB 157]</em>,
                            <em>viz</em>, that, where the plaintiff has chosen
                        to set out in his SOC the particular defamatory meaning which he contends is
                        the natural and ordinary meaning of the offending words, "the defamatory
                        meaning so averred is treated at the trial as <em>the most
                            injurious meaning</em> which the words are capable of bearing"
                        [emphasis added] (<em>Slim</em> at 175). As we said
                        earlier, the plaintiff must be the best person to know the sting of the
                        alleged libel concerning him. He should thus be bound by the meaning which
                        he has pleaded, subject to any change brought about by an amendment to his
                        SOC so as to plead a more defamatory or variant meaning from that originally
                        pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In their pleaded case, the plaintiffs had
                    stated that their claim was brought on the basis that they were “in
                    breach of, neglected and/or abdicated their duties as directors of CYF
                        …”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> That the funds were already in the hands of
                    outsiders (see [40] above) was not pleaded in its Statement of Claim. Therefore
                    the plaintiffs’ aggravated interpretation of the statements at trial that
                    the funds had fallen into the hands of others was not supported by their
                    pleadings and must fail. I shall proceed to examine the natural and ordinary
                    meaning of the statements based on the plaintiffs’ pleaded
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law in relation to the construction of words</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It is instructive to refer to the Court of
                    Appeal decision in <em>Bernard Chan</em> which set out the
                    general principles regarding the construction of words based on their natural
                    and ordinary meanings at [18]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general principles applicable to the construction of
                        words based on their natural and ordinary meanings are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the natural and ordinary meaning of a word is that which is
                            conveyed to an ordinary reasonable person;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) as the test is objective, the meaning which the defendant intended
                            to convey is irrelevant;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) the ordinary reasonable reader is not avid for scandal but can
                            read between the lines and draw inferences;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) where there are a number of possible interpretations, some of
                            which may be non-defamatory, such a reader will not seize on only the
                            defamatory one;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e) the ordinary reasonable reader is treated as having read the
                            publication as a whole in determining its meaning, thus "the bane and
                            the antidote must be taken together"; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(f) the ordinary reasonable reader will take note of the circumstances
                            and manner of the publication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On the general principles espoused by the
                    Court of Appeal, I find that the words “ensure that the assets and $90
                    million funds of Char Yong Dabu Association do not fall into the hands of
                    outsiders” were not defamatory and were merely made to alert CYA members
                    to such a future possibility. The words “to better safeguard”
                    might just be a call for improvement. This is not necessarily premised upon the
                    fact that the circumstances at that time were unsatisfactory. Improvements could
                    still be made even if the circumstances were satisfactory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The above interpretation is also supported by
                    the circumstances. The management and control of the $90m fund in the context of
                    the election are relevant. This holistic approach is recommended by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Jeyasegaram David (alias David Gerald Jeyasegaram)
                        v Ban Song Long David</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 712 <em>(“Jeyasegaram David”)</em> at [27]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In determining the meaning of the words alleged to be defamatory,
                            <em>a holistic approach had to be adopted</em>, as
                        it was the broad impression conveyed by the alleged libel that fell to be
                        considered, and not the meaning of each word or sentence under
                        analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The management and control of the $90m fund</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     With respect to CYF’s affairs, I note in
                    particular that there was a significant restructuring of the CYF’s board
                    of directors in 2011. For better governance, seven independent directors who
                    might not be of Char Yong (Dabu) heritage were included in the board of
                    directors. This gave rise to some concerns regarding the role of the external
                    individuals in the handling of the $90m fund held on trust and managed by CYF.
                    During cross-examination, PW1 also stated that the second plaintiff suggested at
                    a CYF Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) that CYF should be
                    “totally independent” from CYA. He also said that the funds should
                    be held by CYF independently rather than on trust.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> This was held on 7 October
                    2011 prior to the election.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In light of this, I find that the ordinary,
                    reasonable CYA member who was reasonably interested would have been concerned
                    about the management and control of the funds held by CYF. As admitted by the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Therefore, a reasonably interested CYA member
                    would have been interested in the issue relating to the management and control
                    of the $90m fund held by CYF. However, different CYA members might have taken
                    different views as to how the $90m fund should be handled. Some might have been
                    of the view that there should be no independent directors managing the funds.
                    This responsibility should be born only by CYA Management Council members who
                    are Hakka and are of Char Yong (Dabu) heritage. Such CYA members would also want
                    the funds to be held on trust and they might be regarded as the more
                    conservative members. On the other hand, some might be more liberal. They might
                    be of the view that more independent directors who are not Hakka and not of Char
                    Yong (Dabu) heritage may be introduced, so long as they could manage the funds
                    well. These liberal members might also be of the view that CYA does not have to
                    be in control of the funds and that CYF can hold the funds independently. Such
                    differences among the members may be gleaned from the cross-examination of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It is therefore clear that the management and
                    control of funds was an important issue that would interest and might divide the
                    CYA members. Even though the issue related to the funds held by CYF, it cannot
                    be divorced from the operations of CYF, which are closely related to the affairs
                    of CYA. This is because CYF was established for the primary purpose of
                    furthering CYA’s charitable objectives. Furthermore, it can also be seen
                    from the Interview that the defendant adopted a more conservative view when he
                    stated that “the main directorship [of CYF] should remain within
                    [CYA].”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The election context</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The issue as to the management and control of
                    funds held by CYF would be of concern to the ordinary, reasonable and reasonably
                    interested CYA member. This would also be of special concern to an ordinary CYA
                    member when electing the members of the CYA Management Council as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     It is for the CYA Management Council
                        to decide whether to allow CYF to hold the funds
                    independently.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        related directors, who constitute a majority of the CYF board of directors,
                        are CYA Management Council members.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_c"></a>(c)     The related directors have the final say in the
                        restructuring of CYF’s board of directors to include more independent
                        directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The statements urged CYA members to retain
                    control of the $90m fund so that it would not fall into the hands of outsiders.
                    It is logical that a conservative CYA member would after hearing the statements
                    be more inclined to vote for a fellow conservative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">My findings on the natural and ordinary meaning of the
                statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The statements in question must be interpreted
                    in the light of the context described above. I am of the view that the statement
                    in the Flyer was simply a call by the defendant for CYA members to ensure that
                    the $90m continues to be in the control of CYA. The words “ensure that
                    the assets and $90m funds of Char Yong Dabu Association do not fall into the
                    hands of outsiders” simply meant that the defendant appealed to members
                    of CYA not to accept the suggestion made at the October 2011 AGM that the $90m
                    fund be an outright gift to CYF for it to <em>independently</em> manage the fund. The CYF is not totally comprised
                    of Hakka and Char Yong (Dabu) heritage. It has a board of directors consisting
                    of ten members of CYA’s Management Council and seven independent
                    directors. The seven independent directors may not be Hakka or of Char Yong
                    (Dabu) heritage. Thus they could be described as “outsiders” as
                    they lacked ties with CYA. The voters could “ensure” that their
                    conservative interests were advanced by voting conservative CYA members into the
                    35th Management Council. They could be assured that these members would not
                    adopt a liberal policy in relation to the management and control of the funds
                    held by CYF.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It was also in this light that the defendant
                    appealed to the “conscience” of the CYA members. He was asking
                    them to vote wisely while being aware of the need to preserve their Char Yong
                    (Dabu) heritage. This was possibly the principal reason for adopting a
                    conservative stance towards the issue of the management and control of CYF
                    funds. This then explained why the words “to protect the dignity of the
                    people of Char Yong Dabu Association” were used in the
                Flyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Similarly, the exhortation to “better
                    safeguard” the funds held by CYF in the Brochure was also a plea for
                    members to vote conservative candidates into the 35th Management Council. This
                    was made especially clear by the follow up statement which read
                    “[s]trictly prohibit the carving-out of the Association’s
                    Foundation Assets to be an Independent Entity” which was a call for the
                    CYA members to oppose the idea that CYF should hold the funds independently of
                    CYA. This also ties in with the appropriate interpretation of the statement in
                    the Flyer, which was distributed together with the Brochure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The first plaintiff in his unguarded moments
                    candidly revealed his true understanding about the statements. Under
                    cross-examination, he indicated that he would not have found the statements to
                    be defamatory if they had been made at a board of directors meeting:

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     If the plaintiffs were of the view that the
                    statements indicated a mismanagement of funds, a fact that was entirely untrue,
                    why would they condone such allegations being made at a board meeting? They
                    would still be defamatory since they would be false allegations of misconduct or
                    mismanagement of funds. I was therefore not surprised that after an adjournment
                    of the trial proceedings, the first plaintiff realised the implication of his
                    earlier answers and retracted his position. He said that he would still have
                    taken issue with the making of the statements even if they were made at a board
                    of directors meeting. I am of the view that this was an
                afterthought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The first plaintiff probably also regarded the
                    statements as referring to the management and control of the funds held by CYF
                    above. He must have felt that such an issue was better dealt with behind closed
                    doors given its divisive nature and the impact that it might have on the
                    election. That would explain why he would have been amenable to having the issue
                    aired at a board of directors meeting rather than during the course of the
                    election. It is telling of the weakness of the plaintiffs’ case that even
                    the first plaintiff was aware that the statements pertained to the management
                    and control of funds rather than the alleged insinuation of a mismanagement of
                    funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     I therefore do not agree with the plaintiffs
                    that the statements suggested a mismanagement of funds. Hence the statements
                    could not mean “that the funds in the foundation had gone
                        missing”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Neither could the statements
                    mean that “the assets … had fallen into the hands of
                        outsiders”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> An ordinary,
                    reasonable and reasonably interested CYA member with an understanding of the
                    issue relating to the management and control of funds held by CYF would not have
                    interpreted the statements as suggesting a mismanagement of funds or that the
                    funds had already fallen into the hands of outsiders. Such a CYA member would
                    have understood the defendant as merely appealing to the members to vote
                    conservative candidates into the 35th Management Council to oppose the idea that
                    CYF should hold the funds independently of CYA. The statements were thus
                    non-defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I would also like to point out that the
                    defendant was part of the CYF’s board of directors at the time the
                    statements were made. It would have been absurd for him to make the statements
                    that defamed the CYF’s board of directors at a time when he was competing
                    at the election, especially when he was the leader of his campaigning team (see
                    also [30] above). That would have meant that he was lowering his own standing
                    amongst CYA members as well. The plaintiffs contended that the defendant did
                    this out of desperation. There was no evidence to suggest that the defendant
                    would have taken such desperate and illogical measures. Moreover, the defendant
                    had endorsed eight members of the CYF board of directors, including the fourth
                    plaintiff, as members of his team in his list of 35 recommended candidates for
                    the 35th Management Council election. It would seem highly improbable that the
                    defendant would defame the candidates he recommended to the voters. I cannot
                    accept such a submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The opinion of CYA members regarding the statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The plaintiffs called two CYA members, namely
                    PW1 and PW3, to give their views on their understanding of the statements. They
                    opined that the statements were defamatory in nature as they suggested that
                    there was a mismanagement of funds. The plaintiffs submitted that the court
                    should accept PW1 and PW3’s opinions since they were neutral and
                    reasonable members of CYA. I wish to reiterate that the court is required to use
                    the objective test of an ordinary, reasonable and reasonably interested CYA
                    member to ascertain whether the statements are defamatory. Thus neither the
                    intention of the defendant nor what the plaintiffs understood to be the meaning
                    of the statements matter. The views of any particular CYA member are also not
                    decisive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I find that the interpretations of PW1 and PW3
                    went against the grain of the natural and ordinary meaning of the statements in
                    the Flyer and Brochure. Their testimonies were also biased and partial. PW3 even
                    said that the statements suggested that CYF Directors had misappropriated the
                    $90m fund. However I find that there is no way for the purported defamatory
                    statements to have such meanings, short of distorting them. I also question the
                    objectivity of PW1, as he had admitted that he was particularly sensitive to the
                    statements during cross-examination:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The ordinary, reasonable and reasonably
                    interested CYA member cannot be overly sensitive: <em>Bernard
                        Chan</em> at [18]. The fact that PW1 admitted to being “very
                    sensitive” would therefore disqualify his opinion as to how the
                    statements should be read. In my view, it is unsafe to rely on PW1 and
                    PW3’s understanding of the statements. The objective test must be used to
                    ascertain the meaning of the statements from the perspective of an ordinary,
                    reasonable and reasonably interested CYA member. In other words <em>“…</em>the ordinary reasonable person is very
                    much an average rational layperson, neither brilliant nor foolhardy, and not
                    idiosyncratic in his behaviour or disposition”: <em>Bernard Chan</em> at [18].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The apology of the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The plaintiffs submitted in evidence the
                    transcript of the 21 December CYF board meeting in which the defendant was
                    confronted and interrogated at length on the statements in the Flyer and the
                    Brochure. They said that the defendant had admitted that the statements were
                    misleading and had caused hurt to the CYF board of directors. The defendant had
                    also apologised to the board of directors at this meeting. Therefore the
                    plaintiffs argued that the defendant had admitted to the defamatory
                    statements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I disagree. An audio recording was taken at
                    this meeting and I reproduce the relevant portion of the defendant’s
                    speech: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… So I also want to, isn’t it, use this opportunity,
                        isn’t it, to explain, isn’t it, that is the inconvenience and
                        misunderstanding that I have, isn’t it, caused to everyone,
                        isn’t it. I still want to apologise to everyone …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>It is clear that the defendant, in apologising, was not
                        admitting that the statements were defamatory. He only admitted that it had
                        caused some “misunderstanding”, for which he was apologising.
                        That was consistent with his evidence in the Interview. The defendant had
                        said that he had been wronged by the CYF board of directors. He had been
                        made to bear the responsibility for the statements even though he did not
                        make them. On 7 January 2013, he had sent a letter to the CYF board to
                        clarify the statements and complimented the work of the board. On 2 February
                        2013, the new CYF board (the first, second and fourth plaintiffs were not in
                        this board) accepted the defendant’s explanation. He was no longer
                        required to publish a public apology as required by the previous CYF board
                        in the 21 December board meeting. Be that as it may, the central issue of
                        this case turns on the natural and ordinary meaning of the statements and
                        not the intention of the defendant or the understanding of the plaintiffs.
                        This factor is thus irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiffs’ poor results at the election</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The plaintiffs further submitted that their
                    poor results at the 35th Management Council election supported their position
                    that the statements were defamatory. The first and second plaintiffs who were
                    part of the 34th Management Council lost their seats. The third plaintiff,
                    although elected into the 35th Management Council, also suffered a significant
                    plunge in his popularity. He was ranked fifth in the election for the 34th
                    Management Council but he was ranked 32nd in the election for the 35th
                    Management Council.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I am not convinced that the adverse results
                    were caused by the defendant’s statements. While the first, second and
                    third plaintiffs (although elected) did not perform well in the elections, the
                    election results also showed that eight board members and the fourth plaintiff,
                    who was a non-related director, were elected to the 35th CYA Management Council.
                    Nine out of the eleven board members who stood for the election were elected.
                    PW1, the treasurer of the board, had secured the highest number of votes. If the
                    statements of misappropriation of funds were believed, PW1 should logically not
                    have been elected or if elected should not have attained the highest number of
                    votes as he was the treasurer. Thus even if the plaintiffs had sought to rely on
                    the loss of votes as proof of the statements being defamatory, these
                    overwhelming results went against the plaintiffs’ case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Change of voting system</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     It must be emphasised that unlike previous
                    elections that allowed for voting via proxies, the election of the 35th
                    Management Council adopted for the first time a different method of voting. It
                    required all CYA members to vote in person. This change in voting method was
                    further discussed during the cross-examination of the third plaintiff:

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     I am also of the view that the poor results of
                    the plaintiffs at the election of the 35th Management Council were most probably
                    a result of the change in voting method. This also explained why the defendant
                    suffered a sharp decline in his popularity at the election of the 35th
                    Management Council. He was previously one of the top five elected candidates at
                    the election of the 34th Management Council whereas he was ranked 28th at the
                    election of the 35th Management Council.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My conclusion on the first issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In summary, I hold that the statements are not
                    defamatory in nature. Therefore I am unable to accept the plaintiffs’
                    submission that “the effect of the Flyer was to cast doubt on the
                    competence, honesty and integrity of the then CYF Board”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The plaintiffs have
                    failed to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case of
                    defamation. For completeness, and as the parties have submitted on the defences
                    of qualified privilege and fair comment, I shall proceed to give my views on
                    those submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defence of qualified privilege</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Qualified privilege is a common law defence
                    against defamation. This defence arises in situations when the defendant has an
                    interest or a duty, legal, social or moral to communicate certain information
                    and the recipient has the corresponding interest or duty to receive the
                    information also. It is commonly known as the duty-interest test. The Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Bernard Chan</em> at [86] has explained the
                    nature of the defence of qualified privilege as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The nature of the defence of qualified privilege is explained in <em>Gatley on Libel &amp; Slander</em> (Patrick Milmo and W V
                        H Rogers eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed, 2008) ("<em>Gatley</em>") at para 14.1:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There are circumstances in which, on grounds of public policy and
                        convenience, less compelling than those which give rise to absolute
                        privilege, a person may yet, without incurring liability for defamation,
                        make statements of fact about another which are defamatory and in fact
                        untrue. These are cases of qualified privilege ... For a very long time
                        these cases primarily concerned communications of a 'private' nature,
                        commonly arising out of the necessities of some existing relationship
                        between the maker of the statement and the recipient. Protection was granted
                        if the statement was 'fairly warranted by the occasion' (that is to say,
                        fell within the scope of the purpose for which the law grants the privilege)
                        and so long as it was not shown by the person defamed that the statement was
                        made with malice, i.e. with some indirect or improper motive, which was
                        typically established by proof that the defendant knew the statement to be
                        untrue, or was recklessly indifferent as to its truth...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     However, the defence of qualified privilege is
                    explicitly curtailed in the context of election proceedings under s 14 of the
                    Defamation Act, which reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">Limitation of privilege at elections</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14<b>.</b> A defamatory statement published by or
                        on behalf of a candidate in any election to the office of President or to
                        Parliament or other elected or partially elected body <em>shall not be deemed to be published on a privileged occasion on the
                            ground that it is material to a question in issue in the
                            election</em>, whether or not the person by whom it is published
                        is qualified to vote at the election.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiffs’ view</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant is
                    absolutely barred from relying on the qualified privilege defence because
                    Parliament disallowed this defence in an election. They referred to the
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Reports, Official
                        Report</em> (26 November 1998) vol 69 at cols 1764–1765, where
                    Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Elections and electioneering <em>should never be
                            justification for defaming or maligning an opposing candidate</em>
                        whether with words which are plain and ordinary in the meaning or, more
                        often than not, words with innuendo meaning. Why should the law give licence
                        to politicians, whether Opposition or Government, to make defamatory
                        statements? If any politician thinks it is in the public interest to expose
                        any character flaw or wrongdoing of an opposing candidate, he can and indeed
                        should do so. But, at the same time, he must be prepared to justify these
                        allegations, and that is the way it should be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The plaintiffs further made reference to
                        <em>Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew</em>
                    [1992] 1 SLR(R) 791 (“<em>JBJ</em>”) where
                    the Court of Appeal held that the circumstances of a general election were
                    insufficient to result in an occasion of privilege even if the subject-matter in
                    issue was a material one. The plaintiffs in this case submitted that there was
                    also no evidence that the matters were of current interest or in matters which
                    the CYA members would be interested at the time of the election.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The defendant’s view</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In contrast, the defendant submitted that
                    while s 14 deemed election proceedings to be insufficient in making out the
                    qualified privilege defence, it did not mean that the qualified privilege
                    defence was always inapplicable to an election situation. He argued that the
                    qualified privilege defence is available to him notwithstanding s 14
                    because he was not relying on the elections as a basis for establishing his
                    interest in communicating the statements to the CYA members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The defendant traced the history of s 14
                    back to the Defamation Ordinance 1957 (F M Ordinance No 20 of 1957)
                    (M’sia), which was inherited from Malaysia and which was in turn inherited
                    from the United Kingdom’s Defamation Act 1952 (15 &amp; 16 Geo 6 &amp; 1
                    Eliz 2 c 66) (UK) (“the Defamation Act 1952”): <em>Singapore Parliamentary Reports, Official Report</em> (13 January
                    1960) vol 12 cols 73–74 and <em>JBJ</em> at [58]. The
                    defendant submitted that s 10 of the Defamation Act 1952 is <em>in pari materia</em> with s 14 and had been interpreted
                    by Denning MR in <em>Plummer v Charman And Others</em>
                    [1962] 1 WLR 1469 (“<em>Plummer</em>”) at
                    1472 not to preclude the applicability of the qualified privilege defence (in an
                    election situation).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>
                    Similarly, the possibility of the privilege being invoked in electoral
                    situations was observed by Upjohn LJ in the same case, although he observed that
                    the possibility might be a “theoretical one”. This position was
                    reaffirmed in <em>Culnane v Morris</em> [2006] 1 WLR
                    2880.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Next, the defendant further submitted that
                    s 14 should not apply if the communicator of the statements was under a
                    public or private duty, legal or moral, in matters where his interests were
                    concerned, to communicate it to the persons who were in fact the electors who
                    had an interest in receiving them: <em>Plummer</em> at
                    1472.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In this case, the defendant thus argued that
                    his statements were made at the election campaign. He was under a public or
                    private duty, legal or moral, in matters where his interests were concerned, to
                    communicate the statements to CYA members who were the voters. The CYA members
                    also had an interest in receiving them.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> Such circumstances would be
                    sufficient to establish the qualified privilege defence because the privilege
                    was being claimed on the basis of the traditional common law duty-interest test.
                    It was not being claimed on the basis that the statements were material to the
                    question in issue in an election, which is prohibited by s 14 of the
                        Act.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The defendant further argued that if the
                    statements were found to be defamatory he had a duty to inform the CYA members
                    of the importance to protect and safeguard the huge assets of CYA from being
                    fallen into the hands of outsiders. The CYA members also had a corresponding
                    interest to know and decide the fate of the $90m fund which was held on trust by
                    CYF for CYA’s benefit. Thus the defence submitted that the defence of
                    qualified privilege was made out as the statements were made without
                    malice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">My views on the interaction between s 14 and the qualified privilege
                defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Does s 14 disallow the defendant from
                    relying on the defence of qualified privilege as the statements were made in the
                    course of the election of members of the 35th CYA Management Council? A close
                    scrutiny of s 14 does not show that Parliament has totally precluded the
                    defence of qualified privilege in an election situation. The crucial phrase of
                    s 14 is as follows: “…<em>shall not be deemed
                        to be published on a privileged occasion on the ground that it is material
                        to a question in issue in the election…</em>”. This
                    means that the defendant cannot found his qualified privilege defence on the
                        <em>sole</em> event of an election. We can see that the
                    courts have been reluctant to allow the defendants to seek refuge under
                    qualified privilege as a defence for defamation in an election. I shall make
                    reference to case law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In <em>JBJ</em>, the
                    respondent was the former Prime Minister of Singapore who sued the appellant, an
                    opposition politician, for slander because of what he said at a political rally
                    on 26 August 1988. His case was that the appellant had disparaged him as the
                    Prime Minister and thus had harmed his character, credit and reputation. The
                    appellant had however sought to rely on the defence of qualified privilege on
                    the basis that his speech was made at a political rally. His case was that he
                    had a legitimate interest to make that speech to an audience who had a
                    corresponding and legitimate interest in receiving that communication. The Court
                    of Appeal disallowed this defence and stated at [72]–[73] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72    Parliament has thus legislated that the
                            circumstances of a general election are not sufficient to give rise to
                            an occasion of privilege even if the subject matter of the publication
                            is material to an issue in the election. It is true that the section is
                            limited to publications by or on behalf of a candidate in an election.
                            But that is indicative of Parliament’s intention as to the scope
                            of privilege to be attached to a speech made at an election, and
                                <em>the courts should be slow to extend such
                                privilege</em>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73    In our opinion, the appellant’s interest in
                            the subject matter of his speech and the interest, if any, of the
                            audience in the same subject matter are not enough, by themselves, to
                            found the defence of privilege; <em>there must also be
                                present a legal, moral or social duty on his part to communicate the
                                subject matter of his speech to the
                        audience</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>From the above, it is clear that while the Court of Appeal
                        held that courts should be slow to allow the qualified privilege defence to
                        be used in electoral situations, s 14 does not totally disallow the
                        defence of qualified privilege in an election.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     This position is also consistent with
                        <em>Plummer</em>. In that case, the plaintiff was an
                    elected Member of Parliament who was running for re-election. He sued the
                    defendants, who were opposing electoral candidates, for libel. The defendants
                    had sought to amend their pleadings to include the defence of qualified
                    privilege. The issue before the court was whether the amendments should be
                    allowed. In disallowing the amendment, Denning MR first commented that s 10
                    of the Defamation Act 1952 had overruled the previous position in <em>Braddock and others v Bevins and another</em> [1948] 1 KB 580
                    where the English Court of Appeal held that statements contained in an election
                    address regarding an opposing candidate and his supporters were published on a
                    privileged occasion, unless there was malice. Next at 1472, he held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It seems plain to me that that means that if the candidate
                        himself publishes a statement, or anyone publishes a statement on his
                        behalf, to the electors in support of his candidature, then it is no longer
                        a privileged occasion. The result is that in the ordinary way the only
                        defences open to a person who makes an election address and puts it out to
                        the electors is either that the words were true or that they were fair
                        comment on a matter of public interest. <em>I do not exclude
                            the possibility that there might be a case where a person might
                            conceivably say: “I am an elector; I made a communication to the
                            other electors on a matter of common interest to us in such
                            circumstances that it is privileged,” and it is not caught by
                            section 10</em>. I do not exclude the possibility of such a case,
                        but in all ordinary circumstances an election address published by or on
                        behalf of a candidate is no longer the subject of qualified privilege. The
                        only defences open, if defamatory statements are contained in it, are
                        justification or fair comment on a matter of public interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The possibility of statements falling outside
                    s 10 of the Defamation Act 1952 can also be discerned from Upjohn
                    LJ’s judgment where he stated at 1473:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I would think a somewhat theoretical one – where the
                        statement although contained in an election address, may be the subject of
                        some qualified privilege because, quite independently of it being the
                        occasion of an election or being contained in an election address, the
                        person who has made it was under a public or private duty, legal or moral,
                        in matters where his interests were concerned, to communicate it to the
                        persons who were in fact the electors who had an interest to receive
                        it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Therefore in this case, the defendant may find it extremely
                        difficult to avail himself to the defence of qualified
                    privilege.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In this case, does s 14 of the Act apply? I am
                    of the view that it does. The statements here were contained in the
                    defendant’s election manifesto made to canvass for votes. These statements
                    were his election strategy to win votes. They were the defendant’s
                    dominant or sole purpose for use in the election to compete against the
                    plaintiffs’ team. This is the typical election situation to which
                    s 14 applies and if the statements were defamatory, the defendant cannot
                    rely on the event of an election to set up his defence of qualified privilege.
                    Since he has not shown any other reason apart from the event of the election to
                    justify his publication of the statements, he cannot rely on the qualified
                    privilege defence. I shall now address whether the fair comment defence is
                    available to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the defence of fair comment available to the defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The fair comment defence is founded upon the
                    protection and promotion of freedom of comment by anyone on matters of public
                    interest: <em>Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd v Wright Norman
                        and others and another suit</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 410 at [32]. To
                    establish this defence, the following elements must be satisfied:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_a"></a>(a)     the words complained of must be
                        comments, though they may consist of or include inference of
                    facts;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_b"></a>(b)     the comment
                        is on a matter of public interest;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_c"></a>(c)     the comment is based on facts; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_85-p2_d"></a>(d)     the comment is one which a fair-minded
                        person can honestly make on the facts proved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were the statements comments or statements of fact?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     There is a difference between comments and
                    facts. The Court of Appeal explained this difference in <em>Review Publishing</em> at [140]–[141]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">140    The fundamental
                            rule is that the defence of fair comment applies only to <em>comments</em> and not imputations of facts, and the
                            difficulty lies precisely in trying to distinguish a comment from a
                            statement of fact. This difficulty, as well as the test for
                            distinguishing between comments and statements of facts, has been aptly
                            summarised by the learned authors of <em>Evans on
                                Defamation</em> ([26] <em>supra</em>) at
                            p 103 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>It will often be very difficult to decide whether a
                                given statement expresses a comment or [an] opinion, or by contrast
                                constitutes an allegation of fact</em>. The same words
                            published in one context may be statement[s] of fact, yet in another may
                            be comment[s]. <em>Therefore, whether this element of the
                                defence is established is one of fact, dependent upon the nature of
                                the imputation conveyed, and the context and circumstances in which
                                it is published. The test in deciding whether the words are fact or
                                comment is an objective one - namely, whether an ordinary,
                                reasonable reader on reading the whole article would understand the
                                words as comment[s] or [as] statements of fact</em>. The
                            statement must be recognisable as [a] comment by the ordinary,
                            reasonable and fair-minded reader having regard to the whole context of
                            the publication. <em>When such a reader cannot readily

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">141    Generally speaking, a comment is often equated
                            with a statement of opinion (see <em>Tun Datuk Patinggi
                                Haji Abdul-Rahman Ya'kub v Bre Sdn Bhd</em> [1996] 1 MLJ 393
                            at 408, where it was stated that "it is settled law that a comment is a
                            statement of opinion on facts truly stated", and <em>Lee
                                Kuan Yew v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</em> [1979-1980] SLR(R)
                            24 ("<em>Jeyaretnam JB</em>") at [57], where it was
                            stated that "[a] comment is a statement of opinion on facts") or a
                            statement of conclusion (see <em>Mitchell v
                                Sprott</em> [2002] 1 NZLR 766 at [19], where it was stated
                            that "[t]he defence applies when the words appear to a reasonable reader
                            to be conclusionary"). More specifically, a comment has been said to be
                            "something which is or can reasonably be inferred to be a deduction,
                            inference, conclusion, criticism, judgment, remark, observance, etc."
                            (see <em>Clarke v Norton</em> [1910] VLR 494 at
                            499; see also generally <em>Gatley</em> at para
                            12.6).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Whether the statements are comments or facts
                    depends on the understanding of the ordinary and reasonable CYA member of the
                    statements. This principle was articulated by Lord Porter in <em>Kemsley v Foot</em> [1952] AC 345 (“<em>Kemsley</em>”) at 356 (see also <em>The Law of
                        Torts in Singapore</em> at para 13.014):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the defendant accurately states what some public man has really done,
                        and then asserts that ‘such conduct is disgraceful’, this is
                        merely the expression of his opinion, his comment on the plaintiff’s
                        conduct. So [it is], if without setting it out, he identifies the conduct on
                        which he comments by a clear reference. In either case, the <em>defendant enables his readers to judge for themselves how far
                            his opinion is well founded</em>; and, therefore, what would
                        otherwise have been an allegation of fact becomes merely a comment. But if
                        he asserts that the plaintiff has been guilty of disgraceful conduct, and
                        does not state what the conduct was, this is an allegation of fact for which
                        there is no defence but privilege or truth. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The defence of fair comments will only be relevant if the
                        statements are considered to be defamatory and the statements must therefore
                        first mean that the plaintiffs have been remiss in their duties.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> The plaintiffs
                        submitted that the statements were not comments because there was an imputed
                        meaning that the plaintiffs had been incompetent, lacking in integrity and
                        lacking in honesty with no basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     I cannot agree with the plaintiffs’
                    submission. The statements were exhortatory comments by the defendant to the CYA
                    members beseeching them to vote for candidates who believed in keeping the
                    control and management of CYF and its assets within CYA. They were not
                    statements of fact. There were two factions at the election with different ideas
                    on how to manage and control the $90m fund (see above at [48] – [50]). The
                    statements could not be facts as the $90m fund had not fallen into the hands of
                    outsiders. Instead, I find that they were merely expressions of the
                    defendant’s views or opinions regarding the control and management of the
                    $90m fund. Moreover, the defendant had clarified in the Interview that the
                    statements were not personal attacks against the CYF independent directors but
                    simply his view that the control and management of CYF should remain with CYA.
                    There was no express allegation of misconduct in the statements. The ordinary
                    reasonable person reading those comments would thus understand them to be
                    comments rather than statements of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were the statements relating to matters of public interest?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     What constitutes public interest is wide and
                    includes any matter affecting people at large so that they may be legitimately
                    interested in what is going on or how they might be affected: <em>Aaron Anne Joseph and others v Cheong Yip Seng and others</em> [1996]
                    1 SLR(R) 258 (“<em>Aaron Anne Joseph</em>”)
                    at [75]. The term “public interest” has been read widely by
                    Denning MR in <em>London Artists Ltd v Littler Grade Organisation
                        Ltd</em> [1969] 2 QB 375 at 391 when he held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no definition in the books as to what is a matter of public
                        interest. All we are given is a list of examples, coupled with the statement
                        that it is for the judge and not for the jury. I would not myself confine it
                        within narrow limits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Such matters have been held to pertain not
                    just to matters of national importance, but also matters in which a significant
                    number of people would have a legitimate interest in (see <em>London Artists Ltd</em> and <em>South Hetton Coal
                        Company, Limited v North-Eastern News Association, Limited</em> [1894]
                    1 QB 133). Here, the statements concerned the $90m held on trust by CYF. The
                    election of appropriate candidates into the 35th CYA Management Council would be
                    important for the safeguarding of the fund. This is a matter that is
                    understandably of concern to the members of CYA. Given that many clan
                    associations in Singapore run charitable initiatives, it is my view that the
                    statements referred to matters of public interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Were the comments based on facts?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The plaintiffs argued that the facts relied
                    upon by the defendant must be true. The defendant sought to rely on a proposal
                    (“the 7 October proposal”) made at a CYA Board of Directors
                    meeting on 7 October 2011 as the basis of his comments. The 7 October proposal
                    envisaged that instead of CYF holding the $90m fund on trust for CYF, the latter
                    would have full control over the $90m fund with certain conditions attached. The
                    plaintiffs submitted that this was merely a suggestion that CYA might wish to
                    consider in the future.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>
                    It did not suggest that the money was to be an outright gift to CYF without
                    restrictions and processes to have control over the funds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Therefore,
                    it could not constitute a fact on which the defendant’s statements could
                    be based on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The crux of this issue rests on the
                    interpretation of the 7 October proposal. It is not disputed that the 7 October
                    proposal was a suggestion made by PW1 and the second plaintiff. In my view, the
                    basis of the defendant’s statements was on the 7 October proposal and it
                    is a fact that the suggestion was made. The defendant, being a more conservative
                    CYA member, would understandably be concerned at the perceived
                    “loosening” of control by the CYA over the funds should the 7
                    October proposal be considered and eventually come into fruition in the future.
                    This was the background behind the defendant’s statements. This position
                    would also uphold the objective of the fair comment defence, which is premised
                    on the protection and promotion of free speech (see [85] above). Thus I find
                    that the statements were based on facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the defendant fair-minded and honest when he made the statements
                on the facts?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Lastly, the plaintiffs submitted that the
                    defendant could not have honestly made the comments in the statements. The
                    plaintiff argued that the defendant knew that legal advice was sought from M/s
                    Joo Toon &amp; Co on the 7 October proposal. The legal opinion indicated that
                    CYA could not transfer or confer any interest in the $90m fund to CYF and that
                    CYF could not claim any legal or equitable interests to the funds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Thus the
                    plaintiffs submitted that the comments made by the defendant did not satisfy
                    this threshold because they were “extreme and grave
                        allegations”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     A fair comment is an opinion that a
                    fair-minded person could honestly hold, with some leeway given for prejudices
                    and exaggerations: <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em>
                    at para 13.026, citing <em>Aaron Anne Joseph</em> at
                    [77]–[78]. The test of honesty is an objective one (<em>Chen Cheng and another v Central Christian Church and other
                        appeals</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 236 at [48]) and the defendant is to be
                    given every allowance or latitude for prejudice and exaggeration as long as he
                    was fair-minded: <em>Aaron Anne Joseph</em> at
                        [78].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     I find that the defendant made the statements
                    honestly as a fair-minded person. He was opposed to the independence of CYF from
                    CYA. He was contesting an election and knew of the 7 October proposal which was
                    a suggestion made by the second plaintiff for consideration in the future. As
                    part of the 34th Management Committee standing for re-election, he would
                    understandably be concerned. Thus he would do his utmost to prevent the 7
                    October proposal from being considered by CYA’s Board. It is true that
                    legal advice was obtained from M/s Joo Toon &amp; Co. The latter opined that CYF
                    could neither claim a legal nor an equitable interest in the fund. It was also
                    not possible for CYA to transfer its interest in the fund to CYF. However, this
                    was of no comfort to the defendant since the CYA Constitution can be easily
                    changed by the CYA Management Council in order to accommodate CYF’s
                    independence from CYA should the 7 October proposal come to
                fruition.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The defendant has therefore satisfied the four
                    conditions needed in establishing the fair comment defence. I turn now to
                    examine whether the defendant was malicious when he made the statements as
                    malice would vitiate the fair comment defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was the defendant malicious?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     To find malice, there must be evidence to
                    indicate that the defendant did not genuinely believe in what he stated or that
                    he acted with a dominant motive of injuring the other person: <em>Bernard Chan</em> at [90]. The plaintiffs submitted that the
                    defendant did not raise any objection when the 7 October proposal was raised at
                    the meeting. He also did not bring up this issue before the defendant decided to
                    form his own team for the election. Neither did he mention the 7 October
                    proposal at the CYF board meeting on 21 December to seek clarification on the
                    statement. In my view, these omissions are insufficient to show that the
                    defendant lacked honesty when he made the statements. Furthermore, as noted at
                    [59] above, the defendant had endorsed the fourth plaintiff as member of his
                    team in the election campaign. It is highly inconsistent and improbable that he
                    would endorse them and later make a malicious statement against them. Hence I am
                    satisfied that there was no malice on the facts and the defendant would succeed
                    on the fair comment defence if the statements were defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the High Court the correct forum to bring this action?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Before the commencement of the trial, at one
                    of the pre-trial conferences, the parties, particularly the plaintiffs, were
                    advised to review their options on whether the High Court or the State Courts
                    was the appropriate forum for this defamation suit.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>
                    The parties’ attention was drawn to the Court of Appeal case of <em>Koh Sin Chong Freddie v Chan Cheng Wah Bernard and others and
                        another appeal</em> [2013] 4 SLR 629 in which costs were awarded on

                    received an amount less than $250,000. The jurisdiction of the High Court can
                    only be invoked when the claim is for more than $250,000. Yet, the plaintiffs in
                    this case proceeded to pursue this suit in the High Court when in their closing
                    submissions they stated that the damages to be awarded to each plaintiff were to
                    be a minimum of $50,000 per plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> In the
                    circumstances, the High Court may not be the appropriate forum to bring their
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     This is an unfortunate case in which the
                    plaintiffs had overreacted to the defendant’s campaign slogan. They had
                    read into the purported defamatory statements extraneous matters that were not
                    in the statements, thus arriving at an offensive and derogatory meaning which no
                    ordinary reasonable person would have come to. The tempest in the teacup was
                    self-induced and unwarranted. For the reasons given above, the plaintiffs’
                    have failed to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case that
                    they had been defamed. Therefore I dismiss their claim. I will hear the parties
                    on the issue of costs.</p>
