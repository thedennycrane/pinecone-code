His main defence at trial was that his elevated Breath Alcohol Concentration (“BrAC”), as measured in his breath evidential analyser (“BEA”) test result, was attributable to his oral application of Bonjela gel after he had ceased to drive the motor van. This defence was rejected by the District Judge (“DJ”), who convicted the Appellant and sentenced him to three weeks’ imprisonment and a $6,000 fine (in default 12 days’ imprisonment). In addition, the Appellant was disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for four years (to take effect from the date of his release).

This was not a case where the Dräger Expert had simply made a bare assertion that the Dräger Alcotest 9510 SG could distinguish “mouth alcohol” from “breath alcohol”, to be believed by the DJ without question, and without any accompanying explanation as to <span class="font-italic">how</span> that distinction could be achieved in practice, for the DJ to assess the rationality and coherence of her evidence. The Dräger Expert had provided sufficient detail for the court to “examine the underlying evidence and the analytical process by which the [expert’s] conclusions are reached” (<span class="font-italic">Teo Ghim Heng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] 1 SLR 1240 at [38]) and to judge the cogency of her logic (<span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 67 at [95]). Further, the Dräger Expert had accompanied this detail with an explanation of the reasoning behind her conclusions (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor </span><span class="font-italic">v Chia Kee Chen</span> [2018] 2 SLR 249 at [118]). Having examined her evidence as such, I concluded that the Dräger Expert gave a logically cogent and compelling explanation, within the scope of her field of expertise, as to how any stomach alcohol entering the mouth via burping or belching would have been detected as “mouth alcohol” by the machine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I was also cognisant that where such expert evidence was based on sound grounds and supported by basic facts, the court would not be in a position to substitute its own views for that of an uncontradicted expert’s (<span class="font-italic">Sakthivel Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 983 (“<span class="font-italic">Sakthivel</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [76]; <span class="font-italic">Saeng-Un Udom v Public Prosecutor </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Saeng-Un</span>”) at [26]–[27]).

</div> However, as the Appellant conceded in oral submissions, he could find no basis in case law to support his assertion that expert evidence could not be accorded its due weight in the absence of corroboration by written documentation. To the contrary, I considered that such a submission was inconsistent with the axiomatic proposition that a judge should be slow to substitute his or her own views for the uncontroverted expert evidence, on a matter falling outside of the expertise of the court, where that expert explanation is based on sound grounds and is not contradicted by the extrinsic facts or otherwise obviously lacking in defensibility (<span class="font-italic">Sakthivel </span>at [74] and [76]; <span class="font-italic">Saeng-Un</span> at [26]–[27]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In any event, the Dräger Expert’s evidence that the machine would be able to distinguish between “mouth alcohol” and “breath alcohol” had, in fact, been corroborated by the Draeger Experiment Results, as had been attested to by the Draeger Experimenter. The experiment results, relayed in an email to Dräger Safety AG, showed that two experiments had been conducted (orally applying 1 cm and 2 cm of Bonjela gel respectively), that showed that, post-application, the machine indicated “Mouth Alcohol” within 20 minutes, and gave only negative readings thereafter.

</div> The findings of the Defence Experiment Results were thus unhelpful in answering the question of whether the Dräger Alcotest 9510 SG <span class="font-italic">specifically</span>, due to its functionality and the method by which it arrives at a valid BEA test result, would be capable of distinguishing “mouth alcohol” from “breath alcohol”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Accordingly, even if the Appellant’s stomach alcohol had not been fully absorbed when the Administering Officer performed the BEA test, and even if the Appellant had burped or belched during the BEA test, any stomach alcohol which could have entered the Appellant’s mouth would have been detected as “mouth alcohol” by the machine as there would have been no “plateau” in the alcohol concentration levels over the course of the Appellant’s breath.

</div>
</div> In my view, this omission was striking. The word “belch”, for example, is defined in the <span class="font-italic">Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary</span> (Diana Lea and Jennifer Bradbery ed) (Oxford University Press, 10th ed, 2023) as “to let air come up noisily from your stomach and out through your mouth”. Such an action would not be a bodily function that would have gone unnoticed (or unheard) by the Appellant. I was thus inclined to find the Appellant’s omission to mention that he burped or belched, in either his statements or his testimony in court, as strongly indicative of the fact that no such actions had in fact occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The Appellant, however, attempted to downplay the significance of that omission in his submissions on appeal. He argued, in particular, that “[i]t would have been unnecessary for him to [give evidence of such burping or belching in his EIC] since his entire stated defence turned on whether burping [or] belching affected the breathalyser reading”. His omission to give such evidence ought not to be “held against” him, because the Prosecution likewise failed to challenge the Appellant’s case of burping or belching in cross-examination. In light of the testimony of multiple witnesses at the trial below, this “issue of belching [or] burping caused by Bonjela was such a prominent feature of the trial that it would be unjust to deny the Appellant’s defence of belching [or] burping affecting the breathalyser readings”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 I was of the view that these submissions of the Appellant were misplaced as they conflated two entirely distinct issues of fact. In order to satisfactorily make out the statutory exception in s 71A(2), based on a claim of burping or belching after the ingestion of Bonjela gel, the burden of proof was on the Appellant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, two separate points of fact – <span class="font-italic">first</span>, that a test subject burping or belching following the use of Bonjela gel, during the administration of a breathalyser test upon them, could give rise to an elevated BrAC reading on the Dräger Alcotest 9510 SG machine; and <span class="font-italic">second</span>, that the Appellant had <span class="font-italic">in fact</span> burped or belched during the course of <span class="font-italic">his</span> breathalyser test on 14 June 2019, following his post-driving application of the Bonjela gel that day. Evidence of <span class="font-italic">both</span> of these facts had to be adduced. Proof of the former could not logically act as a substitute for proof of the latter. Showing that application of Bonjela gel could have affected a breathalyser test by burping or belching was a distinct question from whether the Appellant had in fact burped or belched. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Hence, that the Appellant never once testified that he had burped or belched during his breathalyser test on 14 June 2019 meant that there was no evidence adduced at trial to infer that he had, in fact, burped or belched in his breathalyser test. I also observed, for completeness, that the Administering Officer’s evidence was that he could not remember if the Appellant had burped during his BEA test.

The Dräger Expert expressly confirmed, in her cross-examination, that no waiting period had to be observed after the receipt of that particular error message.

</div> The HSA Expert had clarified the contents of the HSA Report by explaining that the need to obtain two different BEA readings, with a waiting period of 2-- to 10 minutes between the two, was to ensure that the one BEA reading was not the product of “mouth alcohol” being detected instead. She explained that “most countries practise doing 2 readings, 2 to 10 minutes apart, <span class="font-italic">to verify that there is no mouth alcohol effect</span>”, and this may be necessary “[b]ecause mouth alcohol, if present, is <span class="font-italic">random.

</div> This cohered with her explanation of how the Dräger Alcotest 9510 SG was able to distinguish between “mouth alcohol” and “breath alcohol”, which logically implied that a “mouth alcohol effect” would result in an error message rather than a valid first result. Given that I had already found that the DJ rightly accepted the evidence of the Dräger Expert on this point, and that it fell within her area of expertise, I was of the view that this should be accorded greater weight than the evidence given by the HSA Expert. I was thus of the view that there was insufficient evidence to support the Appellant’s assertion that a single BEA test result from the Dräger Alcotest 9510 SG machine was unreliable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In summary, I was not convinced that there had been any error, let alone one justifying appellate intervention, in the DJ’s finding that the Appellant had failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that his BEA test result of 75g / 100ml being over the prescribed limit was attributable to his post-driving oral application of Bonjela gel. The Appellant thus failed to make out the exception under s 71A(2) of the RTA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 First, the Appellant had failed to show that his BEA test result being above the prescribed limit was attributable to him burping or belching during the breathalyser test, owing to his post-driving oral application of the Bonjela gel. There was no evidence that alcohol would have been left unabsorbed in his stomach after the passing of two hours, or that he had even burped or belched in the first place. Further, even if the Appellant had burped or belched, and there had happened to be unabsorbed alcohol in his stomach, this would have been indicated as a “mouth alcohol” error message on the Dräger Alcotest 9510 SG machine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Second, the Appellant had failed to show that his BEA test result being above the prescribed limit was attributable to him having Bonjela gel trapped within the crack-line of his upper right molar during the administration of the breathalyser test, owing to his post-driving oral application of the Bonjela gel. Even if Bonjela gel had remained trapped in his tooth’s crack-line at the time of the breathalyser test, this would have been indicated as a “mouth alcohol” error message on the Dräger Alcotest 9510 SG machine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Third, the Appellant had failed to show that his BEA test result being above the prescribed limit was otherwise attributable to his post-driving oral application of the Bonjela gel, in the absence of any burping or belching during the course of the breathalyser test or any Bonjela gel having been trapped in his tooth’s crack-line at that time. There was no evidence that the alcohol would have remained in his mouth for more than 20 minutes after his last application of Bonjela gel. Even if there had been alcohol in his mouth, this would have been indicated as a “mouth alcohol” error message on the Dräger Alcotest 9510 SG machine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Fourth, the Appellant had failed to show that there had been improprieties in the administration of his breathalyser test by the Administering Officer. There was no requirement for the Administering Officer to observe a waiting period after the appearance of the error message “ALC. CONC. NOT STABLE”, and there was insufficient evidence that the omission to obtain two distinct BEA test results would have had any impact on the accuracy of such a test.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Accordingly, I found that the DJ did not err in giving effect to the assumption under s 71A(1) of the RTA that the breath alcohol level within the Appellant’s body, at the time of the alleged offence, was as indicated in the BEA reading that was obtained in this case – <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, 75g / 100ml.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 For the above reasons and given the Appellant’s discontinuance of his appeal against sentence mentioned at [20] above, I dismissed the Appellant’s appeal against conviction and sentence.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Wen Cheng Adrian (August Law Corporation) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gregory Gan (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
