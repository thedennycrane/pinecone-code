At the meeting, the 2nd defendant entered into written receivables purchase agreements on behalf of VPD and PCPL, with ARC Trade Finance Fund (“ARC”) which was owned by Centurion. I will refer to these agreements as the “VPD RPA” and the “PCPL RPA”. These agreements governed the sale of receivables by VPD and PCPL to ARC, and both are titled “Receivables Purchase Agreement”. ARC was the “Financing Entity” and the sellers were both corporate entities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11  There is some dispute between the parties about whether Chin orally explained to the 2nd defendant at the meeting how the VPD RPA would work, and that it was an agreement for the sale and purchase of receivables. According to the 2nd defendant, Chin only explained how Centurion would offer VPD business financing if VPD provided its customers’ invoices to Centurion. The 2nd defendant also averred that her understanding of the process was that she would be given money upon providing her customers’ invoices to Centurion, and then required to repay Centurion with a larger amount of money at a later date.

A total sum of $19.5m was paid back under the arrangement. The 2nd defendant’s position is that interest of $1.5m was paid in respect of the monies advanced on these 174 invoices.

Whilst these 174 invoices are not the subject matter of the present dispute, the 2nd defendant submitted that a trial was warranted so that the nature of these 174 invoices could be explored. The point raised was that an examination of the circumstances relating to the 174 invoices together with the 60 invoices in dispute in the present case (see [25] below) would support her case that the transactions were in fact money-lending.

As the 1st defendant did not do so, the 60 Traded Debts became “disputed debts” within the meaning of the CS T&amp;Cs.

The 1st defendant was responsible for collecting and enforcing payment of the Traded Debts by the Customers, so that the investors could be paid. The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs may require the 1st defendant to repurchase the Traded Debts on the basis that they have become “Disputed Debts” within the meaning of cl 17.1, which provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“<span class="font-weight-bold">Disputed Debt</span>” means a Debt (a) payable by a Customer who the Seller knows or ought to know is disputing or is likely to dispute its liability to pay the Debt in full or to pay the Debt by the Expected Payment Date, (b) is not paid within 14 days after the Expected Payment Date except when such non payment is due to the insolvent winding-up or bankruptcy of the Customer, or (c) which will be reduced to be less than its Face Value without the Purchasing Investors’ consent</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As the Traded Debts were disputed by the Customers and not paid within 14 days of the Expected Payment Dates, they became “Disputed Debts”, such that the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs were entitled to require the 1st defendant to repurchase them. Although the defendants dispute their liability for the repurchase price generally, they do not contend that the calculations done at [31] by the plaintiffs in accordance with the formula in cl 10.2 are inaccurate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On the basis of the express terms in the CS T&amp;Cs that govern the contractual relationship between the parties, it is clear to me that the plaintiffs have made out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for judgment against the 1st defendant on the contractual claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As for the 2nd defendant, she had “irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee[d]” by way of the Guarantee to pay on demand “all present and future payment obligations and liabilities” of the 1st defendant incurred under the CS T&amp;Cs “arising out of any obligation to repurchase any present or future Traded Debt”. She had also “irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee[d] the due and punctual performance and observance by the [1st defendant] of its repurchase obligations under the CS T&amp;Cs” to the 2nd plaintiff and each investor.

</div> I note as well that the sum claimed under the alternative claims (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $6,783,433.86, being the plaintiffs’ share of the advance sum paid for the Traded Debts) is lower than the sum claimed under the primary claims (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $8,464,740.92 and upwards, being the plaintiffs’ share of the aggregate repurchase price payable by the defendants which will continue to accrue until the date of the judgment). That said, I nonetheless state that I also find that the plaintiffs have made out a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case in respect of the alternative claims. I will be brief in my reasons on this issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Fraudulent misrepresentation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In <span class="font-italic">Panatron Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [14], the Court of Appeal summarised the elements of the tort of deceit as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… First, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct. Second, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the plaintiff. Third, it must be proved that the plaintiff had acted upon the false statement. Fourth, it must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing. Fifth, the representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it must be wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The defendants’ position on whether the 60 invoices are fabricated is odd to say the least. They do not affirmatively plead that the 60 invoices are genuine. Then again, they do not admit that the invoices were in fact fabricated. Instead, as noted at [28] above, what is pleaded is merely that the allegations are not admitted, and the plaintiffs are put to strict proof. The responses in evidence of Evershine and Fish &amp; Co however make clear that the invoices in their names were fabricated or false. Indeed, the 2nd defendant is now facing 60 charges of cheating under the Penal Code in respect of the 60 trades. Whilst this court is aware that the 2nd defendant has not been convicted of any of the charges, the equivocal pleadings of the defendants as to whether the 60 invoices are genuine or false or fabricated is disturbing. These invoices are from the 1st defendant which operates under the control of the 2nd defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The inescapable conclusion is that these invoices were fabricated by the 1st defendant and listed on the CS Platform so that they would be purchased by investors. In so doing, the 1st defendant made a wilfully false representation with the intention that it be acted upon by the plaintiffs and other investors. The plaintiffs who purchased the Traded Debts acted upon this false representation to their detriment. This satisfies all elements of the tort and establishes a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>claim for the return of the plaintiffs’ share of the advance sum paid to the 1st defendant in respect of the 60 Traded Debts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I briefly remark that if the 60 invoices are in fact genuine trade receivables as the plaintiffs have been led to believe, then as I will discuss below, there would be no viable defence of moneylending. On the other hand, if the 60 invoices are fake or fabricated, this would not affect the plaintiffs’ position as purchasers of the Traded Debts, unless the VPM RPA was a sham and the plaintiffs, in particular the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs, were aware of and a party to an elaborate sham. There is nothing however that supports or tends to that conclusion. I will turn to this point again later.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Lifting of the corporate veil</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I also consider it appropriate for the 1st defendant’s corporate veil to be lifted, such that the 2nd defendant should be held personally liable in fraudulent misrepresentation. There appears to be no question that the 2nd defendant, the sole director and shareholder of the 1st defendant, was the one who had submitted the fabricated documents (the 60 invoices) and perpetrated the entire fraudulent scheme. The parties do not dispute that the very purpose of incorporating the 1st defendant was so that VP could list its receivables on the CS Platform (see [19] above), regardless of whether the incorporation of the 1st defendant had in fact been pursuant to suggestions made by Chin or anyone else. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In these circumstances, there is at least a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for the corporate veil to be pierced so as to prevent the abuse of corporate personality by the 2nd defendant as the 1st defendant’s true controller, and so that the court will not lend its aid to a fraudulent scheme (see <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sia Sukamto and another</span> [2013] 4 SLR 253 at [103], citing <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span> (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2009) at paras 2.50–2.51).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at pp 772– 775 sets out a helpful summary of the situations whereby a director incurs personal liability for the tort of a company. One situation is where the director authorised, directed or procured the company’s tort (at para 18.044). This also applies here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any case, the liability of the 2nd defendant does not rest solely on her liability as the sole director and shareholder and her role in the deceit. The 2nd defendant is in any case directly liable under the personal guarantee which she had entered into.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the illegal moneylending defence amounts to a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The burden now shifts to the defendants to show that they have a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence in order to resist summary judgment. As the defendants put it, they “rely on a singular defence to show cause why the Plaintiffs’ present application should be dismissed, on the basis of the illegal moneylending defence”.

</div> In essence, the defendants contend that the sale and purchase of the Traded Debts constitute loans that are unenforceable under the Moneylenders Act, while the plaintiffs deny this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant provisions in the Moneylenders Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 I begin with the relevant provisions in the Moneylenders Act. Section 5(1) provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) No person shall carry on or hold himself out in any way as carrying on the business of moneylending in Singapore, whether as principal or as agent, unless —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) he is authorised to do so by a licence;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) he is an excluded moneylender; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) he is an exempt moneylender.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Section 2 in turn defines “excluded moneylender” to include, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, any person who lends money solely to corporations (s 2(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(iii)(A)). The parties are in agreement that the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs are not authorised by licence to lend money, nor are they exempt moneylenders within the meaning of the Moneylenders Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Section 3 sets out the presumption that “[a]ny person, other than an excluded moneylender, who lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be a moneylender.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Section 14 on “Unlicensed moneylending” provides that the contravention of s 5(1) is a criminal offence. Section 14(2) then reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Where any contract for a loan has been granted by an unlicensed moneylender, or any guarantee or security has been given for such a loan —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the contract for the loan, and the guarantee or security, as the case may be, shall be unenforceable; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) any money paid by or on behalf of the unlicensed moneylender under the contract for the loan shall not be recoverable in any court of law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sheagar s/o T</span><span class="font-italic"> M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd </span>[2014] 3 SLR 524 (“<span class="font-italic">Sheagar</span>”) at [75] summarised the principles to be adopted in relation to s 14(2) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) To rely on s 14(2) of the MLA [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Moneylenders Act], the borrower must prove that the lender was an "unlicensed moneylender";</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) If the borrower can establish that the lender has lent money in consideration for a higher sum being repaid, he may rely on the presumption contained in s 3 of the MLA to discharge this burden;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The burden then shifts to the lender to prove that he either does not carry on the business of moneylending or possesses a moneylending licence or is an "exempted moneylender";</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) However, if there is an issue as to whether the lender is an excluded moneylender, the legal burden of proving that he is not will fall on the borrower.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It follows from the first principle in (a) that if the purported borrower cannot prove that the purported lender was an “unlicensed moneylender”, s 14(2) is inapplicable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the sale and purchase of the Traded Debts amounts to moneylending</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I agree with the plaintiffs that a sale and purchase of receivables is not generally to be regarded as a loan transaction. The “purchase of debts … for the purpose of providing finance, or relieving the seller from administrative tasks or from bad debts or for any or all of such purposes” is also known as “factoring” (Noel Ruddy, Simon Mills &amp; Nigel Davidson, <span class="font-italic">Salinger on Factoring</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th ed, 2006) (“<span class="font-italic">Salinger on Factoring</span>” at para 1-04). While the object and commercial purpose of a factoring facility may be similar to that of a loan facility, it is not a loan facility at least in form (see <span class="font-italic">SAL </span><span class="font-italic">Industrial Leasing Ltd v Hydtrolmech Automation Services Pte Ltd and others</span> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 676 at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The courts’ general approach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In <span class="font-italic">City Hardware Pte Ltd v Kenrich Electronics Pte Ltd</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 733 (“<span class="font-italic">City Hardware</span>”) at [24]–[25], the learned V K Rajah J (as he then was) articulated the courts’ general approach to determining whether a transaction constitutes moneylending:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 … What constitutes lending must of course remain a question of fact in every case.

One is by selling book-debts and another by selling unmatured bills, in each case for less than their face value. Another might be to buy goods on credit or against a post-dated cheque and immediately sell them in the market for cash. Their Lordships are, of course, aware, as was Branson J., that transactions of this sort can easily be used as a cloak for moneylending. The task of the court in such cases is clear. It must first look at the nature of the transaction which the parties have agreed. If in form it is not a loan, it is not to the point to say that its object was to raise money for one of them or that the parties could have produced the same result more conveniently by borrowing and lending money. But if the court comes to the conclusion that the form of the transaction is only a sham and that what the parties really agreed upon was a loan which they disguised, for example, as a discounting operation, then the court will call it by its real name and act accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In short, while factoring arrangements and the sale of book debts are not moneylending in form, the court will take a pragmatic approach by looking to the nature of the transaction and consider whether the arrangements are in fact a sham to disguise what was really a loan transaction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Reference was made in <span class="font-italic">City Hardware</span> (at [26] and [27(a)]) to the English case of <span class="font-italic">Olds Discount Co Ltd v John Playfair Ltd</span> [1938] 3 All ER 275 (“<span class="font-italic">Olds Discount</span>”), where it was held that the sale of book debts is not a moneylending transaction.

To show otherwise, the defendants raise a number of arguments, but I do not find them to be persuasive for the reasons stated below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 First, the defendants place reliance on the fact that the Traded Debts, as well as the receivables previously traded under the VPD RPA, were purchased at a discounted rate of 80% of the invoice value.

</div>
</div> However, this discount is fully consistent with the nature of a sale and purchase of receivables. The plaintiffs cite <span class="font-italic">Welsh Development Agency v Expert Finance</span><span class="font-italic"> Co Ltd</span> [1992] BCC 270 at 283, in which the English Court of Appeal explained that the “essence” of a factoring transaction is that the sale price is “necessarily discounted from the full aggregate face value of the debts”. This is primarily “because the trader will be getting an immediate payment, while the finance company will have to wait for the debts to come in from the debtors and they may well not be presently payable” (see also <span class="font-italic">Salinger on Factoring</span> at para 3-35).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 On a related note, the defendants seek to rely on the statutory presumption in s 3 of the Moneylenders Act that “[a]ny person, other than an excluded moneylender, who lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be a moneylender.”

</div> The defendants highlight that the discounted sums were paid out in consideration of larger sums being repaid. This may be true, but it misses the point that the presumption in s 3 requires the <span class="font-italic">lending</span> of money in the first place, which is not the case in a true sale of receivables. As Rajah J remarked in <span class="font-italic">City Hardware</span> at [24], “[i]t is axiomatic that if there has been no lending there can be no moneylending”. In this case, without some indication that the factoring of any of the Traded Debts or past receivables was in substance a loan transaction, the presumption in s 3 does not apply. Moreover, I add that it is expressly stated that s 3 does not apply to an “excluded moneylender”, and I will address this issue at [81] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Next, and also related to the above point regarding the discount rate, the defendants complain that the “interest rates” charged by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs were exorbitant, this being about 7.9% to 10% of the advance sums paid to the 1st defendant. Further, there was a 2% processing fee imposed for each transaction.

</div> Again, the fact of a discount or processing fees, even if “exorbitant” as the defendants claim, does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span> suggest that these were interest charges or that the sale of the Traded Debts were loans. As <span class="font-italic">Salinger on Factoring</span> states at para 3-35, “as opposed to interest which accrues from day-to-day, a discount is fixed as a deduction from the purchase price at the time of the purchase”. Further, although this was not specifically argued by the defendants, I agree with the plaintiffs that the imposition of some interest for overdue payment under the CS T&amp;Cs does not suffice to change the overall nature of the transactions involving the Traded Debts from factoring into loans.

</div> This contention is at odds with the CS T&amp;Cs, which provide that each sale and purchase took effect as an unconditional sale and purchase of the entire legal and beneficial interest in the said receivable (see [44] above). There is nothing to suggest that any invoice was meant to be held as a security interest. Nor do I find that the notices of assignment were held as security for lending. Even if Chin had previously told the 2nd defendant that Centurion would hold onto the notices of assignment “just in case” VPD failed to pay, this was done to facilitate the collection and enforcement of the receivables from VPD’s customers. The same applies for the 2nd plaintiff and the 1st defendant in respect of the Traded Debts; cl 6.1 of the CS T&amp;Cs provides for the 2nd defendant’s right to do so.

Here, the notices of assignment were only sent to the Customers on 30 March 2017 upon the 1st defendant’s failure to repurchase the Traded Debts (see [27] above). There is no basis upon which the court may infer that the invoices or the notices of assignment were being held by the 1st or 2nd plaintiffs as security for payment by the 1st defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The 2nd defendant’s affidavit made mention of two other arguments which I deal with briefly.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it was said that the obligation of payment always remained on the defendants, and that the 2nd plaintiff had no interest in whether the Customers had made payment.

</div> But by providing for the 2nd defendant’s right to collect and enforce the payment of the Traded Debts by the Customers, cl 6.1 of the CS T&amp;Cs shows that the 2nd defendant’s argument in this regard is inaccurate.

</div> In my view, it was entirely open to the 2nd plaintiff to contractually provide for the right to require the 1st defendant to repurchase the Traded Debts, and this does not necessarily indicate that the relevant transactions ought to be treated as loans. Indeed, such recourse provisions proved vital in protecting the interests of the plaintiffs, considering the events which precipitated following the sale of the Traded Debts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The defendants produced correspondence which they argue is consistent with their characterisation of the arrangement as loan transactions. Specifically, there was an instant messaging chat transcript between the 2nd defendant and Lee in December 2014, wherein Lee referred to Chin or Centurion as the “lender”.

</div> Lee was not a representative of ARC, Centurion or any of the plaintiffs, but a broker from Finaqe that was assisting VPD with procuring capital at the time. The context was that in late 2014, Lee was in contact with the 2nd defendant to assess VPD’s eligibility for a term loan, and to help VPD find alternative financing solutions. Considering this isolated use of the term “lender” by a third party in context, this does not suffice to create a triable issue. I also place little significance on the use of the words “repay”, “repaid” or “repayment” in certain contractual documents and correspondence between the parties,

According to the defendants, the contractual documents and agreements entered into by the parties and their predecessors were all meant “to facilitate, and provide a veneer of authenticity to, the arrangement between the parties which were, in essence, moneylending transactions”. The defendants seek to rely on the 174 invoices (which I have referred to above at [13]) submitted between 2014 and 2016 pursuant to a financing arrangement between Centurion and the 1st defendant’s predecessors, and highlight that “the total sum repaid was higher than the total sum that was advanced”. But again, the defendants do no more than to simply assert that the differences between the discounted price and face value of the invoices amount to exorbitant “interest” payments,

</div> I have already expressly dealt with some of these purported disputes (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the relevance of the 174 past invoices and the nature of the parties’ relationship as evidenced by correspondence), whereas some others (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the defendants’ awareness of the 3rd to 46th plaintiffs and whether the CS Platform was real) will be dealt with later on in the judgment. The remaining questions raised by the defendants are as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) who introduced Chin to Finaqe;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether Chin explained to the 2nd defendant at the 19 December 2014 meeting how the VPD RPA would work and the purpose of the notice of assignment; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) whether the 1st defendant was incorporated upon Chin’s suggestion.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 However, even supposing that these amounted to factual disputes, they are not legally significant facts for the determination of this case.

In relation to (ii), I note in particular that the VPD RPA and the documents constituting the CS Membership Agreement expressly set out the arrangements concerning the sale of invoices.

The defendants cannot create a triable issue in this regard simply by making unsupported assertions about the nature of the transactions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Moneylenders Act applies to the plaintiffs in any event</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Even if I am wrong in finding that there are no triable issues as to the nature of the factoring transactions, I note that s 5(1)(b) of the Moneylenders Act creates an exception for “excluded moneylenders”, which is defined in s 2(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)(iii)(A) to include any person who lends money solely to corporations (see [59] above). The defendants do not allege that the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs themselves loaned money to any specific entity or person apart from corporations. Based on the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs’ requirement that only corporations could list receivables on the CS Platform, this does not appear to be the case either. Although the defendants allege that Centurion and ARC had disbursed funds to “all and sundry, and not just corporations”,

Instead, the defence is that the monies were in fact loans to the 1st defendant. The question is, why would it be necessary to structure loans to the 1st defendant as transactions for the sale and purchase of receivables? After all, the Moneylenders Act does not catch loans to corporations. Whilst the Moneylenders Act does apply to cases where a person lends money to individuals (and non-corporate entities), it does not catch the sale and purchase of receivables for the reasons discussed earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Regardless, on the basis that the sale and purchase of the Traded Debts do not amount to moneylending, the defendants have not satisfied their burden of showing that they have a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence of illegal moneylending against the plaintiffs’ claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the defendants have any other defence that is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">bona fide</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For completeness, I will briefly deal with the other arguments raised in the defence (see [41] above), even though they were not canvassed in the defendants’ written or oral submissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether there was a contractual relationship</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 First, I reject the defendants’ argument that no contractual relationship existed between the parties.

</div> While I would have preferred to have supporting affidavits from at least a few of the 3rd to 46th plaintiffs before me, and for the plaintiffs’ solicitors to have been more forthcoming with producing the warrants to act when requested to do so by the defendants’ solicitors, I nonetheless see no reason to doubt that the investors and the transactions involving the Traded Debts were in fact genuine.

This assertion is supported by an email dated 8 February 2017 sent by Kuah to Lee explaining that the origination fee of 2% was being imposed (previously waived for the 1st defendant) to bring it in line with what was charged to the other sellers. Further, Kuah’s email stated that the cost of servicing the 1st defendant’s account had increased due to the need to answer investor queries, reimburse investors for interest discrepancies and follow up with latest bank and financial statements which the 2nd defendant had yet to receive.

</div>
</div> This is inaccurate. It was simply the case in <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC)</span> that the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation was not made out on the facts. As observed at [77] above, the facts here are easily distinguishable. It does not appear that the plaintiffs were aware that the invoices were fabricated, and the 2nd defendant’s conduct in contacting the Customers and filing a police report was entirely consistent with this.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, they argue that there is no basis to lift the corporate veil of the 1st defendant, as it was purportedly incorporated at Chin’s behest. In the same way that I found at [75] above that this dispute of fact was not legally significant in the context of the illegal moneylending defence, it does not detract from a finding that the corporate veil should be lifted. I reiterate that it was not seriously contended that the plaintiffs or Chin knew about the fabricated invoices. Even if Chin had made the initial suggestion that the 2nd defendant should incorporate a company to list VP’s receivables on the CS Platform, this does not change the fact of the 2nd defendant’s intention to use the 1st defendant as an instrument to further her fraudulent scheme.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Concluding Observations </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The plaintiffs had entered into what they thought were genuine contracts for purchase of account receivables of the 1st defendant: a company that was set up and run by the 2nd defendant. There is no dispute that the 1st defendant received and accepted considerable sums of money pursuant to the agreement. So far as the plaintiffs are concerned, the intention was to enter into a binding contract with the 1st defendant for the purchase of receivables. The defendants, on the other hand, took the position that the documents were a sham intended to mask the fact that the arrangement in substance was illegal moneylending, but failed to provide any support for their bare allegations in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 In summary, the defendants have not established that there is a fair or reasonable probability that they have a <span class="font-italic">bo</span><span class="font-italic">na fide</span> defence to the plaintiffs’ claims. I add that I do not see any other reason for a trial (see O 14 r 3(1) of the ROC).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span><span class="font-italic">(CA)</span>, the Court of Appeal observed at [2] that “the primary issue arising from the appellants’ claim in contract is legally straightforward, albeit factually intensive – whether the claim fails because the agreements were illegal moneylending contracts which are unenforceable under the Moneylenders Act”. This is similar to the present case. In coming to my decision, I am aware that <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading</span><span class="font-italic"> (HC) </span>was decided at first instance after a full trial. I am also cognisant of the Court of Appeal’s clear statement in <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading (CA) </span>at [206] that the Moneylenders Act extends not just to the rogue loan shark who preys on the poor and vulnerable, but to anyone who engages in the business of moneylending within the meaning of the Moneylenders Act without licence. There is no doubt that the Moneylenders Act fulfils an important regulatory purpose. That said, for my reasons at [77] and [93(a)] above, the present case is clearly distinguishable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Finally, it will be recalled <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> states at para 79/1/8 that if a bare allegation of moneylending is asserted to resist summary judgment, “the borrower <span class="font-italic">may</span> be given only conditional leave to defend” [emphasis added]. Nevertheless, it does not follow that the court must grant conditional leave just because a bare allegation of illegal moneylending has been made. Whether it is appropriate to do so (and on what conditions, such as payment into court of some, or all, of the amount claimed) must depend on the usual principles as discussed in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> at para 14/4/12. In the circumstances, whilst I do not see fit to grant the defendants conditional leave to defend, a very substantial payment would have been appropriate if I had been of the view that a case for conditional leave to defend was merited. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 For the above reasons, I grant summary judgment for the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 I allow the plaintiffs’ claim against the defendants for their share of the repurchase prices and repurchase fees in respect of the 60 Traded Debts, accruing until the date of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Under cl 14.1 of the CS T&amp;Cs, the 1st defendant agreed to compensate and indemnify the 1st plaintiff “in full for all losses, actions, proceedings, costs, claims, demands, awards, fines, orders, expenses and liabilities (including legal fees on an indemnity basis) incurred” in respect of any breach of the 1st defendant’s obligations under the CS Membership Agreement (cl 14.1(1)) or as a result of the 1st defendant’s “fraud or wilful misconduct” (cl 14.1(6)).
