</div> The applicant had asked for a moratorium period of six months. I heard this application on 14 August 2023 and granted a moratorium period of three months (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re</span> <span class="font-italic">Logistics Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2023] SGHC 231). In brief, I granted the shorter moratorium for the following reasons. First, I was convinced that the moratorium application had been brought in good faith and represented a genuine attempt by the applicant to obtain protection from its creditors while it sought to restructure its liabilities. Second, I found the support of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“OCBC”), which is the applicant’s largest creditor, to be important. Third, while I found the particulars in the proposed scheme to be sufficient, they did appear to be short of specific details. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">As such, I found that a relatively shorter moratorium of three months </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">would balance the interests of the applicant and its creditors.

</div> Accordingly, on the basis of the documents before me and applying the cashflow test set out in the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Sun Electric Power Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">RCMA Asia Pte Ltd (formerly known as Tong Teik Pte Ltd) </span>[2021] 2 SLR 478, in that a company is considered to be insolvent if its current liabilities exceed its current assets (within a 12-month timeframe) such that it will be unable to meet all of its debts when they fall due, I am satisfied that the applicant is unable to pay its debts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">There is a real prospect that one or more of the purposes of judicial management would likely be achieved</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Next, I am satisfied that, by placing the applicant under judicial management, there is a real prospect that one or more of the purposes of judicial management as set out in s 89(1) of the IRDA would likely be achieved. As the High Court explained in <span class="font-italic">Re</span> <span class="font-italic">X</span><span class="font-italic"> Diamond Capital Pte Ltd (Metech International Ltd, non-party) </span>[2023] SGHC 253 (“<span class="font-italic">Re</span> <span class="font-italic">X</span><span class="font-italic"> Diamond</span>”) (at [15]), the use of the expression “would be likely” in s 91(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IRDA, to describe the prospect that a judicial management order might fulfil one or more of the purposes set out in s 89(1), connotes a “real prospect” test (see also the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Deutsch</span><span class="font-italic">e Bank AG and another v Asia Pulp &amp; Paper Co Ltd </span>[2003] 2 SLR(R) 320 (at [15]–[17])). This is a lower threshold than a balance of probabilities test, and the applicant need not establish that the purpose in question will more probably than not be achieved if a judicial management order is made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 First, I agree with the applicant that placing it under judicial management would be likely to achieve its survival, or the whole or part of its undertaking, as a going concern. In this regard, the Investment Group’s proposed investment will provide much needed working capital. This will enable the applicant to continue servicing and operating its existing projects. Also, the Investment Group has indicated its intention to continue the applicant’s business in the construction industry after acquisition and restructuring, which will benefit from the applicant’s Grade A1 construction licence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 While Buildforms does not object to the applicant being placed under judicial management, it raises, amongst others, the concern that the Term Sheet does not provide sufficient details. For example, the purchase price for the acquisition of the applicant’s shares has not been agreed.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-1e0d2f8d-4e46-49a1-89a4-7cdf1838d32f" data-toggle="modal" type="button">43</button></sup>

</div>
</div> Also, whereas the Investor Group’s acquisition of the applicant’s shares requires there to be “satisfactory completion” of “the agreement on the terms of a restructuring plan between [the applicant] and its creditors”, it is “confusing” that the Investor Group also agrees that it will “work together” with the applicant to “propose the … non-exhaustive restructuring terms to the trade creditors of the [a]pplicant” after the acquisition.

</div> I acknowledge Buildforms’s concerns. Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the gist of the Term Sheet is clear: the Investor Group intends to purchase the applicant’s entire share capital and provide $1m in working capital. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Second, I agree with the applicant that placing it under judicial management would be likely to achieve a compromise or an arrangement between it and its trade creditors pursuant to the relevant provisions in the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed) or the IRDA. In this regard, the intended restructuring plan envisages that the liabilities of the applicant’s trade creditors will be restructured through a compromise or arrangement. Based on an estimated trade debt of approximately $23,048,000, and a recovery of up to $3m, the estimated recovery rate of each trade creditor would be roughly about 13%.

</div>
</div> This compares favourably to a liquidation scenario, where it is likely that the trade creditors would experience a lower recovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Again, Buildforms points out that it is “disconcerting” that the applicant and the Investor Group appear resolute to distribute only up to $3m to the trade creditors, even though the total liabilities of the applicant appear to be about $67,449,000.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-95e13db1-2d7a-46ca-835a-4968aec23e20" data-toggle="modal" type="button">46</button></sup>

</div> This is but a small fraction of the total current debt. Again, while I acknowledge Buildforms’s concerns, I am satisfied that there is likely to be a compromise or an arrangement between the applicant and its trade creditors because the alternative of winding-up is likely to lead to a lower recovery rate. Indeed, Buildforms implicitly recognises this since it is willing to support the applicant being placed under judicial management to “see if more of the [a]pplicant’s contractual assets may be realised under judicial management”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Third, for the same reasons in relation to the likelihood of a compromise or an arrangement, I also agree with the applicant that placing it under judicial management would be likely to achieve a more advantageous realisation of its assets or property than if it were to be wound up. In this regard, the applicant’s assets are mainly in its existing contractual assets. Therefore, it is only by placing the applicant into judicial management that a judicial manager can continue operating its projects and realise these assets in collaboration with the Investor Group.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">There is support or at least no objection from a majority of the creditors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24  Next, I am satisfied that there is support, or at least no objection, from the majority of creditors, which is a factor in favour of placing the applicant under judicial management. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 As a starting point, the presence of creditor support is a factor to be considered by the court in granting a judicial management order (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Point72 Ventures Investments</span><span class="font-italic"> LLC v FinLync Pte Ltd (Klein, Peter Selig and another, non-parties) </span>[2023] SGHC 122 at [43]). This is because “a company whose debts far exceed its assets in effect belongs to its creditors”, and as a result, the “court must show great heed to the wishes and views of such creditors” (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re Genesis Technologies International (S) Pte Ltd </span>[1994] 2 SLR(R) 298 (at [8]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 However, as in the present case, if a company proposes to rehabilitate itself through capital injections, creditor support would be of lesser relevance. Be that as it may, the fact that there is at least no objection to placing the applicant under judicial management amounts to a factor in support of an order being granted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Accordingly, for all the reasons above, I am satisfied that the applicant should be placed under judicial management. However, the real controversy between the applicant and some of its creditors relates to the judicial manager to be appointed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Ms Tan or the Buildforms Nominees should be appointed as the judicial manager</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The court’s exercise of its power of appointment of a judicial manager is fact-sensitive (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Hodlnaut Pte Ltd </span>[2023] 4 SLR 862 (“<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Hodlnaut</span>”) at [10]). However, some factors that the court may consider when making the appointment include: (a) the choice of the largest creditor or group of creditors; (b) the independence or perceived independence of the nominees; and (c) the skill and expertise of the judicial managers (see<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Re Hodlnaut </span>at [8]–[12]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Against these factors, s 91(3) of the IRDA provides the specific procedure for the appointment of a judicial manager. The relevant portions of s 91(3) are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">91.</span>—(3)  In any application for a judicial management order under subsection (1), the following apply:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  the applicant must nominate a person who is a licensed insolvency practitioner, but is not the auditor of the company, to act as a judicial manager; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)  the Court may reject the nomination of the applicant and appoint another person in place of the applicant’s nominee;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)  where a nomination is made by the company — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i)  a majority in number and value of the creditors (including contingent or prospective creditors) may be heard in opposition to the nomination; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii)  the Court may, if satisfied as to the number and value of the creditors’ claims and as to the grounds of opposition, invite the creditors to nominate another person in place of the applicant’s nominee and, if the Court sees fit, adopt their nomination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The effect of s 91(3) is that the court retains the overall discretion to appoint the judicial manager. To begin with, s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides that an applicant for judicial management <span class="font-italic">must </span>nominate a qualified person to be the judicial manager. However, the court is not bound by the applicant’s nomination and, pursuant to s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), “may reject the nomination of the applicant and appoint another person in place of the applicant’s nominee”. In particular, where the nomination is made by the company concerned, s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) sets out that a majority of the creditors “in number and value” may be heard in opposition to the nomination and, if the stipulated circumstances are satisfied, they may be allowed to put forth their alternative nomination (see also <span class="font-italic">Re</span> <span class="font-italic">X</span><span class="font-italic"> Diamond </span>at [45]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the present application, Buildforms opposes the applicant’s nomination of Ms Tan as the judicial manager.

In this regard, s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)(i) provides that only “a majority in number and value of the creditors (including contingent or prospective creditors)” may be heard in opposition to an applicant’s nomination of a judicial manager. As such, in order to establish the requisite standing, Buildforms must establish that (a) it is a creditor, including being a contingent creditor or prospective creditor, <span class="font-italic">and </span>(b) it is part of the majority in number and value of such creditors.

In <span class="font-italic">Founder Group,</span> the court held (at [49]) that “a claimant who relies on a debt, the existence of which is subject to a substantive dispute, cannot be said to have established its standing as a creditor for the purposes of a winding-up application”. On the basis of <span class="font-italic">Founder Group</span>, Buildforms is not even a contingent creditor, let alone a creditor, as its claim against the applicant is premised on a liability that the applicant is contesting in legal proceedings in OC 370. Therefore, Buildforms does not have the standing to nominate alternative individuals as judicial manager.

</div> At the hearing, counsel for Buildforms, Mr Muhammad Imran bin Abdul Rahim (“Mr Imran”), clarified that Buildforms’s primary position is that it is a creditor of the applicant, and that its fallback position is that, even if it were not found to be a creditor of the applicant, it should still be considered a contingent creditor of the applicant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) My decision: Buildforms is a contingent creditor, but not a creditor, of the applicant</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(I) <span class="font-italic">Buildforms is a contingent creditor of the applicant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In my judgment, for the reasons that I will develop, I find that Buildforms is a contingent creditor of the applicant. Buildforms therefore has the standing to object to the applicant’s nominee for judicial manager. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 First, while the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Founder Group </span>was interpreting the expression “contingent creditor” in s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA, its reasoning is equally applicable to interpreting the same expression as it appears in the judicial management provisions. Indeed, s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) uses the same expression as in s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), “creditors (including contingent or prospective creditors)”, to describe the individuals or entities who can be heard in opposition to a company’s nomination of a judicial manager. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Second, the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Founder Group </span>leads me to conclude that the disputed liability between the applicant and Buildforms is really a contingent liability. To begin with, the Court in <span class="font-italic">Founder Group </span>had to consider whether Founder Group (Hong Kong) (in liquidation) (“FGHK”) had standing as a creditor under s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA to bring a winding-up application against Singapore JHC Co Pte Ltd (“JHC”). FGHK had argued that it had standing as a “contingent creditor” to do so, because JHC was obliged, under certain contracts, to make payment to FGHK. Furthermore, FGHK maintained that it still had standing even if JHC disputed the obligation. In this regard, JHC disputed the debt because the supposed payment obligations under the contracts were never meant to be enforced. Further, no deliveries had been made under them. Sundaresh Menon CJ, delivering the unanimous grounds of decision of the Court, held that FGHK was not a contingent creditor (although the Court later found that FGHK was, in fact, a creditor). Menon CJ explained (at [45]) that “a disputed liability may in principle be considered a contingent liability where the liability itself is not disputed and the only dispute is over whether the contingency that crystallises the liability has occurred”. This was said to be consistent with Kitto J’s observations in the High Court of Australia decision of <span class="font-italic">Community </span><span class="font-italic">Development Pty Ltd v Engwirda Construction Co </span>(1969) 120 CLR 455 (“<span class="font-italic">Community Development</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at 459) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… there must be an existing obligation and that out of that obligation a liability on the part of the company to pay a sum of money will arise in a future event, whether it be an event that must happen or only an event that may happen. A building contract creates, as soon as it is entered into, an obligation upon the building owner to pay the contract price, either as a whole upon a future event or, more usually, by progress and final payments each of which is to be made on a future event. The event or events may not happen, but if and when one of them does happen the building owner, by force of the contractual obligation, must pay the builder a sum of money. It is, I think, nothing to the point that the event may be complex, as where the payment is agreed to be made when the whole or some part of the work has been done to the satisfaction of an architect as expressed in a certificate or to the satisfaction of an arbitrator as expressed in an award: the building owner is bound from the time the contract is made to pay money to the builder upon a contingency; and that in my opinion makes the builder a contingent creditor of the owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Applied to the present case, I find that Buildforms is a contingent creditor of the applicant notwithstanding the parties’ dispute in OC 370. In OC 370, Buildforms claims the sum of $2,806,365.31 for works carried out under the so-called “MOE subcontracts and SEAB subcontract”. It is important that the applicant, in its Defence filed in OC 370, does not deny that it had entered into the “MOE subcontracts” with Buildforms, even if it denies having entered into the “SEAB subcontract” with Buildforms. Rather, the applicant’s defence in OC 370 is that Buildforms did not carry out works under the “MOE subcontracts”, save for certain general repairs and redecoration works. Therefore, the applicant claims for damages arising from Buildforms’s alleged breaches of the “MOE subcontracts”, which it pleads as a set-off against Buildforms’s claim. Thus put, the applicant does <span class="font-italic">not</span> actually dispute the existence of (at least) the “MOE subcontracts”. To adopt the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Community Development</span>, these contracts created an obligation upon the applicant to pay Buildforms contingent on a future event, which is Buildforms’s completion of the specified works. Thus, the applicant was bound, from the time the “MOE subcontracts” were made, to pay money to Buildforms upon a contingency. While the parties dispute whether the contingency has occurred so as to crystallise the liability (see <span class="font-italic">Founder Group </span>at [45]), the fact remains that Buildforms is a contingent creditor of the applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 For completeness, I do not find the citation of the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 268 (“<span class="font-italic">Metalform</span>”) by counsel for the applicant, Mr Sean Lee (“Mr Lee”), to be of much assistance to his case. Mr Lee suggested that <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>supports a broad proposition that where a debtor company’s cross-claim is larger than a creditor’s claim, the creditor is generally deprived of standing in the context of various insolvency and judicial management proceedings. I do not agree with Mr Lee’s reading of <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span>, the Court of Appeal was concerned with the question of when the court may restrain a creditor of an undisputed debt from presenting a winding-up petition against a debtor company, where that debtor company has an alleged cross-claim against that creditor (see <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [1] and [63]). Chan Sek Keong CJ held that the debtor company only has to show that there is a “likelihood” that the petition might fail, or that it is “unlikely” that a winding-up order would be made, for a creditor to be restrained from presenting its winding-up application (see <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [77] and [88]). The main policy consideration behind this approach is that “the commercial viability of a company should not be put in jeopardy by the premature presentation of a winding-up petition against it where it has a serious cross claim based on substantial grounds” (see <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [82]). Having regard to Chan CJ’s considerations, it is clear that the comments in <span class="font-italic">Metalform</span> were confined to the context of a winding-up application, and were not intended to apply more broadly across all manner of insolvency and judicial management proceedings, including the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Third, my finding that Buildforms is a contingent creditor of the applicant does not, contrary to the applicant’s concerns, determine OC 370 in any way. This is the whole point of differentiating a “contingency creditor” from a “creditor”. Thus, while the applicant’s liability to Buildforms is premised on the “MOE subcontracts” that the applicant does not deny entering into with Buildforms, whether that liability crystallises is contingent on Buildforms being able to make out its case in OC 370.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 For all these reasons, I conclude that Buildforms is at least a contingent creditor under s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA. For completeness, and because the point was argued by the parties in their written and oral submissions, I go on to consider whether Buildforms is a creditor under s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-6 text-left font-italic">(II) <span class="font-italic">Buildforms is not a creditor of the applicant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In short, I find that Buildforms is not a creditor of the applicant, for reasons I shall develop below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As a preliminary point, I take guidance from <span class="font-italic">Founder Group</span> in interpreting the meaning of the word “creditor” within s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA. This is because of the reason at [38] above, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the same expression is used in s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) as in s 124(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA. Again, for the reasons at [38] above, I find that the Court of Appeal’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">SAAG</span><span class="font-italic"> Oilfield Engineering (S) Pte Ltd (formerly known as Derrick Services Singapore Pte Ltd) v Shaik Abu Bakar bin Abdul Sukol and another and another appeal </span>[2012] 2 SLR 189, which adopted a broader meaning of “creditor” in the context of a scheme of arrangement in s 210 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), is less relevant to the present case as compared to the Court’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Founder Group</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I then turn to the law as set out in <span class="font-italic">Founder Group</span>. The starting position is that a creditor must be owed a debt that is presently due (see <span class="font-italic">Founder Group </span>at [50] and [69]; see also <span class="font-italic">Goode on Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law</span> (Kristin van Zweiten gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 5th Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Goode on Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law</span>”) at para 2−26). From this, it is relatively clear that the <span class="font-italic">legal test</span> for “creditor” status, distinguished from the concepts of “prospective” or “contingent” creditor within s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA, is that the alleged creditor must be owed a debt that is presently due. I find that this narrower definition of “creditor” is justified by the need to ensure that the expression “including any prospective or contingent creditors” in s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), and wherever else it occurs, is not rendered otiose. The outstanding question then becomes the <span class="font-italic">standard of proof</span> to which the existence of the debt must be established. Without belabouring the point, a standard of proof refers to the caution that must be exercised in making a positive finding of fact (see Ho Hock Lai, <span class="font-italic">A Philosophy of Evidence Law</span><span class="font-italic">: Justice in the Search for Truth </span>(Oxford University Press, 2008) at p 173). This is to be distinguished from the concept of a “legal test”, which broadly refers to a legal condition, or a set of legal conditions, that, if met, result in certain legal consequences.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 This question on the applicable standard of proof arises because Buildforms’s submissions appear to suggest that, for a creditor to have standing under s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA, the standard of proof to which it must establish its debt is only that of a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case”.

</div> Thus, if the debtor company successfully does so, the creditor would lose its standing under s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 To resolve this question on the applicable standard of proof, I take guidance from <span class="font-italic">Founder Group</span>, where the Court of Appeal<span class="font-italic"> </span>made clear that an insolvency court generally cannot determine the underlying dispute where the facts and liability are heavily contested (at [28(a)]). More broadly, in hearings where a court relies only on affidavit evidence, “there can be no finding of fact on the balance of probabilities, but only on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> basis” (see the Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">The “Bunga Melati</span><span class="font-italic"> 5” </span>[2012] 4 SLR 546 at [129]). I am therefore bound to find that the applicable standard to which Buildforms must establish its debt, is that of a “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard”. By this standard, a creditor will be deprived of its standing as a “creditor” to object to the appointment of a judicial manager under s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA if the debtor company manages to raise triable issues in relation to the alleged debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 As to the scope of issues that can be properly considered under “triable issues”, this is likely to be quite broad. Indeed, there is no reason why “triable issues” must relate solely to the <span class="font-italic">existence</span> of the debt in question. In my judgment, questions of potential set-off against the debt can properly fall within “triable issues”, given that set-off is a recognised defence against a creditor in a winding-up or judicial management context (see s 219 of the IRDA). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Applying these principles to the present facts, it is clear that Buildforms has proven that the applicant owes it a debt, at least on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> standard.

It therefore urges me to adopt a different interpretation of s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>). To begin with, Buildforms argues that s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) does not set out the group out of which the majority is to be derived, that is, whether the majority is to be determined with reference to (a) all of the applicant’s creditors, or (b) all of the applicant’s creditors who expressed their positions on the nominations made by the applicant and Buildforms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Due to the two apparently possible interpretations, Buildforms argues that I should adopt the latter for several reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Buildforms’s interpretation would be consistent with other judicial management provisions. For instance, s 94(11)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) makes clear that “a majority in number and value of the creditors of the company <span class="font-italic">present and voting</span>” [emphasis added] is required for the appointment of a judicial manager in the context of judicial management by resolution of creditors. Similarly, s 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) requires a “majority [of creditors] in number and value, <span class="font-italic">voting either in person or by proxy</span>” [emphasis added] to fill the vacancy where there is a vacancy in the appointment of a judicial manager.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, Buildforms’s interpretation would avoid conferring on a company an “unassailable advantage”. This advantage is that a company may claim a substantial number of creditors, which may not be accurate, and if those creditors then take no position on the company’s nomination for a judicial manager, the company can then claim that no majority of creditors oppose its nomination. Indeed, unlike the situations of a court-ordered winding-up and a scheme of arrangement, where there are checks in the form of court-appointed liquidators or appointed scheme managers to guard against abuse, a company who applies to place itself under judicial management can claim who its creditors are without having a third party do so or having a third party verify such a determination.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, Buildforms’s interpretation makes good commercial sense because in the context of entities with a substantial number of creditors, many of those creditors may not be interested, or cannot afford to be involved, in the restructuring or winding-up of the entity concerned. It would therefore skew matters in favour of the company’s nomination if the determination of a majority is made with reference to the body of creditors that includes these potentially disinterested creditors. Finally, it would not be realistic for a creditor, who is already owed moneys by the company, to spend even more money to canvass for its nominees by reaching out to as many creditors as it can.

</div>
</div>
</div> As such, Buildforms submits that I should hear the opposing creditors, including itself, and consider their nomination of the Buildforms Nominees. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Section 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA only allows a majority of all creditors to be heard in opposition</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Despite Buildforms’s interesting arguments, I do not agree with its interpretation of s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 First, the purpose of s 93(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) is to protect the company from <span class="font-italic">any</span> of its creditors’ wishes as to the appropriate judicial manager. As such, it is no surprise that the section makes it difficult for creditors to be heard in opposition to the company’s nomination. Indeed, the original version of s 227B(3) as proposed in the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 9/1986) had required that a proposed judicial manager be approved<span class="font-italic"> </span>by the majority of a company’s creditors: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Power of the Court to make a judicial management order and appoint a judicial manager</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">227B.</span>—(3)  In any application for a judicial management order under subsection (1), the applicant shall nominate a person who is an approved company auditor, who is not the auditor of the company, to act as the judicial manager. The Court may reject the person nominated by the applicant and appoint another person in his stead or it may invite the Minister to make a nomination, or the Minister may himself nominate a person to act as judicial manager, if he considers that the public interest so requires, and any such person appointed by the Court or nominated by the Minister need not be an approved company auditor. <span class="font-italic">In a case where the nomination is made by the company, the person nominated shall be approved by the majority of creditors.</span> In a case where the nomination is made by the Minister he may be heard in support of the nomination and for this purpose may be represented.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 However, as observed in a representation to the Select Committee, it could be unwieldy and costly if the company <span class="font-italic">always </span>had to seek the approval of majority of its creditors in nominating a judicial manager. That same representation suggested that the proposed s 227B(3) be amended to permit the company to nominate a judicial manager, while leaving the creditors the right to oppose this nomination and suggest another nominee (see <span class="font-italic">Report of the Select Committee on the Companies (Amendment) Bill</span> (Bill No 9/86) (Parl 5 of 1987, 12 March 1987 at pp A-113 to A-114). This suggestion was accepted (at B-38, Minutes of Evidence dated 5 November 1986 para 151). Eventually, as the High Court noted in <span class="font-italic">Re</span> <span class="font-italic">X</span><span class="font-italic"> Diamond </span>(at [43]), s 227B(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) was enacted via the Companies (Amendment) Act 1987 (Act 13 of 1987). This section remained unchanged in the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) until it was reproduced in its current form in s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA. With this legislative history in mind, it is therefore understandable why it <span class="font-italic">should be </span>difficult for the creditors to be heard in opposition. As such, the mere fact that Buildforms finds it difficult to be heard in opposition is not a sufficient reason to adopt its interpretation of s 93(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>); that difficulty is by design. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Second, although s 94(11)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) and s 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the IRDA determine a majority based on the creditors who are “present and voting”, that does not mean that a similar approach should be taken with respect to s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>). In the first place, the words “present and voting” (or similar) do not appear in s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) as they do in s 94(11)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) and (in a different form) in s 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). It is not right for me to read into s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) what Parliament has seen fit to omit therefrom but inserted in other provisions. Yet, this is what Buildforms’s interpretation would have me do. Moreover, that the determination of a majority is made with reference to creditors who are present and voting in s 94(11)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) and s 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) makes perfect sense in <span class="font-italic">those </span>contexts. This is because s 94(11)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) is concerned with the appointment of a judicial manager by resolution of creditors at a <span class="font-italic">creditors’ meeting </span>convened under s 94(7). It therefore makes sense that the majority is determined from those present at <span class="font-italic">that meeting</span>. As for s 98(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), it is concerned with the appointment of a judicial manager in the event of a vacancy by way <span class="font-italic">of a vote</span>. It therefore makes sense for the majority to be determined by reference to those voting in person or by proxy. In contrast, the right to be heard in opposition to a company’s nomination of a judicial manager under s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) is <span class="font-italic">not by a</span> <span class="font-italic">vote</span>. For completeness, I am unconvinced by Mr Imran’s attempt, at the hearing before me, to draw an analogy between participation in a creditors’ meeting and participation in or attendance at a court hearing to oppose the appointment of a judicial manager. After all, Mr Imran could not point me to, nor I could think of, any other provision in the IRDA or elsewhere where participation in court proceedings was treated as a vote at a meeting. Besides, accepting this proposition would run into the same difficulty as before: if the intention was for participation in the court proceedings under s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) to be treated akin to a “present and voting” requirement, Parliament could have easily included express words to that effect, or more simply, provided for a creditors’ meeting to achieve that effect. However, Parliament has not done so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Third, while I understand Buildforms’s argument that the applicant’s interpretation of s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) would confer an advantage on a company, I observe that Buildforms’s interpretation could easily create serious disadvantages for the company. This is because it is conceivable that a very large creditor, who may not amount to a majority in number or value, could nominate a judicial manager. If, as Buildforms suggests, the other creditors were uninterested to participate in the restructuring or winding-up proceedings, then the company concerned would have to engage with this creditor even if it were not in the majority. This would defeat the very reason behind s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>), which is to shield the company from such contrary nominations in most cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Finally, while I again understand Buildforms’s argument that it is difficult for a creditor, particularly where there are, as in the present case, a large number of creditors, to garner sufficient support for its nomination, the fact remains that such difficulty is by design. And if Buildforms is suggesting that a different approach should be undertaken with respect to cases involving a large number of creditors, I am not sure how that can be accommodated within the relevant provisions of the IRDA, which do not make a distinction between cases that involve large and small number of creditors. Indeed, it would be impossible for a court to draw a line in the sand, in the absence of legislative guidance within the IRDA, as to when such a proceeding could be considered to involve a “large” or “small” number of creditors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For all these reasons, I reject Buildforms’s proposed interpretation of s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>). In my view, the “majority” referred to in s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) must be determined by reference to all of the applicant’s creditors, as opposed to all of the applicant’s creditors who expressed their positions on the applicant’s nominations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) My decision: Buildforms does not have standing to be heard in opposition to the applicant’s nomination of Ms Tan</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 It follows from my conclusion as to the correct interpretation of s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the IRDA, in particular as to how the “majority” is to be determined, is that Buildforms does not have standing to be heard in opposition to the applicant’s nomination of Ms Tan as the judicial manager. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Ms Tan is suitable to be the judicial manager</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Technically, my conclusions so far mean that Buildforms’s nomination of the Buildforms Nominees is not before the court. This follows from Buildforms’s lack of standing to be heard in opposition and put forward its nomination. Although I now obviously know about the Buildforms Nominees, I do not think it is right for me to consider their suitability for appointment by way of s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the IRDA. As the court said in <span class="font-italic">Re</span> <span class="font-italic">X</span><span class="font-italic"> Diamond </span>(at [47]), it “could not have been the legislative intent for s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to act as a backup plan where s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) cannot be invoked”. Otherwise, a creditor who does not satisfy the Majority Requirement in s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) can always put forward a nomination even in the knowledge that it will fail under that section for lack of standing, but hope that the court will still consider its nomination via s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). That cannot be the case. It would render the requirements in s 91(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) otiose. There is therefore no need for me to <span class="font-italic">compare </span>Ms Tan against the Buildforms Nominees in deciding on Ms Tan’s suitability to be judicial manager.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 That said, I still need to be independently satisfied that Ms Tan is a suitable judicial manager. I am satisfied that Ms Tan is so by virtue of the reasons advanced by the applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 First, while Mr Imran raised concerns about Ms Tan’s seeming lack of experience as a judicial manager in the construction sector, I am satisfied by Ms Tan’s curriculum vitae that she is an experienced insolvency and restructuring practitioner with over 15 years in the industry. Indeed, Ms Tan’s record shows that she has worked with clients across a wide range of business sectors.

I do not agree with Buildforms’s allegation that the mere appointment of a judicial manager by an applicant results in the lack of independence, perceived, or real. Indeed, as the High Court pointed out in <span class="font-italic">Re</span><span class="font-italic"> X Diamond </span>(at [50]), this point, if accepted, would mean that “any company, which seeks judicial management because its fortunes have taken a turn for the worse due to internal mismanagement, cannot put forward its own nominee because that nominee may feel, or be perceived to feel, hindered in conducting thorough investigations”. It makes no difference in the present case that the two controllers of the applicant are also creditors who have nominated Ms Tan. Indeed, given that a judicial manager is an independent officer of the court, this is not a tenable position to take without serious evidence (see s 89(4) of the IRDA and the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re Halley’s Department</span><span class="font-italic">al Store Pte Ltd </span>[1996] 1 SLR(R) 81 at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Fourth, I accept that the support of the trade creditors bears greater weight than that of the non-trade creditors. This is because the intended restructuring plan is envisaged to deal only with the liabilities of the applicant’s trade creditors, with the liabilities of the non-trade creditors to be dealt with under the restructuring of BHL. Thus, the alleged lack of OCBC’s support, if any, which admittedly is the largest and only secured creditor, is not as weighty a factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Fifth, and relatedly, Buildforms’s case, that Ms Tan’s appointment is opposed by creditors holding a substantial proportion of the applicant’s debt,

</div> Without OCBC (to whom $14.524m is owed), the debt owed by the applicant to creditors who support the Buildforms Nominees is $5,729,203.01 or $6,577,030.85 (calculated by Buildforms).

</div> Furthermore, I note that a significant proportion of this debt is comprised of Buildforms’s own alleged debt of $2,828,136.31. On the other hand, the debt owed by the applicant to creditors who support Ms Tan’s nomination is allegedly $4,696,330.20 (as calculated by Buildforms).

</div> This means that, out of the debt owed to creditors who have expressed a view regarding the appointment of a judicial manager (only), about 54−58% is owed to companies opposing Ms Tan’s application as judicial manager. Indeed, if Buildforms’s debt is removed from the calculation, since this debt is being disputed on substantial grounds, this percentage drops to around 38−44%.
