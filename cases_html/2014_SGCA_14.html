<p class="Judg-Author">
        Sundaresh Menon CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against parts of the decision
                    of the learned Judicial Commissioner (“the Judge”) in Summons No
                    3435 of 2012 (“SUM 3435/2012”). The first appellant, a company
                    incorporated in Germany, went into liquidation. It had certain assets in
                    Singapore though the Judge found that it did not carry on business here. The
                    central issue was whether its Singapore assets were to be remitted to the
                    liquidators in Germany or whether they should be held to satisfy the claims of
                    creditors in Singapore. The answer to this depended in large part on whether
                        s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) applies to a foreign company that is in
                    liquidation, even where it is not registered under s 368 of the Act and has not
                    established a place of business or carried on business here. Section
                        377(3)(<em>c</em>) establishes a scheme for any local
                    assets to be applied first to satisfy debts and liabilities incurred in
                    Singapore before any residual amount is remitted to the foreign liquidator. The
                    Judge held that s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) applied to the
                    first appellant and ordered that the company’s assets be applied towards
                    the payment of a judgment debt incurred in Singapore. The Judge’s decision
                    is reported as <em>Beluga Chartering GmbH (in liquidation) v
                        Beluga Projects (Singapore) Pte Ltd (in liquidation) and another (Deugro
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd, non-party)</em> [2013] 2 SLR 1035 (“the
                    GD”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing the parties and the <em>amicus curiae</em> Professor Yeo Tiong Min <em>SC</em> (“Prof Yeo”), we allowed the appeal and held
                    that s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) did not apply to a foreign
                    company such as the first appellant, which was not registered under the Act and
                    did not carry on business or have a place of business here. We ordered that its
                    assets in Singapore be remitted to its liquidators in Germany. We now give the
                    reasons for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The facts are comprehensively set out in the GD,
                    and we summarise only the material background facts to the extent they help in
                    providing the context for the legal issues discussed in these
                grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The first appellant, Beluga Chartering GmbH (in
                    liquidation) (“Beluga Chartering”), is a company incorporated
                    under the laws of Germany. It was the ship chartering arm of the Beluga group of
                    companies (“the Beluga Group”). Mr Chee Yoh Chuang and Mr
                    Abuthahir Abdul Gafoor, who are the Singapore liquidators of Beluga Chartering,
                    are the second and third appellants (see further at [12] below). We refer to
                    them in these grounds as “the Singapore
                Liquidators”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The respondents, Beluga Projects (Singapore) Pte
                    Ltd (“Beluga Singapore”) and Beluga Chartering Asia Pte Ltd
                    (“Beluga Asia”) (hereafter referred to collectively as “the
                    Singapore Subsidiaries”), are companies incorporated in Singapore and are
                    wholly owned subsidiaries of Beluga Chartering.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Beluga Singapore acted as Beluga
                    Chartering’s exclusive mercantile agent for Southeast Asia and Western
                    Australia. Beluga Asia acted as Beluga Chartering’s exclusive shipping
                    agent. Beluga Chartering financed the setting up and operations of the Singapore
                    Subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The non-party, deugro (Singapore) Pte Ltd
                    (“deugro Singapore”), is a company incorporated in Singapore.
                    deugro Singapore owed Beluga Chartering $1,587,294.31 (“the deugro
                    Debt”). Part of this sum was for work done by the Singapore Subsidiaries
                    on behalf of Beluga Chartering. The deugro Debt is Beluga Chartering’s
                    only asset in Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Beluga
                    Chartering in turn owed deugro Singapore €502,600 (“the deugro
                    Liability”). This debt arose out of a contractual obligation owed by
                    Beluga Chartering to deugro Danmark A/S (“deugro Denmark”) to
                    perform five voyages from Vietnam to Scotland pursuant to a booking note dated 5
                    January 2011. Beluga Chartering was unable to perform four of the five voyages
                    as a result of which deugro Denmark claimed to have suffered damages amounting
                    to €502,600. Upon Beluga Chartering informing deugro Denmark that it was unable
                    to fulfil its remaining obligations due to pending insolvency proceedings,
                    deugro Denmark invoiced Beluga Chartering for this amount and subsequently
                    assigned this debt to deugro Singapore.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The winding up proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 16 March 2011, the Insolvency Court of the
                    Bremen District Court placed Beluga Chartering into liquidation. Mr Edgar Grönda
                    (“the German Liquidator”) was subsequently appointed as Beluga
                    Chartering’s permanent insolvency administrator.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 31 March 2011, the Singapore Subsidiaries
                    filed a writ of summons in Suit No 227 of 2011 seeking a sum of $1,415,631.21
                    for agency work performed for Beluga Chartering. Judgment in default was entered
                    against Beluga Chartering on 20 April 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Singapore Subsidiaries obtained an
                    injunction against Beluga Chartering on 1 April 2011 prohibiting Beluga
                    Chartering from dealing with or disposing of its assets in Singapore up to the
                    value of $1,415,631.21. The injunction was still in effect when we heard this
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 2 September 2011, a winding up order was
                    made against Beluga Asia and the Official Receiver was appointed as the
                        liquidator.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> On 13 January 2012, a winding up order
                    was made against Beluga Singapore. Mr Sim Guan Seng and Mr Goh Yeow Kiang Victor
                    (“Mr Goh”) of Baker Tilly TFW LLP were appointed as the
                        liquidators.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 17 January 2012, Beluga Shipping GmbH &amp;
                    Co KG Ms “Beluga Persuasion”, a German creditor of Beluga
                    Chartering, filed Companies Winding Up No 5 of 2012 (“CWU 5/2012”)
                    in the Singapore High Court for a winding up order against Beluga Chartering on
                    the grounds that Beluga Chartering was unable to pay its debts and that it was
                    just and equitable for Beluga Chartering to be wound up as the Singapore
                    Subsidiaries would otherwise be paid in preference to the other creditors of the
                    company. On 17 February 2012, the High Court made an order winding up Beluga
                    Chartering and appointed the Singapore Liquidators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     deugro Singapore agreed to pay the Singapore
                    Liquidators the sum of US$849,647.42 in full settlement of deugro
                    Singapore’s liability to Beluga Chartering (“the deugro
                    Asset”). It then took the position that the settlement put an end to
                    issues of set-off and mutuality of the deugro Debt and the deugro
                    Liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The summons for determination of questions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Singapore Liquidators subsequently filed

                    following questions of law (“the Questions”):</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The application was filed to ascertain whether
                    the Singapore Liquidators were entitled to remit the deugro Asset to the seat of
                    the principal liquidation in Germany, to be dealt with in accordance with German
                    insolvency law. The Singapore Subsidiaries opposed the application. Mr Goh (who
                    appeared in person) attended on behalf of Beluga Asia and the Official Receiver
                    represented Beluga Singapore. Mr Goh aligned himself fully with the Official
                    Receiver’s submissions both below and before us on appeal and we do not
                    differentiate between the respondents in these grounds. deugro Singapore took no
                    position on the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Judge first considered whether s
                        377(3)(<em>c</em>) applied to Beluga Chartering.
                    Section 377(3)(<em>c</em>) imposes obligations on a
                    Singapore liquidator to realise and recover assets in Singapore and pay any
                    debts and satisfy any liabilities incurred here by the foreign company before
                    remitting the net recovery to the foreign liquidator. This framework, which
                    preserves assets in Singapore for the purpose of meeting claims here, was
                    referred to as “the ring-fencing provision”. The Judge concluded
                    (at [103] of the GD) that s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) did
                    apply to Beluga Chartering and his reasoning is more fully discussed
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As s 377(3)(<em>c</em>)
                    was found to apply to Beluga Chartering, the Singapore Liquidators would have to
                    apply its assets in Singapore first to meet liabilities here unless the court
                    had a common law power to disapply that statutory provision (at [175] of the
                    GD). The Judge discussed the English case law on the scope of the common law
                    ancillary liquidation doctrine and concluded that under that doctrine he did
                    have a discretion to disapply aspects of the statutory insolvency regime and, in
                    effect, to order the remission of assets to the liquidator in the home
                    jurisdiction of the company notwithstanding s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) (at [219] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Judge then analysed the facts in some
                    detail to decide how he should exercise his discretion. He held that Beluga
                    Chartering was not carrying on business in Singapore (at [307] of the GD) but
                    observed that it “came as close as a foreign company [could] to doing so
                    without actually doing so” (at [314] of the GD). Although the Judge
                    accepted that the usual course in the case of a foreign company which did not
                    carry on business in Singapore would be to exercise the discretion by
                    disapplying the ring-fencing provision (at [313] of the GD), he found that the
                    Singapore Subsidiaries would suffer real prejudice and declined to do so (at
                    [322]–[323] of GD). The effect of the Judge’s decision was that the
                    Singapore Liquidators were obliged to pay the judgment debt owed to the
                    Singapore Subsidiaries before remitting any remaining proceeds to the German
                    Liquidator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The contentions of the parties centred
                    primarily on a single issue of statutory interpretation: whether
                        s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) applied to a foreign company
                    that was not registered under s 368 of the Act and which neither had a
                    place of business nor carried on business in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     If s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) applied, the issue that followed would be whether the courts
                    had a discretion to disapply the ring-fencing provision; if s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) did not apply, the court would then have to consider
                    whether there was any common law discretion to ring-fence the assets for the
                    satisfaction of debts incurred locally before ordering the remittal of the
                    assets to the liquidators conducting the principal winding up. We overturned the
                    Judge’s decision because we were satisfied that s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) did not apply to Beluga Chartering. We therefore
                    determined only the latter question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The first issue: Did s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) apply
                to Beluga Chartering?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was the application of s 377(3)(c) excluded by
                s 350(2)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Beluga Chartering was wound up in Singapore
                    under s 351(1). This provision is found in Division 5 of Part X of the Act.
                    Section 350(2) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Section 350(2) has two limbs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     the first limb makes it clear that
                        the provisions of Division 5 of Part X of the Act are in addition to
                        provisions contained elsewhere that concern the winding up of companies;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     the second
                        limb imports all those powers that are available to the court or a
                        liquidator when winding up a company into the scheme that governs the
                        winding up of an unregistered company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Questions required the Judge to consider
                    whether s 377(3)(<em>c</em>), which is found in
                    Division 2 of Part XI, could apply to the winding up of an unregistered company
                    under Division 5 of Part X. In this regard, the respondents relied on both limbs
                    of s 350(2) to contend that a liquidator may exercise any power or do any
                    act that may arise from provisions found in other parts of the Act or even in
                    other laws.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Judge held that the word
                    “companies”, which is found twice in conjunction with the words
                    “winding up” in s 350(2), must be read generically to mean
                    any corporate “legal person” in both instances and is not confined
                    to “a company incorporated pursuant to the [Act]” as provided in
                    the general definition in s 4(1) of the Act (at [107] of the GD). The Judge
                    traced the legislative history of s 350(2) and observed that s 350(2)
                    was originally derived from s 404 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1948
                    (c 38) (UK) (“the UK 1948 Act”), which provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>404</b>.    The provisions of
                            this Part of this Act with respect to unregistered companies shall be in
                            addition to and not in restriction of any provisions hereinbefore in
                            this Act contained with respect to winding up companies by the court,
                            and the court or liquidator may exercise any powers or do any act in the
                            case of unregistered companies which might be exercised or done by it or
                            him in winding up companies formed and registered under this Act
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The second limb of this provision referred to
                    powers that “might be exercised or done by [the Court] or [liquidator] in
                    winding up companies <em>formed and registered under this
                        Act</em>” [emphasis added]. On the other hand, the reference to
                    provisions “with respect to the winding up of <em>companies</em>” in the first limb did not expressly limit the
                    meaning of companies to companies incorporated under the UK 1948 Act. The Judge
                    therefore thought that the word “companies” in the first limb
                    should be construed generically to mean corporate “legal persons”
                    (at [109]–[110] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Section 404 was later adopted as the model for
                    s 314(2) of the Companies Act 1961 (No 6839 of 1961) (Vic) of the State of
                    Victoria (“the Victorian 1961 Act”). At that time, the reference
                    to “companies <em>formed and registered under this
                        Act</em>” under the second limb was replaced with the
                    unqualified word “companies” (at [111] of the GD). The Judge
                    concluded that it must have been intended that the meaning of the second use of
                    the word “companies” in s 314(2) should be assimilated with
                    the first use of that word, and the word “companies” should
                    therefore be taken as a consistent generic reference to corporate “legal
                    persons” (at [112]–[113] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Section 350(2) of the Act is identical to
                    s 314(2) of the Victorian 1961 Act, and the Judge concluded that Parliament
                    had intended s 350(2) to have the same scope as s 314(2) of the
                    Victorian 1961 Act (at [114] of the GD). Accordingly, when
                        s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) – a power applicable to
                    the winding up of a corporate legal person – was read together with s
                    350(2), s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) could apply to a winding up
                    instituted under Division 5 of Part X. The Judge further held that on any
                    interpretation of the word “companies”, s 350(2) would not prevent
                    provisions which fell outside its scope from applying to a liquidation under
                    Division 5 of Part X. The first limb of s 350(2) was phrased in the
                    negative and in effect provided that any provision that was found outside
                    Division 5 and related to the winding up of companies could apply to the winding
                    up of an unregistered company. At the same time, it did not positively exclude
                    the application of any other provision that might independently apply (at
                    [116]–[117] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The High Court had previously reached a
                    different conclusion on the meaning of the word “companies” in
                    s 350(2) in <em>RBG Resources plc (in liquidation) v Credit
                        Lyonnais</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 240 (“<em>RBG
                        Resources</em>”). Woo Bih Li J disagreed with the submission
                    that the word “companies” in the first limb should refer to all
                    companies, whether or not incorporated in Singapore. He held (at [34]) that both
                    uses of the word “companies” should be given the same meaning,
                    namely, locally incorporated companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In our judgment, the word
                    “companies” in s 350(2) should be read in accordance with the
                    definition of “company” in s 4(1), that is, “a company
                    incorporated pursuant to [the Act]”. We prefer the interpretation that
                    was applied by Woo J in <em>RBG Resources</em> to that
                    which the Judge applied in the proceedings below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The first limb of s 404 of the UK 1948 Act
                    (see above at [24]) provided that the provisions in the Division did not
                    restrict the application of “any provisions hereinbefore in this Act
                    contained with respect to winding up companies by the court”. The
                    preceding provisions in the UK 1948 Act in Part V with respect to winding up
                    concerned only companies that were registered in England or Scotland. We
                    therefore doubt that the use of the word “companies” in the first
                    limb of s 404 was originally intended to refer more generally to corporate
                    “legal persons” rather than to “companies formed and
                    registered under the [UK 1948 Act]”. The essential purpose of the second
                    limb of the provision was simply to confer on the court or liquidator of an
                    unregistered company any powers that could have been exercised in the winding up
                    of a company incorporated under the UK 1948 Act. There is nothing to suggest
                    from this that when the second limb was amended to make reference only to
                    “companies” in s 314(2) of the Victorian 1961 Act and
                    s 350(2) of the Act, a broader meaning must have been
                intended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     If s 350(2) were read strictly, it may be
                    argued that as the provisions of Division 2 of Part XI concern foreign companies
                    that are not incorporated under the Act, s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) could not be imported pursuant to the second limb of s 350(2)
                    so as to apply to the winding up of unregistered companies under Division 5 of
                    Part X. But as the first limb of s 350(2) does not positively exclude the
                    operation of provisions that might otherwise apply, we turn to consider the
                    position as to whether s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) could
                    apply on any independent basis to the winding up of Beluga
                Chartering.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Does s 377(3)(c) apply to a company that does not have a place of
                business or carry on business in Singapore?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Section 377(3) is found in Division 2 of Part
                    XI of the Act and states as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Division 2 of Part XI is titled
                        “<em>Division 2 — Foreign
                    companies</em>” and the first provision immediately following the
                    heading is s 365, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Foreign companies to which
                            this Division applies</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>365</b>.    This Division
                            applies to a foreign company which, before it establishes a place of
                            business or commences to carry on business in Singapore, complies with
                            section 368 and is registered under this Division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Section 368, which is referred to in
                    s 365, imposes an <em>obligation</em> on a foreign
                    company to register “<em>before</em> it establishes
                    a place of business or commences to carry on business in Singapore”
                    [emphasis added]. The term “foreign company” is generally defined
                    in s 4(1) of the Act as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    a company,
                            corporation, society, association or other body incorporated outside
                            Singapore; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)    an unincorporated
                            society, association or other body which under the law of its place of
                            origin may sue or be sued, or hold property in the name of the secretary
                            or other officer of the body or association duly appointed for that
                            purpose and which does not have its head office or principal place of
                            business in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In these grounds, we use the term “foreign company”
                    generally to refer to any company that satisfies the definition under s 4(1) and
                    “non-registrable foreign company” to refer to a company that is
                    not under the obligation to comply with s 368.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Judge’s reasoning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Judge reasoned that the wording of
                    s 377(3), which enjoins a liquidator of a foreign company to do certain
                    acts or imposes limits on the exercise of his powers, is broad enough to apply
                    to any foreign company whether or not it was registered under s 368 (at
                    [119] of the GD). This was incompatible with s 365 being interpreted as
                    setting a condition precedent for the application of the provisions in Division
                    5, including s 377 (at [121] of the GD). The Judge accordingly undertook a
                    meticulous analysis of the legislative history of s 365 and concluded that
                    the section no longer operated as a condition precedent to the application of
                    Division 2 of Part XI of the Act:</p>

                        of the Act, s 329 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1967 Rev Ed) (“the
                        1967 Act”), was in substance identical to s 344 of the Victorian 1961
                        Act, which was the first provision of Division 3 of Part XI of the Victorian
                        1961 Act concerning foreign companies which had a place of business or which
                        carried on business within the state. Section 329 stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading2">
<b>Foreign companies to which
                                this Division applies</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>329</b>.    This Division
                                applies to a foreign company only if it has a place of business or
                                is carrying on business in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>The word
                            “<em>only</em>” in s 329 made it
                        clear that the section established a condition precedent to the application
                        of all the provisions of Division 2 of Part XI of the 1967 Act. The
                        provisions in that Division therefore applied <em>only</em> to foreign companies that satisfied the requirements of
                        s 329 (at [134] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     In 1984, s 332 of the 1967 Act, which imposed a
                        requirement for a foreign company to register <em>within one
                            month after</em> establishing a place of business or commencing to
                        carry on business in Singapore, was amended by the Companies (Amendment) Act
                        1984 (Act 15 of 1984). Section 332 after the amendment obliged a foreign
                        company to register <em>before</em> it established a
                        place of business or commenced carrying on business in Singapore (at [136]
                        of the GD). However, s 329 was not amended and continued to operate as
                        a condition precedent to the application of the provisions of Division 2.
                        But the obligation to register before commencing business was contained in
                        s 332, which was placed in a Division that would only apply to a
                        company under s 329 if it had established a place of business or
                        commenced carrying on business here. This created a logical difficulty that
                        prevented s 332 from operating as intended (at [137] of the
                    GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     In 1986, the
                        Companies (Amendment) Bill (No 9 of 1986) (“the 1986 Bill”)
                        was introduced to amend s 329, which had by then been renumbered as
                        s 365. Section 332 was also renumbered as s 368. Clause 62 of the
                        1986 Bill, as originally drafted, amended s 365 to read as
                        follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading2">
<b>Foreign companies to which
                                this Division applies</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">
<b>365</b>.    This Division
                                applies to a foreign company which intends to have a place of
                                business or to carry on business in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>The
                        reformulated s 365 omitted the word “only” and because of
                        this omission, the Judge thought it was no longer intended to operate as a
                        condition precedent (at [138]–[140] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_d"></a>(d)     After the second reading of the 1986
                        Bill, it was referred to a Select Committee, which rephrased the language of
                        s 365 to its present form. This was explained by the then Minister for
                        Finance, Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (“Dr Hu”) (see the <em>Report of the Select Committee on the Companies (Amendment)
                            Bill (Bill No 9/86)</em> (Parl 5 of 1987, 12 March 1987)
                        (“the Select Committee Report”) in the following terms at p
                        D 69:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The purpose of this amendment is to better reflect the intention of
                            the section by incorporating in it the concepts that appear in section
                            368 of the Act. There is at present a logical inconsistency between the
                            existing section 365 and section 368 in that the latter section applies
                            to a foreign company before it establishes a place of business or
                            commences to carry on business here while existing section 365 states
                            that the Division applies only if a foreign company has a place of
                            business or is carrying on business in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>The amended
                        1986 Bill was passed by the Companies (Amendment) Act 1987 (Act 13 of 1987)
                        (“the 1987 Amendment Act”). Section 365, as reworded, was
                        meant to address the logical inconsistency between ss 365 and 368. But,
                        in addition, the Judge thought that its effect was that s 365 would no
                        longer operate as a condition precedent (at [143] of the
                    GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_e"></a>(e)     Because of the
                        omission of the word “only”, s 365 no longer prescribed
                        that Division 2 of Part XI shall apply to the class of foreign companies
                        specified and to no others; it merely described one of the classes of
                        foreign companies to which Division 2 applies (at [145] of the GD). This
                        interpretation was consistent with the drafting convention of the Act, which
                        imposed condition precedents by using the word “only” (at
                        [146] of the GD). The Judge thought that it could not have been the
                        legislative intent to create “circularity, loopholes and
                        underinclusiveness” by creating another inapt condition precedent (at
                        [147] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The relationship between s 365 and s 377</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     We were unable to agree with the Judge’s
                    analysis and his conclusion. The Judge placed considerable emphasis on the
                    deletion of the word “only” in s 365 by the 1987 Amendment
                    Act. In our judgment, that deletion was a slender and ultimately inadequate
                    thread from which to hang the Judge’s conclusion that s 365 was
                    thereafter no longer intended to operate as a condition precedent for the
                    application of the provisions in Division 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Prior to the amendments made in 1987, s 365
                    unequivocally stated that Division 2 of Part XI applied <em>only</em> to a defined category of foreign companies – foreign
                    companies that had a place of business or were carrying on business in
                    Singapore. This much was recognised by the Judge (see [35(a)]
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     When s 365 was reworded by the 1986 Bill
                    and subsequently further revised by the Select Committee, not the faintest
                    indication was given to suggest that the amendment had been driven by anything
                    other than the very specific objective of resolving the logical anomaly caused
                    by the change in the required sequence of registration under s 332 in 1984.
                    The Explanatory Statement to cl 62 of the 1986 Bill stated that the
                    amendment to s 365 “<em>clarifies</em> the
                    operation of Division 2 of Part XI” [emphasis added], with no mention at
                    all of any legislative intent to significantly expand its reach and operation.
                    Similarly, it is clear from Dr Hu’s statements in the Select Committee
                    Report that the only reason for the change was to ensure that s 365 would
                    be read consistently with s 368. In keeping with this, the words
                    “before it establishes a place of business or commences to carry on
                    business in Singapore” in s 365 were lifted directly from
                    s 368(1), and s 365 further makes reference to compliance with
                    s 368 and registration under Division 2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As Dr Hu explained, the limited purpose of
                    amending s 365 was simply to incorporate the concepts found in s 368
                    into the former section by tying both provisions together. There was therefore
                    no legislative material to support the Judge’s interpretation that the
                    word “only” in s 365 was deliberately deleted in order to
                    alter the character of that section as a condition precedent such that Division
                    2 would thereafter apply to any foreign company, including one that was
                    incorporated outside Singapore and had no presence or place of business here.
                    The Judge’s interpretation of s 365 effected a substantial expansion
                    of the ambit of Division 2. We considered it implausible that Parliament would
                    have effected such an important change through a side wind without any
                    discussion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     We sympathise with the Judge in respect of the
                    difficulties he faced in construing s 365 in accordance with its literal
                    terms. On the one hand, as the Judge noted, s 365 is titled “Foreign
                    companies <em>to which this Division applies</em>”
                    [emphasis added]. It also contains the words “which, before it
                    establishes a place of business or commences to carry on business in Singapore,
                    complies with section 368 and is registered under this Division”. These
                    words identify the characteristics of the foreign companies to which Division 2
                    applies and by inference, exclude other classes of foreign
                companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On the other hand, as the Judge quite
                    correctly pointed out (at [122]–[124] of the GD), an interpretation that s
                    365 operates as a condition precedent for the application of the rest of the
                    provisions in Division 2 would create an apparent circularity and defeat the
                    legislative purpose of the whole of Division 2. This is because the obligation
                    to register under s 368 is itself found in Division 2 and would <em>prima facie</em> apply only to foreign companies that already
                    meet the requirements of the condition precedent in s 365. The condition
                    precedent in s 365, on the other hand, is triggered only after the foreign
                    company has complied with s 368 and is registered under Division 2. This
                    seems to give rise to the untenable situation that a foreign company is under no
                    obligation to comply with s 368 until it has complied with the requirement
                    to register under s 368.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The matter of the relationship between ss 365
                    and 368 had arisen in <em>RBG Resources</em>. That case
                    concerned the liquidation of a company incorporated in England, RBG Resources
                    plc (“RBG”). A winding up order was made both in England and in
                    Singapore, and a creditor sought an order for RBG’s debts in Singapore to
                    be paid from the company’s Singapore assets before the assets were paid to
                    the English liquidation estate for distribution. It was common ground that RBG
                    was not registered under Division 2 of Part XI, and the creditor conceded that
                    for this reason s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) did not apply to RBG
                    (at [25]). Although the relationship between ss 365 and 368 was not the
                    subject of detailed argument, Woo J observed (at [31]) that the obligation under
                    s 368 was to lodge documents for registration prior to establishing a place
                    of business or commencing business here. Woo J thought that a company that
                    failed to do so would be committing a continuing offence under the Act. However,
                    he also thought (at [31]) that if a foreign company was not registered under the
                    Act at the time it went into liquidation, then by virtue of s 365, none of
                    the provisions in Division 2 of Part XI of the Act, including
                        s 377(3)(<em>c</em>), would apply to
                it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Judge recognised that apart from the
                    analytical circularity between ss 365 and 368, the interpretation placed on
                    s 365 in <em>RBG Resources</em> also created an
                    unanticipated practical loophole in s 365. If a company that ought to have
                    registered but did not register could escape the application of the provisions
                    of Division 2, it would mean that the very companies that were intended to fall
                    under the scope of s 368 could evade their obligations by deliberately
                    refraining from registering (at [124] of the GD). Section 365 therefore would
                    appear to be underinclusive, and this would severely undermine
                    Parliament’s purpose in regulating companies that have some degree of
                    connection with Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Much as this might seem reasonable, we did not
                    consider that the court could deal with the potential underinclusiveness of the
                    section by resorting to the opposite extreme and concluding that Parliament must
                    therefore have intended an overinclusive scope instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We turn to the Judge’s observation that
                    in as much as Parliament amended s 365 precisely for the purpose of solving
                    the problem created by an inapt condition precedent, it could not then have
                    intended to replace this by yet another inapt condition precedent (at [147] of
                    the GD). Our difficulty with this was that it presumed Parliament was aware that
                    the reworded s 365 could be read to give rise to yet another difficulty of
                    a similar kind as that which it had set out to cure. But there was no basis for
                    this presumption. If this was indeed the case, as Prof Yeo observed, it would
                    seem counterintuitive for the Select Committee to have made the conscious effort
                    to specify a condition in s 365 that was referable to the requirement of
                    registration in s 368. The same result could instead have been achieved by
                    simply providing in clear and unmistakable terms that Division 2 of Part XI
                    applied to all foreign companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Additionally, we were concerned that the wide
                    interpretation that the Judge placed on s 365 would give rise to problems of
                    extraterritoriality. Indeed, this would have represented a significant policy
                    shift that Parliament must have been aware of had it intended to extend the
                    scope of Division 2 of Part XI. The Judge was of the view that
                    “[i]nsolvency law [held] the key to addressing this over
                    inclusiveness” (at [149] of the GD). He observed that the court had the
                    discretion to decide whether a winding up order should be issued against a
                    foreign company and the discretion to disapply substantive aspects of
                    Singapore’s insolvency law in appropriate circumstances (at
                    [150]–[151] of the GD). However, there are other problems that arise from
                    the Judge’s interpretation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The phrase “foreign company” in
                    any provision under Division 2 could conceivably extend to every foreign
                    company, whether or not it had any connection to Singapore. Apart from the
                    obligation to register that is contained in s 368, and which expressly
                    applies only to a foreign company before it establishes a place of business or
                    commences to carry on business in Singapore, all foreign companies would be
                    subject to a host of other regulatory obligations under Division 2
                    including:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     the obligation to have a registered
                        office in Singapore to which all communications and notices may be addressed
                        (s 370);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     the obligation to lodge particulars with the Registrar of any changes or
                        alterations in the constitutional documents or details of the company
                        (s 372);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     the obligation to lodge with the Registrar balance sheets after conducting
                        annual general meetings (s 373); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_d"></a>(d)     being potentially subject to penalties for
                        failure to comply with any provision in Division 2
                    (s 386).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Taking the Judge’s reasoning to its
                    logical conclusion, the implications of interpreting s 365 as a descriptive
                    provision would go well beyond insolvency law. There is no rule of insolvency
                    law that could be invoked to curtail this overreaching extraterritorial effect.
                    This is untenable. Further, there is a general statutory presumption against
                    extraterritoriality and there was nothing to displace this presumption here.
                    Having regard to all these considerations, we were unable to concur with the
                    Judge that Parliament must have intended that Division 2 of Part XI would apply
                    to all foreign companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Although the drafting of s 365 is
                    infelicitous, Parliament’s intention may be given effect through a
                    construction that accords with the purpose of the amendment of the section in
                    1987. On this reading, s 365 would operate to apply the provisions of
                    Division 2 of Part XI to all foreign companies that have complied or <em>are liable to comply</em> with the registration requirements
                    under s 368.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Section 365 extends the application of
                    Division 2 to a foreign company “which, before it establishes a place of
                    business or commences to carry on business in Singapore, <em>complies</em> with s 368 <em>and is
                        registered</em> under [Division 2]” [emphasis added]. The first
                    logical difficulty that we have alluded to above (see [41]) would be avoided if
                    s 368 were read as applying independently of the condition precedent laid
                    down in s 365. In other words, a company would be obliged to comply with
                    s 368 if it comes within its terms without any requirement that s 365
                    must first have been satisfied. This is consistent with the principle of
                    statutory interpretation that an absurd interpretation or one that leads to
                    unworkable consequences that are patently contrary to Parliament’s intent
                    should be avoided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     But s 365 also incorporates a number of
                    otiose references which came about as a result of the efforts of the Select
                    Committee to closely tie the language of the section to s 368, including the
                    reference to a foreign company “before it establishes a place of business
                    or commences to carry on business in Singapore” and the disjunctive
                    obligations to comply with s 368 <em>and</em> register
                    under Division 2. Parliament’s intention, as evidenced by the original
                    version of s 365 as well as the proposed rewording of that section in the
                    1986 Bill prior to the amendments by the Select Committee (see above at
                    [35(c)]–[35(d)]), was that the provisions in Division 2 should apply to
                    companies which <em>intended</em> to establish a place of
                    business or carry on business in Singapore and would have been liable to
                    register under s 368 of the Act. The interpretation that would be most
                    consistent with Parliament’s purpose would be to read the references in s
                    365 to prior compliance with s 368 and registration under the Division as
                    including a continuing obligation to comply with and register under s 368
                    as long as a company comes within the terms of s 368. This means that a foreign
                    company falls within the scope of s 365 if is subject to s 368 but has not
                    complied with the registration requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In summary, s 365 would operate as a
                    condition precedent for the application of all provisions in Division 2 of Part
                    XI save for s 368. It would be triggered when a foreign company:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     has actually been registered under s
                        368(1); or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     comes under the liability to register under s 368(1) because it
                        intends to establish a place of business or commence carrying on business in
                        Singapore, this being a liability that continues even after it actually does
                        commence business or establishes a place of business here without being
                        registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Did s 377(3)(c) apply to Beluga Chartering?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     On our interpretation of s 365 above,
                        s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) would apply to Beluga
                    Chartering only if it was under the obligation to register under s 368. The
                    Judge made an unequivocal factual finding (at [307] of the GD) that Beluga
                    Chartering never carried on business in Singapore under the definition in s 366
                    of the Act or on any broader meaning of the term and was not obliged to register
                    under s 368. The respondents did not appeal against this finding of fact.
                    Counsel for the second respondent, Ms Beverly Wee (“Ms Wee”),
                    conceded that the respondents had not appealed against the Judge’s finding
                    in this regard, but submitted that the activities of Beluga Chartering warranted
                    a finding that Beluga Chartering was carrying on business in Singapore through a
                    wholly owned subsidiary or proxy and had come as close as a foreign company
                    could do so without actually doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     While we accepted that a foreign company may
                    be carrying on business through an agent or subsidiaries within the definition
                    in s 366 of the Act as a matter of fact or law, it was not open to us at this
                    juncture to make a finding contrary to the Judge’s holding that Beluga
                    Chartering was not doing business in Singapore. The Judge had carefully
                    considered the corporate structure of the Beluga Group’s operations in
                    Singapore in deciding that Beluga Chartering, the parent company, did not carry
                    on business in Singapore (at [308]–[312] of the GD); on the facts before
                    us, we saw no reason to come to a different conclusion. We therefore concluded
                    that Beluga Chartering was not carrying on business in Singapore and was not
                    obliged to register under s 368. Section 377(3)(<em>c</em>)
                    therefore did not apply to the Singapore Liquidators of Beluga
                    Chartering.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second issue: Should the Singapore assets of Beluga Chartering
                nonetheless be ring-fenced to satisfy its local liabilities?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It followed from our decision on the first
                    issue that the winding up of Beluga Chartering, an unregistered foreign company,
                    was governed primarily by the provisions in Division 5 of Part X and the
                    Singapore Liquidators were not subject to the obligations under s
                        377(3)(<em>c</em>). There is no express statutory
                    provision dealing with the relationship between a Singapore liquidator and a
                    foreign liquidator, and Beluga Chartering’s application to remit the
                    Singapore assets to Germany therefore had to be decided on the basis of the
                    common law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Does the common law ancillary liquidation doctrine apply in
                Singapore?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The common law ancillary liquidation doctrine
                    was described in these terms by Vaughan Williams J in <em>In re
                        English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank</em> [1893] 3 Ch 385
                        (“<em>English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered
                        Bank</em>”) at 394:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… one must bear in mind the principles upon which liquidations are
                        conducted, in different countries and in different Courts, of one concern.
                        One knows that where there is a liquidation of one concern the general
                        principle is - ascertain what is the domicil of the company in liquidation;
                        let the Court of the country of domicil act as the principal Court to govern
                        the liquidation; and let the other Courts act as ancillary, as far as they
                        can, to the principal liquidation. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The doctrine does not mandate any single
                    course of action and could encompass a broad range of orders that would assist
                    the principal liquidation: see Lloyd Tamlyn, “Ancillary Winding
                    Up” in <em>Cross Border Insolvency</em> (Richard
                    Sheldon QC gen ed) (Bloomsbury Professional, 3rd Ed, 2012) (“<em>Cross Border Insolvency</em>”) ch 7 at para
                    7.16.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     We agreed with the Judge (see [41] of the GD)
                    that the ancillary liquidation doctrine is a part of the Singapore common law
                    and that the court has a power under this doctrine to order the local liquidator
                    to remit assets that are gathered in locally to the principal place of
                    liquidation. Indeed, this holding was not disputed by the parties on appeal. We
                    were satisfied that the ancillary liquidation doctrine is historically
                    entrenched as part of the common law in a number of jurisdictions: see <em>In re Commercial Bank of South Australia</em> (1886) 33 Ch D
                    174 at 178; <em>English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered
                        Bank</em> at 394; <em>Re Alfred Shaw &amp; Co Ltd ex
                        parte Mackenzie</em> (1897) 8 QLJ 93 at 96; <em>Re
                        National Benefit Assurance Co</em> [1927] 3 DLR 289. The existence of
                    this common law doctrine was also endorsed by Sir Richard Scott V-C in <em>In re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No
                        10)</em> [1997] 1 Ch 213 (“<em>Re
                        BCCI</em>”) and more recently by both the majority and minority
                    of the House of Lords in <em>In re HIH Casualty and General
                        Insurance Ltd</em> [2008] 1 WLR 852 (“<em>Re HIH
                        Insurance</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     This doctrine was recognised as part of the
                    law of Singapore by Murison CJ in the early Straits Settlements case of
                        <em>Re Lee Wah Bank Ltd</em> [1926] MC 5. The case
                    involved the question of whether the court should direct that sums owed to a
                    bank incorporated in Hong Kong be transferred to the liquidators in Saigon or
                    liquidators in Hong Kong. Murison CJ cited the general principle laid down by
                    Vaughan Williams J in <em>English, Scottish, and Australian
                        Chartered Bank</em> which we have referred to above (at [56]) and held
                    that as the domicile of the bank was Hong Kong, the funds should be paid to the
                    Hong Kong liquidator. Similarly, in <em>RBG Resources</em>,
                    Woo J accepted that the common law ancillary liquidation doctrine applied in
                    Singapore, and directed that the Singapore liquidators were at liberty to
                    transmit the Singapore assets of RBG to the English liquidators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     There is thus ample authority for the
                    proposition that the common law ancillary liquidation doctrine continues to
                    exist alongside the statutory insolvency regime where no other statutory
                    provision has been made. This was described by Scott V-C in <em>Re BCCI</em> (at 246C–D) as a proposition that rested on an
                    “accretion of judicial decisions”, and we saw nothing in the Act
                    to exclude the operation of the doctrine to a non-registrable foreign
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Does the court have the discretion to ring-fence local assets for
                locally incurred debts notwithstanding the ancillary liquidation doctrine?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The obligation of a Singapore liquidator of a
                    foreign company (to which s 365 applies) under Division 2 of Part XI to
                    “ring-fence” assets to pay off debts and satisfy liabilities
                    incurred in Singapore is a purely statutory obligation under
                        s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) and has no immediate common
                    law counterpart. Ms Wee submitted that if we held that s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) did not apply, the respondents’ fall-back
                    position was that the court had a discretion to refuse to remit the assets of a
                    non-registrable foreign company until its local creditors had been paid. The
                    question for us was whether such a discretion could exist as part of the common
                    law ancillary liquidation doctrine notwithstanding the statutory
                regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As Ms Wee’s submission raised the
                    relationship between the common law and the statutory framework, we were invited
                    to consider the contours of the ancillary liquidation doctrine and how the
                    courts saw this issue in that context. This was examined by Scott V-C in
                        <em>Re BCCI</em>. An application was made by the
                    English liquidators of an insolvent bank incorporated in Luxembourg seeking
                    directions as to whether certain provisions should be made for English creditors
                    before transmitting the proceeds of realisation in England to the Luxembourg
                    liquidators. The set-off rules recognised by the Luxembourg insolvency regime
                    would have produced a very different practical effect from the application of
                    the set-off rule under r 4.90 of the English Insolvency Rules 1986 (SI No 1925
                    of 1986) (UK), which permitted a self-executing offset between debts owed by and
                    debts owed to the insolvent bank such that only the net balance would be
                    provable in the liquidation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Scott V-C accepted that the power to direct
                    liquidators to transmit funds to the principal liquidators under the ancillary
                    liquidation doctrine was well-established as part of the common law (at
                    247F–G). He also held that the court had no inherent power to disapply the
                    provisions of an applicable statutory insolvency scheme (at 239F). After a
                    detailed survey of the relevant line of authorities, Scott V-C set out a number
                    of propositions of law (at 246C–F) which bear reproducing as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This line of authority establishes, in my opinion, at least the following
                        propositions. (1) Where a foreign company is in liquidation in its country
                        of incorporation, a winding up order made in England will normally be
                        regarded as giving rise to a winding up ancillary to that being conducted in
                        the country of incorporation. (2) The winding up in England will be
                        ancillary in the sense that it will not be within the power of the English
                        liquidators to get in and realise all the assets of the company worldwide.
                        They will necessarily have to concentrate on getting in and realising the
                        English assets. (3) Since in order to achieve a pari passu distribution
                        between all the company's creditors it will be necessary for there to be a
                        pooling of the company's assets worldwide and for a dividend to be declared
                        out of the assets comprised in that pool, the winding up in England will be
                        ancillary in the sense, also, that it will be the liquidators in the
                        principal liquidation who will be best placed to declare the dividend and to
                        distribute the assets in the pool accordingly. (4) <em>None
                            the less, the ancillary character of an English winding up does not
                            relieve an English court of the obligation to apply English law,
                            including English insolvency law, to the resolution of any issue arising
                            in the winding up which is brought before the court</em>. It may
                        be, of course, that English conflicts of law rules will lead to the
                        application of some foreign law principle in order to resolve a particular
                        issue.</p>

                        <em>RBG Resources</em> (at [38]–[39]).
                    Propositions (1) to (3) are generally uncontroversial, but proposition (4)
                    appears to have been clearly set out as a statement of the law for the first
                    time in <em>Re BCCI</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Scott V-C concluded that r 4.90 was a
                    substantive rule of English law and that the cases had not established the power
                    of a court to disapply a substantive rule forming part of the English statutory
                    insolvency scheme (at 247G–H). Even if the court had the power to disapply
                    rule 4.90, Scott V-C would have declined to exercise his discretion to do so (at
                    249D–E).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     More recently, the doctrine was considered by
                    the House of Lords in <em>Re HIH Insurance</em>, though no
                    clear consensus emerged as to its conceptual basis or content. <em>Re HIH Insurance</em> concerned the liquidation of a group of
                    Australian insurance companies with assets situated in England. These assets
                    mainly comprised reinsurance claims on policies taken out in the London market.
                    A winding up order was made by a New South Wales court in 2001 and provisional
                    liquidators were also appointed in England to realise the English assets. In
                    2005, an Australian judge sent a letter of request to the English High Court
                    pursuant to s 426(4) of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK) (“UK
                    Insolvency Act 1986”) – which applies only to a country designated
                    by the Secretary of State as a “relevant country” (which included
                    Australia) – asking that the provisional liquidators be directed to remit
                    the realised assets to the Australian liquidators for distribution. Sections

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Under Australian insolvency law, the assets of
                    an insurance company in liquidation would have to be applied first to the
                    discharge of debts payable in Australia, and the proceeds of reinsurance
                    policies had to be applied to discharge insurance liabilities. This differed
                    from the position under English insolvency law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The House of Lords unanimously ordered that
                    the English assets should be remitted to Australia. However, the two leading
                    speeches, delivered by Lord Hoffmann and Lord Scott of Foscote respectively, set
                    out two different conceptual approaches to the common law
                doctrine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Lord Hoffmann observed that the judicial
                    practice of treating an English winding up of a foreign company as ancillary to
                    the winding up by the court of its domicile was based on the principle of
                    modified universalism (at [7]–[8]). The power to remit assets to the
                    principal liquidator was established long before the UK Insolvency Act 1986 (at
                    [27]) and was exercised whenever there was a foreign jurisdiction more
                    appropriate than England to deal with all outstanding questions in the winding
                    up; s 426 was not involved in the application before the court (at [28]). This
                    judicial practice of ordering remittal was inconsistent with the broad
                    proposition that creditors could not be deprived of their statutory rights under
                    the English insolvency scheme and it followed that the court may, under the
                    ancillary liquidation doctrine, “disapply” parts of the English
                    statutory scheme by authorising the foreign liquidator to perform certain
                    actions under foreign law, which may or may not be the same as English law (at
                    [19]). Any differences in the English and foreign schemes of distribution
                    therefore went only to discretion (at [24]). Lord Hoffmann concluded that it
                    would not offend any principle of justice or public policy for the assets to be
                    remitted to Australia under the common law power (at [31] and [34]). Lord Walker
                    of Gestingthorpe agreed with Lord Hoffmann.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Lord Scott held that the exercise of the
                    s 426 power to direct the remission of assets to Australia did not entail
                    the disapplication of the English statutory insolvency scheme as s 426 was
                    itself part of the English statutory scheme (at [59]). Lord Scott thought that
                    the English courts had a statutory obligation to apply the English statutory
                    scheme and had “no inherent jurisdiction to deprive creditors proving in
                    an English liquidation of their statutory rights under that scheme” (at
                    [59]). The English court was not relieved of its obligation to apply English law
                    to the resolution of any issue arising in the winding up (at [60]), and under
                    the common law, a remittal would be refused if there was a class of preferential
                    creditors under the principal winding up who would not have priority under
                    English law (at [62]). However, Lord Scott was willing to accede to the request
                    made by the Australian courts by virtue of the court’s power under
                    s 426, which permitted remittal even in the above circumstances (at
                    [62]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury thought that the
                    existence of an inherent common law jurisdiction to remit English assets to
                    foreign liquidators in jurisdictions that were not designated as relevant
                    countries would “sit uneasily with the provisions of section 426(4) and
                    (5)” as it would almost thwart the statutory purpose of having designated
                    countries under s 426 (at [76]). However, in a subsequent extrajudicial
                    speech, Lord Neuberger expressed the tentative view that there was
                    “considerable attraction in the Hoffmann-Walker view” (see Lord
                    Neuberger, “The international dimension of insolvency” (2010) 23
                    Insolvency Intelligence 42 at 44).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers allowed the
                    appeal on the basis that the court had the jurisdiction under ss 426(4) and
                    426(5) to accede to the request of the Australian court (at [37]). He expressly
                    declined to take a position on the issue of whether the court would have had a
                    discretion under the common law to order remittal of assets in the circumstances
                    of the appeal (at [44]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In summary, Lord Hoffmann thought that courts
                    did have a discretion under the common law premised on the principle of modified
                    universalism to order assets collected locally in the ancillary liquidation to
                    be remitted to the liquidators of the principal liquidation regardless of any
                    statutory provision and that s 426 <em>extended</em>
                    this. Lord Scott, on the other hand, thought that the courts, in exercising
                    their power under the common law ancillary liquidation, had no discretion to
                    disapply the English statutory insolvency regime or deprive creditors of any of
                    their statutory rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The parties did not refer us to any
                    Commonwealth case that has directly applied Lord Hoffmann’s approach to
                    the common law ancillary liquidation doctrine. Prof Yeo and counsel for Beluga
                    Chartering, Mr Sim Kwan Kiat (“Mr Sim”), both submitted that Lord
                    Scott’s approach restated the existing common law, while Lord
                    Hoffmann’s approach represented an incremental development of the law. In
                    keeping with this, in the decision of the English High Court in <em>In re Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane SpA</em> [2011] 1 WLR
                    2049, Newey J observed (at [54]) that in the light of the division of opinion in
                    the House of Lords, <em>Re HIH Insurance</em> could not be
                    taken as authority for the proposition that the common law power extended to
                    permit the court to direct remittal of assets to a foreign liquidator where the
                    assets would be distributed other than in accordance with English
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The aspirational principle of modified
                    universalism as articulated by Lord Hoffmann has featured in a number of cases
                    on different aspects of cross-border insolvency (see the Privy Council decision
                    in <em>Cambridge Gas Transportation Corpn v Official Committee of
                        Unsecured Creditors of Navigator Holdings plc and others</em> [2007] 1
                    AC 508 (“<em>Cambridge Gas</em>”); the Court
                    of Appeal decision in <em>Rubin and another v Eurofinance SA and
                        others</em> [2011] 1 Ch 133 (reversed by the Supreme Court in
                        <em>Rubin and another v Eurofinance SA and others (Picard and
                        others intervening)</em> [2013] 1 AC 236) as well as in academic
                    commentary (see Gabriel Moss QC, ““Modified universalism”
                    and the quest for the golden thread” (2008) 21 Insolvency Intelligence
                    145; Philip Smart, “Cross-border insolvency cooperation” (2008)
                    124 LQR 554; Wee Meng Seng, “A lost opportunity towards modified
                    universalism” (2009) 1 LMCLQ 18). This principle, as recognised by Lord
                    Hoffmann in <em>Re HIH Insurance</em> (at [7]), is
                    nevertheless not a legal rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The Judge’s decision was premised on an
                    acceptance of Lord Hoffmann’s approach to the common law ancillary
                    liquidation doctrine. Our holding that the ring-fencing provision found in s
                        377(3)(<em>c</em>) is inapplicable to Beluga Chartering
                    however, renders moot the issue of whether Lord Hoffmann’s or Lord
                    Scott’s approach represents what the common law <em>is</em>, or indeed, what the common law <em>ought</em> to be. In the absence of clear authority, we prefer to
                    reserve our opinion on this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     What is clear is that the traditional common
                    law position gives the court a general power to order the remittal of realised
                    assets to the principal place of liquidation. But it does not have the power to
                    authorise the local liquidator to ignore the statutory insolvency scheme so as
                    “to deprive creditors proving in a [local] liquidation of their statutory
                    rights under that scheme” (<em>per</em> Lord Scott
                    in <em>Re HIH Insurance</em> at [59]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     It was common ground that the Singapore
                    Subsidiaries were unsecured creditors and did not enjoy any other priority under
                    the Act. Their only claim to a statutory priority for the judgment debt was the
                    ring-fencing provision in s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) which
                    we have held did not avail them. No evidence was put before us that a general
                        <em>pari passu</em> distribution would not be ordered
                    in the German liquidation or that a different result would ensue under the
                    German insolvency regime. Applying Lord Scott’s traditional approach to
                    the scope of the power of remittal, it followed that we had the power to hold
                    that the Singapore Liquidators were at liberty to remit the Singapore assets to
                    the German Liquidator for distribution. There was no question of
                    “disapplying” any statutory insolvency provision or depriving the
                    Singapore Subsidiaries of any vested rights under the Act or other written
                    law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As a matter of interest and to provide a
                    comparison, on Lord Hoffmann’s approach, remittal of assets to a foreign
                    liquidator would be permitted even if the distribution in the foreign
                    liquidation differs from that mandated by Singapore’s statutory insolvency
                    scheme, as long as it is not contrary to principles of justice or local public
                    policy. The mere fact that the foreign insolvency scheme differs from the local
                    insolvency scheme would not suffice to constitute injustice. In a case such as
                    the present where there was no indication that the scheme of distribution would
                    differ and the only known creditors (namely, the Singapore Subsidiaries) were
                    not preferential creditors and had no priority under the local statutory scheme,
                    there would have been no basis for not remitting the local assets. Hence,
                    regardless of which approach was taken, it was clear to us that the ancillary
                    liquidation doctrine would result in remittal being ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     We return here to Ms Wee’s submission
                    that the court should exercise a discretion that was said to exist under the
                    common law – one that paralleled the ring-fencing provision in
                        s 377(3)(<em>c</em>) – to direct that assets
                    would be remitted to the principal place of liquidation only after making
                    provision for locally incurred debts and liabilities. We could see no basis for
                    this. There is certainly nothing in the development of the common law ancillary
                    liquidation doctrine to warrant a view being taken that a statutory scheme on
                    priority can be applied by analogy under the common law doctrine to situations
                    that were not contemplated by Parliament. We were therefore unable to accede to
                    the proposition that the court had a discretion under the common law that
                    extended to a <em>positive</em> power to ring-fence assets
                    even when there was no statutory basis for doing so. It has never been thought
                    that the court has the power to confer on a creditor a priority that it does not
                    otherwise have under the statutory regime, and Ms Wee could not point us to any
                    common law rule to this effect. All the cases have been concerned with the
                    converse proposition – whether a statutory provision may be disapplied to
                    achieve a universal scheme of distribution. Moreover, any impetus as presently
                    exists is towards universalism rather than to favour local creditors or to
                    confer a preference on locally incurred debts. As Scott V-C observed in
                        <em>Re BCCI</em> (at 242C–D), “[i]t is
                    basic to an English winding up that English creditors cannot be ring-fenced and
                    treated more favourably than foreign creditors”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     We were also urged to consider that the
                    statutory framework on international insolvency in Singapore has failed to keep
                    pace with commercial and business realities. However, insolvency law involves a
                    multitude of social and economic considerations and compromises. Moreover, this
                    is an area that is presently being actively reviewed. The Insolvency Law Review
                    Committee (“the Law Review Committee”) recently concluded its
                    review of Singapore’s bankruptcy and corporate insolvency regimes and
                    submitted a report dated 4 October 2013 (“the Insolvency Review
                    Report”). Chapter 11 sets out the Law Review Committee’s summary of
                    the present law on cross-border insolvency, and notes that there is uncertainty
                    over the common law doctrine of “modified universalism” and that
                    there are few express legislative provisions for matters arising in cross-border
                    insolvency: see p 230 of the Insolvency Review Report. The Law Review Committee
                    has recommended the adoption of provisions of the UNCITRAL Model Law on
                    Cross-Border Insolvency (30 May 1997) (“the Model Law”), which
                    will set out a comprehensive framework for international cooperation in
                    insolvency matters and provide clarity and certainty: see pp 234-235 of the
                    Insolvency Review Report. We note in passing that the provisions of the Model
                    Law would have furnished a clear framework for the resolution of the issue that
                    arose in the present appeal: see p 233 of the Insolvency Review Report; Arts 21
                    and 22 of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     In the circumstances, we declined to accept Ms
                    Wee’s suggestion that we could as a matter of the common law, impose a
                    ring-fencing provision analogous to s 377(3)(<em>c</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     We therefore held that we ought to exercise
                    our power to direct the Singapore Liquidators to remit the realised assets of
                    Beluga Chartering in Singapore to the German Liquidator, without first
                    satisfying the judgment debt owed to the Singapore Subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">An issue on the side: What is the effect of foreign insolvency
                proceedings on claims before the Singapore court?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Our decision on the foregoing issues was
                    sufficient for us to dispose of this appeal. However, it may be helpful for us
                    to make a few observations on an issue that arose in the course of the
                    arguments, namely the position of a foreign liquidator where local liquidation
                    proceedings are not initiated. This did not arise on the facts of this appeal
                    because a winding up order was made in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     If an insolvent foreign company –
                    whether registered or unregistered – is not concurrently wound up in
                    Singapore, the application of the ancillary liquidation doctrine does not arise,
                    and any issues that arise before the Singapore courts would instead involve
                    questions of recognition. There are broadly two types of recognition that the
                    Singapore courts may be requested to grant: (i) recognition of the title of the
                    foreign liquidator and (ii) recognition of the foreign
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Recognition of the title of the foreign liquidator</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The law of the place of incorporation of a
                    company governs an agent’s authority to act on behalf of the company, and
                    if a liquidator is properly appointed under that law, his authority and title to
                    act on behalf of a company should be recognised: see Rule 179 of <em>Dicey, Morris and Collins on The Conflict of Laws vol 2</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at para 30-102; Ian Fletcher, <em>The Law of Insolvency</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed,
                    2009) at paras 30-057 to 30-058; <em>Cambridge Gas</em> at
                    [20]; <em>Bank of Ethiopia v National Bank of Egypt and
                        Liguori</em> [1937] 1 Ch 513.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Unlike personal bankruptcy proceedings, a
                    winding up order does not automatically vest the assets of the company in the
                    liquidator; instead, the legal title to assets remains with the company (albeit
                    impressed with a statutory trust), but the power of the board of directors to
                    deal with the company’s assets is displaced in favour of the liquidator.
                    Accordingly, a liquidator of a foreign company will be recognised as the
                    representative of the company for the purposes of getting in and realising the
                    company’s worldwide assets and there would generally be no basis for a
                    Singapore court to decline to recognise the liquidator’s claim to assets
                    belonging to the company under general principles of property law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     This general principle has been applied by the
                    High Court. In <em>Re Cosimo Borrelli and another</em>
                    Originating Summons No 762 of 2010 (unreported), the High Court granted a
                    declaration that a provisional liquidator of a company incorporated in the
                    Cayman Islands was authorised and empowered to recover and take possession of
                    the company’s movable and immovable assets. Further, in <em>Re Aero Inventory (UK) Limited (in administration)</em> Originating
                    Summons No 127 of 2011 (unreported), the High Court ordered that the
                    administrators of an English company would have power over the company’s
                    property and assets in Singapore as they had under English law pursuant to an
                    administration order made by the English High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Recognition of foreign winding up proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     We turn next to the recognition of the foreign
                    proceedings or of the effect the initiation of such proceedings would have. We
                    limit our discussion in this context to the question of whether a stay of
                    execution that is consequential on a foreign winding up order would extend to
                    assets located in Singapore such that creditors here would not be entitled to
                    execute against or attach these assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     A statutory moratorium on the commencement or
                    continuation of legal proceedings and process triggered by a winding up order
                    does not generally have extraterritorial effect: see <em>In re
                        Oriental Inland Steam Co; Ex p Scinde Railway Co</em> (1873-74) LR 9
                    Ch App 557 at 558-560 <em>per</em> James and Mellish LJJ;
                        <em>In re Vocalion (Foreign), Limited</em> [1932] 2 Ch
                    196 at 201-202. This is premised on the fundamentally territorial nature of
                    jurisdiction. It follows that under the common law rules of recognition, a court
                    would not recognise the jurisdiction of a foreign legislature or court to impose
                    a stay on any proceedings in the forum court and so would not be bound by any
                    such stay: see <em>Banque Indosuez SA v Ferromet Resources
                        Inc</em> [1993] BCLC 112 at 117-118.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     What then would be the position of creditors
                    bringing execution proceedings in the local courts in the absence of winding up
                    proceedings being taken here? We were not referred to any English authority
                    directly on point, although the issue has arisen tangentially in a number of
                    cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In <em>Firswood Ltd v Petra
                        Bank</em> [1996] CLC 608, the assignee of a creditor of an insolvent
                    Jordanian bank attempted to obtain a judgment against the bank in England, and
                    to bypass the liquidator in the process. The issue before the court was whether
                    the creditor could obtain leave to serve the writ out of jurisdiction. The
                    English Court of Appeal declined leave and observed (at 618) that the assignee
                    had no higher claim to priority than the creditor and the creditor would, by
                    contracting with a Jordanian company, have expected that Jordanian law would
                    apply to govern priorities in the event of the company’s insolvency. The
                    court therefore held (at 618) that it would not permit parallel proceedings in
                    England when the only purpose was for the assignee to obtain an English judgment
                    and to “deprive the liquidator of assets for distribution to the general
                    body of creditors”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     In <em>Felixstowe Dock &amp;
                        Railway Co v United States Lines Inc</em> [1989] QB 360, a company
                    incorporated in the United States was placed under Chapter 11 proceedings
                    pursuant to the United States Federal Bankruptcy Code and a restraining order
                    was made to enjoin the commencement or continuation of judicial proceedings
                    against the company or the issuance of legal process. English and European
                    creditors of the company obtained <em>Mareva</em>
                    injunctions in England prohibiting the removal of the company’s assets
                    from the jurisdiction, and the company filed summonses to set aside the
                    injunctions. Hirst J was not convinced that the fair and equitable treatment of
                    the general body of creditors would be frustrated if the assets in England were
                    not released for the benefit of the Chapter 11 proceedings (at 386A–B).
                    Instead, the applicant creditors would suffer substantial prejudice as they
                    would not derive any benefit if the funds were remitted to the United States and
                    used to keep the company as a going concern (at 387A–D). However, Hirst J
                    imposed a condition that the funds could not be released until after the expiry
                    of a reasonable period of notice to the company, which would then be free to
                    apply to the court for a winding up order (at 386B–D). It was therefore
                    evident that Hirst J did not think that the creditors should be wholly free to
                    execute their judgment against the company’s assets in England at the
                    expense of the remaining body of creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The two cases in the preceding paragraphs may
                    be compared with <em>In Re Suidair International Airways Ld
                        (application of Vickers-Armstrong, Ld)</em> [1951] 1 Ch 165. A
                    provisional winding up order was issued against the debtor company in South
                    Africa. Six days later, a judgment creditor – who had knowledge of the
                    winding up order – took out garnishee proceedings against the
                    company’s bank account in England and two writs of <em>fieri facias</em> for the seizure of the company’s goods. A
                    final winding-up order was made in South Africa and subsequently also in
                    England. The creditors applied for an order that they were entitled to retain
                    the benefit of the two writs against the English liquidator. Wynn-Parry J held
                    that although the execution would have been void under South Africa law as it
                    had been put in force after the presentation of the winding up petition, the
                    English court could only administer the assets of the company within its
                    jurisdiction under English law (at 173). Wynn-Parry J decided to exercise his
                    discretion under s 325(1)(c) of the UK 1948 Act to allow the creditor to
                    retain the benefit of its execution against the liquidator in the light of the
                    company’s conduct in impeding the creditor from obtaining the fruits of
                    its judgment (at 172). Although the result in this case suggests that a creditor
                    may enforce a judgment debt against a company notwithstanding pending foreign
                    insolvency proceedings, it should be noted that this was a case that arose in
                    the context of the creditor’s rights in an ancillary winding up in
                    England. It was therefore not a situation where the English court was being
                    asked to consider only the effect of a foreign winding up order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The courts in Hong Kong have considered the
                    question of when proceedings should be stayed because of a foreign insolvency
                    order. In <em>Modern Terminals (Berth 5) Ltd v States Steamship
                        Company</em> [1979] HKLR 512, a company incorporated in Nevada that
                    had been placed under Chapter 11 proceedings sought a stay of proceedings
                    against it in the Hong Kong courts. Trainor J entered judgment in favour of
                    the creditor on the grounds that Hong Kong was the proper forum to adjudicate
                    the claim, but decided (at 523) that a stay of execution ought to be ordered on
                    the basis of the nature of Chapter 11 proceedings and the principle of universal
                    distribution of a bankrupt’s effects in <em>Galbraith v
                        Grimshaw and another</em> [1910] AC 508.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     A similar approach was adopted in <em>CCIC Finance Ltd v Guangdong International Trust &amp; Investment
                        Corporation</em> [2005] 2 HKC 589, where a judgment creditor made an
                    application for a garnishee order <em>nisi</em> to be made
                    absolute, and the insolvent company applied for a stay of all proceedings. The
                    company was incorporated in the People’s Republic of China. A Chinese
                    court declared the company bankrupt and a Liquidation Committee was appointed.
                    Deputy Judge Gill accepted the principle of universalism (at [56]–[57])
                    and concluded that the making absolute of the garnishee order would interfere
                    with the liquidation of the company (at [85]). He therefore exercised a
                    discretion to refuse the application for a garnishee order absolute as it would
                    have offended the <em>pari passu</em> principle by allowing
                    the creditor to obtain an unfair preference over similarly ranked creditors (at
                    [96]) and granted the company’s application for a stay of all proceedings
                    (at [102]). Both decisions were followed by Reyes J in <em>Hong
                        Kong Institute of Education v Aoki Corporation</em> [2004] 2 HKLRD
                    760, where the court entered judgment against the defendant company but stayed
                    execution as the company was undergoing a civil rehabilitation under the law of
                    incorporation of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Stays of proceedings or execution have also
                    been ordered in other jurisdictions when there is a pending foreign winding up
                    order: see <em>Turners &amp; Growers Exporters Ltd v The ship
                        "Cornelis Verolme"</em> [1997] 2 NZLR 110 (New Zealand); <em>Cunard Steamship Company Limited v Salen Reefer Services</em>
                    AB 773 F 2d 452 (2th Cir, 1985) (United States).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     While the issue remains open for further
                    consideration on a subsequent occasion, we offer these provisional observations.
                    Singapore courts are clearly not bound by any stay of legal proceedings that
                    flows from a foreign winding up order in the absence of local winding up
                    proceedings. Nonetheless, it remains open to the courts to assist the foreign
                    liquidation proceedings by exercising their inherent discretion to stay
                    proceedings: see Roy Goode, <em>Principles of Corporate
                        Insolvency Law</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2011) at para 16-62;
                    Philip Wood, <em>Principles of International
                        Insolvency</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2007) at paras 28-044 to
                    28-045; <em>Cross Border Insolvency</em> ch 10 at paras
                    10.27 and 10.54-10.56; see also the instructive discussion in P St J Smart,
                    “International insolvency: ancillary winding up and the foreign
                    corporation” (1990) 3 ICLQ 827 at pp 845-846.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Most courts recognise the desirability and
                    practicality of a universal collection and distribution of assets and that a
                    creditor should not be able to gain an unfair priority by an attachment or
                    execution on assets located within the jurisdiction of the court subsequent to a
                    winding up order made elsewhere. However, this can only operate as a very broad
                    statement of principle. Whether and how the Singapore court will render
                    assistance to foreign winding up proceedings through the regulation of its own
                    proceedings will depend on the particular circumstances before it. Assistance
                    might, for example, take the form of a stay of a claim if Singapore is not the
                        <em>forum conveniens</em>; or staying an execution or
                    attachment; or exercising a discretion against granting a garnishee order
                    absolute; or refusing leave to serve process out of the jurisdiction; or winding
                    up the company in Singapore. We would observe however that the commencement of
                    legal proceedings against a defendant foreign company or an attempt to levy
                    execution against its assets is not precluded by the mere fact that insolvency
                    proceedings have been commenced against the company in another
                    jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    For these reasons, we allowed the appeal and
                    directed that the Singapore Liquidators of Beluga Chartering were at liberty to
                    remit the company’s assets in Singapore to the German Liquidator subject
                    to any deductions authorised or required under the Act, notwithstanding the
                    existence of the Singapore Subsidiaries’ unsatisfied judgment debt. The
                    parties agreed that they would bear their own costs of the appeal.</p>
