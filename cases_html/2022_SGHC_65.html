Affle’s position was that PhonePe could not vote until the decision of the Emergency Arbitrator (which would be quite a long time later, and thus a cause of concern). Significantly, counsel for Affle maintained that the shareholders who signed the s 184A resolutions (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the May Resolutions) should be the ones voting at the EGM. Counsel for Affle conceded that, to be fair, the original shareholders should vote. In that regard, PhonePe could ask the Vendor Shareholders for authority to vote <span class="font-italic">on their behalf</span> but PhonePe could not vote as PhonePe (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, could not vote in its own right but could vote as proxy).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 At the hearing before me on 18 June 2021 (see [27] above), counsel for Affle reiterated its position that PhonePe should not vote at the EGM. However, contrary to what he had earlier conceded, he also objected to the Vendor Shareholders voting. Counsel for Affle argued that it would be a “fictitious” vote since the shareholders would not be expressing their own independent view in the vote and it would really be PhonePe voting. Affle submitted that it would be only after the Emergency Arbitrator had determined the validity of the registration of shares that it would be possible to determine which party (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, either PhonePe or the Vendor Shareholders) would have the right to vote at the EGM. In that regard, to allow PhonePe to vote in substance would be a <span class="font-italic">fait accompli</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Affle’s underlying reasoning could perhaps be expressed thus. The May Resolutions were invalid. Therefore, the transfers of OSLabs shares by the Vendor Shareholders were also invalid. OS 468 Prayer 1 originally specifically sought an order to this effect. Although at the request of Affle, OS 468 Prayer 1 was later narrowed down to seek only an order as to the invalidity of the May Resolutions (see [25]), it remained Affle’s position that the transfers by the Vendor Shareholders in favour of PhonePe were invalid. Hence the provision in OS 468 Prayer 4 for determination of their validity by the Emergency Arbitrator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 On the basis that the transfers by the Vendor Shareholders were invalid, it was understandable that Affle sought to prevent PhonePe from exercising voting rights in respect of their shares. <span class="font-italic">Ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span>, the Vendor Shareholders therefore retained the right to vote. If the share transfers were invalid, the Vendor Shareholders remained as shareholders and could vote as such. I address this point at [44] below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">OS 800 and SUM 3963</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Affle’s case was that the EGM held on 15 July 2021 was not properly convened and held, thereby resulting in the resolutions passed thereat being invalid. In particular, Affle submitted that an invalid EGM “must mean that the resolutions passed are invalid”. This would, in turn, determine OS 800 Prayers 1, 2, and 3.

Whilst the logic of their contention was difficult to follow, their motives were not. Having successfully obtained a court order to convene the EGM, they wanted to ensure that the proposed resolutions would fail to find the requisite majority support at the EGM. Affle’s stand was particularly unmeritorious in light of the fact that, regardless of whether the Vendor Shareholders or PhonePe voted, their votes would most likely, if not certainly, be the same (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in favour of the resolutions). Affle was not prepared to abide by the majority vote which they knew or feared would eventuate unless the Vendor Shareholders were stopped. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Affle cited ss 180, 19(6A) and 64(1) of the Companies Act in regard to the issue of voting rights on resolutions at company meetings in the present matter.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Affle’s Written Submissions in OS 800 and SUM 3963 dated 2 September 2021 at para 25.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Crucially, such submission demonstrated that Affle acknowledged that a registered shareholder may vote on a poll at a meeting of the company on any resolution. However, by the time of the EGM, the Vendor Shareholders had transferred their shares to PhonePe and PhonePe was a registered shareholder (see [7] above). Affle’s position that PhonePe was not entitled to vote at the EGM was itself contrary to the same legal principle Affle sought to rely on.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Taking Affle’s position at its highest (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the share transfers and registration were invalid), it necessarily must also be the case that the shares remained with the Vendor Shareholders. Yet, Affle simultaneously contended that the Vendor Shareholders were not entitled to vote at the EGM. I was not persuaded that Affle’s position that neither could vote could be maintained as a matter of law. In that regard, the insurmountable difficulty with Affle’s position was that <span class="font-italic">nobody was a registered shareholder such that neither </span><span class="font-italic">PhonePe nor the Vendor Shareholders were entitled to vote at the EGM</span>. Thus, I had little hesitation in dismissing OS 800.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The voting shareholders and elected Chairman of the EGM</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 For the foregoing reasons, I decided (at the hearing before me on 18 June 2021) that those voting at the EGM <span class="font-italic">had to be</span> the shareholders on record as at 3 and 5 May 2021 respectively. <span class="font-italic">There was no appeal against my order</span><span class="font-italic"> at that point in time</span>. The EGM was duly held on 15 July 2021 with the Vendor Shareholders exercising their voting rights. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The question whether the Vendor Shareholders could vote had already been decided at the hearing before me on 18 June 2021. Affle’s application <span class="font-italic">in OS 800 and SUM 3963</span> therefore amounted to an <span class="font-italic">impermissible back-door appeal</span>. Even assuming, <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span>, that I was wrong in allowing the Vendor Shareholders to vote, until I was reversed, my decision on 18 June 2021 stood at the time OS 800 and SUM 3963 were filed. Under s 182 of the Companies Act, it is clear that the court has the power to “order a meeting to be called, held and conducted in such manner as the Court thinks fit, and may give such ancillary or consequential directions as it thinks expedient”. I agreed with the defendants that OSLabs, in convening the EGM on 15 July 2021 and allowing the Vendor Shareholders (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the members on the register as at 3 and 5 May 2021) to vote, was merely abiding by my order.

</div> As mentioned above at [34] and [51], Affle had only recently filed its Notice of Appeal against my decision given on 18 June 2021, long after it had filed OS 800 and SUM 3963 and I had dismissed them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As mentioned at [40], Issue 1 is also directly related to the issue of whether the EGM was not properly convened because Mr Nair of ON Mauritius had chaired the EGM.

</div>
</div>
</div> As the Vendor Shareholders were entitled to vote, there was nothing to prevent Mr Nair from chairing the EGM.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether the May Resolutions were incapable of ratification and of no effect</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 As earlier recounted at [41], Affle contended that OSLabs’ attempt to have the May Resolutions ratified was wrong at law for two reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) As the May Resolutions had been declared invalid in ORC 3587 pursuant to s 184D(2) of the Companies Act, they were incapable of being ratified at the 15 July 2021 EGM. Fresh resolutions ought to have been tabled instead. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In any case, pursuant to s 184DA of the Companies Act, the May Resolutions had lapsed so that any purported agreement to the May Resolutions was ineffective.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 I shall deal first with Affle’s contention regarding s 184DA. In my view, it is clear that s 184DA is inapplicable to this case and Affle’s reliance thereon is misplaced. Section 184DA provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">184DA.</span>—(1)  Unless the constitution of a company otherwise provides, a resolution proposed to be passed by written means lapses if it is not passed before the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which the written resolution is circulated to the members of the company.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The agreement to a resolution is ineffective if indicated after the expiry of that period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 A plain reading of the provision shows that it applies where a resolution has been proposed to be passed by written means but was not so passed within 28 days after the proposed written resolution was circulated to the members of the company. The result is that it lapses. Section 184DA(2) makes clear that after the proposed resolution lapses, it is incapable of being passed as such.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 If there be need for support for the interpretation, reference may be made to the Ministry of Finance (“MOF”), <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">eport of the Steering Committee for Review of the Companies Act</span> (April 2011) at Recommendation 2.7, para 31 (Chairman: Walter Woon SC) which states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) It is <span class="font-italic">not desirable to have a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">proposed written resolution</span><span class="font-italic">, which was not signed or acted upon, left lying around</span>. It is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">necessary to let such a proposed resolution lapse</span>. If the 28-day period is too short, the company’s articles could provide for a longer period. If there is a need to resurrect the proposal, a new written resolution can be proposed again.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The directors and shareholders of a company might change over time. In view of this, it is logical to stipulate that a written resolution would lapse if the required majority vote is not attained by the end of the 28-day period, as this would address changing circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The aforementioned recommendation was accepted by the MOF (Ministry of Finance, <span class="font-italic">Ministry of Finance’s Responses to the Report</span><span class="font-italic"> of the Steering Committee for Review of the Companies Act</span>) (3 October 2012)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13. <span class="font-weight-bold">MOF accepts Recommendation 2.7</span>. The [Steering Committee] had considered the administrative concerns of companies but on balance had proposed the recommendation as it was not desirable to have a proposed written resolution which was not signed or acted upon. As the directors and shareholders of a company might change over time, it is prudent to stipulate that a written resolution would lapse if the required majority vote is not attained by the end of a certain period. It is noted that the UK had provided for a 28-day period, unless otherwise stated in the companies’ Articles. MOF agrees with the views of the [Steering Committee], and notes that a company may provide a longer lapsing period in its Articles where necessary.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In the present case, the proposed resolutions were passed on 3 and 5 May 2021 respectively. They were not left as mere proposed resolutions such as to attract the application of s 184DA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Before I leave this topic, I should perhaps add that even if s 184DA was applicable, nothing in the section precludes a company from subsequently proposing a fresh resolution identical to the lapsed resolution for adoption by written means or at a general meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 I go on to deal with Affle’s submissions that the May Resolutions having been declared invalid by ORC 3587, they were incapable of being ratified. As mentioned at [1], the EGM was proposed to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, “consider and if deemed fit ratify” the May Resolutions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The word “ratify” is capable of more than one single meaning. As in agency law, it could mean approving or adopting a contract entered into by an agent purportedly on the principal’s behalf. In that sense, ratification “is akin to an assent by the principal to the transaction entered into by the unauthorised agent by adopting the agent’s otherwise unauthorised acts” (<span class="font-italic">Cavenagh</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment Pte Ltd v Kaushik Rajiv</span> [2013] 2 SLR 543 at [31]). In such a case by ratifying the contract the principal becomes legally entitled and bound as though he had authorised the agent’s action from the beginning; the ratification  thus has retrospective effect. The retrospective effect of ratification causes the “legal consequences of the agent’s act to relate back to the time the agent performed those acts as if they had been properly authorised at the outset” (Tan Cheng Han SC, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) at para 6.009). As Lord Sterndale, MR explained in <span class="font-italic">Koenigsblatt</span><span class="font-italic"> v Sweet</span> [1923] 2 Ch 314 at 325, ratification is “equivalent to an antecedent authority” and “when there has been ratification the act that is done is put in the same position as if it had been antecedently authorized”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 This first meaning of the word did not sit comfortably in the context of the May Resolutions for two reasons. Firstly, it would be senseless for any ratification to apply <span class="font-italic">retrospectively</span>. If the May Resolutions were adopted retrospectively by way of ratification, then the transfers and registration of the shares purchased from the Vendor Shareholders in favour of PhonePe were valid. It would then follow that the Vendor Shareholders had no right to vote in the ratification exercise; the result would then be that the ratification failed. To interpret “ratify” in this sense leads to an intractable conundrum. Moreover, as Affle itself pointed out, the May Resolutions had been declared invalid, in line with s 184D(2). Secondly, and in any case, there was no <span class="font-italic">unauthorised act </span>committed by any agent to speak of. On the contrary, the May Resolutions were passed with the requisite majority of the shareholders (see [3]–[4] above). I thus concluded that the parties could not have intended the word “ratify” in this technical sense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 There is another more general sense in which “ratify” is used in plain English, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, to approve and give formal consent to something. Under s 184D(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the May Resolutions which had been passed by written means became invalid once Affle called for a general meeting to be “convened for that resolution” in exercise of its right so to do under s 184D(1). In the circumstances of the present case, it was clear that the word “ratify” was used in this ordinary sense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The EGM ordered by the court on 31 May 2021 (and as later amended on 18 June 2021; see [25] and [27] above) was pursuant to Affle’s application in OS 468 where Affle invoked s 184D(1). In the light of s 184D(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) which requires that a general meeting be convened for that “particular resolution”, it made no sense for Affle to contend that the same resolutions which had been passed by written means (but later invalidated) could not be passed at the EGM of 15 July 2021. Indeed, Affle’s position effectively rendered s 184D(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) otiose if a resolution invalidated pursuant to s 184D(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) could not be put to the vote at the EGM. Seen in that light, it is abundantly clear that Affle’s objection to the EGM on 15 July 2021 on account of the use of the word “ratify” (see [1] above) is merely a technical one which is untenable in the context of s 184D(2) of the Companies Act. In any case, on the facts, I found that the parties’ clear intention in holding the EGM was for the purpose of satisfying s 184D(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Accordingly, the resolution passed at that EGM must be valid notwithstanding Affle’s technical objection. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed OS 800. SUM 3963 also fell away with the dismissal of OS 800. As mentioned at [32], with regard to OS 468, Affle requested that ORC 2881 be discharged and I did so order at the hearing before me on 9 September 2021. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67  After hearing parties’ submissions on costs, I made the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) for OS 468, costs fixed at $20,000 plus disbursements to be borne equally by OSLabs and PhonePe; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) for OS 800, costs fixed at $10,000 plus respective disbursements to be paid by Affle to each defendant.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Andrew Ang<br/>Senior Judge</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kenneth Tan SC (Kenneth Tan Partnership) (instructed), Tan Soo Peng Daniel, Lee Yew Boon and Jonas Chung Teck Hong (Dan Tan Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Teng Muan and Loh Li Qin (Mallal &amp; Namazie) for the first defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sarbjit Singh Chopra, Lee Wen Rong Gabriel and Luis Inaki Duhart Gonzalez (Selvam LLC) for the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
