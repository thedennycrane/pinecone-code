<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present assessment of damages arises out of
                    two leases signed between the plaintiff, Mr Gerd Walter Thode, and the
                    first defendant, Mintwell Industry Pte Ltd (“Mintwell”), for two
                    units in Mintwell Building, an industrial building located at No 55 Ubi
                    Avenue 3, Singapore 408864 (“Mintwell Building”). Although the
                    hearing of the assessment of damages took only half a day before me, the parties
                    subsequently raised a myriad of legal issues in their written and oral
                    submissions. As will be demonstrated, most of these seemingly complicated issues
                    can in fact be resolved having regard to first principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts of this case are undisputed and
                    reference can be made to the judgment of the trial judge, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J,
                    in <em>Thode Gerd Walter v Mintwell Industry Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 44 (“<em>Thode Gerd
                    Walter</em>”) (at [1]–[13]). For purposes of the present
                    proceedings, the facts can be briefly summarised as follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff is the sole-proprietor of Euromal
                    Precision Engineering (“Euromal”) and is in the business of
                    mechanical engineering works. At the material time, Mintwell was the lessor of
                    Mintwell Building and had granted leases of various units in Mintwell Building
                    to others, including the plaintiff. The second defendant is Mr Seah Bak
                    Kheow (“Seah”), who was alleged by the plaintiff, and found by
                    Belinda Ang J in <em>Thode Gerd Walter</em> (at [46]), to
                    be the key controlling mind behind Mintwell at the material time,
                    notwithstanding that he was not a director of Mintwell. The third defendant is
                    Mr Tan Kee Hock, Eddy (“Eddy”), a director of Mintwell at the
                    material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Mintwell had granted the following two leases to
                    the plaintiff:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     a lease dated 16 February 2005
                        for unit #01-02 at a monthly rent of $15,643.60, which commenced on
                        1 May 2005 and was for a period of two years up till 30 April 2007
                        with an option to renew for a further two years; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     a lease dated 1 August 2006 for
                        unit #03-02 at a monthly rent of $5,940.00, which commenced on 1 August
                        2006 and was for a period of 33 months up till 30 April 2007 with an
                        option to renew for a further two years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff
                    had taken up the second lease for unit #03-02 as he needed more space to expand
                    his growing business, and the term of the second lease was 33 months so as to
                    ensure that the expiry dates of both leases would coincide.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Previously, Mintwell had mortgaged Mintwell
                    Building to Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation (“OCBC”) and
                    covenanted, <em>inter alia</em>, not to let any part of the
                    property without the consent in writing of the bank. Unknown to the plaintiff,
                    OCBC had obtained an order of court dated 2 September 2002 against Mintwell
                    for vacant possession of Mintwell Building (in Originating Summons No 1106
                    of 2002 (“OS 1106/2002”)) after Mintwell defaulted in mortgage
                    repayments and had subsequently filed a writ of possession on 30 June 2006
                    to enforce the order. In breach of its covenant, Mintwell had also leased the
                    two units to the plaintiff without the consent of OCBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       It was only on 2 August 2006 when the
                    plaintiff was served with a copy of Summons No 3453 of 2006 (“SUM
                    3453/2006”), an application by OCBC for the execution of the writ of
                    possession, that the plaintiff first found out about the true situation. In
                    order to avoid eviction, the plaintiff contested the summons at the hearing on
                    1 September 2006, but was unsuccessful. The Assistant Registrar ordered
                    that OCBC be at liberty to enforce the order of court dated 2 September
                    2002 and to execute the writ of possession, albeit a stay of execution was
                    granted until 1 December 2006, 4 pm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiff eventually found alternative
                    premises for his business at 45 Changi South Avenue 2, #03-01, Techplas
                    Industrial Building, Singapore 486133 (“Changi South premises”)
                    and entered into a lease for this new premises on or about 22 November 2006
                    at a monthly rent of $23,000. Prior to the Changi South premises, the plaintiff
                    had considered another premises at 9 Tai Seng Drive (“Tai Seng
                    premises”) but found the place unsuitable. The plaintiff vacated unit
                    #03-02 at Mintwell Building on or about 4 October 2006 and vacated unit
                    #01-02 on or about 28 November 2006. Although the plaintiff had incurred
                    expenses renovating unit #03-02, he never commenced operations
                there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 8 June 2007, the plaintiff commenced the
                    present action against the three defendants. He sued Mintwell for breach of
                    contract (in respect of Mintwell’s breaches for the two leases),
                    negligence and fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation and Seah and Eddy
                    for fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation. On 25 August 2008, the
                    parties entered into a consent judgment whereby interlocutory judgment was
                    entered for the plaintiff against Mintwell for breach of contract with damages
                    to be assessed by the Registrar. On 23 February 2009, Belinda Ang J,
                    after the trial of the action, entered interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff
                    against Mintwell and Seah for negligent misrepresentation with damages to be
                    assessed by the Registrar. She, however, did not find Eddy liable. As such, the
                    present proceedings are only against Mintwell and Seah (reference hereafter to
                    “the defendants” in this judgment will refer only to Mintwell and
                    Seah).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The present assessment of damages and the heads of damages claimed by
                the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The present assessment of damages was a
                    consolidated hearing (pursuant to an order of court dated 25 August 2009)
                    for the assessment of damages due to the plaintiff under both judgments. The
                    plaintiff claimed in total a sum of $251,902.53, which can be broadly divided
                    into four categories:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     $191,195.38 for expenses incurred in
                        relation to the move to the Changi South premises, which formed the bulk of
                        the claim;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     $15,964 for expenses incurred for unit #03-02, in which operations never
                        commenced there;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     $27,551.95 for labour costs (for the plaintiff’s staff and for the
                        plaintiff himself) incurred in relation to the move to the Changi South
                        premises; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     $17,191.20 for legal costs incurred for contesting the eviction and title
                        searches/conveyancing fees for the Tai Seng premises and the Changi South
                        premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At the hearing of the assessment of damages,
                    the defendants elected not to call their witness, <em>ie</em>, Eddy, to give evidence at the end of the plaintiff’s
                    case. Eddy’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) was
                    thus not admitted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary issue – the measure of damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Before I proceed with my decision on the
                    damages to be awarded, it will be necessary to deal with a preliminary issue
                    first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At the start of the hearing of the assessment
                    of damages on 9 October 2009, counsel for the plaintiff, Ms Sugidha
                    Nithi (“Ms Nithi”), represented to me that parties have
                    agreed that the assessment of the damages due under both judgments would result
                    in the same figure, and no issue was raised by either party as to what was the
                    proper measure of damages. Ms Nithi explained that this was also the reason
                    why consolidation was sought in the first place and granted. However, at the
                    oral submissions on 20 November 2009, counsel for the defendants,
                    Ms Sarah Tan (“Ms Tan”), raised for the first time the
                    issue that the plaintiff should elect his measure of damages and decide whether
                    to proceed with damages in contract or tort. Although the defendants had alluded
                    briefly to the different measures of damages in contract and tort in their
                    written submissions<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, they had
                    not explained the significance of such difference or what the consequences of
                    non-election of the measure of damages were in this case. Indeed, the bulk of
                    the defendants’ written submissions were focused on the legal issues of
                    proof of damage, mitigation and remoteness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     At the oral submissions, Ms Tan explained
                    that if the plaintiff chooses to proceed in tort, he would only be entitled to
                    recover damages in respect of the expenses he incurred for the <em>two</em> units in Mintwell Building (it should be noted,
                    however, that the plaintiff is only claiming for expenses incurred for <em>one</em> unit, <em>ie</em>, unit #03-02,
                    as part of the total damages claimed (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>
                    above)) and nothing more because the aim of damages in tort was to restore him
                    to the position he would have been in if the tort (<em>ie</em>, the misrepresentation in this case) had not been committed.
                    And if the tort had not occurred in the first place, she reasoned that the
                    plaintiff would not have taken up the two leases at Mintwell Building and would
                    have simply taken up another place. Consequently, he would not have had to move
                    to the Changi South premises and incur all the other expenses claimed. His loss
                    would therefore only be confined to the wasted expenditure for the two units in
                    Mintwell Building. However, if the plaintiff chooses to proceed in contract, the
                    plaintiff would be entitled in principle to claim for the expenses he expended
                    for moving to the Changi South premises as well as the rest of the damages
                    claimed here. She did not, however, submit that the plaintiff should choose the
                    measure of damages in tort or that that was the correct measure for the present
                    case. Rather, her position was simply that the plaintiff should make an
                    election.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On the other hand, Ms Nithi reiterated
                    the position at the start of the hearing of the assessment of damages. She
                    contended that no election was necessary and that, in any event, the same amount
                    of damages would be ascertained under either measure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     It does not appear to me that the defendants
                    are pressing the point strongly that an election should be made or that the
                    measure of damages in tort is the right measure. In any case, I do not agree
                    with the defendants’ view that if the measure of damages is to be based in
                    tort, then it follows that the plaintiff can only recover the expenses incurred
                    for the two units at Mintwell Building and nothing more. This argument appears
                    to be based on a misunderstanding of the principle that the aim of damages in
                    tort is to put the claimant in a position he would have been in if the tort had
                    not been committed. There is no doubt that this is the guiding principle of the
                    object of damages in tort, which is <em>different</em> from
                    that in contract, which aims to put the claimant in as good a position, as far
                    as money can do it, as if the promise had been performed (see the Court of
                    Appeal decision of <em>Wishing Star Ltd v Jurong Town
                        Corp</em> [2008] 2 SLR 909 (“<em>Wishing Star</em>”) at [28]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, there is no reason to draw an
                    artificial and arbitrary line to limit damages to only expenses incurred for the
                    two units if the measure of damages is based in tort in the present case. Could
                    it not be said similarly that had the tort not been committed (<em>ie</em>, if there had been no misrepresentation), the
                    plaintiff would not have gone on to incur and would have avoided all other
                    expenses he had incurred such as those in relation to the move to the Changi
                    South premises? Indeed, as a matter of general principle, a claimant in tort is
                    entitled to recover not only the basic pecuniary losses he suffered as a result
                    of the tort, but also the <em>consequential</em> pecuniary
                    losses which will include other expenses necessitated by the tort (see generally
                    Harvey McGregor QC, <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2009) at paras 2-043 to 2-045 and paras 2-051
                    to 2-053; see also <em>Grosvenor Hotel Company v
                        Hamilton</em> [1984] 2 QB 836 where a tenant recovered in an action
                    for nuisance the expenses of setting up a new place from the landlord). Apart
                    from proof of damage, the limit to the recovery of such losses would be the
                    remoteness of damage, and in this respect, I note that the test of remoteness of
                    damage in tort is generally considered to be wider than that in contract (see
                        <em>Koufos v C Czarnikow Ltd</em> [1969]
                    1 AC 350 (“<em>The Heron II</em>”)
                    at 385–386, <em>Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen
                        Consultants Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 2 SLR 623 (“<em>Robertson Quay</em>”) at [71]–[74] and <em>Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming
                        Eric</em> [2007] 1 SLR 853 (“<em>Sunny
                        Metal (HC)</em>”) at [138]). Bearing this in mind and the fact
                    that both judgments in this case arose out of the same factual matrix, it would
                    appear odd that the defendants are taking the position that all the other
                    expenses claimed by the plaintiff are in principle claimable and recoverable if
                    the measure of damages is based in contract, but not so if the measure of
                    damages is based in tort.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In my view, the correct position is simply
                    this. There are two judgments here – one against Mintwell for breach of
                    contract and the other against both Mintwell and Seah for misrepresentation in
                    tort. As a matter of principle, the plaintiff is entitled to damages based on
                    the measure of damages in contract for the judgment in contract as well as
                    damages based on the measure of damages in tort for the judgment in tort. Under
                    both judgments, damages are recoverable so long as they are not too remote.
                    However, at the end of the day, there should be no <em>double
                        recovery</em>. Thus, if there is any overlap in losses under both
                    judgments, the court should only grant one set of damages for the same loss. It
                    should also be appreciated that the present case is not exactly one where there
                    are concurrent duties in tort and contract (see for example <em>Sunny Metal (HC)</em>) and more will be said about this later (see
                        <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On the facts of the present case and bearing
                    in mind that the claims put forward by the plaintiff relate mainly to the
                        <em>expenses</em> he had incurred as a result of the
                    breach of contract and/or misrepresentation, I agree with the plaintiff that the
                    damages which he is entitled to in contract would actually be the same as those
                    he is entitled to in tort. This is not unusual, but it should be noted that this
                    is only by way of factual coincidence (<em>Wishing
                        Star</em> at [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… there could be a coincidence in quantum between the contractual
                        and the tortuous measures of damages, depending on the precise facts of the
                        case concerned, although… , this would be more by way of a <em>factual</em> coincidence and does <em>not</em> signify any coincidence in the <em>purposes</em> that the law of contract and the law of tort,
                        respectively, serve… [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In arriving at this conclusion, I took into account the important fact
                    that the present case is not one where the plaintiff is trying to recover loss
                    of profits that he would have made in his business if the representations made
                    by the defendants had been true. Recovery of such loss of profits would not have
                    been permissible in tort, though they may be recoverable in contract, given that
                    the objective of damages in tort, unlike contract, is not to compensate the
                    claimant for the loss of bargain but to restore him to <em>status
                        quo ante</em> (see <em>Wishing Star</em> at [28]
                    and <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at para
                19-003).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Lastly, I am also of the view that, in any
                    case, it is not open to the defendants now to contend that the damages would be
                    different under the judgment in contract and the judgment in tort, having not
                    objected to the consolidation of the assessment of damages when the plaintiff
                    first applied for one and subsequently not raising any objections at the start
                    of the assessment of damages or at any time throughout the proceedings until the
                    day of oral submissions. Indeed, the entire assessment had proceeded on the
                    basis that the damages were the same until the issue was raised (half-heartedly
                    it seems) at the oral submissions. I turn now to my decision on the award of
                    damages for the various heads of damages claimed by the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The defendants have essentially two main
                    objections to these various claims. First, and this appears to be the
                    defendants’ main contention, the defendants contended that the plaintiff
                    had failed to mitigate his losses for two reasons. The first reason is that the
                    plaintiff had chosen to lease the Changi South premises (22,008 square feet in
                    floor area), which is 23.8% <em>larger</em> in floor area
                    compared to the combined floor area of units #01-02 and #03-02 at Mintwell
                    Building (17,774 square feet in floor area in total). The defendants argued that
                    the increase in space would necessarily mean that “the amount the
                    [p]laintiff expended to renovate/fit out the Changi South premises [would be]
                        higher”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. They submitted that the court
                    should take this increase in floor area into account as a factor in awarding
                    damages and “not have [the defendants] pay for the [p]laintiff’s
                    own expansion plans and ambitions”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. Further, they pointed out that if the
                    plaintiff had leased the same floor area as Mintwell Building at the Changi
                    South premises, the monthly rent (at the same rent per square feet) would only
                    be $18,662.70 instead of the present sum of $23,000, which would work out to a
                    savings of $4,337.30 per month and a total savings of $125,781.70 over 29 months
                    from 1 December 2006 to 30 April <em>2009</em>
                    (it should be noted that the defendants had mistakenly taken the expiry date of
                    the two leases as 30 April <em>2009</em> where the
                    correct date should be 30 April <em>2007</em> (see
                        <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above); thus instead of 29 months, it
                    should only be 5 months and the alleged savings should only be
                        $21,686.50)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. The second reason is
                    that in respect of all the renovation, electrical, shifting and air-conditioning
                    works done at the Changi South premises, the plaintiff had failed to source for
                    quotations from other contractors and to bargain for a more favourable price.
                    Instead, the plaintiff had accepted the quotations he obtained from the first
                    contractors he approached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Secondly, the defendants contended that the
                    plaintiff had failed to prove all the expenses that he had allegedly incurred in
                    relation to the Changi South premises. The defendants took the position that it
                    was insufficient for the plaintiff to produce the quotations and invoices for
                    the various works done. The complaint was that the plaintiff did not call the
                    different contractors to give evidence in court so as to justify and explain why
                    certain works were necessary and why certain amounts were charged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     As a matter of principle and logic, the issue
                    of proof should be dealt with first followed by the issue of mitigation (see
                        <em>Robertson Quay</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>). However, in light of the arguments canvassed by the
                    defendants and their emphasis on the issue of mitigation, it would be more
                    convenient for me to deal with the latter issue first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mitigation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It is trite law that a claimant must take
                    reasonable steps to mitigate the loss arising from the defendant’s wrong,
                    be it a tort or breach of contract, and the claimant will not be entitled to
                    recover damages in respect of any part of the loss which is due to his neglect
                    to take such steps (see the speech of Viscount Haldane LC in the leading case of
                        <em>British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company,
                        Limited v Underground Electric Railways Company of London,
                        Limited</em> [1912] 1 AC 673 at 689, which was followed
                    locally in <em>GIB Automation Pte Ltd v Deluge Fire Protection
                        (SEA) Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 2 SLR 918 (“<em>GIB Automation</em>”) at [98]; see also <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) at para 7-014). The onus is on the
                    defendant to show that the claimant has failed to take such steps (<em>GIB Automation</em> at [98] and <em>McGregor
                        on Damages</em> at para 7-019).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     However, the standard of reasonableness is not
                    high in view of the fact that the defendant is an admitted wrongdoer. As stated
                    by Lord Macmillan in <em>Banco de Portugal v Waterlow and Sons,
                        Limited</em> [1932] 1 AC 452 at 506:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It is often easy after an emergency has passed to
                            criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it, but such criticism
                            does not come well from those who have themselves created the
                            emergency</em>. The law is satisfied if the party <em>placed in a difficult situation</em> by reason of the
                        breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of
                        remedial measures, and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost
                        of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other
                        measures less burdensome to him might have been taken. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     It is oft said that the question of mitigation
                    is a question of fact (see <em>Payzu, Limited v
                        Saunders</em> [1919] 2 KB 581 at 588 and 589; see also <em>Robertson Quay</em> at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>). Indeed, as would be implicit in Lord Macmillan’s
                    quoted passage above, what is reasonable must be judged in the <em>circumstances</em> that the claimant is placed
                in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Returning to the facts of the present case,
                    can it be said that the plaintiff has failed to take such reasonable steps given
                    that he had chosen a bigger premises and/or failed to source for alternative
                    quotations for the various works done at the Changi South premises? I do not
                    think so. The circumstances were such that the plaintiff only first found out of
                    the various breaches by the defendants in August 2006. After SUM 3453/2006 for
                    the execution of the writ of possession was heard on 1 September 2006, it
                    then became a certainty that the plaintiff had to move out of Mintwell Building
                    and that he had only up to 1 December 2006, <em>ie</em>,
                    three months, to find alternative premises and to shift there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff first found and considered the
                    Tai Seng premises but found it unsuitable for various reasons before he
                    eventually found the Changi South premises sometime around end September 2006
                    and settled for it. He testified that he was running against time then as he had
                    to find new premises quickly and thereafter carry out the necessary renovation
                    works, which would again take time (he testified that it took about two months
                    for the renovation works), to make the new premises fit for his machinery and
                    business. He testified that although the Changi South premises were bigger, the
                    extra space was unnecessary and he had in fact kept the extra space empty. I
                    accept the plaintiff’s explanation. It was certainly not a case where the
                    plaintiff had sought to expand his business when he moved to the Changi South
                    premises as claimed by the defendants. Indeed, any such expansion would already
                    have taken place when the plaintiff took up the extra unit, <em>ie</em>, unit #03-02, at Mintwell Building.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It should be further borne in mind that the
                    plaintiff is not claiming for the <em>additional rent</em>
                    he has to pay for the Changi South premises as a result of the larger floor
                    area. As such, the figures put forward by the defendants (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above), which they claimed are savings to the
                    plaintiff are, in my view, irrelevant for the present assessment of damages. The
                    defendants also did not submit (and rightly so) that these savings should be
                    deducted from the total damages awarded to the plaintiff. However, I should
                    mention that the defendants did raise a further point about deducting unpaid
                    rent from the damages awarded. They contended that the plaintiff did not pay
                    them rent for unit #01-02 for the months of August to December 2006 when he was
                    still in possession of the unit and had thus saved some $78,218 in rent (the
                    plaintiff has, however, challenged this amount<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>). They also contended that no rent was ever
                    paid for unit #03-02, though no figure was submitted as to the arrears in rent.
                    Accordingly, the defendants submitted that the amount of rent that the plaintiff
                    withheld, especially the sum of $78,218, should be deducted from the award of
                    damages<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. I am of the view that no such
                    deduction can be made given that the defendants themselves did not counterclaim
                    for the unpaid rent or plead the defence of set-off in the first place. In any
                    event, the defendants have also not adduced any statements to prove the arrears
                    in rent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     There is of course the defendants’
                    further contention that a larger floor area would necessitate a larger amount
                    being spent on the renovation works at the Changi South premises (though the
                    defendants did not substantiate this contention in their submissions). I do not
                    think this is necessarily so. If one looks at the list of expenses set out at
                        <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above, it would be noted that the
                    bulk of the items such as the costs of the electrical works, the shifting of the
                    plaintiff’s machinery and the piping and fittings required for the
                    plaintiff’s operations pertains specifically to the plaintiff’s
                    machinery and it is hard to see how the costs for such expenses would be
                    determined or affected by the floor area. The same can be said of the expenses
                    for shifting of the office furniture and equipment. No doubt some items
                    would invariably be affected by the floor area; the plaintiff testified that as
                    there was a longer distance from the compressor to the air-conditioning units at
                    the Changi South premises, additional copper and tubings had to be used for the
                    air-conditioning, and that for the ceiling, additional ceiling boards had to be
                    purchased given the larger area. However, this alone does not mean that the
                    plaintiff had failed to take reasonable steps to mitigate in the given
                    circumstances. To begin with, the plaintiff had in fact brought over the
                    air-conditioning compressor and units as well as the ceiling boards from
                    Mintwell Building to be reused at the Changi South premises in a bid to save
                    costs. Apart from these items, the plaintiff also moved over all other useable
                    office furniture and equipment, including power points, wirings, cables, lights
                    and carpets so as to incur less expenses for the renovation works at the Changi
                    South premises. The truth is that the plaintiff did make considerate efforts to
                    mitigate his losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendants, during the cross-examination
                    of the plaintiff, also sought to point out that the costs charged by ACIS for
                    air-conditioning and Sterling for shifting the machinery in relation to the
                    Changi South premises were higher than the costs previously charged when the
                    plaintiff moved from Betime Building at Macpherson Road into Mintwell Building
                    (the plaintiff had engaged their services then as well). In respect of the costs
                    charged by ACIS, the plaintiff explained that as the new premises had no
                    brackets for the compressor, these had to be installed and additional costs were
                    thus incurred. As for Sterling, the plaintiff explained that a higher fee was
                    charged given that the Changi South premises were located on the third floor.
                    Again, I do not think that the fact alone that these costs were higher for the
                    Changi South premises would mean that the plaintiff’s claims were inflated
                    and the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his losses. To begin with, it would be
                    unrealistic to expect the costs for both moves to be the same given that the
                    scope of the works undertaken by ACIS and Sterling for the two premises would
                    likely be different. The defendants have also not adduced any contrary evidence
                    to show that such expenses were excessive or inflated (<em>cf GIB
                        Automation</em> (<a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> <em>supra</em>) where the defendant in that case had
                    adduced evidence that the plaintiff had inflated the value of the items it
                    ordered in order to claim a larger sum of damages (<em>id</em> at [81]–[97])).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As for the failure to obtain quotations from
                    other contractors, the plaintiff explained that the contractors he hired for the
                    renovation works at the Changi South premises were mostly his regular
                    contractors who had done similar renovation works for him in the past at his
                    premises at Mintwell Building as well as his premises prior to Mintwell Building
                    at Betime Building. This evidence was not challenged by the defendants, who in
                    fact relied on this fact for their cross-examination and submissions. The
                    plaintiff said that he had engaged these contractors again for the Changi South
                    premises as he knew they were reliable, they knew exactly what his requirements
                    were and he trusted their workmanship. He candidly agreed with the suggestion of
                    the counsel for the defendants, Mr Anthony Lee Hwee Khiam, during
                    cross-examination that there could perhaps be other contractors who would charge
                    a lower price for the same work, but he testified that he believed his
                    contractors would not over-charge him for the works, given the trust and rapport
                    they have built up with each other. He also explained that he had negotiated and
                    bargained for a lower price with these contractors before they quoted/invoiced
                    him. He further explained that given the short time frame he had, it was not
                    quite feasible to source for and obtain quotations from other contractors,
                    especially since he would have to spend time telling these new contractors his
                    requirements all over again. For Boge, which was engaged by the plaintiff for
                    the first time, the plaintiff explained that he had decided to engage them as
                    Boge was the company that manufactured his machinery, and he thus felt safer
                    that they did the piping and fittings for the machinery (which ran on compressed
                    air) at the Changi South premises in the short span of time he had. I accept all
                    the plaintiff’s explanation above which, in my view, is entirely
                    reasonable in the circumstances. I would also add that the plaintiff struck me
                    as a truthful witness throughout the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     On the totality of the facts and the evidence
                    before me, I am of the view that the defendants did not discharge their burden
                    of proving that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his losses. No doubt
                    perhaps more savings could have been achieved if the plaintiff had the luxury of
                    time to think or to source for alternative quotations, but this does not as a
                    matter of course mean that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his losses. In
                        <em>Darbishire v Warren</em> [1963]
                    1 WLR 1067, Pearson LJ said (at 1075):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it is important to appreciate the true nature of the so-called
                        "duty to mitigate the loss" or "duty to minimise the damage." <em>The plaintiff is not under any actual obligation to adopt the
                            cheaper method: if he wishes to adopt the more expensive method, he is
                            at liberty to do so and by doing so he commits no wrong against the
                            defendant or anyone else</em>. The true meaning is that the
                        plaintiff is not entitled to charge the defendant by way of damages with any
                        greater sum than that which he reasonably needs to expend for the purpose of
                        making good the loss. In short, he is fully entitled to be as extravagant as
                        he pleases but not at the expense of the defendant. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, the plaintiff has already done what was <em>reasonable in the circumstances</em> to mitigate his losses and we
                    should not, as Lord Macmillan suggested (see <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above), on hindsight, nip-pick on what he could have done
                    better and criticise and penalise him for that.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Proof of damage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I turn now to the defendants’ second
                    main contention, <em>ie</em>, the lack of proof for the
                    expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As held by Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA,
                    delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, in <em>Robertson
                        Quay</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [27], it is fundamental and trite that a
                    claimant claiming damages must prove his damage, <em>ie</em>, he must satisfy the court both as to the fact of damage and
                    as to its amount. Summarising the position at law, Andrew Phang JA said at
                    [31]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To summarise, a plaintiff cannot simply make a claim for damages without
                        placing before the court sufficient evidence of the loss it has suffered
                        even if it is otherwise entitled in principle to recover damages. On the
                        other hand, where the plaintiff has attempted its level best to prove its
                        loss <em>and</em> the evidence is cogent, the court
                        should allow it to recover the damages claimed. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Unlike <em>Robertson
                        Quay</em> where the court found that there was no <em>factual link</em> between the additional interests claimed and the
                    breach of contract (<em>ie</em>, it was not shown that the
                    delay in construction had led to additional interest (claimed by the appellant
                    in that case as damages) actually being incurred) to begin with, this is not the
                    case here. The plaintiff has certainly incurred the expenses as evidenced in the
                    invoices which are undisputedly for renovation works done at the Changi South
                    premises, the move to the Changi South premises and the renovations being
                    necessitated by the defendants’ breach. Indeed, the defendants are not
                    contending otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, as mentioned, the defendants’
                    main complaint here is that the plaintiff did not call the various contractors
                    to come to court to explain the renovations works that were carried out, why
                    certain items of work had to be done and/or why such works were warranted. They
                    took the view that the plaintiff’s explanation of what works were carried
                    out was simply not enough. For instance, in respect of the invoices rendered by
                    Qian Cheng, the defendants complained as follows<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43.    The person behind Qian Cheng… ,
                            Mr David Tang, was not called as the Plaintiff’s witness to
                            justify his recommendations as well as to the nature and extent of the
                            works done.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45.    
              <em>Because Mr David Tang was
                                not called as a witness, there is therefore no direct evidence as to
                                what was done, whether what was done was warranted in the ordinary
                                course of events</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similar assertions were made in respect of the other expenses in the
                    defendants’ written submissions as well as throughout the
                    cross-examination of the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Bearing in mind the guidelines laid down by
                    Andrew Phang JA in <em>Robertson Quay</em>, I am of
                    the view that the plaintiff by adducing the various quotations and invoices,
                    which showed clearly that the works listed there were for the Changi South
                    premises, has done his level best to adduce sufficient and cogent evidence to
                    prove his losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defendants make a general unqualified
                    assertion that the production of quotations and invoices was insufficient and it
                    was necessary to call the contractors to explain these documents. Taken to its
                    logical conclusion, it would mean that in every assessment of damages where a
                    quotation/invoice is produced by a claimant to prove certain expense/loss he has
                    incurred (and this would be the case in most cases), the maker of the
                    quotation/invoice has to come to court to explain it. This would be most
                    impractical especially if a large number of quotations/invoices from different
                    contractors are tendered. In my view, there cannot be such a general requirement
                    in law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     This is not to say that it would always be
                    sufficient just to adduce quotations/invoices to prove one’s alleged
                    expenses/losses. As pointed out by Andrew Phang JA in <em>Robertson Quay</em> (at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>),
                    the process of proof of damage is an “intensely factual one” (even
                    more so than mitigation) and it would not be possible to lay down any general
                    rules or principles as to what would constitute adequate proof of damage since
                    the particular factual circumstances of a case could take literally a myriad of
                    forms. There are cases such as that in <em>Robertson
                        Quay</em> where the adduction of invoices or receipts would be
                    insufficient when to begin with, there appears to be no factual link at all
                    between the damage claimed and the breach. There could also be a situation where
                    the quotation/invoice may call for some explanation such as where the figures in
                    the quotation/invoice may appear to be inflated or certain items appear to be
                    unusual or special, and in such a case, there may be a need to call the maker of
                    the quotation/invoice to court to explain the figures or why the items were
                    indeed necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the present case, it should be first borne
                    in mind that the defendants are not at all disputing the <em>admissibility</em> of the quotations and invoices tendered by the
                    plaintiff. The works listed in the various quotations and invoices did not
                    appear to be unusual or special to suggest that they were unconnected to the
                    renovation of the Changi South premises for the purposes of the
                    plaintiff’s business. It is noteworthy that most of these
                    quotations/invoices were from the plaintiff’s regular contractors who had
                    undertaken similar works for the plaintiff in the past whenever he shifted
                    premises. As mentioned (at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above), the
                    defendants pointed out that the costs for certain works were higher (when
                    compared to similar works done for the two units at Mintwell Building) but for
                    reasons given above (at <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>), I have
                    accepted the plaintiff’s explanation for the difference in costs. By
                    adducing the quotations and invoices for the various works done at the Changi
                    South premises, the plaintiff has satisfied the burden of proof of
                    damage.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In conclusion, for the reasons above, I award
                    the plaintiff the full sum of $191,195.38 he claimed for the expenses he
                    incurred for the renovation works at the Changi South premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Expenses incurred for unit #03-02</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The plaintiff also claimed a sum of $15,964
                    spent on renovating and fitting unit #03-02 at Mintwell Building. The plaintiff,
                    as mentioned, did not commence operations at this unit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     According to the plaintiff, this claim in
                    respect of unit #03-02 is a claim for reliance damages and not expectation
                    damages, unlike the rest of his claims for damages<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff argued that the lease for
                    unit #03-02 was a separate contract and he was entitled to elect the basis of
                    his recovery. The defendants, on the other hand, argued that the plaintiff could
                    not claim for this amount because to claim for both expectation and reliance
                    damages at the same time would be double recovery. In support of their argument,
                    the defendants relied on the cases of <em>Cullinane v British
                        “Rema” Manufacturing Co Ld</em> [1954]
                    1 QB 292 (“<em>Cullinane</em>”) and
                        <em>Hong Fok Realty Pte Ltd v Bima Investment Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1992] 2 SLR(R) 834 (“<em>Hong Fok Realty</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Given that the plaintiff had incurred money to
                    renovate unit #03-02 but never had the chance to utilise it, it would appear
                    intuitively that he should be allowed to recover his wasted expenditure.
                    However, there is merit in the defendants’ argument. Notwithstanding the
                    plaintiff’s point that there are two leases and hence two contracts here,
                    the plaintiff has claimed, and I have already awarded him, the expenses incurred
                    in relation to the Changi South premises, which is a <em>replacement</em> premises for <em>both</em>
                    units #01-02 and #03-02 at Mintwell Building. Together with the rest of the
                    damages I am awarding below, the plaintiff would be placed in a position he
                    would have been in if <em>both</em> the contracts had been
                    performed (having been awarded in this case, as commonly said, the “costs
                    of cure”). In other words, the plaintiff has effectively claimed
                    expectation damages in respect of the lease for unit #03-02 as well. And if the
                    contract had been performed, the plaintiff would necessarily have to incur the
                    $15,964 to renovate unit #03-02. Hence, it would be wrong in principle to award
                    the plaintiff the sum of $15,964 in addition to the expenses for the Changi
                    South premises. In this regard, the following passage from <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) is instructive (at para 2-018):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is important to note… that not only must the defendant be
                        credited with the amount that the claimant has saved by no longer having to
                        perform his side of the bargain, but <em>the claimant cannot
                            also recover, in addition to the basic loss which is intended to
                            represent the loss of his bargain, any expenses he has incurred in
                            preparation or in part performance. Such expenses represent part of the
                            price that the claimant has to incur to secure his bargain</em>.
                        If he recovers for the loss of his bargain, it would be inconsistent that he
                        should in addition recover for expenses which were necessarily laid out by
                        him for its attainment. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Thus, in <em>Cullinane</em>, the English Court of Appeal rejected the
                    plaintiff’s claim insofar as it sought to recover both expectation and
                    reliance damages. Evershed MR, delivering the judgment of the court, said at
                    302:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me, as a matter of principle, that the full claim of damages
                        in the form in which it is pleaded was not sustainable, in so far as the
                        plaintiff sought to recover <em>both the whole of his
                            original capital loss and also the whole of the profit which he would
                            have made</em>. I think that that is really a self-evident
                        proposition, because a claim for loss of profits could only be founded upon
                        the footing that the capital expenditure had been incurred. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     There is no doubt that a claimant generally
                    has a discretion to choose between a claim for reliance damages or a claim for
                    expectation damages unless the defendant can show that the claimant has made a
                    bad bargain and hence should not be entitled to recover reliance damages (see
                        <em>CCF Films (London) Ltd v Impact Quadrant Films
                        Ltd</em> [1985] 1 QB 16). However, he cannot have both for
                    the same loss. The cases of <em>Cullinane</em> (at
                    302–303 and 308) and <em>Hong Fok Realty</em> (at
                    [60]–[62]) cited by the defendants also make it clear that it would be
                    wrong in principle to award a claimant both expectation and reliance damages for
                    the same loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In short, for the reasons above, I would
                    disallow the plaintiff’s claim for $15,964.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Labour costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I turn now to the plaintiff’s claim for
                    damages of $27,551.95 in respect of the labour costs for himself and his staff
                    that were incurred as a result of the move. These are manhours for the period
                    18 November 2006 to 3 December 2006 where the move to the Changi South
                    premises was carried out, and the breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     $22,400 for the plaintiff himself
                        for the over-time hours he spent doing work for the move. This is based on
                        an hourly rate of $200 and the plaintiff claimed he had spent a total of 112
                        over-time hours on the move. According to the plaintiff, the hourly rate of
                        $200 is the rate that he charges his customers. As evidence, he adduced four
                        commercial invoices to his customers which reflected his work time charges
                        as $200 per hour<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. He explained that he had
                        to spend time to design and make plans for the machine layout and to
                        configure the machines subsequently at the Changi South
                    premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     $5,151.95
                        for the plaintiff’s staff for work done for the move. The plaintiff
                        explained that this figure is made up of: (i) the over-time hours spent on
                        the move by his salaried employees during the shifting period; and (ii) the
                        hours spent by his contract workers purely for the move (a detailed
                        breakdown of the hours spent on the move by each of the plaintiff’s
                        staff can be found in a summary table exhibited at p 37 of the
                        plaintiff’s supplementary AEIC (“summary table”)). He
                        also explained that for his salaried employees, they are paid 1.5 times
                        their basic hourly rate if they are required by him to work over-time on a
                        day that falls on Monday to Saturday, twice their basic hourly rate if they
                        are required to work by him on Sundays and their basic hourly rate if they
                        themselves request to work over-time<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff further clarified that for
                        his salaried employees who earn more than $2,000 a month (and there are five
                        of them), as a general rule, they are not paid any over-time work they do in
                        relation to the daily operations at Euromal. However, as the work for the
                        move was not part of their usual job scope, they had to be compensated for
                        the over-time work they put in. For these salaried employees, they are
                        simply paid their basic hourly rate for the over-time hours spent on the
                        move<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. As for the contract
                        workers, they are paid a standard fee of $5.64 per hour for working in the
                        day and $5.91 per hour for working at night<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The plaintiff explained that the during the
                    shifting period, the only working day in which no operations took place at
                    Euromal was the actual day of the move itself, <em>ie</em>,
                    23 November 2006, Thursday. However, as 23 November 2006 was a normal
                    work day and his salaried employees and himself would be remunerated for the
                    normal work hours as part of their basic salaries, he is not claiming for the
                    hours that they spent on the move during office hours<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff is also not claiming for the
                    hours spent by the salaried employees and himself on the move during office
                    hours for the other days during the shifting period as it would be difficult to
                    separate exactly how much time they spent on the daily operations from the time
                    they spent on the move during office hours on those days<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The defendants do not take issue with the
                    rates or the method of calculation put forward by the plaintiff; their objection
                    for this head of damages is simply that the plaintiff has not proved these
                    damages. In respect of the manhours for the plaintiff himself, the defendants
                    argued that there was simply no evidence that because the plaintiff had spent
                    time on the move, he was deprived of the opportunity to service his customers as
                    a professional engineer. They also argued that the plaintiff, apart from a bare
                    assertion, has not adduced any evidence, such as drawings or sketch plans, to
                    prove that he had actually done work for the move as he has claimed. They
                    pointed out that ultimately there was simply no record of what the plaintiff did
                    for the 112 hours. In respect of the other staff, though, <em>inter alia</em>, punch cards and their pay slips have been adduced by
                    the plaintiff to prove that the staff had worked over-time during the shifting
                    period, the defendants argued that there was nonetheless no evidence as to how
                    they spent the time allegedly spent on the move, given that the staff were not
                    called by the plaintiff as witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     For the manhours claimed by the plaintiff for
                    himself, I find that there are merits in the defendants’ submissions.
                    No doubt the plaintiff would have to spend time on the move (would this not
                    be so in all cases of breach, where the claimant would arguably have to expend
                    time (which could have been spent elsewhere either for work or leisure) to deal
                    with the inconveniences or problems created by the defendant’s breach),
                    but it does not appear to me that he has actually suffered a pecuniary loss as a
                    result. Notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff charges his customers $200
                    per hour for work done, it should be borne in mind that the plaintiff’s
                    own evidence is that he has not lost any business nor suffered any loss of
                    profits because of the eviction or move. He stated in his supplementary AEIC
                    that he had managed to fulfil all his orders despite the inconveniences caused
                    by the eviction and the move to Changi South premises<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. That is also why the plaintiff is not
                    claiming for any loss of profits. There was no evidence that those 112 hours he
                    allegedly spent on the move would have been spent servicing clients; in fact,
                    the evidence I just pointed out would suggest the contrary. More importantly, I
                    agree with the defendants that there was simply no evidence save for the
                    plaintiff’s own bare assertion that he had spent the 112 hours on the
                    move. Unlike his staff, the plaintiff does not have a punch card that records
                    his work hours. The plaintiff has not adduced any other records or any plans or
                    drawings that he had allegedly spent time coming up with for the move to
                    substantiate his claim. I would therefore disallow the plaintiff’s claim
                    for $22,400.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Turning to the manhours for the staff, punch
                    cards, pay slips and invoices paid to the company who supplied the contract
                    workers have been adduced to prove that the staff had to work over-time during
                    the shifting period and such additional labour costs were incurred. The
                    defendants, however, submitted that there was still no evidence on whether the
                    staff in fact spent those hours on the move, especially since they were not
                    called to give evidence. They contended that this claim was put in merely to
                    inflate the plaintiff’s claim. I disagree as it could be inferred from the
                    punch cards as well as the summary table that the over-time hours were for the
                    shifting period and that the bulk of the hours (especially for the contract
                    workers) were for 23 November 2006, the actual day of the move. The
                    plaintiff has taken the trouble to explain carefully how the figures were
                    arrived at and how, in fairness, he had excluded those office hours spent by the
                    salaried employees on the move to claim only the over-time hours. I am satisfied
                    that the plaintiff has done enough to prove that he has to pay his salaried
                    employees for the over-time hours spent on the move, as well as for the hours
                    spent by his contract workers on the move. I disagree with the defendants that
                    there is a need to call all 22 staff (salaried and contract) to court to give
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     There is one more minor objection I should
                    deal with for the manhours claimed by the plaintiff for his staff. It came up
                    during cross-examination that the plaintiff has yet to pay all the staff the
                    extra salaries they earned for the move. The plaintiff explained that he had
                    reached an agreement with his staff whereby the latter agreed that they would be
                    paid after the plaintiff’s claim against the defendants is concluded in
                    court. In this regard, the defendants submitted in their written submissions
                    that the “alleged cost of the manhours has not even
                        crystallised”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. I do not see this as a hurdle
                    for the plaintiff. The plaintiff has clarified in his written submissions that
                    it is only the plaintiff and the five salaried employees who have yet to been
                    paid<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. The bottomline is that the
                    staff are <em>entitled</em> to the over-time pay. As the
                    plaintiff stated in his submissions, “[t]he obligation to pay
                    exists”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> and it is only “a
                    function of timing and not of the obligation to pay”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. The plaintiff is entitled to recover
                    damages for the unpaid salaries <em>owed</em> to the
                    salaried employees. I will therefore allow the claim of $5,151.95.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Legal costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The last head of damages claimed by the
                    plaintiff is legal costs incurred for the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_a"></a>(a)     $15,099.91 incurred for contesting
                        the eviction; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_55-p2_b"></a>(b)     $2,091.29 incurred for the title searches/conveyancing fees for the
                        Tai Seng premises and the Changi South premises.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The defendants’ objection to the first
                    set of legal costs of $15,099.91 is rather peculiar. Unlike the second set of
                    legal costs, the defendants did not contest that this sum is too remote but that
                    the plaintiff should have taxed the invoice of his solicitors for the costs of
                    $15,099.91<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. In support of this
                    contention, the defendants made reference to the cases of <em>Great Western Railway Company v Fisher</em> [1905]
                    1 Ch 316, <em>Butterworth v Kingsway Motors</em>
                    [1954] 1 WLR 1286 and <em>British Racing Drivers Club
                        Ltd v Hextall Erskine &amp; Co</em> [1996] 3 All ER 667. In
                    respect of the second set of legal costs, they took the position that the
                    plaintiff ought not recover costs in respect of legal work done in relation to
                    the Tai Seng premises given that such a loss was too remote to be recovered as
                    “it [was] not reasonably foreseeable that the [p]laintiff [would] incur
                    more than 1 tranche of legal fees in his search for alternative
                    premises”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     For the first set of legal costs for
                    contesting the eviction, I find that the defendants’ argument is
                    misconceived and the cases cited are distinguishable and unhelpful. In fact, the
                    defendants’ written submissions appear to conflate different principles.
                    Essentially, what the defendants have done is to refer to English cases where a
                    claimant had sought to recover costs he incurred in previous proceedings as
                    damages in the current proceedings against a defendant in two situations,
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_a"></a>(a)     where the claimant had been
                            <em>successful</em> in the previous action and had
                        recovered costs from the unsuccessful party, and he now sought to recover
                        the shortfall between the actual costs incurred and the costs awarded from
                        the defendant whose wrong had been the cause of the previous action;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_57-p2_b"></a>(b)     where the
                        claimant had been <em>unsuccessful</em> in the previous
                        action and had to pay costs to the successful party and his own costs, and
                        he now sought to recover both sets of costs from the defendant whose wrong
                        had been the cause of the previous action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The positions in the United Kingdom for both
                    situations prior to and after 1986 are different given the change to the costs
                    regime made in 1986 to move from necessary costs to reasonable costs (see
                    generally <em>McGregor on Damages</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) at paras 17-003 to 17-019). Without
                    differentiating the two situations and citing cases pre and post 1986, the
                    defendants referred to these cases as supporting the proposition that only taxed
                    costs can be recovered (and hence my remark about conflating the different
                    principles in their submissions). Without going into the details of these cases
                    and the law (and the position in England for situation (b) post 1986 appears to
                    be open and unsettled (see <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at
                    para 17-009)), it would be clear that the present case does not quite fall under
                    either situation. The plaintiff is not strictly speaking a party in
                    SUM 3453/2006 or OS 1106/2002 but had merely intervened at the hearing
                    for the execution of the writ of possession by OCBC. Although he was
                    unsuccessful in resisting the eviction, he did not have to pay the costs for
                    OCBC; in fact, he was awarded $1,000 costs (payable by the defendants) by the
                    Assistant Registrar. On this ground alone, it would be sufficient for me to
                    dismiss the defendants’ argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In my view, it would have be within the
                    contemplation of the parties (from a contract’s perspective) and/or
                    reasonably foreseeable (from a tort’s perspective) (see <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>–<a href="#p1_74">[74]</a> below for the tests of remoteness for contract and tort) in
                    this case that the plaintiff would have to incur legal fees to contest the
                    eviction as a result of the defendants’ breach, and the defendants are not
                    contending otherwise at least in respect of this set of legal costs. The
                    plaintiff should thus be allowed to recover the legal costs he incurred for
                    contesting the eviction. However, the damages awarded for this set of legal
                    costs should rightly take into account the $1,000 the plaintiff was awarded as
                    costs at the hearing of SUM 3453/2006. As such, I will award the plaintiff the
                    sum of $14,099.91 ($15,099.91 - $1,000).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Remoteness of damage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I turn now to consider the issue of remoteness
                    in relation to the second set of legal costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Robertson Quay</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>), the test of remoteness for contract in
                    Singapore is the famous and hallowed rule laid down by Alderson B in <em>Hadley v Baxendale</em> (1854) 9 Exch 341 at 354
                    (“the rule in <em>Hadley</em>”), as restated
                    by Asquith LJ in <em>Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ld v Newman
                        Industries Ld</em> [1949] 2 KB 528. The test is premised on
                    the criterion of “reasonable contemplation” of the parties and
                    comprises of two limbs – damages under the first limb are known as
                    “ordinary damages” which flow naturally from a breach of contract
                    and damages under the second limb are known as “extraordinary
                    damage”, which do not flow naturally from a breach of contract, but
                    rather are due to special circumstances (<em>Robertson
                        Quay</em> at [59]; see also [81]–[82]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the criterion of “reasonable contemplation” applies
                        to both limbs of the rule in <em>Hadley</em>, although
                        a difference exists between its application with respect to each of the two
                        limbs. For the first limb of <em>Hadley</em>, the
                        horizon of contemplation is confined to loss which arises naturally in the
                        usual course of things and which is therefore presumed to have been within
                        the contemplation of the parties. For the second limb of the rule in
                            <em>Hadley</em>… , by reason of the special
                        knowledge possessed by the party who breaches the contract… , the
                        horizon of contemplation is extended to loss that does not arise in the
                        usual course of things (see <em>The Heron II</em> at
                        415–416).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The rationality and functionality of the rule
                    in <em>Hadley</em> was also given elucidation by Andrew
                    Phang JA in <em>Robertson Quay</em>, who gave two main
                    reasons for the rule. First, he explained that the rule in <em>Hadley</em> served as a useful distinction between the rules and
                    principles relating to remoteness in the law of contract and those in tort
                        (<em>Robertson Quay</em> at [71]). Secondly, and more
                    importantly, the rule in <em>Hadley</em> “most
                    appropriately” described the rules relating to remoteness in the context
                    of the law of contract (<em>id</em> at [74]), having regard
                    to the concept that the law of contract, put simply, is about agreement
                        (<em>id</em> at [75]). He explained that save for
                    instances where the contractual parties have made provision for remedies and
                    damages in the event of breach by including a liquidated damages clause in their
                    contract, the parties would not have fixed in advance the type as well as the
                    amount of monetary loss recoverable. The courts would thus have to formulate
                    “default rules” of universal application as to what would be
                    recoverable and what would be too remote to be recoverable, bearing in mind that
                    the parties had the opportunity to communicate with each other in advance and
                    the need to preserve the sanctity of contract (<em>id</em>
                    at [76]–[79]). The two limbs in the rule in <em>Hadley</em> thus provided such default rules that were both just and
                    fair.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Shortly after <em>Robertson
                        Quay</em> was decided by the Singapore Court of Appeal, the House of
                    Lords reconsidered the rules of remoteness for contract in <em>Transfield Shipping Inc v Mercator Shipping Inc</em> [2009]
                    1 AC 61 (“<em>The Achilleas</em>”)
                    and appeared to favour a shift from the orthodox approach premised on the
                    reasonable contemplation of the contracting parties (as embodied in the rule in
                        <em>Hadley</em>) to one premised on the assumption of
                    responsibility, <em>ie</em>, a contractual party is only
                    liable for such losses that he has assumed responsibility. Such a view was put
                    forward most strongly by Lord Hoffmann who held at [12]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It seems to me logical to found liability for damages
                            upon the intention of the parties (objectively ascertained) because all
                            contractual liability is voluntarily undertaken</em>. It must be
                        in principle wrong to hold someone liable for risks for which the people
                        entering into such a contract in their particular market, would not
                        reasonably be considered to have undertaken. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     
          <em>The Achilleas</em>
                    was a case involving a claim by the owners of a vessel for loss of profits
                    against a charterer for the <em>entire</em> duration of a
                    follow-on charter caused by the late redelivery of the vessel. The owners had
                    fixed the follow-on charter at a lucrative rate. Due to the delay in redelivery
                    by the charterer, they had to reduce the rate in consideration of an extension
                    of the cancellation date in the follow-on charter and in the light of a sudden
                    fall in the market rate. The majority of the arbitrators awarded the loss of
                    profits claimed on the basis that such loss arose naturally from the breach of
                    contract, despite having found that there was a general understanding in the
                    shipping market that a charterer would only be liable for damages for the
                        <em>period of late delivery</em>. The
                    arbitrators’ decision was upheld by both the first instance judge and the
                    Court of Appeal but was reversed by the House of Lords. Lord Hoffmann held that,
                    if one considered what the parties, contracting against the background of market
                    expectations found by the arbitrators, would have considered the extent of the
                    liability they were undertaking, it would be clear that the charterer could not
                    have assumed responsibility for such loss of profits on the follow-on charter
                        (<em>The Achilleas</em> at [23]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It would appear that the approach based on the
                    assumption of responsibility would be a more stringent approach, given that a
                    claimant would not recover, even for losses that were not unlikely to occur in
                    the usual course of things, if the defendant cannot reasonably be regarded as
                    having assumed responsibility for losses of the kind suffered (<em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) (“<em>Chitty</em>”)
                    in vol 1 at para 26-100A).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Interestingly, the difference in approach
                    taken by our Court of Appeal in <em>Robertson Quay</em> and
                    the House of Lords in <em>The Achilleas</em> were
                    considered recently in the local context by AR Teo Guan Siew in <em>Chee Peng Kwan v Toh Swee Hwee Thomas</em> [2009]
                    SGHC 141 (“<em>Chee Peng Kwan</em>”) and
                    Goh Yihan in a case commentary on <em>Robertson Quay</em>
                    (see (2009) 9 OUCLJ 101 (“Goh’s commentary”)).
                    Both, in my view, provided invaluable insight on this issue. In his judgment (at
                    [38]–[39]), AR Teo pointed out that the fundamental difference between the
                    two approaches is essentially a point of principle – the Court of Appeal
                    saw the rule of remoteness as an <em>external</em> rule of
                    law imposed upon the parties to every contract in default of express provision
                    to the contrary, while the House of Lords saw the rule of remoteness as a
                        <em>prima facie</em> assumption about what the parties
                    may be taken to have intended to assume responsibility for, but rebuttable in
                    cases where the context and circumstances show that a party would not reasonably
                    have been regarded as assuming responsibility for such losses (see also
                        <em>The Achilleas</em> at [9] <em>per</em> Lord Hoffmann). Goh opined that, on a closer examination,
                    the two approaches may not be that different if the Court of Appeal’s
                    approach is seen as providing default rules applicable in the absence of
                    agreement, <em>accompanied</em> by an <em>implicit</em> allocation of risk and responsibility (see Goh’s
                    commentary at pp 105–106). However, he was of the view there were still
                    “practical differences in how [the] conceptual understanding [of
                    remoteness principles] is to be given effect” (Goh’s commentary at
                    p 107). In this regard, he said (at p 107):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">While the Court of Appeal uses allocation of risk and responsibility as a
                        justification for the rule in <em>Hadley v
                            Baxendale</em>, it is not imported as a requirement. Indeed, the
                        mere requirement of knowledge (actual or imputed), and the equation of
                        knowledge with liability, would mean that the justificatory reason of
                        agreement is imputed instead of actual. There is no need for actual
                        agreement, even implied, to bear such loss. On the other hand, the approach
                        of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope in <em>The
                            Achilleas</em> is to bring the justification to bear in terms of
                        the requirement; what needs to be objectively ascertained is whether there
                        is really assumption of responsibility for the type of loss in question by
                        the contracting parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Leaving aside the difference in principle
                    between the two, it would not be wrong to say that at the heart of both
                    approaches is still the ultimate desire to provide for the recoverability of
                    damages for breach of contract in a way that gives the <em>best</em> effect to the concept of a contract as an <em>agreement</em>. We have seen the emphasis placed by Lord
                    Hoffmann on discerning the intention of the parties so as to determine
                    effectively the losses the parties have <em>agreed</em> to
                    undertake for their breach (see <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> above).
                    Likewise, Andrew Phang JA made it clear that the rule in <em>Hadley</em> should continue to be applied by the courts because
                    “the two limbs of the rule in <em>Hadley</em> are
                    wholly consistent with – and, in fact, give effect to – the concept
                    of contract as an <em>agreement</em>” (<em>Robertson Quay</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [83]). On a practical note, it would be
                    more likely than not that both approaches will lead to the same outcome in most
                    cases. The losses which are within the reasonable contemplation of the parties
                    will most probable than not coincide with the losses that the parties can be
                    taken to have assumed responsibility on an <em>objective</em> assessment of their intention (in Lord
                    Hoffmann’s own words, the parties’ intention is to be
                        “<em>objectively</em> ascertained”
                    [emphasis added] (see <a href="#p1_63">[63]</a> above)). Lord
                    Hoffmann himself had in fact stressed that departure from the orthodox rule
                    based on individual circumstances will be unusual (<em>The
                        Achilleas</em> ([63] <em>supra</em>) at [11]; see
                    also Edwin Peel, “Remoteness Revisited” (2009) 125 LQR 6
                    (“Peel”) at p 9). Thus, even on the facts of <em>The Achilleas</em>, Lord Hoffmann opined that the same
                    outcome could perhaps have been reached on the orthodox approach, contrary to
                    what the arbitrators, the first instance judge and the Court of Appeal had
                    thought (at [24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The findings of the majority arbitrators shows that they considered their
                        decision to be contrary to what would have been the expectations of the
                        parties, but dictated by the rules in <em>Hadley v
                            Baxendale</em> as explained in <em>The Heron
                            II</em> [1969] 1 AC 350 . <em>But in
                            my opinion these rules are not so inflexible; they are intended to give
                            effect to the presumed intentions of the parties and not to contradict
                            them</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Likewise, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe allowed the appeal on grounds
                    that were reminiscent of both approaches (see <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> at [69], [86] and [87]). Two other members of the
                    House, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry and Baroness Hale of Richmond (who agreed with
                    Lord Rodger’s reasons), in fact decided on the orthodox approach (see
                        <em>The Achilleas</em> at [52], [60] and [93]). Given
                    that the two approaches can be said to share a common ultimate aim and the
                    likelihood of similar outcomes in most cases, it could perhaps be said that the
                    two are not wholly irreconcilable (a point similarly shared by Goh), though
                    admittedly the point of principle as pointed out by AR Teo
                remains.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Turning then to this more difficult question
                    of principle, should the rule of remoteness be seen as an external rule of law
                    or an assumption of responsibility? The former, in my view, would appear to
                    accord more to the <em>realities</em> of the contracting
                    process. It would not be wrong to say that for contracts where there is an
                    absence of express provisions providing for breach and/or remedies, the parties
                    usually do not apply their minds during the formation of the contract to what is
                    to happen in the event of a breach and what kind of losses the party in breach
                    should be liable (see <em>McGregor on Damages</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) at para 6-171 and Andrew Robertson,
                    “The Basis of the Remoteness Rule in Contract” (2008)
                    28 Legal Studies 172 (“Robertson”) at p 176 where
                    it is cogently argued that parties usually contemplate performance rather than
                    breach). For if they have done so, they would in the ordinary course of things
                    have made express provisions for such event in their contract. It has thus been
                    observed that discerning the intention of the parties under the assumption of
                    risk approach may be an <em>artificial</em> exercise since
                    there would usually be little or no evidence of the parties having thought about
                    the risks they were accepting (Peel at p 11 and <em>Chee
                        Peng Kwan</em> at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>; see also
                    Robertson at pp 185–186 and 196). It follows that there are limits to the
                    extent that it is feasible to determine liability by reference to an assumption
                    of responsibility, and such an approach may engender more uncertainties than a
                    simple rule that the party in breach is liable for all losses that are
                    sufficiently likely to occur in the usual course of things, or whose likelihood
                    has been brought home to him when the contract was made, unless he has validly
                    excluded or restricted his liability (see <em>Chitty</em>
                    at para 26-100G and <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at para
                    6-171).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The assumption of responsibility approach
                    which gives primacy to the intention of parties may also not be entirely
                    consonant with the accepted concept that the rule of remoteness is essentially
                    one of <em>policy</em>. As pointed by VK Rajah JA in
                        <em>Sunny Metal &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming
                        Eric</em> [2007] 3 SLR 782 (“<em>Sunny
                        Metal (CA)</em>”) (at [51] and [56]), the rule of remoteness
                    “[embodies] legal principles strictly founded upon reasons of
                    policy”, where legal policy and accepted value judgment must be the
                    “final arbiter” on what is the right balance to strike between a
                    claimant’s right to full compensation and indeterminate liability for a
                    defendant (see also <em>McGregor on Damages</em> at paras
                    4-023, 6-080 and 6-155, Edwin Peel, <em>Treitel on the Law of
                        Contract</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) at para 20-082 and
                        <em>Chee Peng Kwan</em> at [40]). From a policy
                    perspective, it may be questionable why the courts should provide additional
                    protection to defendants in <em>all</em> cases by imposing
                    a higher threshold in insisting that a defendant should only be liable for
                    losses that he could be said to have reasonably assumed responsibility (see also
                        <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a> above). As noted by Lord Reid in
                        <em>The Heron II</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) (at 385–386) and Andrew Phang JA
                    in <em>Robertson Quay</em> (at [71] and [75]–[76]),
                    parties in a contract case, unlike those in tort, have the opportunity to direct
                    each other’s attention to the unusual risks and either can take extra
                    precautions to safeguard his position. Leaving aside the more unusual cases like
                        <em>The Achilleas</em>, why should the courts provide
                    additional protection in most other cases then (see <em>Chitty</em> at para 26-100G)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Lastly, it should perhaps be noted that
                    insofar as the approach of assumption of responsibility is concerned, the House
                    of Lords in <em>The Achilleas</em> does not appear to be
                    unanimous on this point. Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope of Craighead were the only
                    two in favour of the assumption of responsibility approach and decided on that
                    basis. As pointed out, Lord Walker seemed to have decided on grounds embodying
                    both approaches, while Lord Rodger and Baroness Hale simply decided on the
                    orthodox approach and declined to express any firm views on Lord
                    Hoffmann’s approach. It is thus not surprising that the learned authors of
                        <em>McGregor on Damages</em> have argued that that view
                    of Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope did not command a clear majority so as to make it
                    into the <em>ratio decidendi</em> of <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> (at para 6-173). The assumption of responsibility
                    approach also appears to run precariously close to the implied term approach
                    that was previously rejected by the House of Lords in <em>The
                        Heron II</em> (at 422 <em>per</em> Lord UpJohn).
                    What then can one make of the decision of the House of Lords in <em>The Achilleas</em>? In the recent case of <em>Supershield Limited v Siemens Building Technologies Fe Limited</em>
                    [2010] EWCA Civ 7, Lord Justice Toulson, delivering the judgment of the
                    English Court of Appeal, had this to say about the effect of <em>The Achilleas</em> on the law of remoteness in contract (at
                    [43]):</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hadley v Baxendale remains a standard rule but it has been
                    rationalised on the basis that it reflects the expectation to be imputed to the
                    parties in the ordinary case, i.e. that a contract breaker should ordinarily be
                    liable to the other party for damage resulting from his breach if, but only if,
                    at the time of making the contract a reasonable person in his shoes would have
                    had damage of that kind in mind as not unlikely to result from a breach.
                    However, …Transfield Shipping [ie, <em>The
                        Achilleas</em>] [is] authority that there may be cases where the
                    court, on examining the contract and the commercial background, decides that the
                    standard approach would not reflect the expectation or intention reasonably to
                    be imputed to the parties. In those two instances the effect was exclusionary;
                    the contract breaker was held not to be liable for loss which resulted from its
                    breach although some loss of the kind was not unlikely. But logically the same
                    principle may have an inclusionary effect. If, on the proper analysis of the
                    contract against its commercial background, the loss was within the scope of the
                    duty, it cannot be regarded as too remote, even if it would not have occurred in
                    ordinary circumstances. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, the learned
                    authors of <em>Chitty</em> ([65] <em>supra</em>) are also in favour of confining <em>The
                        Achilleas</em> to only exceptional circumstances (see
                    para 26-100G). All that can be safely said for now is that it remains to be
                    seen if the assumption of responsibility would become the governing rule for
                    remoteness in contract in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Insofar as Singapore is concerned, the law
                    since <em>Robertson Quay</em> has been settled, albeit the
                    Court of Appeal has yet to have the opportunity to consider the case of
                        <em>The Achilleas</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Turning now to the test of remoteness in tort,
                    the test is simply one based on reasonable foreseeability (see in particular the
                    classic Privy Council decision of <em>Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd
                        v Morts Dock &amp; Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound)</em> [1961]
                    1 AC 388, <em>Ho Soo Fong v Standard Chartered
                        Bank</em> [2007] 2 SLR 181 at [39] and <em>Sunny Metal (CA)</em> at [56]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     As alluded to above (at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>), the test in tort is broader than that in
                    contract. The difference between the two tests has been explained in <em>Sunny Metal (HC)</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [138] (although the decision of the High
                    Court was reversed, this point was not disapproved by the Court of
                    Appeal):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear that, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, the
                            <em>tortious</em> principles of remoteness are
                            <em>broader</em> than the corresponding <em>contractual</em> principles. Indeed, it would conduce
                        towards more clarity if the phrase “reasonable <em>foreseeablity</em>” was utilised to describe the <em>tortious</em> principles of remoteness, and the phrase
                        “reasonable <em>contemplation</em>” was
                        utilised to describe the <em>contractual</em>
                        principles of remoteness. Put simply, the tortious principles of remoteness
                        are broader and more “generous” simply because, apart from
                        situations where there is <em>concurrent</em> liability
                        in both tort and contract, a situation involving tortuous liability would
                        relate to parties who have had <em>no prior relationship with
                            each other</em>. This is, of course, in <em>stark
                            contrast</em> to a situation involving <em>contractual</em> liability where there would, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, be an existing (contractual) relationship
                        between the parties. In such a situation, the parties would be expected to
                        provide for any reasonable contingencies that might be expected to arise. In
                        any event, it would be easier to <em>infer</em> what
                        the parties might have provided even if no express term covered the
                        contingency concerned (for example, a term could possibly be <em>implied</em> either “in fact” or “in
                        law”). It is only logical and commonsensical, therefore, that
                            <em>stricter</em> rules and principles of
                        remoteness obtain in the contractual – as opposed to the tortious
                        – sphere. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It has been held by the High Court that where
                    there is concurrent liability in both contract and tort that arises out of legal
                    duties owed in both contract and tort, the stricter rules and principles of
                    remoteness in contract ought to prevail (<em>Sunny Metal
                        (HC)</em> at [139]–[140]). The present case does not strictly
                    concern concurrent liability/duties as that envisaged by the High Court in
                        <em>Sunny Metal (HC)</em>, given that there are two
                    separate judgments here, one in contract against Mintwell and the other in tort
                    against Mintwell and Seah (and the latter is for misrepresentation). However, it
                    can be safely said that if the stricter test of remoteness in contract is
                    satisfied in this case, then the lower test of remoteness in tort should also be
                    satisfied given that both judgments arose out of the same facts. The same,
                    however, cannot be said for the converse situation. Given the difference in the
                    tests between remoteness in contract and tort, it is plausible that there may be
                    a situation where a certain loss is too remote to be recovered under the
                    judgment in contract, but not so under the judgment in tort. Fortunately, I am
                    of the view that no such situation arises in the present case (for the reasons
                    given below). In any event, I also note that the parties appear to be in
                    agreement that the rules of remoteness in contract should govern and they have
                    submitted on that basis with no reference to the rules in tort<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. I turn now to the application of the law to
                    the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Generally, courts have allowed a claimant to
                    recover legal costs incurred as a result of a defendant’s breach, be it in
                    contract or tort (see generally <em>McGregor on
                        Damages</em> (<a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> <em>supra</em>) at paras 2-031 and 2-053). The cases cited
                    by the defendants in respect of the legal costs of contesting the eviction
                    (though distinguishable) (see <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> above)
                    also show that legal costs incurred by a claimant in an earlier proceedings
                    brought about by a defendant’s breach may be recoverable in law as
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Turning to the second set of legal costs of
                    $2,091.29, I am of the view that the legal costs incurred on the Changi South
                    premises are recoverable under the first limb of the rule in <em>Hadley</em>. It would have been within the reasonable contemplation
                    of both parties that the plaintiff would in the ordinary course of things have
                    to incur another set of conveyancing fees if he had to give up the premises at
                    Mintwell Building prematurely and to take up alternative premises for his
                    business. Such damage would have flowed naturally from the defendants’
                    breach. I note that the defendants have themselves acknowledged that such costs
                    would not be too remote to be recoverable, having taken the position that the
                    plaintiff is entitled to one tranche of legal fees in his search for alternative
                    premises (see <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     However, the same cannot be said for the legal
                    costs incurred for the Tai Seng premises. I do not think it would have been
                    within the contemplation of the parties that the plaintiff would actually incur
                    more than one set of legal fees for title search/conveyancing. When they entered
                    into the leases, neither party could have reasonably thought that the breach in
                    the present case would have entitled the plaintiff to run checks on all
                    alternative premises that he considered but has yet to make up his mind whether
                    to take up or not and to recover all legal costs incurred in the process. Such
                    legal costs would be too remote to be recoverable under the first limb of the
                    rule in <em>Hadley</em>. There are also no special
                    circumstances that would justify the application of the second limb of the rule
                    in <em>Hadley</em> in this case. The plaintiff should
                    therefore recover no more than one set of legal costs for the alternative
                    premises. Leaving aside disbursements, I note that the invoice rendered by the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors unfortunately do not show the breakdown of the
                    legal costs incurred in respect of the Tai Seng premises and the Changi South
                    premises but only a general figure of $1,700 (without GST) for work done in
                    relation to both premises<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. In
                    these premises, I would only award the plaintiff half the amount claimed,
