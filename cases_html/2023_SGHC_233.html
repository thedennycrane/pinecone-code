In August 2017, Angeline accompanied Khoo to view the show flat for T-Space whereupon he expressed his interest in purchasing a unit there.

Lim claims that after Angeline spoke to Khoo, Khoo agreed to do so purely to help Lim obtain the bank loan but Khoo would not be responsible to contribute to the purchase of the Property. Hence, Lim and Khoo agreed to hold the Property as tenants-in-common in the share of 99 to 1 respectively.

Alternatively, a presumption of resulting trust arises such that they hold the Property as tenants-in-common in shares proportionate to their respective contributions towards the acquisition of the Property.

I understand Khoo’s submission to mean that the beneficial ownership of the Property should follow its legal ownership, and that there is no reason to depart from this. If so, in the present case, the purported common intention between the parties would be given effect to in equity through a common intention constructive trust to establish the parties’ respective beneficial shares in the Property. Therefore, Khoo essentially relies on a common intention constructive trust, in the form of an agreement with Lim as to their beneficial interest; whilst Lim eventually relies on a presumed resulting trust. Both parties further submit that if they are unable to prove their respective claims of an agreement or common intention on the shareholding of the Property, the applicable legal test in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) (see [16] below) should be adopted to determine the beneficial interest in the Property.

The common intention (which may` subsist either at, or subsequent to, the time the property was acquired) can be express or inferred, and of which there must be sufficient and compelling evidence. The court cannot impute a common intention to the parties where one does not exist. However, in the absence of any evidence of a common intention between the parties as to how the beneficial interest in a property is to be held, the resulting trust remains the default analysis (<span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel</span> at [83], citing <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [158], [160(b)] and [160(f)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Where parties have contributed unequal amounts towards the purchase price of a property and who have not executed a declaration of trust as to how the beneficial interest in it is to be apportioned, it is not uncommon for claims of both a common intention constructive trust and a resulting trust to be made. The general approach in determining how the beneficial interest in a property is to be apportioned was laid down in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> (at [160]) which, for the purposes of this suit, sets out the framework as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) If there is sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property, the parties are presumed to hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the presumption of a resulting trust arises).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Despite (a) above, if there is sufficient evidence of a common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in the property in a proportion different from that set out at (a), the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) However, if there is insufficient evidence to establish a resulting trust as in (a) above or a common intention constructive trust as in (b) above, then the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in the manner in which they hold the legal interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Whilst the approach in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> starts with analysing the existence of a presumed resulting trust, before examining if a common intention constructive trust had arisen, it is not the case that the analysis must always proceed in this sequence. This is especially if the parties put forward their foremost claim as premised on a common intention constructive trust and which, if proved, would under the <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> framework negate the presumed resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As Khoo relies on a purported oral agreement that the Property would be held in equal shares with Lim, I begin by considering whether there was such an agreement and the common intention constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Khoo’s claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Khoo’s case, as attested to in his AEIC, is premised on an oral agreement with Lim to jointly purchase the Property, on the understanding that they would both contribute to, and own, the Property in equal proportions (the “Oral Agreement”) (see [3] above).

Khoo claims he did not agree to this proposal at that time, and that Lim followed up on his proposal with Khoo several times. However, Khoo stated in court that they had not discussed the parties’ respective financial contributions in relation to the purchase of a property at these meetings or conversations. In court, Khoo claimed that just before they started looking for a property together (which would have been after at least three conversations on the topic of jointly purchasing a property), they had then spoken about both parties making financial contributions towards its purchase in equal shares.

</div> However, Khoo has not called either the lawyer or the secretary to corroborate his case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In any event, the Manner of Holding Document does not support the alleged common intention as claimed by Khoo. The document, which Khoo claims was read and interpreted in Mandarin to the parties, clearly states that tenants-in-common hold distinct and separate shares in the property with no right of survivorship; whilst each joint tenant in a joint tenancy holds the whole property with a right of survivorship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 However, that the right of survivorship operates upon the demise of either party, does not mean that the parties evinced a common intention to share the Property beneficially in equal shares, while they were still alive. The passage from <span class="font-italic">Neo Hui Ling v Ang Ah Siew</span> [2012] 2 SLR 831 at [39] is instructive:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The intended consequences of the rule of survivorship operate after the death of one tenant, and say nothing whatsoever about what should happen while both tenants are alive. This is not to say that the rule of survivorship is incompatible with an intention that the joint tenants should also hold the property beneficially during their lifetimes. What this means is that the rule of survivorship sheds no light on the tenants’ intentions as to their beneficial interests in the property while both are alive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Hence, where co-owners have contributed unequal amounts towards the purchase price of a property, the apportionment of the beneficial interest in the property upon the death of one party should still be determined according to the framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>. In sum, the parties’ alleged decision to be legal joint tenants is thus equivocal at best. It is also unlikely that they had intended that one party would own the Property wholly on the other party’s demise. Likewise, that both parties are jointly and severally liable for the whole sum of the outstanding mortgage or the Loan also does not support a common intention between them to hold the beneficial interest of the Property in equal shares. Khoo and Lim were merely friends, who had known each other for less than two years before they purchased the Property. That militates against an inference of a common intention between them to hold the beneficial interest in equal shares when they have contributed unequal amounts towards the purchase of the Property or its mortgage repayments.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ respective financial contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Importantly, the documentary evidence shows that Lim contributed significantly more to the purchase of the Property. In this regard, the court may take into account the parties’ subsequent conduct in determining whether there is a common intention, with the appropriate weight to be given to such evidence (<span class="font-italic">Ta</span><span class="font-italic">n Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan and another and other appeals </span>[2017] 1 SLR 654 at [110]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Lim contributed significantly more to the purchase of the Property even before the mortgage repayments were first made in November 2017 and before the TOP was obtained on 26 June 2018. I examine the parties’ respective contributions up to December 2017 (including Khoo’s contribution in terms of repaying the monthly mortgage repayments in November and December 2017) by way of illustration. I use this timeframe to assess the parties’ respective contributions as Khoo alleges that the parties agreed that his half share of the contribution towards the purchase of the Property, after Khoo had made the first two mortgage repayments, would be offset by imputing rent of the Property to Lim. As Lim had sole use of the Property, Khoo claims that they thus agreed that his 50% contribution to the purchase of the Property was to grant Lim sole use of it without collecting rent from Lim, whilst Lim’s 50% contribution to the purchase of the Property was to pay the monthly mortgage repayments (the “Rental Agreement”).

It was after the Conversation that Lim started paying the monthly mortgage repayments from January 2018, and Khoo’s half share contribution to the same was to allow Lim sole use of the Property without collecting rent from him.

She admitted that she did not know for a fact whether Khoo had transferred money to Melvin and that she was merely guessing on the basis that Lim (as she claimed) did not know how to do an interbank transfer. Angeline’s evidence (that Khoo paid Melvin directly) is also at odds with Khoo’s claim that he gave her the money. Melvin was also not called as a witness to corroborate Angeline’s testimony, and more importantly, Khoo’s bank statements for the contemporaneous period did not record any such transfer from his bank account to Melvin’s account.

Between September to December 2017, Khoo purchased other items and, together with the Buddhist statues, he owed Lim around $63,000 in total. On around 16 September 2017, Khoo repaid Lim $20,000. I have earlier found this $20,000 payment by Khoo was for goods purchased from the Shop (see [43] above). Lim claims that Khoo thus owed $43,000 and Khoo repaid: (a) $20,000 on around 5 July 2018, upon Lim’s request, to a POSB Bank account belonging to Mr Winston Fong (“Winston”), who was Lim’s business associate; and (b) $23,000 via the set-off at [86] above.

On the contrary, I find that it was Lim who contributed $22,439.45 towards the Property (for the items listed at [85] above), by handing Khoo money for the six cheques issued. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1) "></span><span class="font-italic">$20,000 transferred by Khoo on 6 July 2018</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Khoo claims that on one occasion, Lim had requested for a rather large sum of money from Khoo, and Khoo suggested depositing cash into Lim’s bank account. Lim then sent Khoo a WhatsApp message on 5 July 2018 to say, “Good morning Towkay. You can make transfer to my Posb acc. 146-xxxxx-0” (the “Message”). Hence, on 6 July 2018, Khoo made a cash deposit of $20,000 to that account (the “$20,000 Transfer”). It is undisputed that the POSB Bank account was Winston’s bank account (see [87] above).

However, I find there is insufficient evidence to support Lim’s claim that the $20,000 Transfer was a partial discharge of Khoo’s debt to him. Even if I accept that Khoo owed him some money for purchases of items from the Shop, or that the 20/8/17 Invoice was genuine, there is no evidence of a link between the 20/8/17 Invoice and the $20,000 Transfer made on 6 July 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 That said, I find that Khoo is unable to show the purpose of handing Lim the $20,000 pertained to the Property and particularly for its acquisition.

</div> Still, Lim did not refute Khoo’s claim of an equal share in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 It was not until Khoo commenced this suit and served the court papers on Lim on 12 October 2021 that Lim then emailed Khoo on 18 October 2021 to state, for the first time, that Khoo’s shares were “nominated shares”, which Khoo promptly rebutted via NLC’s letter on 19 October 2021. Lim then responded on 25 October 2021 to claim, for the first time, that the parties had verbally agreed that the Property would be held by them as tenants-in-common with 1% share to Khoo and 99% share to Lim.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Lim’s AEIC at [68]–[71]; Khoo’s AEIC at [103]–[105]; 3AB 1023 and 1026–1028.</div>
</div>

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Lim’s belated claims, of Khoo holding his share as a nominee or that Khoo’s beneficial shareholding in the Property was merely 1%, all expressed only after Khoo had commenced court proceedings, militate against the existence of the Alternative Agreement. In as much as I have found WKF’s 20/10/20 Letter to be self-serving for Khoo and does not support Khoo’s claim of the Oral Agreement, Lim’s belated responses also do not assist his claim of there being an Alternative Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on Lim’s claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In sum, I find that Lim has also failed to prove his claim of the Alternative Agreement or a presumed resulting trust wholly in his favour. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Computation of parties’ respective financial contributions to the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In summary, I reject both parties’ claims and find there is insufficient evidence of a common intention that the parties held the beneficial interest in the Property in the proportions as Khoo or Lim claims. In this regard, I find both parties’ evidence to be far from satisfactory in relation to what transpired when they decided to purchase the Property together. Their respective assertions to have given moneys (especially in cash) to the other to discharge the purchase price were also sorely lacking in supporting evidence, although they could have easily kept a contemporaneous record (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, by obtaining a written acknowledgement or by a simple WhatsApp message) especially given the substantial sums which purportedly changed hands. It is also unbelievable that Khoo relied on Lim to keep records of payments that he purportedly made to Lim for the Property, as he claimed (see [41] above), without more.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 As there is sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the Property, it will be presumed that they hold the beneficial interest in the Property in proportion to their respective contributions as such. At this juncture, I discuss the types of contributions that can be considered for the purposes of determining the parties’ respective shares under a resulting trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 First, any progress payment towards the purchase price of the Property (including the 5% booking fee and 15% of the purchase price paid on execution of the SPA) would, in my view, constitute direct contributions to the purchase price for the purposes of computing the parties’ beneficial interest in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Second, there is no reason why ancillary costs of purchasing the Property (such as GST, stamp duty, legal fees and survey fees) should not be taken into account in determining the parties’ beneficial interest in the Property under a resulting trust. In <span class="font-italic">Tay Yak Ping and another v Tay Nguang Kee Serene</span> [2022] 2 SLR 641 (“<span class="font-italic">Tay Yak Ping</span>”) at [68], the court opined that it appeared to be “at least arguable that … monetary contributions towards stamp duty <span class="font-italic">should</span> be included” [emphasis in original]. Referring to <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] AC 669 at 708, the court in <span class="font-italic">Tay Yak Ping</span> highlighted that the classic description of a purchase money resulting trust refers to a presumption of resulting trust arising where one party “pays (wholly or in part) <span class="font-italic">for the purchase of property</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>which is vested either in [the other party] alone or in the joint names of [both parties]” [emphasis in original]. On this formulation of the doctrine, a resulting trust analysis should be broad enough to encompass not just the purchase price of the property, but also the stamp duty payable on the purchase of the property. The court in <span class="font-italic">Tay Yak Ping</span> also found persuasive McLelland J’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Currie v Hamilton </span>[1984] 1 NSWLR 687 (“<span class="font-italic">Currie</span>”) at 691A that “what is significant is the cost to the purchasers rather than the benefit to the vendor … [such that] it is the aggregate cost rather than the mere purchase price that should form the basis of the calculation” (at [63] and [68]). In <span class="font-italic">Currie</span>, the court took into account stamp duty, legal costs, bank charges and registration fees in calculating the total cost of acquisition of the property, when determining the parties’ beneficial shares in the property under a resulting trust analysis (at 689C–689G and 693C). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Whilst <span class="font-italic">Tay Yak Ping</span> did not decide the issue, I hold that such ancillary costs of purchasing a property should be included in determining the parties’ respective beneficial interest under a resulting trust. As the court in <span class="font-italic">Tay Yak Ping </span>added (at [68]), “it is often fortuitous whether the money of one person or another is used to pay the purchase price or the stamp duty (or even the legal expenses)” and that “[the] broader approach may also commend itself to the practical importance of this issue bearing in mind the stamp duty regime in Singapore.” In my view, it would be unfair to the party bearing the ancillary costs if the court were only to consider strictly the purchase price of the property without giving any benefit to the ancillary costs related to its purchase, when determining the parties’ respective beneficial shares in the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Third, I consider whether renovations to the Property (which it is undisputed were borne by Lim) should be taken into account. In <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence and another</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 108 (“<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>”) at [126], the Court of Appeal recognised that payments made towards the renovation of the property could be considered as contributions towards the purchase price if such renovations were carried out closely after the purchase of the property and increased the value of the property. However, in the present case, there is no evidence to show that the renovations increased the value of the Property. Additionally, the renovations were done solely for Lim’s benefit, for the purposes of his Shop and Temple. Hence, I find that the renovation costs borne by Lim should not be included in determining the parties’ respective beneficial shares in the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117  Fourth, I deal with miscellaneous expenses such as payments for utilities, monthly maintenance, contributions to the sinking fund and the fire insurance premium, all of which were paid by Lim. I am of the view that these should not be taken into account when determining the parties’ beneficial interest in the Property. These expenses were not for the purpose of or necessary to the purchase of<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Property, but rather for maintaining the Property after its acquisition. Also, there is no evidence that such expenses increased the value of the Property. In this regard, I reiterate that Lim had the benefit of the entire Property after the TOP was obtained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Last, I deal with mortgage contributions. A resulting trust crystallises at the time the property is acquired. As such, the extent of the beneficial interest of the parties where a resulting arises (including a presumed resulting trust) must be determined at the time when the property was purchased and the trust created. Because of the liability assumed by a mortgagor in the case where money is borrowed by him to be used for the purchase of the property, he is treated as having provided the proportion of the purchase price attributable to the monies so borrowed. Hence, subsequent payments of mortgage instalments are not to be regarded as a direct contribution to the purchase price of the property, unless made on the basis of a prior agreement entered into when the mortgage was taken out (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [112]–[113] and [115]–[116], citing <span class="font-italic">Andrew Curley v Nicola Parkes</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 1515 (“<span class="font-italic">Curley</span>”) at [14]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In the present case, the starting point is that both Khoo and Lim as mortgagors of the Property are to be taken as having contributed equal amounts of the housing loan towards the purchase price of the Property, since they assumed liability for the loan jointly (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [119]). I find there to be no evidence to show any prior agreement between the parties (at the time of acquiring the Property or even when the mortgage was taken out) as to how the purchase price of the Property would be paid or who would repay the mortgage instalments. I have already found there to be insufficient evidence of the purported Rental Agreement. I have also rejected Lim’s claim that Khoo was merely joined as an owner of the Property for Lim to obtain bank financing and that the agreement at the outset was that Lim would be responsible for discharging the purchase price of the Property entirely. Hence, in the absence of an agreement as to the ultimate source of funds for the purchase of the Property, the payment of the mortgage instalments subsequent to its initial acquisition should not give rise to any beneficial interest by way of a resulting trust (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> at [117]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 That said, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> (at [55]–[56]) considered whether the position as stated in <span class="font-italic">Curley</span>, and applied in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> (at [118] above), ought to be relaxed to take into account the realities of mortgage repayments and to invoke equitable accounting “in a suitable case” as a possible mechanism for retrospectively adjusting (after the date of acquisition of the property) the parties’ respective shares of the beneficial interest in a manner consistent with the resulting trust analysis. In my view, it is not suitable or appropriate in the present case to make such an adjustment. Although Khoo made only the first two monthly mortgage repayments and Lim has been making the monthly mortgage repayments thereafter, Lim has had sole use of the Property since the TOP was issued to the exclusion of Khoo, and hence the latter has not enjoyed any benefit from the Property. To make any adjustments in Lim’s favour (by taking into account his contributions to the monthly mortgage repayments) would be unfair to Khoo.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ respective contributions to the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 With all the above considerations in mind, I now come to apportion the beneficial interest between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I find the following contributions by Khoo pertaining to the Property (amounting to $13,696) are to be considered in determining his share of the beneficial interest in the Property on a presumed resulting trust:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $5,121 comprising two cheques issued by Khoo for GST payable on a progress payment for the Property and for CLC’s legal fees and disbursements (see [36] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $1,225 being 50% of the cheque issued by Melvin for GST payable on a progress payment for the Property (see [78] and [82] above); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) $7,350 being a cheque issued by Khoo for GST payable on a progress payment for the Property (see [83] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I find the following contributions by Lim pertaining to the Property (amounting to $191,451.78) are to be considered in determining his share of the beneficial interest in the Property on a presumed resulting trust:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $165,400 comprising four cheques issued by Lim for the first 20% of the purchase price of the Property, GST payable on the purchase price and stamp duty (see [31] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $4,900 being a cheque issued by Lim for GST payable on a progress payment for the Property (see [51] above);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) $1,225 being 50% of the cheque issued by Melvin for GST on a progress payment for the Property (see [78] and [82] above); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) $19,926.78 comprising four cheques issued by Khoo (see [85(a)]–[85(d)] above) but which Lim effectively made the payments. In this regard, I disregard the cheques of 10 July 2018 for $500 and $2,012.67 (see [85(e)]–[85(f)] above), which do not relate to the purchase of the Property but towards its subsequent maintenance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 From the above, the total amount to be regarded as contributions to the purchase of the Property is $765,147.78, comprising: (a) $13,696 as Khoo’s direct contributions; (b) $191,451.78 as Lim’s direct contributions; and (c) the $560,000 Loan taken from OCBC Bank, which I am of the view should be attributed equally to both Khoo and Lim (see [119]–[120] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 On the basis of a presumption of resulting trust, Khoo thus holds 38.38% of the beneficial interest and Lim holds 61.62% of the beneficial interest in the Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 It is clear that the relationship between the parties has broken down and it is no longer feasible for the Property to be held in the parties’ joint names. In this case, a clean break would be appropriate. I will make the necessary orders on how the Property is to be dealt with to achieve this, and as to the costs of the proceedings, after hearing the parties on these issues. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Audrey Lim J<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nakoorsha bin Abdul Kadir, Michelle Tang Hui Ming and Rasveen Kaur (Nakoorsha Law Corporation) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Charles Lim Chong Guang and Liew Zhi Hao (Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
