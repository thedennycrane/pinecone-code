<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Some employers view the recruitment of unskilled
                    workers as a purely commercial enterprise bereft of any serious responsibilities
                    for these workers’ well-being. This is altogether wrong. Foreign workers
                    are unquestionably not chattel like the slaves of less enlightened times. Like
                    any other employees, they have basic rights that must be strictly respected. A
                    contract of employment with any employee, regardless of his origins, has at its
                    core the creation of a sense of financial security, identity and self worth.
                    Just as an employee must faithfully discharge his contractual responsibilities,
                    an employer has to discharge his obligations to his employees in a timely and
                    appropriate manner. Unskilled foreign workers, in particular, cannot ordinarily
                    seek alternative employment, often have difficulties communicating, are reliant
                    on their employers for appropriate accommodation, have no financial safety net
                    and are therefore especially vulnerable. They are, in a nutshell, entirely
                    dependent on their employers for both their financial security and welfare. A
                    cavalier failure by an employer to appreciate the serious responsibilities
                    concerning these workers’ welfare can have profoundly unpleasant
                    consequences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Indeed, such an instance is exemplified in the
                    lead up to the present proceedings - 60 aggrieved foreign
                    workers had assembled <em>en masse</em> at the Ministry of
                    Manpower (the “MOM”) to air their grievances over being unpaid and
                    were seeking redress from the MOM. Even more disturbing is the fact that these
                    60 foreign workers recruited by Mr Lee Chiang Theng (the
                    “Appellant”) had been also housed in unapproved and overcrowded
                    accommodation without satisfactory sanitary facilities. Investigations revealed
                    that there was a chicken pox outbreak that infected two of the Appellant’s
                    foreign workers. This outbreak was exacerbated by the severely deficient housing
                    conditions. Tragically one of these two foreign workers passed
                away.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The present proceedings centred on the nature of
                    some of the responsibilities of an employer and the obligations undertaken when
                    foreign workers are brought into Singapore. The Appellant faced a total of 100
                    charges under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A (as amended
                    by the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Act 2007 with effect from
                    1 July 2007)) (the “EFMA”). He pleaded guilty to 33 charges,
                        <em>viz</em> two charges under s 22(1)(<em>a</em>) read with s 20 for failing to provide acceptable
                    accommodation for foreign workers (the “accommodation charges”),
                    24 charges under s 22(1)(<em>a</em>) read with
                    s 20 for failing to pay the salaries of foreign workers on time (the
                    “salary charges”) and seven charges under s 5(1) read with
                    s 20 for employing foreign workers without valid work permits (the
                    “work permit charges”). The Appellant, nevertheless, also
                    consented to the other 67 charges being taken into consideration for the
                    purposes of sentencing, <em>viz</em>, 49 salary charges, 13
                    work permit charges and five accommodation charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant was eventually sentenced by a
                    district judge to a fine of $4,000, in default four weeks’ imprisonment
                    per charge for the accommodation charges and work permit charges. For the salary
                    charges, the Appellant was sentenced to one weeks’ imprisonment per charge
                    with four charges (<em>ie</em>, District Arrest Case
                    (“DAC”) Nos 16480–16483 of 2009) to run consecutively.
                    In total, the Appellant was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment and a
                    fine of $36,000, in default 36 weeks’ imprisonment. The Appellant paid the
                    fine in full for the accommodation and work permit charges and then appealed
                    only in respect of the sentence arising from the salary charges on the ground
                    that the sentence meted out by the district judge was manifestly
                    excessive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       For the sake of completeness, it should be noted
                    that Criminal Motion No 8 of 2011 was filed by the Appellant to adduce
                    further documentary evidence regarding his conduct in managing the workers and
                    Criminal Motion No 36 of 2011 was filed by the Prosecution to adduce
                    additional evidence in the form of affidavits to answer the questions I posed at
                    the first hearing for this appeal on 22 February 2011 (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> below). Both Criminal Motions were eventually
                    allowed with the consent of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After hearing full submissions from both sides,
                    I dismissed the appeal and now give my detailed grounds of
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legislative framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Before examining in greater detail the facts
                    relevant to the present case, I pause to make some observations on the
                    legislative framework governing the employment of foreign workers in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Prior to the enactment of the EFMA in July 2007,
                    the applicable legislation governing the employment of foreign workers was the
                    Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A, 1997 Rev Ed) (the
                    “EFWA”). The EFWA was itself enacted to replace the Regulation of
                    Employment Act (Cap 272, 1985 Rev Ed) (the “REA”). Both the
                    REA (enacted in 1965) and EFWA (enacted in 1991) were enacted for the primary
                    purpose of regulating the inflow of foreign workers (see, respectively,
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (22 December 1965) vol 24 at col 478 (Jek
                    Yeun Thong, Minister for Labour) and <em>Singapore Parliamentary
                        Debates, Official Report</em> (4 October 1990) vol 56 at
                    cols 448 and 456 (Lee Yock Suan, Minister for Labour)). In 2007, Parliament
                    passed the Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Act 2007, which took effect
                    as of 1 July 2007. Pursuant to the said amendment, the EFWA was renamed to
                    its present name (<em>viz</em>, “EFMA”) to
                    reflect the broader coverage of the amended legislation –
                    <em>inter alia</em>, the EFMA consolidated the legislative
                    authority for <em>all</em> work passes (which were
                    previously regulated through different statutes), increased the penalties for
                    selected offences involving foreign workers, introduced new offences and
                    augmented the powers of Employment Inspectors to facilitate enforcement
                    efforts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       For the purposes of the present case, however,
                    it should be noted that the EFMA did not increase penalties for offences related
                    to contravention of the conditions of foreign workers’ work passes (see
                        s 22(1)(<em>a</em>) of the EFWA, <em>cf</em> s 22(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    EFMA). Nonetheless, the importance of regulating employers of foreign workers
                    was clearly expressed in Hansard across the years. When moving the amendment
                    bill in 2007, Dr Ng Eng Hen, then the Minister for Manpower, stated that
                        (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (22 May 2007) vol 83 at col 928):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ability of our companies to access foreign manpower is a comparative
                        advantage. But our foreign worker policy cannot be based on a <em>laissez-faire</em> approach, which will be
                        detrimental to our overall progress. <b>To protect the
                            well-being of foreign workers, we have imposed conditions on employers

                        feature of globalisation and benefits both sending and receiving countries.
                        But we should also recognise that there are syndicates which exist in many
                        countries that seek to exploit vulnerable foreign workers. <b>Many exact payment through empty promises of work, only to
                            leave them hapless and stranded in dire straits</b>, especially
                        in those countries which have porous systems or weak enforcement. And from
                        time to time, it happens here and is picked up by the press. …</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In a subsequent Parliamentary session, it was
                    noted by Mr Gan Kim Yong (“Mr Gan”), then the acting
                    Minister for Manpower that (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates,
                        Official Report</em> (21 October 2008) vol 85 at

                        2007, this House passed changes to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act to

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Under the EFMA, employers owe heavy
                    responsibilities to their foreign workers. The bulk of these responsibilities
                    are set out in the First Schedule to the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work
                    Passes) Regulations (Cap 91A, Reg 2, 2009 Rev Ed). Pursuant to
                    s 22(1)(a) of the EFMA, the contravention of any condition of a foreign
                    worker’s work pass attracts sanctions as specified in the EFMA.
                    Part II of the said Schedule (“Part II”) is of greatest
                    relevance to the present case as the foreign workers concerned here are not
                    domestic workers. In brief, under Part II, employers are responsible for,

                    (“Gates Offshore”). The Appellant stated that he was invited by

                    sponsoring shipyard (“Sponsoring Shipyard”) on 3 March 2008
                    (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> below for elaboration on the
                    concept of a Sponsoring Shipyard). The Appellant thus incorporated Goldrich and
                    was granted the status of Halcyon’s Resident Contractor by the MOM on
                    11 March 2008. Goldrich was given a quota of 200 foreign workers by
                    Halcyon, its Sponsoring Shipyard. After the Appellant brought almost 200 workers
                    into Singapore from Bangladesh, Halcyon’s projects did not materialise.
                    The Appellant submitted that he brought the foreign workers in the batches as

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As a consequence, the foreign workers had no
                    work. In mitigation, the Appellant pointed out that Mr Ong constantly
                    assured him that projects were on their way and that the workers should be
                    retained pending the commencement of these projects.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Appellant claimed that in May 2008,

<p class="Judg-1">Unfortunately, once again, the marine projects promised by Halcyon
                    were delayed and these “400 plus” foreign workers brought in had
                    no work too.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As the case below proceeded on the basis that
                    the Appellant brought in 610 workers through Goldrich and Gates Offshore, I
                    shall adopt this figure notwithstanding that a summation of the numbers in the
                    tables reproduced at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> and <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> suggest a total of 618 foreign workers had
                    actually been affected. After Halcyon’s projects failed to take off as
                    planned, the Appellant could not pay the salaries of his 610 foreign workers.
                    Fortunately, when the MOM investigated the failure to pay the salaries of the
                    foreign workers after the assembly of the 60 foreign workers at the MOM for
                    redress, the Appellant was able, with the assistance of his insurers, <em>ie</em>, EQ Insurance Co Ltd, Maybank General Assurance Bhd
                    and Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd (the “Insurers”), to pay all the
                    salaries, the transport cost of the repatriation and an additional cash
                    allowance of $500 per worker. The Appellant is now indebted to the Insurers in
                    the sum of $544,695.00 for the payments made on behalf of Gates Offshore and
                    $282,879.00 for the payments made on behalf of Goldrich. The Appellant has given
                    a personal undertaking to pay $617,626.66 to EQ Insurance Co Ltd in monthly
                    instalments of $15,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Although the Appellant had failed to pay
                    salaries to most of his 610 workers, the Prosecution only charged the Appellant
                    with regard to 73 workers with the Appellant pleading guilty to 24 of the salary
                    charges and the other 49 salary charges taken into consideration for the
                    purposes of sentencing. The details for the 23 salary charges involving 23

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     After MOM completed its investigation, on
                    2 January 2009 Halcyon and its Resident Contractors (including Gates
                    Offshore and Goldrich) were removed from the sponsorship scheme. Simultaneously,
                    the MOM also revoked the work permits for workers employed by Gates Offshore and
                    Goldrich. Halcyon was re-classified as a non-sponsoring shipyard. It has not, to
                    date, regained its status as a Sponsoring Shipyard. Gates Offshore and Goldrich
                    were then re-classified as common contractors, <em>ie</em>,
                    free to deploy their workers at any of the Sponsoring Shipyards in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In relation to the accommodation charges, the
                    Appellant had breached a condition of the work pass of two foreign workers by
                    failing to provide acceptable accommodation for them (<em>viz</em>, Mr Md Mahmudul Hassan Md Abu Rayhan for a period of
                    two months and 28 days and Mr Md Abbas Molla Md Hemayet Molla for a period
                    of three months and 20 days). They were housed in an industrial/factory unit not
                    designated as workers’ accommodation and did not have the Urban
                    Redevelopment Authority’s approval to convert the unit into a dormitory.
                    This particular accommodation was flagrantly overpopulated with 1,182 foreign
                    workers from 19 companies being housed together in the same premises.
                    Photographs taken of the overcrowded workers’ accommodation showed that
                    space was grossly over congested; many workers were forced to occupy the same
                    room and it appeared that some workers were not provided beds. In short, the
                    standards of accommodation were entirely unacceptable when measured by any
                    civilised standards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In relation to the work permit charges, M/s S1
                    Engineering Pte Ltd (“S1 Engineering”), of which the Appellant was
                    the director, employed seven foreign workers without valid work permits for the
                    period from 19 March 2008 to 1 October 2008, a total of seven months
                    and 12 days. The said workers had valid permits to work for M/s Tipper
                    Corporation Ltd (“Tipper”) but instead were assigned to work for
                    S1 Engineering. The director of Tipper, Mr Lok Siew Fai @ Loke Siew Fai
                    (“Lok”), had approached the Appellant to supply some foreign
                    workers to work for S1 Engineering. The Appellant agreed to Lok’s
                    proposal. These workers carried out cleaning jobs and insulation of pipes,
                    working from 8.00am to 5.30pm daily with a salary of $17 per day. There were no
                    allegations, however, that the foreign workers were improperly treated in the
                    course of that particular engagement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Appellant’s case on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On appeal, the Appellant argued that he never
                    profited from the workers, but in fact, suffered heavy financial burdens in
                    paying for the workers’ lodging, food and allowances. He claimed that the
                    workers were not paid salaries because there were no jobs for the workers and
                    this was, he alleged, a factor beyond his control. The main thrust of his appeal
                    was that the district judge failed to give sufficient weight to Halcyon’s
                    involvement as the Sponsoring Shipyard, especially in light of the MOM’s
                    guidelines for Sponsoring Shipyards that placed the duty on the Sponsoring
                    Shipyard to assign projects to the Resident Contractors. The Appellant argued
                    that the foreign workers of Goldrich and Gates Offshore were <em>exclusively</em> tied to Halcyon, their Sponsoring Shipyard, and that
                    these workers could not be assigned to projects undertaken by other shipyards.
                    The Appellant thus argued that the district judge did not give sufficient weight
                    to the fact that it was Halcyon who largely contributed to the unhappy situation
                    by failing to live up to its side of the bargain to provide employment for the
                    workers. This, his counsel submitted, was the true cause of the
                    predicament.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Relationship between Sponsoring Shipyard and Resident
                Contractor</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Following from the above, it was important to
                    clearly establish the responsibilities of the Sponsoring Shipyard and the
                    Resident Contractor with regard to the foreign workers. To this end, at the
                    first hearing on 1 February 2011, I asked parties to provide further
                    information as to, <em>inter alia</em>, the exact division
                    of roles and responsibilities between Halcyon and its Resident Contractors
                        (<em>ie</em>, Goldrich and Gates Offshore). In this
                    regard, the Prosecution adduced four affidavits from:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     From Then’s affidavit, it was clarified
                    that the MOM divided the marine companies in Singapore into two broad groups,
                        <em>viz</em> (a) shipyards and
                    (b) contractors. These groups were further sub-divided into:
                    (a) Sponsoring Shipyards and non-sponsoring shipyards and (b) Resident
                    Contractors and common contractors. The work permit requirements and controls
                    for foreign worker allocation would vary depending on which group the company
                    fell into. The MOM had a pooled quota system which allowed a Sponsoring Shipyard
                    to combine with Resident Contractors in the hiring of foreign work permit
                    holders. From the perspective of the Sponsoring Shipyard, the benefits of this
                    system are first, that the number of local workers for the Sponsoring Shipyard
                    is consolidated and the number of foreign work permits allowed is a percentage
                    of this combined figure, and second, that no further proof of contracts is
                    required before the MOM issues the work permits. This allowed the Sponsoring
                    Shipyard and its respective Resident Contractors great flexibility in using the
                    same pool of foreign work permit holders for different projects with a fast
                    turn-around time. The Resident Contractor can only be registered with one
                    Sponsoring Shipyard and its foreign workers can only be deployed to that
                    Sponsoring Shipyard. It is noted from Then’s affidavit that the criteria
                    to be classified as a Sponsoring Shipyard became stricter in January 2009 as
                    part of an ongoing process of review and feedback from the industry. The
                    previous requirements relating to the size of the local workforce and paid up
                    capital was raised significantly and new requirements such as financial and
                    employment records as well as the need to demonstrate a pipeline of marine
                    projects were added. There is also currently newly enhanced supervision with
                    increased site visits to ensure Sponsoring Shipyards and their contractors are
                    complying with the work permit requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Then’s affidavit also emphasised the
                    MOM’s position that it was the Resident Contractor who was regarded as the
                        <em>employer</em> of the foreign workers and was,
                    pursuant to the work permit conditions, responsible for paying the monthly
                    salaries to the foreign workers. The Sponsoring Shipyard had no legal obligation
                    to take responsibility for the wages of the foreign workers apart from s 65
                    of the Employment Act (Cap 65, 1997 Rev Ed), which provides for the
                    principal to be responsible for no more than one month of salary due to the
                    workers for work done by the contractor if the contractor is unable to pay said
                    salaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The contracts entered into between the
                    Appellant’s companies and Halcyon as adduced in Mr Ong’s
                    affidavit clarified the division of responsibilities between Halcyon and the
                    Appellant’s companies. They consisted of: (a) a labour supply
                    agreement between Halcyon and Goldrich on 13 March 2008 (“Goldrich
                    labour supply agreement”), (b) a labour supply agreement between
                    Halcyon and Gates Offshore on 2 July 2008 (“Gates Offshore labour
                    supply agreement”) and (c) a $4m fabrication, assembly and
                    installation service agreement between Halcyon and Gates Offshore on
                    1 December 2008 (“Gates Offshore fabrication agreement”). The
                    terms and conditions in the Goldrich labour supply agreement and Gates Offshore
                    labour supply agreement were largely identical. Of particular importance were
                    clauses 3 and 7:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[underlined text in original, emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On an examination of the contracts between
                    Halcyon and the Appellant’s companies, I found that the district judge did
                    not err in rejecting the Appellant’s submission that the Sponsoring
                    Shipyard’s role (in the bringing in of the foreign workers) was an
                    important mitigating consideration. It was clear from the contracts that the
                    heavy legal responsibilities of an employer of foreign workers fell on the
                    Appellant’s companies (<em>ie</em>, the Resident
                    Contractors) and the fact that he had a back-to-back contractual arrangement
                    with Halcyon to provide jobs for these workers was not a legitimate excuse for
                    his failure to pay the workers when the jobs failed to materialise (and see
                    [11(d)] above, referring to para 7 of Part II). While it appeared from
                    the evidence before me that Halcyon had failed to perform its side of the
                    bargain or had given assurances to the Appellant about projects that should not
                    have been given, that was a commercial risk that the Appellant had accepted with
                    open eyes. The Appellant contended that Halcyon, which had five Resident
                    Contractors and a quota of 1,300 foreign workers in all, should not have
                    imprudently promised jobs to all its Resident Contractors if its existing book
                    orders were incapable of supporting 1,300 foreign workers. The Appellant also
                    highlighted the fact that the accused in one of the sentencing precedents
                    tendered by the Prosecution for the salary charges, <em>viz</em>, <em>Public Prosecutor v Yip Si
                        </em><em>Wei Julian</em> (DAC No 30733/2009
                    and others) (“<em>Yip Si </em><em>Wei
                        Julian</em>”) (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>
                    below), had also been a Resident Contractor for Halcyon. Therefore, it appears
                    that the Appellant was not the only one who suffered from dealing with Halcyon.
                    However, Halcyon’s apparent lack of commercial rectitude in its commercial
                    dealings with its Resident Contractors and whatever possible recourse the
                    Resident Contractors may have towards Halcyon is to be adjudged in a different
                    forum; it <em>was entirely </em><em>irrelevant vis-à-vis any consideration of </em><em>the
                        Appellant’s criminal liability under the EFMA apropos the breach of
                        his obligations qua employer.</em> I therefore rejected the misguided
                    attempt to attribute the blame to Halcyon and downplay the Appellant’s
                    serious personal responsibilities towards the workers he had brought
                in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I agreed with the district judge that the
                    Appellant should have acted promptly to cut his losses and repatriate the
                    workers and his “unwillingness to accept that Halcyon was never going to
                    come good with its promises of mega projects had aggravated an already bad state
                    of affairs” (see GD at [19]).
                    Despite the fact that Halcyon had failed previously to provide jobs for
                    Goldrich’s 200 foreign workers who were brought in earlier in the year
                    after Goldrich was granted Resident Contractor status on 11 March 2008, the
                    Appellant blindly relied on Halcyon’s assurances and brought in more than
                    400 additional foreign workers under Gates Offshore once it was granted Resident
                    Contractor status on 30 June 2008. The Appellant had, on his own volition,
                    decided to bring in a large number of foreign workers within a short amount of
                    time without ironclad reasons to believe that work would be found for all the
                    workers he had recruited. He cannot now disclaim responsibility for his actions,
                    especially given that he was <em>legally</em> bound to pay
                    the salaries of the workers that he brought into Singapore <em>regardless</em> of whether Halcyon actually provided jobs for them.
                    The Prosecution highlighted that the Appellant had the prerogative to determine
                        <em>when</em> to bring in the foreign workers as the
                    in-principle approval granted by the MOM for the work permits was valid for a
                    period of three months. In other words, he could have brought the foreign
                    workers in smaller and more manageable batches. He should also have monitored
                    the situation on a monthly basis, and stopped bringing in more workers when it
                    was clear that jobs had not been provided as promised for the workers already
                    brought in. Instead, the Appellant continued to bring in more and more workers
                    until he had utilised the full foreign worker quotas allotted to Goldrich and
                    Gates Offshore. It is noted from Chai’s affidavit that because of the
                    sudden spikes of work permit applications submitted and approved for Gates
                    Offshore from August to October 2008, the WPD had taken administrative action in
                    late November 2008 to block the e-issuance for work permit applications of the
                    workers who had entered Singapore. On 26 November 2008, Chai contacted the
                    Appellant to “withhold”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the bringing in of foreign workers for
                    whom he had submitted work permit applications but had not yet travelled to
                    Singapore. Chai also requested the Appellant to submit the contracts between
                    Gates Offshore and Halcyon to prove the existence of works. In a letter to Chai
                    from the Appellant dated 15 December 2008, the Appellant insisted that
                    Gates Offshore would bring in the outstanding in-principle approved workers in
                    the first quarter of 2009 and hoped “to be able to recruit another 200 to
                    300 additional workers for training”. From his actions, the Appellant
                    plainly did not appear to see the need for exercising restraint. The Appellant,
                    as an experienced business man, should have been conscious that there was always
                    a commercial risk that Halcyon would default on its obligations, and he only had
                    himself to blame for repeatedly and stubbornly believing in Halcyon’s
                    hollow promises notwithstanding that they did not materialise from the outset.
                    The Appellant’s calculated decision to bring in 610 foreign workers cannot
                    be readily excused as a poor business decision. The consequences of his decision
                    had very real ramifications on the livelihoods of the hundreds of foreign
                    workers brought into Singapore. Their well-being which was <em>entirely</em> dependent on him had been severely
                prejudiced.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The sentencing norm for the charges under the EFMA </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Prosecution relied on two sentencing
                    precedents to justify a custodial sentence in this case: <em>Yip
                        Si </em><em>Wei Julian</em> and <em>Public Prosecutor v Lee Heng</em> (DAC
                    No 7211–7213/2010 and others) (“<em>Lee
                        Heng</em>”). In <em>Yip Si </em><em>Wei Julian</em>, the accused faced 100 charges under
                        s 22(1)(<em>a</em>) of the EFMA for failing to pay
                    the salaries of 100 foreign workers. The Prosecution proceeded with 50 charges
                    and the remaining 50 charges were taken into consideration. The accused failed
                    to pay the salaries for the period from 8 January 2009 to 24 February
                    2009 and the total salaries owed was $768 per worker or $38,400 in total for the
                    proceeded charges. Similar to the facts of the present case, the accused in
                        <em>Yip Si </em><em>Wei
                        Julian</em> was a sole proprietor of companies in the marine sector
                    which had run out of work for his foreign workers but decided to retain them in
                    Singapore instead of repatriating them. Also akin to the present case (see
                        <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above), the payment of the
                    workers’ salaries was subsequently made by the insurance company. The
                    district judge sentenced the accused to three months’ imprisonment in
                    respect of each of the charges with three of the sentences to run consecutively,
                    totalling a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Lee Heng</em>, the
                    accused was a project manager of a company dealing in the business of barge,
                    tugboat and sampan services. He was charged, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, with three charges of failing to pay the salaries of three
                    foreign workers for a period of six months from 24 February 2009 to
                    15 August 2009. The unpaid salaries totalled $5,263.28. The accused in
                        <em>Lee Heng</em> had an antecedent; he was previously
                    convicted of four charges under s 22(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    read with s 20 of the EFMA and sentenced to one week’s imprisonment
                    on each charge for an aggregate sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment. The
                    district judge sentenced the accused in <em>Lee Heng</em>
                    to between two to three weeks’ imprisonment on each charge. The sentence
                    totalled 13 weeks’ imprisonment (although the exact breakdown of this
                    total sentence was not provided).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Counsel for Appellant relied on two other
                    sentencing precedents to justify the imposition of a mere fine in the present
                    case, <em>viz </em><em>Public Prosecutor v
                        The Soup Spoon Pte Ltd and Another</em> [2008] SGDC 278
                        (“<em>The Soup Spoon</em>”) and <em>Public Prosecutor v Enilia Donohue</em> [2004] SGMC 9
                        (“<em>Enilia Donohue</em>”). I did not
                    find <em>The Soup Spoon</em> relevant because although the
                    accused also faced eight charges under s 22(1)(<em>a</em>) of the EFMA for failing to comply with the conditions of the
                    work permits, the condition breached in <em>The Soup
                        Spoon</em>, <em>ie</em>, that the eight workers
                    were working in occupations different from the occupation stated in their work
                    permits, was substantially different from the condition breached in the present
                    appeal. The condition breached in <em>The Soup Spoon</em>
                    did not adversely impact the welfare of the foreign workers to the same degree
                    as the breach in the present matter. Plainly, the sentencing considerations at
                    play in <em>The Soup Spoon</em> were quite different from
                    those in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In <em>Enilia</em>, the
                    accused pleaded guilty to one charge of employing a foreign worker without
                    permit and one charge of failing to pay the salary of that foreign worker. The
                    salaries were unpaid for a period from 7 September 2001 to 9 August
                    2003, totalling a sum of $4,630. The presiding magistrate found that the fact
                    that the employer defaulted in the payment of the worker’s levy to the
                    MOM, resulting in the MOM revoking the worker’s work permit, was an
                    aggravating factor. In the circumstances, the magistrate imposed a fine
                    equivalent to 35 months of the levy at the rate of $345 per month for the charge
                    of employing a foreign worker without permit, and a fine of $3,000 for the
                    charge of failing to pay the salary of that foreign worker. I did not find
                        <em>Enilia</em> instructive because it is unclear
                    whether the court had properly appraised the applicable policy considerations.
                    Given the length of the defaulting period, it seems to me that a short custodial
                    sentence as well as a fine would have been appropriate on the facts of that
                    case. I do not think that the decision in that case can be relied on as
                    signalling that custodial sentences are not proper even if there is a flagrant
                    refusal by an employer to discharge his legal responsibilities towards a foreign
                    worker.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As there is a lack of clear precedents
                    regarding the consequences arising from the commission of the offences under the
                    EFMA, <em>it is important to emphasise that employers who
                        persistently fail to discharge their legal responsibilities towards foreign
                        workers will ordinarily have custodial sentences imposed on them.</em>
                    I ought to also emphasise that a single serious transgression in relation to
                    this genre of offences might also attract a custodial sentence. When precisely
                    the custody threshold is crossed will necessarily have to be fact centric. The
                    seriousness of the offence will of course be exacerbated when a large number of
                    foreign workers are brought in and the employer fails to fulfil his legal
                    responsibilities towards them. Other possible aggravating considerations are,
                        <em>inter alia</em>: (a) a persistent failure by
                    an employer to discharge his responsibilities, <em>eg</em>,
                    the employer has been in continuous breach for an extensive period of time with
                    no efforts of rectification, (b) an employer’s failure to discharge
                    its responsibility that renders the employee susceptible to physical harm or
                    otherwise results in a situation that compromises the worker’s overall
                    welfare or well being, and (c) an employer’s cumulative commission of
                    various offences under the EFMA or different conditions in the work permit with
                    regard to the same worker (<em>eg</em>, failing to pay the
                    salary <em>and</em> housing the worker in unacceptable
                    conditions). Such breaches by the employer of his responsibilities show clear
                    disregard of the importance and purpose of the statutory scheme. The wider
                    consequences of such flagrant breaches were exemplified in this case: as
                    mentioned in <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above, the aggrieved workers
                    had assembled <em>en masse</em> at the MOM to air their
                    grievances and to seek redress. Ironically, it was the Appellant who arranged
                    transportation for the foreign workers to the MOM for the purposes of seeking
                    redress for their unpaid salaries, presumably because he believed the real
                    responsibility for the unpaid salaries lay with Halcyon and not himself. While
                    he might have been well-meaning in arranging for his workers to publicise their
                    unhappy predicament, ultimately, the Appellant – as the employer and,
                    accordingly, the person responsible for the foreign workers – could not
                    shift his criminal liability to Halcyon (as emphasised in <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Parliament has shown concern about the
                    seriousness with which an employer’s failure to pay the salaries of his
                    foreign workers ought to be viewed. In early 2009, Mr Gan, when responding
                    to questions about the problem of salary arrears for foreign workers, said
                        (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (22 January 2009) vol 85 at

<em>While we can understand that some employers may be
                            facing business difficulties under the current economic environment,
                            this does not absolve them from their basic responsibilities towards
                            their foreign workers</em>. These include paying salaries and
                        providing workers with proper accommodation, food and medical care. MOM will
                        not hesitate to take action under the Employment Act (EA) or the Employment
                        of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) against errant employers who fail to pay
                        salaries on time. The penalty for non-payment of salaries under the
                        Employment Act has been increased to $5,000 per charge for first-time
                        offenders since January this year.</p>

                        <em>We must also recognise that in a volatile business
                            environment, some employers may find that the projects they had earlier
                            planned for are delayed or even cancelled. In such situations, companies
                            may not have work for some of their foreign workers. If so, the work
                            permit conditions require the employer to terminate the contracts and
                            facilitate the repatriation of their workers to their home country after
                            ensuring that all outstanding employment issues have been

                        and we will step up enforcement and tighten checks, if necessary.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I also mentioned in my previous answer that <em>for

                            can return home</em>. To keep these foreign workers here without
                        adequate work will not be beneficial for them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The accountability of an employer was re-emphasised by Mr Gan in
                    response to a question on freelance employment of foreign workers (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, (23 November 2010)
                    vol 87 at col 1660):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Sir, primarily, as we allow a foreign worker to come into Singapore, we
                        would require an employer to be responsible for the stay and the work of
                        that foreign worker. <em>In the event that this particular
                            foreign worker gets into difficulty, we would need to be able to hold a
                            certain employer accountable and responsible for the well-being of this
                            foreign worker</em>. It will be very difficult for us to open the
                        gate and allow foreign workers to come in without an employer to be
                        responsible for them. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As evinced by the numerous Parliamentary speeches (including the
                    excerpts cited in <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> and <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a> above), there is clearly enormous public
                    interest in holding employers, as the persons with the greatest control over the
                    stay and work of foreign workers, fully accountable for the welfare of those
                    workers. <em>It is a legal responsibility that cannot be shirked
                        or excused by a deteriorating economic climate or by defaulting business
                        partners. This legal responsibility is even more significant when the
                        foreign workers are of particular vulnerability, ie, where they are
                        unskilled workers with little bargaining power and unable to fend for
                        themselves</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The district judge was therefore correct to
                    take the view that the main sentencing consideration to be applied was that of
                    general deterrence, and that this case required a custodial sentence (see GD at
                        [19]). While it is necessary to be
                    sensitive to the specific factual matrix of every case, the general principle
                    must be that employers who persistently fail to pay the salaries of their
                    foreign workers will ordinarily face custodial sentences. With regard to the
                    accommodation charges and work permit charges, the district judge was of the
                    opinion that a fine of an appropriate amount would constitute sufficient
                    deterrence (see GD at [16]–[17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I turn first to consider the work permit
                    charges. The prescribed punishment for the work permit charges is heavier than
                    the salary and accommodation charges – a fine not exceeding $15,000, or
                    imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both (see s 5(6)(<em>a</em>) of the EFMA). The district judge considered the
                    number of charges involved (seven convicted and 13 taken into consideration),
                    the fact that the period of time the workers were employed without valid work
                    permits were not short (<em>ie</em>, about eight months)
                    and the fact that the Appellant was a first offender (see GD at [17]). In my opinion, as the welfare of the
                    foreign workers in question did not seem to be compromised in this case, a fine
                    may have served as sufficient deterrence but in light of the eight months of
                    cheap and unlicensed labour the Appellant was able to economically enjoy, the
                    quantum of $4,000 fine per charge was on the low side and ought to have been
                    calibrated higher.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I turn next to examine the accommodation and
                    salary charges. Both charges deal with contraventions of the conditions under
                    the foreign workers’ work permits and arguably embody two of the more
                    serious responsibilities of an employer in ensuring the adequate welfare and
                    health of their foreign workers. In my view, the aggravating considerations
                    identified above are all clearly present in this case. Not only did the
                    Appellant persistently disregard his responsibilities under the EFMA, he
                    cumulatively breached both his obligations to pay salaries and provide
                    acceptable accommodation to some of his workers. His actions were undoubtedly
                    severely deleterious to their welfare. Most pernicious is the fact that his
                    breaches resulted in his foreign workers living in unsafe conditions in which a
                    life was lost.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The prescribed punishment for the
                    accommodation and salary charges was a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment
                    for a term not exceeding six months or both (see s 22(1)(<em>i</em>) of the EFMA). Under the conditions of the work permit, the
                    employer shall be responsible for and bear the cost of the employee’s
                    upkeep and maintenance in Singapore. It is also a breach of the Security Bond
                    that an employer undertakes with the MOM to provide acceptable accommodation for
                    their employees who are work permit holders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In respect of the accommodation charges, the
                    district judge considered the number of charges (two convicted and five taken
                    into consideration), the fact that the period of unacceptable accommodation was
                    not short (<em>ie</em>, about four months), the fact that
                    the Appellant had arranged alternative accommodations without delay for the
                    affected foreign workers when he knew about the unacceptable dormitory
                    conditions and that he was a first offender (see [16] of GD). The district judge therefore felt a fine of $4,000
                        (<em>ie</em> at the higher end of the spectrum) would
                    be an appropriate sentence. On the contrary, as stated earlier at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> and <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>,
                    I viewed the Appellant’s failure to discharge his obligation in providing
                    acceptable accommodation much more seriously – such breaches that expose
                    and cause physical harm to one’s employees deserve a custodial sentence to
                    reflect the abhorrence towards such offences. In my opinion, had the Prosecution
                    appealed, the accommodation charges would have attracted a custodial sentence in
                    order to be commensurate with the severity of the harm caused and the level of
                    general deterrence required. The Appellant ought to therefore consider himself
                    fortunate that he is not facing a more substantial aggregate custodial sentence
                    for the totality of his offending conduct in this sorry episode.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     For the salary charges, the Appellant was
                    required under the terms of the workers’ work permits to pay them their
                    salaries before the expiry of the seventh day after the last day of their salary
                    periods. The Appellant admitted that he had failed to do so and defaulted on
                    payments for extensive periods from one to six months (as tabulated above at
                        <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>–<a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>). The exact amount of salaries paid back to all the 610
                    foreign workers was not provided, but the total amount involved in the 24
                    proceeded salary charges was $62,016.69. The Appellant also had 49 other salary
                    charges which were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The
                    district judge had correctly given mitigating weight to the fact that the
                    Appellant was a first offender and had paid all the salaries of the foreign
                    workers with the assistance of the Insurers (see GD at [20]). The Appellant also submitted that he
                    spent more than $350,000 monthly to maintain the 610 workers, and this was also
                    an important mitigating consideration. In my opinion, the district judge had
                    taken into account all the relevant factors of the case and I am satisfied that
                    the district judge did not err in principle. In fact, the facts of this appeal
                    are comparable with <em>Yip Si </em><em>Wei
                        Julian</em> – although the number of charges was greater in
                        <em>Yip Si </em><em>Wei
                        Julian</em>, the workers in this appeal were owed salaries for a
                    longer period and the salary arrears was of a higher amount. Although the
                    Appellant stated that he had offered repatriation to all his foreign workers at
                    his own expense and only 50 out of the 610 workers elected to return home, it
                    would be simplistic to believe that the rest of the foreign workers were truly
                    happy and willing to stay on without proper employment. After all, these foreign
                    workers had taken great pains and efforts to travel to Singapore for better job
                    prospects and yet each of them was deprived of a job opportunity and a chance to
                    earn wages to send home. The simmering dissatisfaction of the foreign workers
                    inevitably culminated into an <em>en masse</em> protest at
                    the MOM and it must have been a highly taxing undertaking by the MOM and the
                    Insurers to ensure the adequate and safe repatriation of all the affected
                    foreign workers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Therefore, it could not be said that a
                    sentence of one weeks’ imprisonment per charge with four charges to run
                    consecutively was manifestly excessive. Indeed, given the number of workers
                    involved here the sentence ought to have been heavier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It must be re-emphasised that employers are in
                    a position of considerable authority over their foreign workers. But this
                    authority over the workers for their duration of their stay in Singapore carries
                    with it serious responsibilities that have to be scrupulously observed. A
                    serious failure to discharge these responsibilities, <em>ie</em>, in relation to the payment of salaries; the statutory levies
                    due; or the provision of suitable accommodation will ordinarily attract a
                    custodial sentence (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     For the reasons enunciated above, I dismissed
                    the appeal on sentence <em>vis-à-vis</em> the salary
                    charges. Perhaps I should also make plain that the custodial sentence given in
                    these proceedings should not be viewed as the benchmark for similar offending
                    conduct. Had there been an appeal to enhance the sentences, I would have been
                    inclined to significantly increase the term of imprisonment (see <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>–<a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above). The totality of the Appellant’s offending
                    conduct was entirely unacceptable. He cannot shield himself from the
