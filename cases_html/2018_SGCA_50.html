As the Judge observed (at [1]), this is yet another legal tussle in a series of bitterly fought litigation between the parties which stretches across more than four decades and which has hitherto resulted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, in <span class="font-italic">five</span> decisions of this court, excluding the present decision. In the last of those decisions, this court characterised the protracted quarrel between the parties as a “marathon saga of litigation” (<span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title</span><span class="font-italic"> Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 998 at [3]). At this juncture, some seven years and yet another set of proceedings later, it seems appropriate to say, in the words of Herman Melville, that it is a “quenchless feud” (Herman Melville, <span class="font-italic">Moby</span><span class="font-italic">-Dick; or, The Whale</span> (Norton, 1892) at p 169).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In fact, the appellant had in 2008 ultimately obtained a decision in its favour with regard to the principal subject matter of their longstanding quarrel, namely, a disputed right of way over a narrow strip of land. Now that there is no longer any dispute over that original subject matter, the parties have turned their energies to disputing about the dispute itself. This time, the proceedings which culminated in the present appeal were commenced by the appellant, the owner of that strip of land, who has claimed against the respondent, who had been found not to have that right of way despite years of asserting that it did, in four causes of action, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, abuse of process, malicious prosecution, malicious falsehood and trespass.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 These proceedings are, in fact, replete with irony as well as legal significance. It is ironic that a dispute bitterly fought over several decades by two parties who have nothing but personal ill will towards each other has engendered (for Singapore law) questions of the first importance in relation to the development of the common law in general and tort law in particular. More specifically, of threshold importance to the appellant’s claims for abuse of process and malicious prosecution is the issue of whether these torts ought to be <span class="font-italic">recognised</span> by the Singapore courts <span class="font-italic">in the first place</span>. If this court does not recognise the existence of these torts in the Singapore context, then the appellant’s case would not even be able to take off.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">At least two sub-issues</span> arise in relation to this particular issue – <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">first</span>, whether the Singapore courts ought to recognise either or both torts simply because there is <span class="font-italic">case law</span> that endorses both them – and, in relation to one of the torts, case law that endorses the tort in a number of <span class="font-italic">narrower</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>situations. Put simply, does this last-mentioned point raise a “<span class="font-italic">Donoghue v Stevenson</span> moment”? To elaborate, it is well known that the landmark House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">M’Alister</span><span class="font-italic"> (or Donoghue) (Pauper) v Stevenson</span> [1932] AC 562 (“<span class="font-italic">Donoghue</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>birthed the modern law of negligence (albeit by a bare majority of three to two). In the process of arriving at its decision, the majority in <span class="font-italic">Donoghue</span> considered several streams of seemingly disparate precedents, drawing together a central thread via the now famous “neighbour principle” laid down by Lord Atkin (see also the classic account (albeit from an American perspective) by Prof Edward H Levi in his book, <span class="font-italic">An Introduction to Legal Reasoning </span>(The University of Chicago Press, 1949), especially at pp 8−27 and ch 3 of Robert C Beckman, Brady S Coleman and Joel Lee, <span class="font-italic">Case Analysis and Statutory Interpretation – Cases and Materials </span>(Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore, 2nd Ed, 2001), as well as the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang and another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another matter </span>[2015] 1 SLR 26 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang</span>”) at [80]). It is important to note that in <span class="font-italic">Donoghue</span>, the various precedents were indeed flowing (albeit as separate streams) in the <span class="font-italic">same direction</span>. It was therefore logical as well as fair and just for the court in <span class="font-italic">Donoghue</span> to gather together, as it were, those disparate smaller streams and channel them into the more powerful river that we now know as the tort of negligence. To state that this was a significant moment in the development of the common law of torts is an understatement of the highest order. Indeed, since <span class="font-italic">Donoghue</span>, the law of negligence has constituted the most important part of the law of tort and takes centre stage in textbooks and case books as well as in law schools across the Commonwealth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 As we shall see, there are possible parallels in the case before us. One of the principal (and relatively recent) decisions that has endorsed the <span class="font-italic">extension</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>of the tort of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">malicious prosecution</span> to the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">civil </span><span class="font-italic">sphere</span> is that of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (on appeal from the Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands) in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters (Cayman) Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Sagicor General Insurance (Cayman) Ltd </span>[2014] AC 366 (“<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>”) (noted by Tom K C Ng in “The Torts of Malicious Prosecution and Abuse of Legal Process” (2014) 130 LQR 43 and discussed by Stephen Todd in “Liability for the Malicious Institution of Civil Proceedings” (2017) 4 J Int’l &amp; Comp L 123 (“<span class="font-italic">Todd</span>”)), where the Board held in favour of the aforesaid extension – though only (as was also the case in <span class="font-italic">Donoghue</span>) by a <span class="font-italic">narrow majority of three to two</span>. Indeed, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>was subsequently endorsed in the UK Supreme Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> v Joyce and another </span>[2016] 3 WLR 477 (“<span class="font-italic">Willers</span>”; discussed in <span class="font-italic">Todd </span>and James Lee, “The Judicial Individuality of Lord Sumption” (2017) 40 UNSW Law Journal 862 (“<span class="font-italic">James L</span><span class="font-italic">ee</span>”) at pp 880−886)<span class="font-italic"> – </span>again by a <span class="font-italic">narrow majority of five to four </span>(with <span class="font-italic">all five </span>of the judges who sat on <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>also sitting on this particular appeal (for further proceedings, see <span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> v Joyce </span>[2017] EWHC 1225 (Ch))). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 By way of a side-note of sorts, the UK Supreme Court in fact delivered (in relation to <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>) a <span class="font-italic">second</span> decision devoted exclusively to the issue of <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span> or binding precedent which suggested that, in certain circumstances, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council could effectively decide that courts in England and Wales should follow its decision rather than the earlier decision of the House of Lords, the UK Supreme Court or of the English Court of Appeal on <span class="font-italic">a point of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">English</span><span class="font-italic"> law</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> v Joyce (No 2)</span> [2016] 3 WLR 534, especially at [19]−[21]). Although such an approach has not escaped academic criticism (see Peter Mirfield, “A Novel Theory of Privy Council Precedent” (2017) 133 LQR 1), it rests on a <span class="font-italic">practical</span> basis. As Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury (with whom all the other judges agreed) observed (at [21]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]t seems to me to be not only convenient but also sensible that the [Judicial Committee of the Privy Council], which normally consists of the same judges as the [UK] Supreme Court, should, when applying English law, be capable of departing from an earlier decision of the [UK] Supreme Court or House of Lords to the same extent and with the same effect as the [UK] Supreme Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 It is trite, though, that the Singapore courts are not bound to follow decisions of either the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council emanating from another jurisdiction or the UK Supreme Court. We are hence <span class="font-italic">not</span> bound to follow either <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> or <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 What will be of crucial importance in our analysis below is whether the various precedents which applied the tort of malicious prosecution in the <span class="font-italic">civil</span> sphere were indeed flowing in the <span class="font-italic">same direction </span>(as was the case with the precedents prior to <span class="font-italic">Donoghue</span>) <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">or</span> whether they were <span class="font-italic">distinct streams that were flowing in separate directions </span>(<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, were <span class="font-italic">specific historical</span> developments and no more) and therefore not susceptible of being consolidated and harnessed into a more effective river, as was done in <span class="font-italic">Donoghue</span>. We should pause to point out that one area of difference is that whereas <span class="font-italic">Donoghue </span>birthed a completely novel cause of action, by some accounts, the application of the tort of malicious prosecution to civil proceedings is nothing new. Indeed, the majority in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>pointed out that there were prior cases that had endorsed the application of the tort of malicious prosecution in the civil sphere on an apparently general basis – although they, too, acknowledged that that was, by the time of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>, <span class="font-italic">no longer</span> the law. However, as we shall also see, the minority in the same case (in particular, Lord Sumption) advanced an argument from history to demonstrate the contrary, that the tort had never been of such general application. What is clear is that the Board in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> (and, subsequently, the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>) were faced directly with the issue as to whether the tort of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">malicious prosecution </span>should (by way of a clear and unambiguous declaration of what the law should be) be <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">extended</span> to the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">civil</span> <span class="font-italic">sphere</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">general</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ly</span>. Looked at in this light, the Board in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>(and, subsequently, the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>)<span class="font-italic"> </span>were indeed faced with a “<span class="font-italic">Donoghue v Stevenson </span>moment”. This is, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, the case as far as the <span class="font-italic">Singapore</span> position is concerned.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 We pause to observe that the first sub-issue (see [4] above) outlined in the preceding paragraphs is also relevant to whether the tort of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">abuse of process</span> ought to be introduced in the Singapore context, although it is not as important in relation to this particular tort as the second sub-issue, to which our attention must now turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">second</span> sub-issue is this: Whether, regardless of the precedents themselves, there are <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">persuasive arguments of general principle, policy, logic as well as justice and fairness</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that would lead, on balance, to the conclusion that the tort of malicious prosecution ought to be extended to the <span class="font-italic">civil</span> sphere, and that the tort of abuse of process ought to be recognised in the Singapore context. In this regard, we will also consider the judgments in both <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>and <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>. We should mention that, whilst a parochial approach to legal development ought to be assiduously eschewed, this court cannot ignore – where relevant – the lack of suitability of any rule or principle of English law to the <span class="font-italic">local circumstances of Singapore</span> (see also s 3(2) of the Application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Rev Ed)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In considering the possible recognition of the torts of malicious civil prosecution and abuse of process in Singapore, we bear in mind the oft-quoted observations by Denning LJ (as he then was) in the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Candler</span> <span class="font-italic">v Crane, Christmas &amp; Co </span>[1951] 2 KB 164, where the learned judge drew (at 178) a distinction between “timorous souls who were fearful of allowing a new cause of action” and “bold spirits who were ready to allow it if justice so required”. These observations have, in fact, been quoted more than once by this court itself (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock v </span><span class="font-italic">Khoo Eng Lim </span>[2010] 3 SLR 179 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock</span>”) at [80]; <span class="font-italic">Lim Meng </span><span class="font-italic">Suang</span> at [80]; and <span class="font-italic">ATE v ATD</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal </span>[2016] SGCA 2 at [27]). However, there is a <span class="font-italic">limit</span> to judicial law making. As this court observed in <span class="font-italic">Ang Sin Hock</span> (at [80]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">To adopt phrases coined by Denning LJ in a slightly different context, judges can be “bold spirits”, as opposed to “timorous souls” – but <span class="font-italic">only</span>, we would reiterate, <span class="font-italic">where there is a legal basis for such judicial boldness which would (in turn) aid in achieving a substantively just and fair result in the case at hand.</span> [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Indeed, perhaps the expression “wise spirits” instead of “bold spirits” might be a preferable term. Put another way, if the recognition of the aforementioned torts would lead to more difficulties as well as complexities within Singapore law itself, it would then be <span class="font-italic">unwise</span>, to say the least, for this court to proceed to recognise these torts. Indeed, such a situation would mandate a <span class="font-italic">non-</span>recognition of these torts instead.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 With this overview, we turn to outline the factual backdrop to this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The appellant is Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd (“Lee Tat”).

class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Servient Tenement, which lies between what was formerly Lot 111-34 and Grange Road. This means that for Grange Heights residents, the most direct method of accessing Grange Road is to pass through the Servient Tenement. The question at the heart of the protracted tussle between Lee Tat and the MCST was whether Grange Heights residents had this right of way (“the Right of Way”). In successive rounds of litigation, the MCST maintained that Grange Heights residents did have it. On the other hand, Lee Tat, which initially owned only two dominant tenements, Lots 111-32 and 111-33 (shown to the left of the Servient Tenement), but subsequently acquired the Servient Tenement itself, maintained that Grange Heights residents had no such Right of Way, and sought to exclude them from using the Servient Tenement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The issue whether Grange Heights residents had the Right of Way is intertwined with changes in ownership of the various lots of land over time. Lots 111-30, 111-31 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Servient Tenement), 111-32, 111-33 and 111-34 were originally owned by a company called Mutual Trading Ltd (“Mutual Trading”). In 1919, Mutual Trading sold Lots 111-30, 111-32, 111-33 and 111-34 (“the Dominant Tenements”) and granted a right of way over the Servient Tenement to the purchasers of the Dominant Tenements. In this way, owners of Lot 111-34 came to enjoy the Right of Way over the Servient Tenement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In 1970, Hong Leong Holdings Ltd (“HLH”), the developer of Grange Heights and the MCST’s predecessor in title, acquired Lots 111-34 and 561. The two lots were amalgamated into Lot 687 in 1976. It should be noted that the residential units within Grange Heights were built on what was formerly Lot 561, while the tennis courts and changing rooms were constructed on what was formerly Lot 111-34. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Lee Tat, which was then known as Collin Development Pte Ltd (“Collin”), acquired Lots 111-32 and 111-33 in 1973.

At the time, Collin had recently acquired Lots 111-32 and 111-33, but did not own the Servient Tenement. Collin sought a declaration that HLH and its employees, as well as Grange Heights residents, were not entitled to use the Servient Tenement. HLH counterclaimed for a declaration that it enjoyed the Right of Way. The matter was heard at first instance by F A Chua J. In <span class="font-italic">Collin Development (Pte) Ltd v Hong Leong Holdings Ltd </span>[1974–1976] SLR(R) 618 (“<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 1</span><span class="font-italic">) (HC)</span>”), he dismissed Collin’s claim on the basis that HLH had not substantially interfered with Collin’s enjoyment of the Right of Way (at [22]). Chua J also dismissed HLH’s counterclaim on the ground that the declarations sought by HLH could not be made against Collin because the latter was not the owner of the Servient Tenement (at [24]). His decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Collin Development (Pte) Ltd v Hong Leong Holdings Ltd </span>[1974–1976] SLR(R) 806.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Second Action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The Second Action was commenced by the MCST in April 1989. By this time, Lots 111-34 and 561 had been amalgamated, the MCST had become the owner of Lot 687, and Collin had renamed itself Lee Tat. Lee Tat owned Lots 111-32 and 111-33, but it did not yet own the Servient Tenement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Second Action was prompted by Lee Tat’s instalment of an iron gate and fence across the ends of the Servient Tenement. The MCST reacted by applying for an injunction to restrain Lee Tat from restricting its access to the Servient Tenement. Lee Tat raised two contentions in response:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, that the amalgamation of Lot 111-34 and Lot 561 had extinguished the MCST’s Right of Way (“the Amalgamation Issue”); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) secondly, that Grange Heights residents were not entitled to use the Servient Tenement because the residential apartments stood on Lot 561, and the benefit of the Right of Way did not extend from Lot 111-34 to Lot 561, as the latter was not one of the Dominant Tenements (“the Extension Issue”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Second Action was heard by Punch Coomaraswamy J. In <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title</span><span class="font-italic"> Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd </span>[1990] 2 SLR(R) 634, Coomaraswamy J<span class="font-italic"> </span>held that the amalgamation of Lots 111-34 and 561 had not extinguished the MCST’s Right of Way (at [8]). He also found that Lee Tat was not entitled to close the Right of Way because it was not the owner of the Servient Tenement and did not complain of excessive use of the Servient Tenement (at [9]–[10]). He therefore granted an injunction restraining Lee Tat from interfering with the MCST’s Right of Way (at [11]). This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 </span>[1992] 3 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 2</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA)</span>”), which judgment was released in September 1992.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 It must be noted that<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">whilst Coomaraswamy J determined the Amalgamation Issue in favour of the MCST, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">he did not address the Extension Issue</span>. The Court of Appeal also did not address the Extension Issue in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 2</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA)</span>. The significance of this point will become clear shortly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Third and Fourth Actions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The Third Action was commenced on 4 June 2004 by the MCST. By this time, Lee Tat had become the owner of the Servient Tenement (in 1997). In the Third Action, the MCST sought a declaration that it was entitled to repair and maintain the Right of Way, which had allegedly fallen into disrepair.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Soon after the commencement of the Third Action, Lee Tat commenced the Fourth Action on 26 June 2004. It sought various reliefs, including a declaration that the Right of Way could not be used for access to Lot 687, and a permanent injunction preventing Grange Heights residents from using the Right of Way. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 By agreement of the parties, the Fourth Action was heard before the Third Action. In the proceedings, Lee Tat again raised the Extension Issue, submitting that the Right of Way could not be used for the benefit of Lot 561. In this regard, it cited <span class="font-italic">Harris v Flower and Sons </span>(1904) 91 LT 816 (“<span class="font-italic">Harris v Flower</span>”) for the principle that a right of way which is granted over a servient tenement in favour of a dominant tenement cannot be used for the purposes of a non-dominant tenement, as this would exceed the rights of the dominant owner as defined by the terms of the grant (“the <span class="font-italic">Harris v Flower </span>principle”). The Fourth Action was heard by Woo Bih Li J at first instance. His judgment is found at<span class="font-italic"> Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 </span>[2004] 4 SLR(R) 828 (“<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 4</span><span class="font-italic">) (HC)</span>”). Woo J held that the judgments in the Second Action had determined whether Grange Heights residents could use the Right of Way to gain access not only to Lot 111-34 but also to Lot 561 (at [30] and [37]). He considered that this gave rise to an issue estoppel which meant that Lee Tat was not entitled to raise this issue afresh in the Fourth Action (at [43]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed Woo J’s decision in the Fourth Action by a two-to-one majority. That decision is found at <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Management Corporation of Strata Title Plan No 301 </span>[2005] 3 SLR(R) 157 (“<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 4</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA)</span>”). The majority agreed with Woo J that an issue estoppel had arisen because the judgments in the Second Action had “finally and conclusively determined” that Grange Heights residents enjoyed the Right of Way over the Servient Tenement (<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 4</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>at [2]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Chao Hick Tin JA dissented, and took the view that no issue estoppel had arisen. He noted that the First and Second Actions had been decided at a time when Lee Tat was the owner of only two dominant tenements (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Lots 111-32 and 111-33), and not the owner of the Servient Tenement. The courts in the First and Second Action had therefore approached the issue purely as a matter of whether the use of the Servient Tenement by HLH or Grange Heights residents had interfered with Lee Tat’s rights and interests as owner of Lots 111-32 and 111-33 (at [68]–[69]). Yet the rights of the owner of a servient tenement were different from those of an owner of a dominant tenement, and the issue had not been decided as between the MCST and Lee Tat <span class="font-italic">in its capacity as owner of the Servient Tenement</span>. While Lee Tat had raised the Extension Issue in the Second Action, it had not been ruled upon because Lee Tat “could not really raise the issue of trespass”, given that its rights were, at the time, purely those of the owner of a dominant tenement (<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 4</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>at [74]). Therefore, Lee Tat was not estopped from re-litigating this issue (at [82]). Applying the <span class="font-italic">Harris v Flower </span>principle, Chao JA held that Grange Heights could not extend the Right of Way to benefit Lot 561 because under the terms of the original grant, the Right of Way applied to only Lot 111-34 (at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Following the conclusion of the Fourth Action, the Third Action came for hearing before Woo J. In <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title</span><span class="font-italic"> Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 554 (“<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 3</span><span class="font-italic">) (HC)</span>”), Woo J held that the MCST was entitled to repair and maintain the Servient Tenement (at [6]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Woo J’s decision was set aside by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 301 </span>[2009] 1 SLR(R) 875 (“<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 3</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA)</span>”). As the Judge noted, this was the point at which “[t]he tide turned” (see the Judgment at [23]). In that decision, this court held that the majority of the Court of Appeal in the Fourth Action had erred in finding that issue estoppel arose. This court agreed with Chao JA’s dissenting judgment in the Fourth Action (<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 3</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>at [44] and [67]). As Lee Tat’s arguments in these appeals rely heavily on what was decided by the Court of Appeal in the Third Action, we summarise the findings reached in that decision in some detail:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, there was no need for the High Court and the Court of Appeal in the Second Action to decide the Amalgamation Issue. The MCST and Lee Tat were, at the time, fellow owners of dominant tenements, and neither was in a position to question the existence of the Right of Way <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the other. Only an owner of the Servient Tenement could have done this. In so far as the courts in the Second Action had decided the Amalgamation Issue, such a decision bound Lee Tat only as the owner of Lots 111-32 and Lot 111-33, and not as the owner of the Servient Tenement (at [32(a)] and [32(e)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, there was no need for the courts in the First and Second Actions to determine the Extension Issue (at [41]). The courts in both actions had effectively ruled that Collin, and later Lee Tat, were not competent to raise the Extension Issue (at [45]). It was not the owner of the Servient Tenement and therefore had no <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>to raise the Extension issue. Thus, the decisions of the courts in the Second Action did not constitute a ruling on the merits of the Extension Issue (at [32(f)] and [32(g)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, any decisions made in the First and Second Actions could not have affected Lee Tat’s rights as servient owner after it acquired the Servient Tenement in 1997. Further, the Extension Issue had not been decided in the First and Second Actions. Thus, in the Fourth Action, Lee Tat was not estopped from litigating any issue affecting its interests in the Right of Way in its capacity as owner of the Servient Tenement, including the Extension Issue (at [43(f)] and [82]–[84]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, the judgment of the majority in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 4</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>contained an “egregious error” in so far as it stated that the Extension Issue had been decided in the MCST’s favour in the Second Action. This had caused the grave injustice of preventing Lee Tat from raising the Extension Issue in the Fourth Action. The <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception (see the House of Lords decision in <span class="font-italic">Arnold v National Westminster Bank </span><span class="font-italic">plc </span>[1991] 2 AC 93) therefore applied to the finding in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 4</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>that the Extension Issue was <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> (at [80]–[81]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Court of Appeal then considered both the Amalgamation Issue and the Extension Issue afresh. In so far as the Extension Issue was concerned, the court held that the MCST could not seek to extend the benefit of the Right of Way to Lot 561, which was a non-dominant tenement, as that would exceed the terms of the grant and therefore breach the <span class="font-italic">Harris v Flower </span>principle (<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 3</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>at [91]–[92]). In so far as the Amalgamation Issue was concerned, the court held that the Right of Way <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Lot 111-34 had been extinguished by operation of law as a result of the amalgamation of Lots 111-34 and 561 (<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 3</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>at [93]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Fifth Action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In June 2009, the MCST filed an application for an order to reconstitute the Court of Appeal to set aside its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 3</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA)</span>. It argued that there had been a breach of natural justice as the MCST had not been heard on the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception in the Third Action. It then filed an application to the High Court (“the Fifth Action”) to determine the preliminary question of whether the Court of Appeal could be reconstituted to hear an application to set aside its own judgment. The application was heard by Choo Han Teck J, who in <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title</span><span class="font-italic"> Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd </span>[2010] 1 SLR 645, held that the Court of Appeal should not be reconstituted, because even if the MCST had been deprived of an opportunity to be heard on the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception, this was not so grave a procedural wrong as to warrant reopening the case (at [11]). Choo J therefore dismissed the application. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title</span><span class="font-italic"> Plan No 301 v Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 998 (“<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 5</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA)</span>”), albeit based on different reasoning. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to explain the details of this court’s findings in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 5</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA)</span>. It should be noted, however, that one of the court’s reasons for affirming Choo J’s decision to dismiss the application by the MCST was that it would not serve any useful purpose to allow the application. The Court held that in so far as the application had been brought as a precursor to an attempt to set aside the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 3</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA)</span>, it would not serve any useful purpose because the Court in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 3</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>had set aside the judgment in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 4</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>not only based on the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception but on “three separate and distinct grounds” (<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 5</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>at [66]), including a finding that the Extension Issue had never been decided on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 As will become clear later in this judgment, Lee Tat relies heavily on that finding to convince this court that the Judge had erred in dismissing its claim in trespass in the present set of proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The present set of proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Lee Tat commenced the present set of proceedings on 24 December 2012. It claimed damages against the MCST in four causes of action: abuse of process, malicious prosecution, malicious falsehood and trespass. What follows is a brief summary of its case in the court below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 First, Lee Tat argued that the MCST had abused the court’s process by participating in the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Actions for the collateral purpose of enhancing the value of its land by retaining the Grange Heights address and name. This it sought to do by retaining access (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Right of Way)<span class="font-italic"> </span>to Grange Road through the Servient Tenement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Second, Lee Tat argued that the MCST had maliciously prosecuted the Third and Fifth Actions because the MCST did not genuinely believe that Grange Heights residents were entitled to use the Right of Way. Malice was made out in that the MCST had done this for the collateral purpose of retaining the Grange Heights address.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Third, Lee Tat asserted that the following two statements constituted malicious falsehoods by the MCST:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 12 October 1997, the Straits Times ran an article titled “Condo’s MC takes developer to court again”. Mr Rustom M Ghadiali, the then Chairman of the MCST, was quoted as saying that “the estate’s owners had the right to use the road forever – for walking as well as for driving”, and that “the residents could not give up the right to access because it was a valuable piece of land” (“the 1997 Statement”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 14 November 2007, the MCST’s property agents, Jones Lang LaSalle, placed an advertisement in the Straits Times regarding the sale of Grange Heights by tender. The advertisement stated that there was “[c]onvenient access from Grange Road” (“the 2007 Statement”).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">These will be collectively referred to as “the Statements”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Finally, Lee Tat’s claim in trespass was based on its complaint that Grange Heights residents had used the Servient Tenement to access Lot 561 continually until 1 December 2008 when, as <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span> had established, they were not entitled to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The Judge noted that it was unclear whether abuse of process was a recognised tort in Singapore and, if so, whether it was a cause of action capable of giving rise to a claim for damages. However, he found it unnecessary to decide these issues. In his view, even if this tort were recognised, the facts of this case would not even “fall within the scope of the English tort of abuse of process” (see the Judgment at [28]–[29]). The Judge reasoned that the wrong within the tort of abuse of process lay in a litigant bringing legal proceedings in order to seek some object which was <span class="font-italic">wholly extraneous </span>to the reliefs that might be ordered in those proceedings, and to achieve an outcome which was not reasonably related to victory in the suit (see the Judgment at [32]–[34]). The tort was therefore not made out on the facts. Even if the MCST’s primary purpose in the various proceedings was, as Lee Tat claimed, to retain Grange Heights’ name and address, that outcome was contingent on and related to the existence of the MCST’s purported Right of Way over the Servient Tenement, which was precisely the subject matter of the Second to Fifth Actions. Thus, the MCST could not be said to have abused the process of the court for an “improper or collateral purpose” (see the Judgment at [35]). The Judge also found that the MCST was genuinely interested in securing physical access to the Servient Tenement for the subsidiary proprietors of Grange Heights (see the Judgment at [38]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Malicious prosecution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Judge noted that the tort of malicious prosecution had been extended to civil proceedings generally in England following the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>and <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, but that there was uncertainty over the position in Singapore (see the Judgment at [40]–[41]). He declined to make a finding as to whether the tort should be extended to civil proceedings generally here because, in his view, the claim was clearly not made out on the facts (at [42]). To succeed, Lee Tat would have to show that (a) it was prosecuted by the MCST; (b) the prosecution was determined in its favour; (c) the prosecution was without reasonable and probable cause; and (d) the prosecution was malicious (see the Judgment at [43], citing the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin </span><span class="font-italic">Kuning and others v Chan Sin Mian Michael and another </span>[1996] 2 SLR(R) 858 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainal bin </span><span class="font-italic">Kuning</span>”) at [54]). The Judge found that two elements of the tort – that the prosecution must have been without reasonable and probable cause, and that the prosecution must have been malicious – were not satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 First, the MCST could not be said to have brought the previous actions “without reasonable and probable cause”. It was not “so obvious” that Grange Heights residents were not entitled to use the Right of Way that the MCST “could not have truly believed otherwise” (see the Judgment at [55]). In particular, it was not obvious from the judgments in the Second Action that the Extension Issue had been left undecided, such that the MCST could be said to have been acting without reasonable and probable cause in the Fourth Action (see the Judgment at [57] and [68]). It also could not be said that the MCST lacked reasonable and probable cause just because various individuals had expressed concerns at annual general meetings and management council meetings about whether Grange Heights residents were in fact entitled to the Right of Way. The mere fact that the MCST might have had doubts about its case did not amount to a lack of reasonable and probable cause (see the Judgment at [71]–[72]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Judge further held that malice was not made out. Malice meant “being motivated by improper and indirect considerations” and required proof that “the prosecution was motivated not by a desire to achieve justice, but for some other reason” (see the Judgment at [84], citing <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin </span><span class="font-italic">Kuning</span> at [84]). In the Judge’s view, the MCST had brought the Second to Fifth Actions for a <span class="font-italic">bona fide </span>purpose, because it “genuinely sought to have its alleged right of way over the Servient Tenement adjudicated” (see the Judgment at [90]). Even if, as Lee Tat suggested, the MCST’s primary motivation was to retain Grange Heights’ name and address, that did not constitute an improper motive. There “was nothing spiteful or vindictive about” the MCST’s commencement of the Second, Third and Fifth Actions [emphasis in original omitted] (see the Judgment at [87]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Malicious falsehood</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Judge accepted that the 1997 Statement and the 2007 Statement both amounted to assertions that Grange Heights residents enjoyed the benefit of the Right of Way (see the Judgment at [95]). However, he did not agree that the Statements amounted to malicious falsehoods. To begin with, he held that they were not false, because both were made at times when the MCST had obtained judgments which suggested that Grange Heights residents were entitled to the Right of Way. The 1997 Statement was made after the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Second Action, while the 2007 Statement was made after the decisions in the Second, Fourth and Third Actions. These decisions were in favour of the MCST (see the Judgment at [100]–[107]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Judge further held that the element of malice was not made out. Malice could be made out only where the words were published with the dominant intention of injuring the plaintiff (see the Judgment at [109], citing the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Golden Season Pte Ltd and others v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd</span> <span class="font-italic">and another</span> [2015] 2 SLR 751 (“<span class="font-italic">Golden Season</span>”) at [92]), or where the defendant knew that the statement complained of was false, or did not believe it was true, or had a “reckless disregard of the true facts” (see the Judgment at [109], citing the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Low Tuck </span><span class="font-italic">Kwong v Sukamto Sia </span>[2014] 1 SLR 639 at [82] and the High Court decision in <span class="font-italic">WBG Network (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Meridian Life International Pte Ltd and others</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 727 (“<span class="font-italic">WBG Network</span>”) at [72]). On the facts, there was nothing to suggest that the Statements had been made with the knowledge that they were false, or with reckless disregard to the truth, or with the predominant intention of injuring Lee Tat. Indeed, “the weight of judicial authority” at the time of the Statements was “firmly in favour of the MCST enjoying a right of way over the Servient Tenement” (see the Judgment at [110]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Trespass</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Judge dismissed the claim in trespass on the basis of the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, which required that “even erroneous decisions” be given effect to (see the Judgment at [121], citing the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN </span><span class="font-italic">Amro Bank NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporation Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1104 (“<span class="font-italic">TT International</span>”) at [71]). The only exception to the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> was the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception, which allowed the re-opening of a decision only to “affect <span class="font-italic">future</span> relief” [emphasis in original] (see the Judgment at [125]). In the Judge’s view, Lee Tat’s claim in trespass was not aimed at affecting future relief. Rather, it essentially “sought to undo the effect of <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (</span><span class="font-italic">No 4) (CA)</span>”, and this was impermissible (see the Judgment at [131]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues arising on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 On appeal, Lee Tat argues that the Judge was wrong to have dismissed all of its claims, and maintains that its claims in abuse of process, malicious prosecution, trespass and malicious falsehood should be allowed. It ultimately seeks to be compensated for the opportunity cost of not being able to develop Lot 111-31 from 1997 to 2008, and Lots 111-32 and 111-33 from 1974 to 2008. Unsurprisingly, the MCST’s position is that the Judge was correct to have dismissed Lee Tat’s claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In view of the above, the issues arising for consideration are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) with regard to Lee Tat’s claim for malicious prosecution, whether this tort should be extended to civil proceedings in Singapore, and if so, whether the tort is made out on the facts;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) with regard to Lee Tat’s claim for abuse of process, whether this tort should be recognised in Singapore, and if so, whether the tort is made out on the facts;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the tort of malicious falsehood is made out; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether Lee Tat is able to claim for trespass notwithstanding the fact that at the material time, the relevant judicial pronouncements were in favour of Grange Heights residents being entitled to the Right of Way. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span><span class="font-weight-bold">and </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> – </span><span class="font-weight-bold">a summary</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> of the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Before we address these issues, we find it appropriate to set out a summary of the facts in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Crawford Adjusters </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">and </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Willers</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> This is not only because we will be referring to the reasoning in these cases extensively, but also because the facts will, we think, impart a useful sense of the types of circumstance arising from toxic and irresponsible conduct of litigation, in respect of which even courts of the highest authority may be sharply divided over whether to give effect to the impulse to remedy the obvious injustice that the victim has suffered. This will appropriately foreshadow our attempt below to analyse whether giving effect to that impulse can in fact be justified as a matter of principle and policy, as well as our observations on why such an analysis is of the first importance. It will also be appreciated that the facts of the present case are, in any event, of a very different ilk from these cases, and this at least instinctively suggests that the redress sought here is far less (or even not) deserved, although for the reason just given, that in itself is not conclusive.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>, the plaintiff, Mr Alastair Paterson (“Mr Paterson”), acted as project manager and loss adjuster for the defendant insurer, Sagicor General Insurance (Cayman) Ltd (“Sagicor”), in relation to an insurance claim brought by a large residential development for damage sustained by the development during a hurricane. Mr Paterson was responsible for supervising and approving payments made to a firm of building contractors which had been engaged to carry out the restoration works. The contractors were responsible for procuring and paying for the subcontractors and the materials. To that end, they received a series of advance payments from Mr Paterson. After making advance payments totalling 2.9m worth of Cayman Islands Dollars (“KYD”), Mr Paterson advised Sagicor to settle the claim at KYD5.5m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Around this time, a Mr Frank Delessio (“Mr Delessio”) was appointed senior vice-president of Sagicor. Mr Delessio strongly disliked Mr Paterson and had a low opinion of his professional competence. Mr Delessio reviewed Mr Paterson’s recommendation that Sagicor settle the claim for KYD5.5m and found that it was insufficiently documented. He came to the view that Mr Paterson and the contractors had dishonestly overstated the value of the works. At about that time, Mr Delessio stated that he intended to drive Mr Paterson out of business and to destroy him professionally. He appointed another chartered surveyor and loss adjuster, Mr Purbrick, to assess the value of the restoration works. Mr Purbrick produced reports which suggested that the value of the works was significantly less than Mr Paterson had suggested. Sagicor’s lawyers advised, based on these reports, that the degree of overcharging by Mr Paterson was so gross as to be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence of fraud. Sagicor then commenced proceedings against Mr Paterson and the contractors, claiming damages for breach of contract, deceit, conspiracy to defraud and negligence. Mr Delessio deliberately alerted the local press to these allegations against Mr Paterson and the contractor. As a result of this, Mr Paterson suffered loss to his reputation and business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Just three months prior to the dates fixed for trial, the contractors disclosed invoices and other documentation which indicated that they had indeed made extensive payments to subcontractors and suppliers. Concerned that this information appeared to undermine Mr Purbrick’s reports, which had been the basis of Sagicor’s claim, Sagicor discontinued the action against Mr Paterson and the contractors. Mr Paterson, in turn, served an amended counterclaim against Sagicor, claiming damages for abuse of process. The matter was set down for trial but before the trial commenced, Mr Delessio committed suicide.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The trial judge noted that the torts of abuse of process and malicious prosecution were closely related and treated Mr Paterson as having relied on both torts in the alternative (even though Mr Paterson’s counterclaim was only for abuse of process). He held that the tort of abuse of process was not made out because Mr Delessio (whom he found to be the directing mind and will of Sagicor) unreasonably, but genuinely, believed that Mr Paterson had overstated the value of the restoration works. With regard to malicious prosecution, the trial judge held that Sagicor’s proceedings had been commenced without reasonable cause and were brought against Mr Paterson maliciously. Nevertheless, he disallowed Mr Paterson’s counterclaim on the basis that the tort of malicious prosecution did not extend to civil proceedings generally. The Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands affirmed these findings on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Mr Paterson appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. With regard to the tort of abuse of process, the Judges were unanimous in holding that the claim was not made out because Mr Delessio genuinely believed that Sagicor had been overcharged by Mr Paterson and the contractors, and there was no suggestion that Sagicor had no true intention of bringing the proceedings to trial. With regard to the tort of malicious prosecution, the appeal was allowed by a three-to-two majority, Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, Lord Wilson and Baroness Hale of Richmond finding that the tort should be recognised in the context of civil proceedings generally, and that its elements were established. The details of their reasoning will be explored later in this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Willers</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Next, in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, the plaintiff, Mr Peter Willers (“Mr Willers”), was employed by Mr Albert Gubay (“Mr Gubay”), a successful businessman, as his right hand man for over 20 years until he was dismissed in 2009. One of Mr Gubay’s businesses was a leisure company, Langstone Leisure Ltd (“Langstone”). Mr Willers was a director of Langstone. Prior to Mr Willers’s dismissal, Langstone pursued an action for wrongful trading against the directors of another company, Aqua Design and Play Ltd (“Aqua”), which had gone into liquidation. On Mr Gubay’s instructions, Langstone’s action against Aqua’s directors was abandoned shortly before trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In 2010, Langstone sued Mr Willers for breach of contractual and fiduciary duties in causing it to incur costs in the action against the directors of Aqua. Mr Willers issued a third party claim for an indemnity against Mr Gubay on the grounds that he had acted under Mr Gubay’s instructions in pursuing the claim against Aqua’s directors. On 28 March 2013, two weeks before trial, Langstone discontinued the action against Mr Willers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Mr Willers brought proceedings against Mr Gubay, claiming damages for malicious prosecution of the claim brought against him by Langstone. Mr Gubay sought an order striking out the claim on the sole ground that malicious prosecution did not extend to civil proceedings generally. The judge agreed and struck out the action. Mr Willers appealed. While the appeal was pending, however, Mr Gubay died. His executors were substituted as defendants to the action and respondents to the appeal. The matter came before the UK Supreme Court. By a five-to-four majority, the court allowed the appeal, holding that the tort of malicious prosecution did extend to civil proceedings generally. Mr Willers’s claim thus proceeded to trial and, as we have noted earlier, the dispute is winding its way through the English courts (see [5] above). Again, we will explore the judges’ reasoning in greater detail below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Having set out this overview of the two cases which recognised, by a bare majority, the extension of the tort of malicious prosecution to civil proceedings generally under English law, we turn to the question of whether we should likewise recognise such an extension of that tort in the Singapore context.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Malicious prosecution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It is undoubtedly the case that a civil cause of action for the malicious prosecution of <span class="font-italic">criminal</span> proceedings exists in this jurisdiction. Indeed, this is expressly recognised in s 359(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”), which provides that the court’s power to order that an accused be compensated by the prosecution or the complainant for a frivolous and vexatious prosecution “shall not affect any right to a claim for civil damages for malicious prosecution”. There are strongly principled reasons why such a claim is recognised. Cases involving such egregious situations are (fortunately) few and far between, as the number of reported and unreported cases demonstrate. Indeed, the principal justification is to deter (as well as compensate for damage caused by) the <span class="font-italic">abuse of state power</span>. The issue, however, is whether the tort of malicious prosecution ought to be extended to proceedings which are strictly within the <span class="font-italic">civil sphere</span>, which are quite different from criminal proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 We shall begin with some general observations on the nature of the reasoning that should be employed in resolving this issue. We are compelled to do so because in the majority judgments in both <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> and <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, there is a noticeable emphasis on the broad notion that every wrong deserves a remedy, and on the influence of previous cases on the existence and on the development of the tort as it stands today. The latter is, of course, a characteristic feature of common law reasoning, but it has proper limits which need from time to time to be articulated. And for reasons that we shall explain, it is our view that the issue at hand ought to be resolved primarily by considering the relevant <span class="font-italic">specific</span> arguments of principle and policy, in contrast to pure deference to the decided cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">General observations</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Every wrong deserves a remedy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 A significant theme of the majority judgments in <span class="font-italic">Crawford</span> <span class="font-italic">Adjusters </span>is the proposition that wrongs should be remedied. This proposition was referred to by Lord Wilson in his leading judgment as the “reason” for the law’s existence which “the arguments against renewed recognition of a tort of malicious prosecution of civil proceedings fail to override” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [73]). Lord Kerr perceived the issue in that case in even broader terms, taking the view that “fundamental principle has a large part to play in the resolution of the debate in this case”, and that “the pre-eminent principle at stake here is that for every injustice there should be remedy at law” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [94]). With respect, while such propositions may be attractive at first blush, deeper consideration reveals that they are not a suitable guide for a proper resolution of the issue whether to recognise a new tort.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The fundamental difficulty with the proposition that every wrong deserves a remedy is that it presupposes that the damage that has been suffered constitutes a legal wrong that deserves a legal remedy. To put the matter in the converse, it presupposes that the person who has suffered the damage has a legal right to the remedy he seeks. But whether or not there is a “legal wrong” or a “legal right” in this sense is precisely the issue in question. And in order for the court to answer that question, it must decide whether there are good arguments from authority, principle and policy for recognising the legal wrong or the legal right. This means that the assertion that when a wrong has been committed, there ought in principle to be a remedy, is no more than a mere assertion. One may easily elicit agreement with it, but one would equally be none the wiser thereafter as to the underpinnings of that proposition with respect to the specific legal right or legal wrong in question. In this connection, we agree with the following observations of Baroness Hale in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>, who, significantly, was also in the majority along with Lords Wilson and Kerr (at [81]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is always tempting to pray in aid what Sir Thomas Bingham MR referred to as “the rule of public policy which has first claim on the loyalty of the law: that wrongs should be remedied”: <span class="font-italic">X </span><span class="font-italic">(Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council</span> [1995] 2 AC 633, 663. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">But by itself that wise dictum does not tell us what the law should define as a wrong. </span><span class="font-italic">Some conduct is wrongful whether or not it causes any damage – that is the essence of the tort or torts of trespass; other conduct is only wrongful if it causes particular types of damage – that was the essence of the action on the case; </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">but not all conduct which causes such damage is wrongful</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> The tort or torts of wrongfully bringing legal proceedings are actions on the case and therefore can only lie if there is damage of the kinds specified in <span class="font-italic">Savile v Roberts</span> (1698) 1 Ld Raym 374. But that is not enough. Instigating legal proceedings in good faith and with reasonable cause, even if they fail and even if they do damage in the <span class="font-italic">Savile v Roberts</span> sense, is not wrongful. Even maliciously instigating legal proceedings is not always, or even often, wrongful. So how is the wrong done by instituting legal proceedings to be defined? [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The dangers of providing a remedy without proper justification are well known, the chief of which is that the courts may create “bad law”, that is, the court may cause the law to develop in a way that adversely complicates other areas of law and creates new injustices. As Lord Mance observed in his dissenting judgment in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [93]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Viewed in isolation, the assumed facts of this case make it attractive to think that the appellant should have a legal remedy. But the <span class="font-italic">wider implications require close consideration</span>. We must beware of the risk that hard cases make bad law… [emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In a similar vein, Lord Reed opined in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that “major steps in the development of the common law should not be taken without <span class="font-italic">careful consideration of the implications</span>, however much sympathy one may feel for the particular claimant” [emphasis added]<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [184]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The upshot is that we must eschew broad statements of principle in so far as they purport to be <span class="font-italic">specific</span> <span class="font-italic">justifications</span> for a tort of malicious prosecution in civil proceedings generally. We do not deny that considerations of justice and fairness are crucial to the inquiry. However, the tort that the court is being asked to recognise must be undergirded by specific and coherent arguments of legal principle or policy (see <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> at [178]<span class="font-italic"> per </span>Lord Sumption).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Influence of case law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Another significant theme of many of the judgments in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> and <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> is a reliance on case law as pointing towards either the existence of a general tort of malicious prosecution of civil proceedings or the non-existence of such a tort. While we do not think that any of those judgments can be fairly criticised for relying on precedent as the decisive reason for their conclusions, we consider it appropriate to observe here that where a new legal cause of action is sought to be recognised for the first time, precedent tends to serve a limited role. This observation encompasses several strands of thought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 First, where there is a serious and genuine argument that the cause of action in question is new, the general body of cases behind that cause of action is likely to be equivocal in effect. As a result, placing too much reliance on those cases is unlikely to be productive. Nor will much come from making absolute statements about their effect. For example, Baroness Hale in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> was prepared to say in relation to the tort of malicious civil prosecution that the view that “such a wrong has been recognised by the law for centuries is incontrovertible” (at [83]). However, it is plain from the analysis of the cases undertaken by Lord Sumption in that case, and by Lord Mance in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, that that view is in fact quite controvertible. That explains the more measured observation made by Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> that “the early case law is capable of more than one respectable interpretation, and it may be that there was never a time when there was a general understanding precisely where the boundaries of the tort lay” (at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Second, the number of cases that go one way or another is at best a <span class="font-italic">quantitative</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>measure. What is more important are the <span class="font-italic">qualitative</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>aspects of the relevant cases – in particular, whether they embody sound logic and principle. Indeed, in so far as this court is concerned, it is, <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>, not bound by any<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">foreign</span> decision. What matters, in the final analysis, is whether or not there are sound legal arguments, based on first principles, that justify the extension of the tort of malicious prosecution to civil proceedings generally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 While case law is the lifeblood of the common law system, it is not important for its own sake (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span><span class="font-italic"> Investment Pte Ltd v Wealthplus Pte Ltd and others and another matter </span>[2016] 2 SLR 1022 at [1]), and it is certainly not sacrosanct – except to the extent that it is binding pursuant to the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">stare decisis</span> (which is itself also subject to exceptions in any event). Indeed, even the majority in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> admitted that the early case law it referred to was departed from in the English Court of Appeal decision in <span class="font-italic">Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Co v Eyre </span>(1883) 11 QBD 674 (“<span class="font-italic">Quartz Hill</span>”), although they were of the view that <span class="font-italic">Quartz Hill</span> marked a wrong turn in the legal road. However, this, in and of itself, demonstrates that the case law did not unambiguously point in one direction. It should also be pointed out that in <span class="font-italic">Quartz Hill </span>itself, Bowen LJ was of the view that there was “no decisive authority” (at 691) for the broad proposition that an action could be maintained in civil proceedings generally pursuant to the tort of malicious prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 None of this is to say that historical analysis of the relevant case law is not profitable. The common law as it stands is very much what the judges of the past have made of it, and any development or divergence ought to be pursued with a firm understanding of how the law came to be. That being said, the direction of that pursuit is very much up to the judges of today, and the only rational way in which the proper direction might be decided is by reference to <span class="font-italic">specific arguments o</span><span class="font-italic">f principle and policy</span>. With this in mind, we turn now to explain the ways in which the existing cases <span class="font-italic">shape </span>(without <span class="font-italic">determining</span>) our consideration of the question whether the tort of malicious prosecution ought to be extended to civil proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lessons from history</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The historical development of the tort of malicious prosecution was the subject of detailed analysis and conflicting interpretations in both <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> and <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>. As mentioned at [8] above, the judges in the majority in each case considered that, on the authorities, the tort of malicious prosecution <span class="font-italic">had </span>historically<span class="font-italic"> </span>been recognised in the civil sphere on a general basis, while the minority took the contrary view. We do not see the profit of repeating that analytical exercise in full measure here because ultimately, as Lord Reed correctly said in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, the court must not lose sight of the fact that that it is deciding the law for the 21st century (at [182]). We will, however, state that we prefer the analyses of the case law that was developed in the leading minority judgments in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> and <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, namely, those of Lord Sumption and Lord Mance, respectively. In particular, Lord Sumption’s analysis of the cases established that the tort of malicious prosecution had been formulated <span class="font-italic">only </span>with regard to the criminal sphere (see <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [136]–[144], as well as Christian Witting, <span class="font-italic">Street on Torts </span>(Oxford University Press, 14th Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Street</span>”) at p 608). We consider that these historical perspectives do shape the issue at hand in two significant ways. First, they demonstrate that the tort’s true rationale is to afford a private remedy for the abuse of state power. Second, the cases demonstrate that the tort has been extended to civil proceedings only in so far as they concerned applications (usually for <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> interlocutory remedies) which have the potential to cause immediate and irreversible damage to the person, property or reputation of the respondent. There is therefore no doubt that an extension of the tort to civil proceedings generally would overreach its historical provenance, and must be justified by cogent reasons of principle and policy.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Rationale of the tort</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 We agree with Lord Sumption that historically speaking, “the rationale of the tort … lie[s] in the public character<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the function performed by the prosecutor” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [139]). The tort arose because until the 1830s in England, almost all prosecutions were carried out by private individuals. The private prosecutor did, however, bring his indictment in the name of the Crown, and therefore performed “an essentially public function” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [136]). That is why malice is a component of liability, because it “negative[s] the public character<span class="font-italic"> </span>of the prosecutor’s performance of his functions, and expose[s] him to liability which would not have attached to proper albeit misguided performance of a public function” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [142]). The tort was recognised in, and confined to, the criminal sphere in order to ensure that private prosecutions were not abused, since they involved the invocation of coercive state power.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Although responsibility for the conduct of criminal prosecutions has been largely transferred to a public prosecutor – this being true both in England and in Singapore – the risk of abuse remains real. That much is recognised by Parliament in s 359(5) of the CPC, as we have seen (at [59] above). One of the ways of mitigating that risk is the availability of the tort of malicious prosecution. As one writer has put it (see Chuks Okpaluba, “‘Prosecution’ in an action for malicious prosecution: a discussion of recent commonwealth case law” [2013] J S Afr L 236 at p 236):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Through the action for malicious prosecution <span class="font-italic">the state is held accountable for the acts of prosecutors who do not enjoy absolute immunity</span> for violating the liberty of the person and the human dignity arising from botched prosecution. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The historical rationale for the tort invites the question whether the differences between the criminal process and the civil process suggest anything about whether recognising a general tort of malicious prosecution of civil proceedings would be a <span class="font-italic">principled </span>step for the law to take. This is a question we examine in detail at [86]–[92] below. But before considering that particular issue, it is important to recognise that there are cases in which the tort has in fact been successfully established in civil proceedings, and therefore the issue that must first be addressed is the true import of those cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">A rational list of </span>ex parte<span class="font-italic"> processes</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In our judgment, the cases just mentioned do <span class="font-italic">not</span> support the existence of a <span class="font-italic">general</span> tort of malicious prosecution in civil proceedings. The question of what to make of them is succinctly captured in Baroness Hale’s suggestion in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [86] that they are either a “rag bag” or a “rational list of ex parte processes which do damage before they can be challenged”. Lord Sumption (at [143]) and Lord Neuberger (at [178]) preferred the latter view (as did a number of other judges in earlier cases as well as in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>). As we shall explain in the following paragraphs, we are inclined to agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The cases in question have arisen in the following situations which were summarised by Lord Wilson in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>(at [67]): (a) a petition for bankruptcy (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Court of Exchequer’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Emerson and Sparrow </span>(1871) 6 LR Ex 329); (b) a petition for winding up (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Quartz Hill </span>as well as the Scottish decision of <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Seaspray” Steamship Company Limited v Tenant </span>1908 SLT 874); (c) a writ to arrest and detain a judgment debtor who had already paid the debt (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Court of Common Pleas decision of <span class="font-italic">Gilding v Eyre</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>(1861) 10 CBNS 592 (“<span class="font-italic">Gilding</span>”)); (d) the procurement of a bench warrant to arrest and produce a person for failure to respond to a witness summons which had not been served on him (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Roy v Prior</span> [1971] AC 470); (e) a writ to arrest a ship in the course of a dispute about a contract for its sale (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the decision of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty division of the English High Court in <span class="font-italic">The Walter D Wallet </span>[1893] P 202); (f) a writ to arrest an aircraft in the course of a dispute about an alleged lease of it (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the New Zealand High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Transpac</span><span class="font-italic"> Express Ltd v Malaysian Airlines </span>[2005] 3 NZLR 709; (g) an order for the attachment of a plaintiff’s assets in advance of an arbitration (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Congentra</span><span class="font-italic"> AG v Sixteen Thirteen Marine SA (The Nicholas M) </span>[2009] 1 All ER (Comm) 479; and (h) a search warrant (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the Privy Council’s decision (on appeal from the Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands) in <span class="font-italic">Brian Gibbs</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v John Mitchell Rea </span>[1998] 1 AC 786).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The basic feature of these cases appears not to be controversial. Thus, in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Gregory v Portsmouth City Council </span>[2000] 1 AC 419 (“<span class="font-italic">Gregory</span>”), Lord Steyn observed their common feature to be “the initial ex parte abuse of legal process with arguably immediate and perhaps irreversible damage to the reputation of the victim” (at 427). In <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>, Lord Sumption described those cases as “involv[ing] ex parte interlocutory orders improperly procured by the person initiating the proceedings, in circumstances where in the nature of things there would never be a final order” (at [143]). In the same case, Lord Neuberger added that because the processes involved were <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> or interlocutory, “they could quite conceivably have been granted in proceedings which could subsequently be established as having been ‘malicious’” (at [178]). And in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, Lord Mance accepted that “[t]here is a range of cases in which the ex parte misuse of civil procedures, with immediate effects on the other party’s person, property or business, has grounded a tortious claim for malicious prosecution” (at [129]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In summary, most of these cases (subject to exceptions which we will touch upon in a moment) involved the improper procuring in the first instance of <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> interlocutory orders by the party initiating the proceedings, the effect of which is (potentially at least) to inflict immediate and perhaps even irreversible damage to the reputation of the other party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 As for the cases which have recognised the tort of malicious prosecution in respect of bankruptcy and winding up proceedings, although these cases have not involved the improper procurement of <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> interlocutory <span class="font-italic">orders</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>they are in a similar category in so far as the legal requirement of advertisement placed the petitioners in a position to inflict irreversible damage on the other party by unilaterally and publicly impugning his credit and reputation before the petition was heard on the merits. Thus, in <span class="font-italic">Quartz Hill</span>, Brett MR noted that under regulations made pursuant to the Companies Act 1862 (c 89) (UK), a winding up petitioner was required to advertise the petition seven days before it was to be heard (at 685) (this is also the position in Singapore – see r 24 of the Companies (Winding Up) Rules (Cap 50, R 1, 2006 Rev Ed)). Such advertisement meant that there was potential for damage to the credit (and consequent business reputation) of the company, in advance of actual hearings where the allegations as well as imputations of insolvency could be defended (<span class="font-italic">Quartz Hill </span>at 685 and at 692–693 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Bowen LJ; and see generally Andrew Keay, “Claims for malicious presentation: the peril lurking on the sidelines for petitioning creditors” (2001) 4 Insolvency Lawyer 136). Brett MR considered that the position was similar in respect of bankruptcy proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act 1869 (c 62) (UK), where “a man’s fair fame is injured … because he is openly charged with insolvency before he can defend himself” (<span class="font-italic">Quartz Hill</span> at 684 and at 691−692 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Bowen LJ).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 We note that in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>, Baroness Hale appeared to accept the view that the cases could be viewed as a “rational list of ex parte processes which do damage before they can be challenged”. However, her Ladyship <span class="font-italic">then</span> used this proposition to build the claim that a general tort of malicious prosecution of civil proceedings existed, reasoning that “today bringing an ordinary action can also do damage before it can be challenged” (at [86]). We respectfully disagree that the cases justify this view. Whilst it is true that “ordinary actions” may also cause damage before they are challenged, the law (rightly, in our view) continues to recognise <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>interlocutory processes as a special type of proceedings which are especially capable of causing damage and which carry a particularly high risk of abuse. That is clear from the fact that a special practice has developed in relation to many types of <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>and interlocutory orders, in that they are typically accompanied by cross-undertakings as to damages which may be called on if the order is found to have been wrongly obtained. This serves only to <span class="font-italic">underscore </span>the fact that these cases constitute a distinctive class of civil remedies, which explains the <span class="font-italic">unique</span> treatment which they have received in relation to claims for malicious prosecution. The fact that malice is irrelevant to the defendant’s entitlement to damages in these cases only raises the question as to why malice should be relevant with regard to civil proceedings more generally (see <span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [160] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Neuberger).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In our view, there is also sound reason why the courts have treated winding up proceedings as being in an exceptional class of proceedings which may result in tortious liability where maliciously commenced. The historical requirement highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Quartz Hill</span> that such applications be <span class="font-italic">advertised </span>is significant not only because the requirement of advertisement itself engenders a risk of reputational harm, but also because this requirement points to the <span class="font-italic">special</span><span class="font-italic">, collective character</span> of such applications as going beyond the usual assertion of <span class="font-italic">personal rights </span>in ordinary civil proceedings. This was noted by Hoffmann J (as he then was) in the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">RA Foulds Limited </span>(1986) 2 BCC 99, 269 at 275:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It is frequently said that in presenting a petition the creditor is not merely exercising a <span class="font-italic">personal right </span>but a <span class="font-italic">class right on behalf of all creditors. </span>That is why the petition is advertised, so that other creditors may have the opportunity to come in and oppose or support the making of the winding-up order, and on the hearing of the petition any winding-up order that is made is deemed to be made on behalf of all creditors and contributories. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Whereas ordinary civil proceedings imply that the defendant is personally liable to the plaintiff, winding up proceedings, which invite all of the defendant’s creditors to take a position in relation to the debts owed to them by the defendant company, imply that the defendant stands in a particular status in relation to all of these creditors, and not only in relation to the applicant. That would ordinarily have a tremendous effect on the defendant’s credit and reputation. It follows that “civil actions cannot be said to have the same inevitable or necessary effect on trading or any other reputation as a winding up petition” (<span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [123] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Mance). Indeed, our courts have noted that the mere commencement of winding-up applications can carry drastic consequences (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Ting </span><span class="font-italic">Shwu Ping (administrator of the estate of Chng Koon Seng, deceased) v Scanone Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 95 at [54]). Such consequences may take the shape of damage not only to the company’s reputation but also to its financial position, since such applications <span class="font-italic">imply </span>insolvency and are almost invariably considered to be “events of default” which trigger certain implications under most modern loan arrangements (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the decision of this court in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Metalform Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 268 at [84]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The most significant alternative perspective on the cases that was used to justify the existence of the tort generally in the civil context was Lord Clarke’s in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>. His Lordship was not persuaded that the cases could be unified by a common thread, principally because there existed claims for damages for the wrongful arrest of a ship, and those claims were “not limited to claims for security” obtained on an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>basis (see <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> at [68]). And the availability of this type of claim, in his Lordship’s view, in fact supported the existence of a general tort of malicious prosecution of civil proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 We also respectfully disagree with this view. The<span class="font-italic"> </span>arrest of ships (and other vessels, such as aircraft) may be treated as a jurisdiction which is <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span>, not least because the arrest of a vessel is recognised as a particularly “invasive remedy” which may have drastic economic consequences for ship owners (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">The “</span><span class="font-italic">Vasiliy Golovnin” </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 at [51]; see also Toh Kian Sing, <span class="font-italic">Admiralty Law and Practice </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) at p 205). To that extent, while Lord Clarke’s points are well taken, his Lordship’s analysis does not<span class="font-italic"> </span>impact in an adverse way the thesis that we have tentatively accepted to the effect that what appear like seemingly disparate situations could – with the possible exception of the arrest of vessels – be unified by a common thread as defined at [76] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 For this reason, we consider that in so far as there is case law recognising the tort of malicious prosecution in relation to <span class="font-italic">specific </span>types of civil proceedings, these situations ought to continue as part of Singapore law. This is <span class="font-italic">a fortiori </span>the case in relation to the arrest of ships. We hasten to add that we would be very reluctant to extend or expand these situations or categories, absent extremely persuasive reasons. In this regard, we also bear in mind Lord Neuberger’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> (at [195]) that “[o]nce … the exceptions are logically explained, it is harder to justify departing from the rule or adding to the exceptions other than on a logical basis”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 More broadly, we agree with Lord Neuberger in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> that the boundaries of the tort, as applied to civil proceedings, have “always been heavily circumscribed and have (on any view) been treated by the courts as heavily circumscribed since 1883”, and that this “places a tolerably heavy burden on the appellant’s argument that those boundaries should, in effect, be removed, or at least substantially widened” (at [154]). For reasons that we shall now explain, principle and policy do <span class="font-italic">not</span> justify any such widening.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reasons of principle</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Criminal versus civil proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In our view, there are essential differences between criminal and civil prosecutions, both in terms of their <span class="font-italic">character </span>and their <span class="font-italic">consequence</span>, which justify maintaining the distinction as to whether they are capable of giving rise to claims in malicious prosecution. We therefore respectfully differ from the views of those who see the distinction as no barrier to extending the tort (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [39] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Wilson, at [87] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Baroness Hale, and at [104] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Kerr).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The <span class="font-italic">character </span>of a criminal prosecution, carried out with a view to punishing a public wrong, is fundamentally different from that of a civil prosecution which is carried out with a view to vindicating a private right. The difference between these two types of proceedings was explained in the following passage from an earlier decision of this court, <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v UI </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 at [52]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… With the reign of William the Conqueror, the [English] criminal justice system, as it then stood, changed drastically. A distinction was created between liability for private wrongs and liability for public wrongs. Sir William Blackstone explained clearly the distinction between public wrongs and private wrongs in <span class="font-italic">Commentaries on the Laws of England </span>vol 4 (A Strahan, 15th Ed, 1809) as follows (at p5):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[P]rivate wrongs, or civil injuries, are an infringement or [a] privation of the civil rights which belong to individuals, con[s]idered merely as individuals: public wrongs, or crimes and [misdemeanours] are a breach and violation <span class="font-italic">of the public rights and duties, due to the whole community, con[s]</span><span class="font-italic">idered as a community, in [its social] aggregate capacity.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As a result of the above change in the English criminal justice system, the individual victim was replaced by the State. The offence was considered to be committed against the State and the liability of the offender was, accordingly, owed first and foremost to the State. <span class="font-italic">This is the criminal justice system which Singapore has inherited and maintains to this day.</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 This difference in character carries with it several important consequences. First, criminal prosecution almost always has more serious effects than civil proceedings on the defendant’s reputation. A message is conveyed to the public when a charge is laid that the person in question has been accused of committing a wrong against the community at large and often against an alleged victim that makes him worthy of punishment. By contrast, no stigma of this nature generally arises when a person is sued in civil proceedings. While we do not deny that a civil suit can sometimes result in serious reputational harm to the defendant, as Prof Gary Chan (“Prof Chan”), the <span class="font-italic">amicus curiae</span>, correctly points out, that usually happens when the substance of the action is capable of some kind of criminal (or quasi-criminal) characterisation as well, such as fraud.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Second, the legal consequences of a successful criminal prosecution are usually more invasive of a defendant’s rights than civil proceedings. An accused person may have his property seized, liberty deprived, or life taken as a result of his conviction (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohd </span><span class="font-italic">Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan</span> [2018] 1 SLR 544 at [60]). By no measure is this range of consequences equal in potential gravity to the consequences of losing a civil suit. This is partly why a charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt before a conviction on it can be secured. Moreover, the gravity of those consequences is felt even before they are imposed for the accused will be having to bear the weight of anticipating the worst during the prosecution itself. Again, we are not suggesting that civil defendants are free from anxiety. But their situation, in our estimation, is meaningfully different from that of an accused in the dock awaiting a pronouncement on his alleged guilt.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Third, criminal prosecution is principally carried out in this jurisdiction by public authorities. Under Art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint), “[t]he Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence”. Right-thinking members of society are likely to attach, and indeed would be justified if they attached, credibility and weight to the fact that a criminal charge has been laid against an individual. This exacerbates the two effects of being subject to criminal prosecution that we have outlined above. In this respect, the contrast with civil proceedings could not be clearer given that they are, in the main, commenced by private individuals against each other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In our judgment, the public character<span class="font-italic"> </span>and harsh consequences<span class="font-italic"> </span>of criminal proceedings undergird the law’s recognition that those who suffer damage at the hands of prosecutors who abuse their function for malicious or improper motives are<span class="font-italic"> </span>deserving of a remedy. The tort is also a “tool for constraining the arbitrary exercise of the powers of public prosecuting authorities” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [145] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Sumption). Because<span class="font-italic"> </span>prosecutors are office holders who exercise public functions and in so doing take on the mantle of the public and community at large, the power which they wield, and the need to guard against abuses of such power, justify the recognition of malicious prosecution in respect of criminal proceedings. For these reasons, we are unable to agree with the suggestion that “the distinction between bringing criminal proceedings in the public interest and bringing civil proceedings in one’s own private interest [does not] make much sense today, if it ever did” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [87]<span class="font-italic"> per </span>Baroness Hale).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 We reiterate that we do not deny that unmeritorious and maliciously brought civil proceedings<span class="font-italic"> </span>may <span class="font-italic">also</span> cause defendants damage. Indeed, a maliciously brought civil suit may cause a defendant not only the “‘inconvenience and embarrassment’, normally caused by litigation” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [176] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Neuberger, citing the decision of the Supreme Court of Texas in <span class="font-italic">Texas Beef Cattle Co v Green </span>(1996) 921 SW 2d 203 at 208), but significant economic and reputational damage as well, as is clear from the facts of <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>. But we are not persuaded that the risk that such injury will go without remedy is sufficient to outweigh the many problems discussed below that will arise if the tort is extended to civil proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Malice in the law of tort</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 We also agree with Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>(at [133]−[135]) that extending the tort to malicious prosecution is inconsistent with the principle that malice is generally irrelevant in the context of tort law (see also <span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [137] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Mance). The principle, specifically, is that if an act is lawful, however ill the motive might be, a person has the right to do it (see the seminal House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">The Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the borough of Bradford v Edward Pickles</span> [1895] 1 AC 587 at 594 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Halsbury LC). Lord Sumption noted in <span class="font-italic">Crawford</span> <span class="font-italic">Adjusters</span> (at [133]) that the point was restated by Lord Watson in the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Thomas Francis A</span><span class="font-italic">llen v William Cridge Flood and Walter Taylor </span>[1898] 1 AC 1 at 92 where the latter said that “[a]lthough the rule may be otherwise with regard to crimes, the law of England does not … take into account motive as constituting an element of civil wrong”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 This general principle is, in our judgment, a salutary and well-established principle of the law of tort because it serves fundamentally to protect the freedom of the individual to perform lawful acts for any reason of his choosing. Thus, it is entirely lawful for a person to commence civil proceedings against another person. If those proceedings turn out to be unmeritorious then he will face the usual procedural as well as costs consequences. It is not clear why just because he commences those proceedings with malice or some other untoward motivation, he ought thereby to be civilly liable to the person against whom those proceedings have been commenced. Of course, the tort of malicious prosecution has other elements, but those elements are concerned essentially with proving the lack of foundation of what would otherwise have been a perfectly lawful act of commencing proceedings. Therefore, to the extent that malice is a defining element of the tort – and clearly it is – the tort is an anomalous one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> identified two significant exceptions in the law of tort where malice is relevant. The first relates to the tort of conspiracy to injure but, as his Lordship correctly points out (at [134]), this particular tort “has generally been regarded as <span class="font-italic">sui generis</span>, and is usually justified by reference to the especially pernicious effect of combinations” [emphasis added]. Lord Sumption then proceeds to consider the second exception which, in his view, “comprises a limited category of causes of action in which <span class="font-italic">the essence</span> of the tort is <span class="font-italic">the abuse of a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">public</span><span class="font-italic"> function for some collateral purposes of the person performing it</span>” and that “[t]his may be (and generally is) <span class="font-italic">established by proof of targeted malice</span>” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] – of which “[t]he paradigm case is the tort of misfeasance in public office” (at [134]). Lord Sumption then observes (at [135]) that “[i]t is to this latter category of malice-based torts that the action for malicious prosecution belongs”. Indeed, <span class="font-italic">the concept of malice</span> enables the court to <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">balance</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>the need to ensure that the public good is achieved by bringing criminals to book on the one hand and the need to prevent abuse that results in the violation of individual liberty on the other (a point that we have already explored in some detail above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 It is clear that the second exception referred to in the preceding paragraph, being related as it is to the abuse of a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">public</span> <span class="font-italic">function</span>, rests on a <span class="font-italic">very narrow</span> basis indeed (Edwin Peel and James Goudkamp, <span class="font-italic">Winfield and </span><span class="font-italic">Jolowicz on Tort</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2014) (“<span class="font-italic">Winfield and </span><span class="font-italic">Jolowicz</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>refer to this (at para 20-21) as the “public law conception” of the tort of malicious prosecution). Put simply, under these<span class="font-italic"> special and limited</span> circumstances, the courts are prepared to permit a claim under the tort of <span class="font-italic">malicious prosecution</span>.<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>The corollary of this is that the tort of malicious prosecution ought <span class="font-italic">not</span> to be extended to cover situations in the civil sphere generally (<span class="font-italic">Winfield and </span><span class="font-italic">Jolowicz</span> refer to this (at para 20-21) as the “private conception” of the tort of malicious prosecution). To proceed otherwise would be not only to wholly ignore the extremely limited role that malice plays in the law of tort but also to extend what is in essence an action intended to restrain abuse of a <span class="font-italic">public</span> function into the <span class="font-italic">private</span> sphere – and without let or hindrance, save to the extent that the plaintiff must establish, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, a lack of reasonable and probable cause as well as malice. This brings us to the next (and closely related) point – which relates to the uncertainties surrounding the concept of malice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 On that point, as Lord Mance points out in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> (at [138]–[139]), the facts of <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>demonstrate that malice may be established based on the (original) plaintiff’s dominant motive to injure, notwithstanding the fact that he may believe the claim to be well founded and may intend to injure the defendant by pursuing it to judgment. The concept of malice, as developed in the case law, does <span class="font-italic">not </span>require that the original plaintiff actually appreciate that his claim was unfounded, so long as he objectively lacked reasonable and probable cause (<span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [139]). However, such a conception, in his Lordship’s view, “opens the door to wider claims, to wider exposure and to wider risks of misuse” (at [139]). Lord Mance also points out that the fact that malice must entail a dominant motive on the part of the (original) plaintiff to injure the (original) defendant “opens the door to future litigation about the meaning of dominant motive” (at [140]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Hence, the concept of malice is itself rather fluid and malleable, and gives rise to uncertainty in the sphere of <span class="font-italic">application as well as further definition </span>(for example, as to what dominant motive means).<span class="font-italic"> </span>Lord Neuberger agreed with Lord Mance’s views, also noting that “there could be real problems involved both in identifying what constitutes malice and in deciding what types of loss and damage should be recoverable in connection with claims based on the proposed tort” (<span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [170]). We also note that a leading textbook has observed that “‘malice’ has proved <span class="font-italic">a slippery word</span> in the law of torts” (see Carolyn Sappideen &amp; Prue Vines eds, <span class="font-italic">Fleming’s The Law of Torts </span>(Lawbook Co, 10th Ed, 2011) at para 27.80 [emphasis added]). Although Lord Toulson in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> sought to argue (at [52]) that there is an established body of case law on the concept of malice, his Lordship did not, with respect, deal with the <span class="font-italic">specific </span>difficulties referred to in both this paragraph as well as the next.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 We would, in fact, go further and observe that the very concept of malice itself tends towards a <span class="font-italic">subjective</span> inquiry, which would, in turn, exacerbate the problem of <span class="font-italic">uncertainty</span>. Whilst it is true that the court will, as far as is possible, have regard to the relevant objective evidence before it, any inquiry into the presence or absence of malice is inherently fraught with subjectivity. If, however, this is the case, the argument often made to the effect that the tort of malicious prosecution ought to be extended to civil proceedings generally because the legal bar is high, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, because of the requirement to prove <span class="font-italic">malice</span> (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [109]−[110] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Kerr, and <span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [55]−[56] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Toulson) becomes <span class="font-italic">much less persuasive</span> – not least because the requisite legal elements (here, malice) are not even clear to begin with. Finally, while we are cautious not to overstate this uncertainty given that we evince little difficulty analysing Lee Tat’s claim in <span class="font-italic">malicious</span> falsehood below, it is noteworthy that the concept of malice in that particular context has obtained a degree of stability from the well-defined requirement – and one which is not found in the tort of malicious prosecution – that the defendant had no honest belief in, or was reckless as to, the truth of his statement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Coherence with cognate areas of the law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 There are yet other areas of uncertainty, the chief of which relates to the effect of extending the tort on other areas of the law. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, Lord Neuberger pointed out (at [164]) that the extension of the tort of malicious prosecution to civil proceedings generally “could well have unanticipated knock-on effects in other areas of law”, including the law of privilege. Similarly, Lord Reed (who was also in the minority in that case) noted the uncertain impact that the extension of the tort would have on the law of defamation. He observed (at [184]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In the present case, the basic problem facing the appellant, so far as his claim is based on damage to his reputation caused by allegations made against him in earlier civil proceedings, <span class="font-italic">is the absolute privilege accorded by</span> <span class="font-italic">the modern law of defamation</span>. The solution favoured by the majority results in the <span class="font-italic">circumvention of that problem by the creation or extension of another tort. </span>The question of where that leaves the law of defamation … appear to me to require fuller consideration than they have received. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Indeed, recognising malicious civil prosecution would not only circumvent the doctrine of absolute privilege, but would also undermine the doctrine’s underlying policy rationale. As noted by this court in <span class="font-italic">Goh Lay Khim </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Isabel Redrup Agency Pte Ltd and another appeal </span>[2017] 1 SLR 546 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Lay Khim</span>”) at [66], absolute privilege covers statements made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, even those which are untrue and made maliciously. This includes “everything that is done from the inception of the proceedings onwards and extends to all pleadings and other documents brought into existence for the purpose of the proceedings” (see the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Lincoln v Daniels </span>[1962] 1 QB 237 at 257 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Devlin LJ). The basis of absolute privilege is that, among other things, judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings are regarded as matters in which “[f]ree speech is so significant … that complete and absolute immunity is afforded to defamatory statements” (Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts in Singapore </span>(Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2016) at para 13.041, cited in <span class="font-italic">Goh Lay Khim </span>at [66]). It would sit uneasily with this general approach to hold that notwithstanding the doctrine of absolute privilege, a litigant may be liable for malicious prosecution in respect of things he says or does in civil proceedings. We therefore agree with the remarks of Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that the extension of the tort of malicious prosecution to the civil sphere “cuts across the immunities which the law has <span class="font-italic">always recognised </span>for things said and done in the course of legal proceedings” [emphasis added] (at [178]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In addition, extending the tort would appear to be inconsistent with another well-established principle of tort law in the area of the conduct of litigation, which is that a litigant owes no duty of care to his adversary in relation to the conduct of proceedings. The leading case is the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Jain </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Trent Strategic Health Authority </span>[2009] 1 AC 853 (“<span class="font-italic">Jain</span>”), where it was held that a local authority which, acting on inaccurate information, had obtained an order to close down a nursing home, owed no duty of care to the proprietors of the home for the basis on which they made the application. In <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>, Lord Sumption, after citing <span class="font-italic">Jain</span>, observed that “[i]t may fairly be said that there is a difference between the negligent and the dishonest conduct of litigation”, before adding that this was “not a difference which has influenced this area of the law” (at [125]), because the law seeks not to deter litigants from coming to court (at [126]). The same is true of the malicious conduct of litigation, and the point here may be conceptualised partly as a function of the general principle which we have articulated at [94]–[95] above that a bad motive does not convert the performance of a legal act into a civil wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 A final point to be made here is that even if the tort of malicious prosecution were extended to civil proceedings generally, there would remain the issue as to what sorts of damage might be recoverable – a point made by Lord Mance in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> (at [130] and [141]−[145]) and acknowledged as well by Lord Neuberger (at [170]). For these reasons, we regard as inescapable the conclusion that extending the tort of malicious prosecution to civil proceedings would destabilise a significant number of well-established principles of the common law. Barring compelling policy considerations to the contrary, that is more than sufficient reason to give us serious pause when deciding whether to extend the tort in that way. And as we will see, there are, in fact, no such policy considerations in the end that point in the opposite direction.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reasons of policy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 In discussing reasons of policy, we are concerned in this context with legal policy and not public policy generally. By legal policy we mean policy that is within the purview of the courts, as opposed to policy that is within the purview of the legislature. It is policy whose formation, in Lord Mance’s words, “does not normally depend on statistics, but rather on judges’ collective experience of litigation and litigants and, more particularly here, their appreciation of the risks involved in litigation and the risks of its misuse” (<span class="font-italic">Willers</span> at [134]). Such policy is of particular relevance in this case because the tort of malicious prosecution concerns precisely the alleged need to provide a remedy to those who have suffered damage as a result of the misuse of the litigation process.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Finality and floodgates</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 We note, first, the fact that extending the tort of malicious prosecution to the civil sphere generally will <span class="font-italic">undermine the principle of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">finality</span> <span class="font-italic">in the law</span><span class="font-italic"> and legal process</span>. Indeed, we envisage that such an extension would encourage unnecessary <span class="font-italic">satellite litigation</span> – which would be especially rife amongst parties who have an unpleasant history between each other (and all the more if one or both parties have deep pockets). Indeed, <span class="font-italic">the present case</span> falls neatly into this description. The result would be to waste the valuable time and resources of the court. In this regard, the following observations by Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> are apposite (at [148]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Finally, there are real concerns about the practical consequences of any extension of the law in this area which would offer litigants an occasion for prolonging disputes by way of secondary litigation. It is no answer to these concerns to say that the bar can be set so high that few will succeed<span class="font-italic">. Malice is far more often alleged than proved.</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The vice of secondary litigation is in the attempt</span><span class="font-italic">. Litigation generates obsession and provokes resentment. It sharpens men’s natural conviction of their own rightness and their suspicion of other men’s motives. It turns indifference into antagonism and contempt. </span>Whatever principle may be formulated for allowing secondary litigation in some circumstances, for every case in which an injustice is successfully corrected in subsequent proceedings, there will be many more which fail only after prolonged, disruptive, wasteful and ultimately unsuccessful attempts.<span class="font-italic"> </span>[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 And, in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, Lord Mance pertinently (and very practically) observed as follows (at [132]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…[T]he recognition of a general tort in respect of civil proceedings would be carrying the law into unchartered waters, <span class="font-italic">inviting fresh litigation about prior litigation</span>, the soundness of its basis, its motivation and its consequences. The basis, motivation and consequences of individual ex parte steps, having immediate effects at the outset of litigation, are likely to relative easy to identify. The exact opposite is likely to be the position in the context of prior litigation which has extended quite probably over years. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Indeed, “fresh litigation about prior litigation” is precisely what we alluded to at the very beginning of this judgment (at [2] above) in saying that the parties in the present case have turned their energies from disputing about the original subject matter to disputing about the dispute itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Not surprisingly, though, Lord Wilson was not persuaded by the argument from finality. In <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>, he began by observing that the law had already permitted the tort of malicious prosecution to be invoked with regard to criminal prosecutions as well as the disparate situations (referred to briefly above at [75]). His Lordship then proceeded to observe thus (at [72(b)(ii)]): “The law has therefore already seen fit to override the argument [from finality] and the only remaining question relates to the extent to which it should do so.” With respect, however, this argument is unconvincing in that it simply seeks to justify<span class="font-italic"> </span>chipping away at the principle of finality <span class="font-italic">further</span> on the basis that cracks have already begun to appear. Again, the question is whether or not there are sound arguments of legal principle and policy that support an extension of the tort of malicious prosecution into the civil sphere generally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 If, as we have already noted, permitting this tort to operate in the narrower sphere is justifiable on narrow grounds, particularly in the context of <span class="font-italic">criminal prosecutions</span>, it is clear that the tort ought not to be extended further than is justified. In <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Lord Toulson considered that while “[t]here is unquestionably a public interest in avoiding unnecessary satellite litigation, whether in criminal or civil matters … that has not been considered a sufficient reason for disallowing a claim for malicious prosecution of criminal proceedings” (at [46]). But the proper conclusion to draw from this is not that the tort should therefore be extended. It is that there are <span class="font-italic">narrow (and even unique) reasons</span> for permitting an action in malicious prosecution in the context of <span class="font-italic">criminal prosecutions</span> – and those reasons do <span class="font-italic">not</span> obtain in the <span class="font-italic">civil</span> sphere.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Following from the point just considered (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the need for finality), there is the closely related danger of opening the <span class="font-italic">floodgates</span> of litigation – particularly where satellite litigation is concerned. In this regard, it bears repeating that there would, as a result, be a waste of the valuable time and resources of the court. Recognising the tort of malicious prosecution in civil proceedings generally could open the door to a litany of claims of a dizzying variety. We speak of “variety” in terms of the types of proceedings in respect of which malicious prosecution claims might be brought, the types of pleadings or actions which might give rise to malicious prosecution claims, the parties against whom such claims could be brought, and the stage of proceedings at which such claims might be brought. The various possibilities were identified by Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>as follows (at [147]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he precise ambit of the tort, if it extends to civil proceedings of a private nature will be both uncertain and potentially very wide. The Board would have created a new malice-based tort the gist of which is the malicious initiation of baseless proceedings in a manner which damages the reputation of the victim. <span class="font-italic">But if that is to be the essence of the tort, then it ought in principle to apply to the malicious abuse of disciplinary proceedings, the very proposition which the House of Lords was not prepared to accept in </span>Gregory<span class="font-italic">. Logically, it would also apply to any factual case advanced in civil </span><span class="font-italic">proceedings which maliciously and baselessly discredited another party, including a case advanced by a defendant or a third party. Logically it would extend to cases where the action was not maliciously brought but the plaintiff gave malicious evidence, or indeed to a case where a witness who was neither the plaintiff nor the directing mind and will of the plaintiff gave malicious evidence.</span> In the case presently before the Board, the particular abuse consisted in the introduction of a baseless allegation of fraud. But if the tort is extended to the conduct of civil proceedings, there is nothing in logic to suggest that liability can be limited to such cases. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Similar observations were made by Lord Mance in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> (at [132]–[133]). These observations point to the numerous ways in which the tort of malicious prosecution could, if recognised generally within the civil sphere, be extended far beyond the paradigm case of a claimant who alleges that the defendant maliciously commenced civil proceedings against him or her. To explore just one of these possible <span class="font-italic">further</span> “extensions” of the tort, if the Singapore courts do recognise the tort of malicious prosecution for civil proceedings generally, might it not be argued that there ought – as a matter of principle, logic, and fairness – to be a tort of <span class="font-italic">malicious defence </span>as well?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Several of the judges in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> acknowledged this possibility, as well as its attendant potential problems (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Kerr at [111]–[112] and Lord Neuberger at [194]). We note, however, that in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Lord Toulson disagreed that recognising a cause of action for malicious defence was a “necessary counterpart” of extending the tort of malicious prosecution to civil claims (at [51]). In his view, there was an “obvious distinction between the <span class="font-italic">initiation</span> of the legal process itself and later steps which may involve bad faith…but do not go <span class="font-italic">to the root of the institution of legal process</span>” [emphasis added] (<span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [51]; see also <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [78(g)] <span class="font-italic">per</span> Lord Wilson). In a similar vein, the authors of <span class="font-italic">Clerk </span><span class="font-italic">&amp; Lindsell on Torts </span>(Michael A Jones gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 22nd Ed, 2018) (“<span class="font-italic">Clerk and </span><span class="font-italic">Lindsell</span>”) at para 16-14 suggest that it is unlikely that an action will lie for malicious defence or the malicious giving of evidence in civil proceedings by a witness, because it is an essential element of the tort that there must be a <span class="font-italic">prosecution </span>which “set[s] the law in motion”. There is no doubt that, as the law stands, the tort applies to only the institution of legal process. The difficulty, however, is that expressions such as “set the law in motion” and “go to the root of the institution of legal process” do not, in and of themselves, offer a rational basis <span class="font-italic">for</span><span class="font-italic"> why the tort should be limited to the</span> <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">initiation</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">of legal process</span>. If, indeed, the concern is that baseless, damaging allegations may be raised in bad faith against an innocent party in the context of civil proceedings, it must be recognised that such damage can originate not only from a malicious plaintiff or claimant, but equally from a malicious defendant or a witness. Why, then, should a defendant who opportunistically and maliciously draws out proceedings against himself to raise a baseless and scandalous defence against his opponent be treated any differently from a plaintiff who <span class="font-italic">initiates </span>proceedings for the same purpose?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 In <span class="font-italic">Crawford </span><span class="font-italic">Adjusters</span>, Lord Kerr recognised the “obvious logic” in the argument that if a claim for malicious prosecution of civil proceedings is to be recognised, then an action should also lie “for malicious defence of such proceedings” (at [111]). He nevertheless took the view that it was “possible … to remain sanguine about [the] likely prevalence” of the tort of malicious defence, and pointed to the significant hurdles in proving that “the defendant knew or had notice” that the basis on which it resisted the claim was baseless and nevertheless persisted for a reason unrelated to the legitimate defence of the claim (at [113]). With respect, however, this does not meet the argument that “[t]he vice of secondary litigation is in the attempt” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [148] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Sumption, quoted at [105] above). Even if the bar for making out a claim is set so high that many claims for malicious defence will fail, those claims would have failed only after significant wasteful expenditures of court time and resources.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Leaving aside the possibility of a tort of malicious defence, some judges in the majority in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>argued that there was no empirical evidence for the “floodgates” argument (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Wilson at [72(e)(ii)] and Lord Kerr at [108]). That may indeed be so. We also note that, in an empirical analysis of cases from Ontario, it was demonstrated that the broadening of the tort of malicious prosecution to civil proceedings generally had <span class="font-italic">not</span> opened the floodgates of litigation (see Michael Marin, “The uncertain scope of malicious prosecution: Insights from Canada” (2016) 24 Tort L Rev 80 at pp 92–96). However, it should be borne in mind that such a study is by no means conclusive. In particular, it relates to just one province in Canada. The social mores and public policy of each society (in our case, Singapore) might be quite different. In any event, given the increased (and increasing) volume of litigation in the Singapore context, if even a small percentage of cases gives rise to further claims pursuant to the tort of malicious prosecution, that would itself have a significant (and adverse) impact on the legal system as a whole. This is not, of course, a reason (in and of itself) not to extend the tort of malicious prosecution to the civil sphere generally, <span class="font-italic">but</span> it is certainly a factor that cannot be ignored. Indeed, it <span class="font-italic">buttress</span><span class="font-italic">es</span> the case <span class="font-italic">against</span> such an extension of this tort.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 We also note Lord Toulson’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> (at [44]) that “[t]he argument that a good claim should not be allowed because it may lead someone else pursuing a bad one is not generally attractive”. With respect, however <span class="font-italic">unattractive</span> the argument may be, the court must squarely confront the reality that its time and resources <span class="font-italic">are finite</span>, and it may thus be unwise for this court to knowingly open itself to a <span class="font-italic">flood</span> of bad claims simply because there might, someday, be a good one.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 More importantly, one ought not to underestimate the vindictiveness of human nature as demonstrated by examples of parties who continue incessantly to be embroiled in litigation. The situation may be exacerbated if the party initiating a claim in malicious prosecution has deep pockets. Indeed, a party might be driven to mount a claim pursuant to the tort of malicious prosecution even if his or her economic resources are insufficient to comfortably support the proceedings. Against the argument that all this is mere speculation stands Lord Mance’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> that “[j]udges have enough experience of disingenuous behaviour and procedural shenanigans on the part of litigants to form a view of sound policy in this area” (at [134]). And in our judgment and experience, it is clear that the danger of opening the floodgates of litigation is no chimera. Human beings are not angels. Disputes and ensuing litigation in the courts constitute clear evidence of this. Neither are many human beings naturally forgiving. These are the harsh – and undeniable – realities that we must confront in arriving at our decision as to whether the tort of malicious prosecution ought to be extended generally in the civil sphere. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Chilling effect</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 We are also of the view that extending the tort of malicious prosecution to the civil sphere generally will <span class="font-italic">have a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">chilling (or deterrent) effect</span> <span class="font-italic">on regular litigation in its various aspects</span>. In the words of Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> (at [126]), the proposed extension of the tort necessarily creates a “deterrent effect of potential liability on litigants, who may be inhibited from invoking the jurisdiction of the courts; and on witnesses, who may be inhibited from freely assisting in the administration of justice”. In a related vein, in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, Lord Neuberger observed as follows (at [166]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [T]he existence of the tort could have a chilling effect on the bringing, prosecuting or defending of civil proceedings. The notion that a person should not have to face malicious proceedings brought by a ruthless party is said to justify the existence of this tort; <span class="font-italic">but the existence of the tort severely risks creating what would be at least </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">an equally undesirable new weapon in the hands of a ruthless party, namely intimidation through the unjustified, but worrying, threat of a malicious prosecution claim to deter bona fide proceedings</span>. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In other words, the creation of a remedy for one wrong is likely to lead to another wrong.</span> [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The argument has been made to the effect that there is an absence of empirical evidence demonstrating that such a chilling or deterrent effect would, in fact, materialise (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [72(a)(ii)] and [87] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Wilson and Baroness Hale, respectively). For the same reasons given with regard to the danger of opening the floodgates of litigation, we are of the view that extending the tort of malicious prosecution could have a possible deleterious impact, in terms of its chilling or deterrent effect on litigation, and this is not wholly speculative. To surmise that the less positive side of human nature might rear its ugly head towards genuine litigants should such a tort be so extended is by no means contrary to logic and, indeed, common sense.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mediation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 It is also our view that the extension of the tort of malicious prosecution to civil proceedings generally might at least possibly – if not actually – be <span class="font-italic">incompatible with</span> the increased (as well as increasing) shift towards integrating <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">mediation</span> into the legal fabric of the Singapore legal system. As was recently observed (see Andrew Phang, “Mediation and the Courts – The Singapore Experience” [2017] Asian JM 14 at para 66):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">The Judiciary’s support for mediation has resulted in significant success and mediation has now been established as a viable dispute resolution option for resolving even the most high-value civil and commercial disputes, alongside court litigation and arbitration.</span> While the judicial function can never be replaced by ADR processes, a system of adjudication supported (as well as complemented) by such processes will be better equipped to deliver access to justice. In fact, there may be instances when it is indeed preferable for users to access and achieve justice through acceptable consensual outcomes, thus promoting a more gracious society in the process. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Reference may also now be made to the Mediation Act 2017 (No 1 of 2017).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Availability of a remedy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Returning to the <span class="font-italic">broad statements</span> centring on justice and fairness (which we rejected as being insufficient as specific justificatory propositions (see above at [61]−[64])), could it be argued that the court concerned has ultimately failed inasmuch as it is powerless to provide a remedy (albeit in a very limited number of rare cases)? This is not, strictly speaking, correct, for there can be an award of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">costs</span> – even on an <span class="font-italic">indemnity</span> basis (see <span class="font-italic">Quartz Hill</span> at 690<span class="font-italic"> per</span> Bowen LJ and, much more recently, <span class="font-italic">Gregory </span>at 429 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Steyn as well as <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [180] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Neuberger), a likely eventuality in the context of a claim that might otherwise have resulted in an award of damages for the tort of malicious prosecution if the tort were extended to civil proceedings generally. This, of course, does <span class="font-italic">not</span> furnish a <span class="font-italic">complete</span> remedy as would, for example, an award of damages (see also <span class="font-italic">Winfield and </span><span class="font-italic">Jolowicz </span>at para 20-020 as well as the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Maryani</span><span class="font-italic"> Sadeli v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other appeals </span>[2015] 1 SLR 496 at [30]–[34]). Indeed, even an award of costs on an indemnity basis is a misnomer of sorts since the successful litigant is not typically awarded his or her <span class="font-italic">full</span> costs as such (as emphasised by Lord Wilson in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [71] and Lord Toulson in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [58], and acknowledged by Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [132]). However, the award of costs does offer a <span class="font-italic">partial remedy</span> which, as we explain below, is complemented by other tools at the court’s disposal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 There also exist, in <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">the current rules of civil procedure</span>, legal mechanisms for bringing claims that would otherwise constitute malicious prosecutions <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">to a prompt and early end</span> – <span class="font-italic">thus obviating excessive costs as well as time and effort on the part of the parties and the courts</span>. For example, a defendant could apply under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) to strike out a plaintiff’s statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action or as being frivolous or vexatious or as otherwise constituting an abuse of process. The existence of equivalent procedural remedies under English law was evidently a factor (among many others) which led the minority judges in both <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>and <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> to conclude that it was neither necessary nor desirable to extend the tort of malicious prosecution to civil proceedings generally. In <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>, for example, Lord Neuberger remarked as follows (at [196]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Fourthly, the United States jurisprudence provides a reminder that wrongful civil litigation should not be viewed in isolation. The courts have procedural mechanisms at their disposal to preserve and strengthen the civil litigation process, and to target proceedings brought wrongfully or mistakenly. … In circumstances where a party has not suffered special injury, the use of procedural mechanisms is preferable to “randomly providing a fortuitous amount of compensation in a handful of isolated cases”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although his Lordship made the observations just quoted in relation to the United States experience, they embody a point of <span class="font-italic">general principle</span> that applies equally to the Singapore context. In a similar vein, Lord Mance observed in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> that the pursuit of an unfounded claim, defence or other step in a civil proceeding had “never been actionable in itself”, and had in the past been remedied using other devices, including “striking out, judgment or costs” (at [137]). The following observations by Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> are also wholly to the point (at [179], also noted by <span class="font-italic">James L</span><span class="font-italic">ee </span>at p 885):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The courts have far more extensive powers today than they did a century and a half ago to prevent abuse of their procedures, and the closer judicial supervision of the interlocutory stages of litigation makes it easier to exercise them. Of course, these powers will not be enough to identify in time the more determined and skillful abuses, but that is part of the price to be paid for access to justice. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 We agree with and endorse these remarks. While costs do not provide a <span class="font-italic">complete</span> remedy for the harm which innocent defendants may suffer as a result of malicious and unjustified claims, this partial remedy is complemented by mechanisms such as striking out. Provided that they are employed and invoked appropriately, such mechanisms ensure that in most cases it would be possible for an aggrieved defendant to stem abusive claims at a fairly early stage, <span class="font-italic">before </span>significant damage is sustained. There will perhaps be cases where “the more determined and skilful abuses” of court processes (see above at [121]) cannot be nipped in the bud, but in our view these cases will be few and far between, and the desire to provide redress in such cases must be weighed against the various undesirable consequences which would arise if the tort of malicious prosecution were extended to civil proceedings generally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 We would also observe that on the unique facts of <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>, one of the original defendants in the underlying suit (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, one of Mr Paterson’s co-defendants in the original action brought against him by Sagicor) made disclosure of certain relevant documents only three months prior to the trial, and these disclosures, in turn, resulted in Sagicor’s discontinuation of the original action only days before the trial itself. In these circumstances, Mr Paterson was unable to invoke the relevant rules of civil procedure which might otherwise have allowed an early termination of the proceedings against him (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> at [21]). This is an unusual fact situation and, had there not been this unfortunate delay in disclosure of the relevant documents, the proceedings in this case might have ended sooner. Indeed, it was after the discontinuation of the action that Mr Paterson was granted leave to amend his counterclaim to include a claim pursuant to the tort of abuse of process (the tort of malicious prosecution, although not pleaded by Mr Paterson, was also considered as an alternative claim).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The idea that existing procedural remedies are adequate is supported by the effect of US jurisprudence, an analysis of which Lord Neuberger undertook in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>(at [165]−[196]; reference may also be made to William C Campbell, “Groundless Litigation and the Malicious Prosecution Debate: A Historical Analysis” (1979) 88 Yale LJ 1218). His Lordship’s discussion is of immense relevance to the point being made here. If we may say so, despite the controversy that existed amongst the various state jurisdictions in the United States, his Lordship managed to distil the main points in a clear and effective manner within a relatively brief compass.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Of especial importance were the observations pertaining to the prevalence of the “English rule” and the “American rule”, as they have come to be known in United States jurisprudence. Under the so-called English rule, the tort is not made out unless the plaintiff can establish that the previous proceedings brought against him or her by the defendant caused him “special injury” – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “something more than the expense, distress and reputational loss that is ordinarily suffered as a result of wrongful litigation”. (We note in passing that while American courts have termed this the “English rule”, this has never been the modern position in England whether before or after <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>and <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>.) On the other hand, the American rule permits recovery if the defendant “participated in instigating or continuing a civil proceeding … without probable cause and for an improper purpose, provided that the proceeding had been terminated favourably to the now-plaintiff” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [173]–[174] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Neuberger, citing Dobbs, Hayden &amp; Bubick, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Torts</span> vol 3<span class="font-italic"> </span>(Thomson West, 2nd Ed, 2011) at pp 408 and 416–417). In Lord Neuberger’s view, it was significant that, putting aside legislative intervention, courts in the United States had been almost as likely to adopt the narrower English rule as the American rule. His Lordship thus observed as follows (at [193]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">[E]</span><span class="font-italic">ven in</span> a jurisdiction where successful defendants rarely can expect to recover their costs, there seems to be <span class="font-italic">as strong judicial support for the English rule as for the American rule</span>. That might at first sight appear to be a somewhat cheap or lazy point, but I believe that it has real force. In a highly developed common law country, where the issue has been considered in far greater depth and by almost infinitely more judges than here, there is about as much support for adhering to the English rule as there is for departing from it, even though there is a significantly stronger case for departure than there is here. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 His Lordship further noted that the requirement under the English rule that a plaintiff should only be able to claim in respect of wrongful litigation if he had suffered “special injury” appeared to be attributable to the American courts’ understanding that since <span class="font-italic">costs sanctions </span>were available under English law, the action for malicious prosecution was only needed if a plaintiff had suffered injury “over and above the ordinary emotional and financial damage” accompanying litigation (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [176]–[177]). A number of judges who had preferred the American rule had done so on the basis that, unlike their English counterparts, American defendants did <span class="font-italic">not </span>have the ability to recover their costs (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [186]). Subsequently, reiterating this point in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span>, Lord Neuberger observed (at [169]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [A]s I discussed in <span class="font-italic">Crawford </span>[<span class="font-italic">Adjusters</span>], paras 170—175 and 181—190, unlike courts in England and Wales, courts in the United States of America have considerable experience of claims for malicious prosecution in the civil field. The state courts are pretty evenly divided as to the existence of the wide tort contended for by the appellant. Many state courts which accept the existence of the wide tort justify departing from what they understand to be the law in England on the basis that “The English rule is that generally the loser must pay the winner’s attorneys’ fees” and so “an English plaintiff who brings a frivolous suit does so as the peril of paying his adversary’s litigation expenses” (to quote Ciparick J in <span class="font-italic">Engel v CBS </span><span class="font-italic">Inc </span>(1999) 711 NE 2d 626, 629). <span class="font-italic">Thus, even though the costs sanction which applies to litigation in this jurisdiction is largely absent in the United States, a substantial proportion of the courts in that jurisdiction have set their face against the existence of this tort, and many of those that accept it justify their view by reference to the absence of the costs sanction which is routinely available in our courts</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The (buttressing) point made by Lord Neuberger (as embodied in the quotations in the preceding two paragraphs) is one that we would wholly endorse. It is telling that even in the United States, where the courts do not generally compensate successful litigants for the expense of resisting baseless claims through costs orders, many states nevertheless apply a <span class="font-italic">more </span><span class="font-italic">stringent </span>form of the tort of malicious prosecution by maintaining the additional requirement that the claimant must have suffered “special injury” to receive tortious redress. Seen in that light, it would be strange for a jurisdiction such as <span class="font-italic">ours</span>, where costs orders are part and parcel of most litigation, to recognise the tort in the form contended for by Lee Tat and applied in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>– which is <span class="font-italic">less stringent </span>than the so-called “English rule” in so far as it does<span class="font-italic"> not </span>require the claimant to demonstrate “special injury” (see the elements of the tort above at [41]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 For the reasons set out in this part of the judgment, we are of the view that the tort of malicious prosecution should <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> be extended to civil proceedings generally. Indeed, the case against such extension appears to us to be overwhelming. And although this is by no means even close to a conclusive factor, we also note the reference in a leading English textbook to “the powerful dissenting opinions of Lord Sumption and Lord Neuberger” in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>as well as to the fact that “[t]he differences between the majority and the minority [in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>] were very fundamental indeed” (see <span class="font-italic">Winfield</span> <span class="font-italic">and</span> <span class="font-italic">Jolowicz</span> at para 20-021; reference may also be made to <span class="font-italic">Street</span> at p 611). Similarly, in yet another leading English (practitioner) textbook, it was observed that there were “two strong dissenting judgments” in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>(see <span class="font-italic">Clerk and </span><span class="font-italic">Lindsell </span>at para 16-02). Academic recognition of the force of these judgments may be presumed not to have been given lightly, and should therefore in our view not be ignored.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Even if the tort were extended</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The above conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider Lee Tat’s claim in malicious prosecution any further. Nevertheless, and for completeness, we wholly agree with the Judge’s finding that the tort is clearly not made out. Lee Tat has failed to establish a lack of reasonable and probable cause on the MCST’s part. It has also failed to establish malice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 As for the alleged lack of reasonable and probable cause, it cannot seriously be suggested that the MCST did not at least have “a case fit to be tried” (<span class="font-italic">Zainal bin </span><span class="font-italic">Kuning </span>at [56]) when it brought the Third and Fifth Actions. With regard to the Third Action, it was neither obvious nor clear-cut that Grange Heights residents were not entitled to use the Right of Way (or to repair or maintain it, as they sought to do by bringing the Third Action). On the contrary, and as the Judge noted, at that stage the Amalgamation Issue had been considered and decided in the MCST’s favour in the Second Action (see the Judgment at [58]). In fact, from 1997 to 2004 the MCST had instituted contempt proceedings against Lee Tat for breaching the terms of the injunction granted by Coomaraswamy J in the Second Action (see [23] above) and Lee Tat had responded in a manner which showed that it recognised<span class="font-italic"> </span>that it was not entitled to obstruct the Right of Way (see the Judgment at [61]–[64]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Lee Tat has suggested that the MCST lacked reasonable and probable cause because it was obvious, and the MCST must have known, that the Extension Issue had yet to be decided in the Second Action. That argument is, with respect, untenable. Surely the clearest illustration that it was neither obvious nor clear-cut that the Extension Issue had been decided lies in the fact that notwithstanding Chao JA’s views that the issue had <span class="font-italic">not </span>been decided, the majority in the Fourth Action took the opposite view (see [28]–[29] above). There is absolutely nothing to suggest that the MCST brought the Third Action without believing that it had a “case fit to be tried” on its entitlement to repair and maintain the Servient Tenement. The suggestion that it must have been “obvious” to the MCST that it was not entitled to use the Right of Way is (a) made in hindsight and (b) speculative and unsubstantiated by any evidence as to the MCST’s actual state of mind at the relevant time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 To address the latter problem, Lee Tat argues strenuously that an adverse inference should be drawn against the MCST for its failure to produce legal advice which it received in connection with the commencement of the various proceedings. In fact, Lee Tat applied unsuccessfully for specific discovery of this legal advice. Its application was dismissed on the ground that the advice was covered by legal professional and/or litigation privilege. In our view, nothing can be made of the fact that the MCST has chosen not to waive that privilege. As the Judge noted, there could be numerous reasons why the MCST may have taken that stance (see the Judgment at [74]) and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the contents of the legal advice. Moreover, as noted by this court in <span class="font-italic">Myk</span><span class="font-italic">ytowych, Pamela Jane v V I P Hotel </span>[2016] 4 SLR 829, it would render privilege otiose to say that “when a party refuses to permit professional confidence to be broken, everything must be taken strongly against him” (at [55], citing the House of Lords decision in <span class="font-italic">W </span><span class="font-italic">C Wentworth v J C Lloyd</span> (1864) 10 HLC 589).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 As for the Fifth Action, this was the MCST’s application to determine whether the Court of Appeal could be reconstituted to hear an application to set aside its own judgment. Save for Lee Tat’s contention that adverse inferences should be drawn against the MCST for failing to disclose its legal advice (see the Judgment at [75]), there was no evidence, and very little argument, to establish that the Fifth Action was commenced by the MCST without a belief that there was a case fit to be tried. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The element of malice is also not made out. Lee Tat’s <span class="font-italic">own </span>case is that malice took the form of the MCST’s wanting to “secure for itself a right which it was in fact not legally entitled to have – namely, the right to use the Right of Way for pedestrian traffic between Grange Road and Lot 561”. Yet there is nothing “improper and indirect” (<span class="font-italic">Zainal bin </span><span class="font-italic">Kuning </span>at [84]) about the fact that the MCST sought to assert its Right of Way over the Servient Tenement. That was plainly and directly the very outcome which the MCST sought to achieve. The fact that we now know the MCST was “in fact not legally entitled” to the outcome it hoped to achieve cannot be a ground for imputing malice or any improper motive to the MCST.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 We turn now to consider Lee Tat’s claim in abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">General observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Abuse of process is not a concept that is unfamiliar to the law. A person who commences proceedings for the predominant purpose of achieving something other than what the legal process was designed to achieve – that is, a legal remedy and reliefs which are reasonably related to that process – is someone who has abused the process of the court. In the realm of civil procedure (and this is a point of some importance), the court has the inherent jurisdiction to strike out proceedings which are an abuse of its process (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Rules and the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Ko</span><span class="font-italic"> Teck Siang and another v Low Fong Mei and another and other actions </span>[1992] 1 SLR(R) 22 at [15], citing the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Wenlock v </span><span class="font-italic">Moloney and others </span>[1965] 1 WLR 1238 at 1243–1244). It is also clear that the court is entitled to refuse equitable relief on the ground of abuse of process (see the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">JTrust</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Pte Ltd v Group Lease Holdings and others </span>[2018] 2 SLR 159 at [101] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Steven Chong JA). The provenance of this jurisdiction is the court’s overriding duty to ensure the proper administration of justice, which entails the power to ensure that its process is not abused and its resources not put to waste (see the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">R v Sang </span>[1980] 1 AC 402 at 455 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Scarman). However, it is one thing to say that the court has powers to prevent abuses of its process and to refuse equitable relief on the basis of an abuse of process. Whether an abuse of the court’s process resulting in damage to the defendant attracts <span class="font-italic">tortious liability</span> is quite another matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 Exactly 180 years ago, the Court of Common Pleas supplied a positive answer to that question in its decision in <span class="font-italic">Grainger v Hill</span><span class="font-italic"> and another </span>(1838) 4 Bing NC 212 (“<span class="font-italic">Grainger</span>”), which was given expressly on the footing that there was no previous authority. It therefore constitutes the origin of the tort of abuse of process. Since then, however, the principle in <span class="font-italic">Grainger</span> has been rarely applied and, even then, rarely successfully. In the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Land Securities plc</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Fladgate Fielder (a firm)</span> [2010] 2 WLR 1265 (“<span class="font-italic">Land</span> <span class="font-italic">Securities</span>”), it was observed that the only two English cases in which the tort of abuse of process has been successfully invoked were, in effect, <span class="font-italic">Grainger</span> and <span class="font-italic">Gilding</span>. In the words of Etherton LJ (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Land Securities</span> (at [41]; see also <span class="font-italic">per </span>Moore-Bick and Mummery LJJ at [81] and [113], respectively):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If <span class="font-italic">Gilding’s</span> case … is properly to be regarded as an example of a [<span class="font-italic">Grainger</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>tortious abuse of process, then it is the last reported case in which such a claim has succeeded in this jurisdiction. If not, then [<span class="font-italic">Grainger</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>itself is the first and last such case. Accordingly, the last reported successful action in this jurisdiction for the tort abuse of process was either about 140 or 170 years ago.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Indeed, it was observed in a leading textbook that “as a result of the decision in [<span class="font-italic">Land Securities</span>], it seems that [the tort of abuse of process] is not intended to be a growth area” (see <span class="font-italic">Winfield and </span><span class="font-italic">Jolowicz</span> at para 20-024), although that same book acknowledged the existence of <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>(<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Nevertheless, as we shall see, the tort has enjoyed something of a resurgence in other Commonwealth jurisdictions. However, with the exception of a few, many cases which have recognised the existence of this tort do no more than assume its existence and provide no analysis of its necessity and of its relationship with other cognate torts and procedural rules which appear to serve very much the same purpose for which the tort is said to exist. That analysis is our task, and we begin by considering the decided cases.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The decided cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The early history of the tort involved cases in which a coercive interlocutory remedy was obtained on an <span class="font-italic">ex parte </span>basis for the purpose of extorting property from the defendant. The basis on which these cases were decided, however, was expressed in the form of a general principle that “taking the property of another without his consent, by an abuse of the process of the law, must be deemed a wrongful taking” (see <span class="font-italic">Grainger </span>at 221 <span class="font-italic">per</span> Tindal CJ). In <span class="font-italic">Grainger</span>, the defendant mortgagees of the plaintiff’s ship were anxious to recover their loan before it was due for payment. So they procured a writ of capias directing the sheriff to arrest the plaintiff, who was made to give up the ship’s register. After being discharged from the arrest, he sued the defendants for the loss caused by his inability to carry on business due to the arrest, and the court allowed his claim. Tindal CJ, with whom Park J agreed, as well as Vaughan and Bosanquet JJ, characterised the plaintiff’s action as being for “abusing the process of the law” or “abusing the process of the Court” for the “purpose of extorting property”, a purpose which Bosanquet J described as “ulterior” (at 221 and 223–224). Tindal CJ also observed that “it is immaterial whether the suit which that process commenced has been determined or not, or whether or not it was founded on reasonable and probable cause” (at 221).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 In <span class="font-italic">Gilding</span>, which is the only other English case in which the tort was successfully established, the defendant creditor procured a writ of <span class="font-italic">capias ad </span><span class="font-italic">satisfaciendum</span> directing the sheriff to arrest the debtor and to exact from him payment substantially exceeding the true amount due. Refusing to pay the excess sum, the debtor was arrested by the sheriff and had to pay the sum to obtain his release. He then sued the defendant successfully to recover that sum. The defendant pointed out that the plaintiff’s failure to obtain a discharge of the arrest suggested that the arrest was not without reasonable and probable cause and also that the former proceeding had not been terminated in his favour. But the Court of Common Pleas disregarded this fact and held that the plaintiff had a “good cause of action” (at 604). Willes J, delivering the court’s judgment, stated that the plaintiff had not brought an action for malicious arrest or prosecution, but had alleged that “the defendant ha[d] maliciously <span class="font-italic">employed the process of the court</span> in a terminated suit, in having by means of a regular writ of execution <span class="font-italic">extorted money</span> which he knew had already been paid and was no longer due on the judgment” [emphasis added] (at 604). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 After the 1860s, there began a long period of quiescence for this particular tort. A probable reason for this is the introduction of rules of procedure which provided for a clear mechanism for curbing abuses of the court’s process. (This is a point of some significance, as we shall later explain). In 1883, the first edition of the Rules of the Supreme Court was brought into force in England pursuant to the landmark Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 which had effected the procedural fusion of the administration of law and equity. O 19 r 27 and O 25 r 4 of the 1883 Rules were later consolidated into O 18 r 19 in subsequent versions of the English Rules of Court, which empowered the court to strike out any pleading which constitutes an abuse of process. In Singapore, the equivalent rules were O 20 r 26 and O 26 r 4 of the (Straits Settlements) Civil Procedure Rules of the Supreme Court 1934 (No 2941 in the Straits Settlement Gazette 93 of 18 December 1934), and, like their counterparts in the 1883 Rules, they were consolidated into O 18 r 19 of our current Rules. Apart from the power to strike out, the power to award costs on an indemnity basis was developed as a method of penalising parties for bringing abusive proceedings. The cross-undertaking as to damages when interlocutory injunctions are granted was also developed as a protection for a defendant against whom such an injunction was granted. These procedural weapons would have enabled the courts to nip in the bud most instances of abuse of process and even to secure compensation for defendants who had been subjected to abusive proceedings. The need to rely on the tort would appear therefore to have correspondingly diminished.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 However, beginning in the 1970s, the tort experienced a resurgence in the Commonwealth, particularly in Canada and Australia (see generally John Irvine, “The Resurrection of Tortious Abuse of Process” (1989) 47 CCLT 217). Thus, in the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in <span class="font-italic">Guilford Industries</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Hankinson Management Services Ltd </span>1973 Carswell BC 198 (“<span class="font-italic">Guilford</span>”), where the court relied on <span class="font-italic">Grainger</span>, the plaintiff succeeded in his claim in the tort, and was awarded damages for the defendants’ malicious filing of a mechanics’ lien upon proof that this had been done purely to extort a settlement in a business dispute. In <span class="font-italic">DK Investments Ltd v SWS Investments </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd </span>(1984) 59 BCLR 33, also a decision of that court, the defendant succeeded in his counterclaim in the tort, and was awarded damages, upon proof that the plaintiff had abused the court’s process for the ulterior purpose of coercing the defendant into foregoing its strict contractual rights and selling a commercial property at a reduced price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In Australia, the Queensland Supreme Court in 1989 awarded damages for abuse of process upon proof that the defendant had applied to wind up the plaintiff company for the predominant object of forcing its board of directors to negotiate with the defendant (see <span class="font-italic">QIW </span><span class="font-italic">Retailers Limited v Felview Pty Ltd </span>[1989] 2 Qd R 245). That case was cited with approval in the leading decision of the High Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Williams v </span><span class="font-italic">Spautz</span> (1992) 174 CLR 509 at 553 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Gaudron J. In that case, the High Court was concerned with whether to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to grant a permanent stay of multiple proceedings that a university lecturer had instituted against the university and its members. Mason CJ observed (at 522) that in elucidating the principles governing this jurisdiction, the courts “have had regard to the tort of collateral abuse of process”, which had been recognised in England (citing <span class="font-italic">Grainger</span>), the United States and Canada (citing <span class="font-italic">Guilford</span>), and by the High Court itself in <span class="font-italic">Varawa</span><span class="font-italic"> v Howard Smith Company Ltd </span>(1911) 13 CLR 35 as well as <span class="font-italic">Dowling v </span><span class="font-italic">The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd</span> (1915) 20 CLR 509, although Mason CJ observed that the tort was not established in either of the last-mentioned Australian decisions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Back in England, the existence of the tort continued for a period to be acknowledged with mixed enthusiasm. On the one hand, Falconer J in 1984 declined an invitation to declare that the tort had long since perished from desuetude, considering it a task best left for an appellate court (see the English High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Digital Equipment Corp v </span><span class="font-italic">Darkcrest Ltd </span>[1984] 3 WLR 617 at 627C–E). In <span class="font-italic">Land Securities</span>, the English Court of Appeal declined to extend the tort, on the assumption that it existed, to judicial review proceedings and also to recovery of economic loss. On the other hand, in <span class="font-italic">Speed Seal Products Ltd v Paddington and Another</span> [1985] 1 WLR 1327 (“<span class="font-italic">Speed Seal</span>”), the English Court of Appeal upheld the grant of leave to the defendants to amend their pleadings to include an allegation that the plaintiffs had brought the action for the purpose of damaging the defendants’ business, on the ground that <span class="font-italic">Grainger </span>“provides a basis for an arguable case that there has been an actionable abuse of the process of the court” (at 1335H <span class="font-italic">per</span> Fox LJ). And in <span class="font-italic">Metall</span><span class="font-italic"> und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc and Another </span>[1990] 3 WLR 563, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had abused the court’s process by submitting a false case for the primary purpose of defeating claims to the return of the plaintiffs’ metal and to prevent the grant of a freezing injunction. The English Court of Appeal considered it “at least well arguable” that the tort of abuse of process existed, and held that the requirements of the tort were not satisfied because the defendants’ actions were directed towards sustaining their defence (at 612H–613A <span class="font-italic">per</span> Slade LJ).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 However, more recently, the Board in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span> recognised the existence of the tort in English law in no uncertain terms. Although the members of the court were divided on whether the tort of malicious prosecution extended to civil proceedings, they were unanimous in their view that the tort of abuse of process was a recognised cause of action. That said, it is significant, in our view, that Lord Sumption appeared to be at pains to emphasise how rarely the tort had been pleaded successfully. In his Lordship’s view, the cases where it could be demonstrated that a litigant had used the process of the court for the purpose of obtaining some wholly extraneous benefit not reasonably related to the relief sought would be “extremely rare”. Indeed, his Lordship remarked that “[the tort of] abuse of process is on the verge of extinction, the only recent sightings being in Australia” (at [149]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The experience of two other jurisdictions may be mentioned briefly for completeness. In New Zealand, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gordon v Treadwell Stacey Smith </span>[1996] 3 NZLR 281, citing <span class="font-italic">Grainger</span> and <span class="font-italic">Speed Seal</span>, and <span class="font-italic">Burns v National Bank of New Zealand Ltd </span>[2004] 3 NZLR 289, citing <span class="font-italic">Grainger</span>, recognised that the tort exists, although no claim in the tort appears to have been successfully established in that jurisdiction. The same is true of Malaysia. While the Malaysian courts seem to have accepted the existence of the tort (see the judgment of Mahadev Shankar J in the Malaysian High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Gasing</span><span class="font-italic"> Heights Sdn Bhd v Aloyah bte Abdul Rahman &amp; Ors</span> [1996] 3 MLJ 259, and of the Malaysian Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Malaysia Building Society </span><span class="font-italic">Bhd v Tan Sri General Ungku Nazarudding Bin Ungku Mohamed </span>[1998] 2 MLJ 425), they have not actually allowed a claim founded on abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 It can be seen, therefore, that there is a relatively stable body of authorities in the Commonwealth which support the existence of the tort of abuse of process. However, with the exception of <span class="font-italic">Land Securities</span> and, to some degree, <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>, none of these cases offers any detailed analysis of the reasons of principle and policy behind the need to attach tortious liability to the perpetrator of such abuse, particularly in the light of the existing rules of civil procedure. As the issue before us is whether we ought to recognise this tort in Singapore, it is necessary to undertake that analysis. This we now turn to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 We are of the view that it would be inappropriate to introduce this tort in the Singapore context. The first point we would make is that there is a close relationship between the torts of abuse of process and malicious prosecution. Though they are distinct causes of action, it seems to us that many factual situations which would found a cause of action in one of these torts would also found a cause of action in the other. The similarity between these two torts was recognised by both Lord Toulson (at [25]) and Lord Clarke in <span class="font-italic">Willers</span> (at [62]). In particular, Lord Toulson remarked as follows (at [25]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[<span class="font-italic">Grainger</span>] has been treated as creating a separate tort from malicious prosecution, but it has been difficult to pin down the precise limits of an improper purpose as contrasted with the absence of reasonable and probable cause within the meaning of the tort of malicious prosecution…It might be better to see [<span class="font-italic">Grainger</span>] for what it really was, an instance of malicious prosecution, in which the pursuit of an unjustifiable collateral objective was evidence of malice, rather than as a separate tort. … <span class="font-italic">It is unnecessary to express a firm view on this point, but [Grainger] does at any rate illustrate the willingness of the court to grant a remedy, in what it regarded as novel circumstances, where the plaintiff had suffered provable loss as a result of civil </span><span class="font-italic">proceedings brought against him maliciously and without any proper justification. </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 It will be seen from the above quotation that the torts of abuse of process and malicious prosecution are similar not only as to their elements but also as to their underlying rationale and the curial impulses which have given rise to their existence. Both torts stem from a common instinct that a remedy should be provided to those who suffer injury as a result of abusive legal proceedings brought against them. At the same time, the recognition of either malicious prosecution or abuse of process would, in our view, give rise to many common problems. In light of this, it should hardly be surprising that many of the same policy reasons that led to our decision not to extend the tort of malicious prosecution to civil proceedings generally have also led us not to recognise the tort of abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Reasons of policy</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Finality and floodgates</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 As mentioned (see [104]–[108] above), extending the tort of malicious prosecution to the civil context generally would undermine the principle of <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">finality </span>in the law, in that this would encourage unnecessary satellite litigation and drag out disputes. In our view, the same consideration weighs against the recognition of the tort of abuse of process, which, like malicious prosecution, would largely be pleaded in the context of “fresh litigation about prior litigation”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 We recognise that unlike the tort of malicious prosecution, the tort of abuse of process does not require the proceeding which is alleged to be abusive to be first terminated in favour of the party relying on the tort. A claim in abuse of process may be brought, for example, as a counterclaim in an action which is alleged to be abusive, and the claim will be capable of being dealt with in the same allegedly abusive proceedings. Nevertheless, abuse of process <span class="font-italic">may </span>also be pleaded in the exact manner in which it has been pleaded in <span class="font-italic">the present </span><span class="font-italic">case</span> – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, many years after the allegedly abusive proceedings have already concluded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In our view, the danger remains that recognising the tort of abuse of process would encourage satellite litigation and prolong disputes, particularly among parties who have animosity between them. In this regard, we reiterate our earlier observations concerning litigation and its capacity to bring out the unpleasant side of human nature (see [116] above). In light of this, it is almost certain that many claims in abuse of process, if the tort were recognised, would take the form of unmeritorious, vindictive attempts, and this would ultimately result in the wastage of the court’s time and resources.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 We have also noted (at [110]–[112] above) that there is the closely related danger of opening the floodgates of litigation. Recognising the tort of abuse of process would also open the courts to the same variety of claims that would arise in respect of malicious prosecution in the civil sphere. Once the abusive institution of legal proceedings is recognised as capable of giving rise to tortious liability, why would the boundaries of the tort end there? Logically, a claim for abuse of process might be founded not only on the <span class="font-italic">institution </span>of civil proceedings, but also any step taken within civil proceedings for a predominant purpose other than that for which that step was designed (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [149]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 We recognise that a counter to the “floodgates” argument might be mounted based on the English experience. But as we have noted, there is a paucity of case law on the tort of abuse of process emanating from that jurisdiction. <span class="font-italic">Grainger </span>and <span class="font-italic">Gilding </span>appear to be the only two cases where the tort has succeeded. Even taking into account the cases where the tort has been argued unsuccessfully, the relatively small amount of case law suggests that there is some truth to the view expressed by Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [149] that the tort appears to be “on the verge of extinction” in its own country of birth (see [146] above). If this is indicative of how the tort is likely to be received and applied in other jurisdictions as well, then the concerns about opening the floodgates of litigation lose much of their force. To this, however, we would make two points in response. The first is that it is unclear whether the English experience <span class="font-italic">can </span>be taken as being so indicative. Indeed, notwithstanding the fact that the tort appeared to have fallen into desuetude in England (at least prior to <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters</span>), it has taken a different course in Australia where litigants “appear to have been both more persistent and more successful” (<span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [149] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Sumption). The second point we would make is that if indeed the tort has been utilised so very rarely, and if indeed the English experience is indicative of the tort’s likely reception in the Singapore context, then there may not be any point in introducing it in our jurisdiction, absent persuasive reasons to the contrary.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Chilling effect</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Further, as noted above in relation to the extension of the tort of malicious prosecution, recognising the tort of abuse of process may create a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">chilling effect </span>on regular litigation. Litigants considering commencing civil proceedings would need to be mindful of the risk that they may be sued or found liable for abuse of process. Of course, to some extent, the potential chilling effect is addressed and limited by the fact that a claim in abuse of process is rather difficult to establish, even in jurisdictions where the tort is recognised. That is clear from the survey we have undertaken at [140]–[147] above. Yet, like malice, abuse of process may be “far more often alleged than proved” (<span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Sumption’s remarks on the tort of malicious prosecution in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [148]) and in such cases, “[t]he vice of secondary litigation is in the attempt” (<span class="font-italic">ibid</span>). In other words, <span class="font-italic">despite </span>the difficulty of successfully claiming in abuse of process, recognising the tort may <span class="font-italic">still</span> carry a chilling or deterrent effect because litigants may be deterred by the <span class="font-italic">threat or possibility </span>of being sued for abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Availability of a remedy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Finally, as we have demonstrated with respect to malicious prosecution at [120]–[122] above, one policy reason weighing against the recognition of the tort of abuse of process is that there are other remedies available to address the problem of abusive litigation. There exists – for the vast majority of cases – a system of various rules of civil procedure which deal precisely with various aspects of abuse of process of the court. Such rules permit a defendant to apply to the court to prevent such abuse − often well before the claim concerned has progressed significantly within the court’s system. Where the facts support a suggestion that the plaintiff is abusing court processes for an ulterior purpose, the defendant may apply to the court to strike out the plaintiff’s statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action or as being frivolous or vexatious or as otherwise constituting an abuse of process. Conversely, where the defendant’s conduct of his case constitutes an abuse of process, the plaintiff can, for example, apply for summary judgment against the defendant pursuant to O 14 of the Rules. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 At this juncture we return to a point already mentioned above (see [142]), which is that it seems entirely plausible that the tort of abuse of process fell into a period of inactivity after the 1860s <span class="font-italic">precisely because </span>the rules of civil procedure provided for a clear mechanism for curbing abuses of the court’s process. In this regard, the dates on which the leading decisions of <span class="font-italic">Grainger</span> and <span class="font-italic">Gilding</span> were decided, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, in 1838 and 1861, respectively, are extremely significant because they fell <span class="font-italic">before </span>the English Rules of the Supreme Court were first promulgated in <span class="font-italic">1883</span>. In the egregious situations that formed the basis of the respective courts’ award of a remedy for the tort of abuse of process in both <span class="font-italic">Grainger</span> and <span class="font-italic">Gilding</span>, the award of such a remedy was probably the only legal avenue that enabled the respective courts to achieve a just and fair result. Presumably, if the legal issues in those cases had arisen <span class="font-italic">after</span> the promulgation of the 1883 Rules, the respective abuses of process might have been addressed at an earlier stage of the litigation process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Thus, it is not the case that innocent litigants who are put to the inconvenience and unpleasantness of abusive civil proceedings are completely without a remedy. In most situations, the Rules would provide just the avenue for parties to seek redress.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 Finally, as was also our view as to why the tort of malicious prosecution should not be extended to civil proceedings generally in Singapore, we are of the view that the introduction of the tort of abuse of process might at least possibly – if not actually – be <span class="font-italic">incompatible with</span> the increased (as well as increasing) shift towards integrating <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">mediation</span> into the fabric of the Singapore legal system – a point which we have already elaborated upon above (see [119]) in relation to the tort of malicious prosecution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 For the reasons set out in this part of the judgment, we do <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>recognise the tort of abuse of process in Singapore and reiterate the point that there are ample legal mechanisms within the existing rules of civil procedure that afford innocent parties adequate legal remedies in the event that there is indeed an abuse of process by the party concerned on the other side. <span class="font-italic">For this reason </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">alone</span><span class="font-italic">, it is clear that the appeal on this particular issue must fail simply because, like the issue raised in relation to the tort of malicious prosecution, </span><span class="font-italic">Lee Tat’s claim cannot even take off since the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">legal basis</span> <span class="font-italic">upon which it premises that claim </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">does not exist</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 We should add, however, that <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">even if</span> this court recognised the extension of the tort of abuse of process, Lee Tat’s claim would <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">still fail </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic font-underline">on the relevant facts</span>. Let us elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Even if the tort were recognised</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 As made clear by Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Crawford Adjusters </span>at [149], an illegitimate purpose is one which seeks “some wholly extraneous benefit other than the relief sought and not reasonably flowing from or connected with the relief sought”. Having “an ulterior purpose in view as a desired byproduct of the litigation” (see the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Goldsmith v </span><span class="font-italic">Sperrings Ltd and others </span>[1977] WLR 478 at 503) does not amount to an illegitimate purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 Lee Tat’s <span class="font-italic">own </span>submission is that the MCST’s “collateral purpose” was to enhance the value of its own land by retaining the Grange Heights address and name. We fully agree with the Judge that this was not a purpose which was not reasonably related to victory or a favourable result in the proceedings (see the Judgment at [35]). In other words, the benefit which the MCST sought was not “wholly extraneous”, but rather was closely connected with the relief which the MCST hoped to obtain in the proceedings. Retaining Grange Heights’ name and address was wholly contingent on the existence of the MCST’s purported Right of Way, which was the subject matter of the Second to Fifth Actions (see the Judgment at [35]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 For these reasons, we uphold the Judge’s decision to reject Lee Tat’s claim in abuse of process, even assuming that the tort of abuse of process exists in the first place (which we have held is <span class="font-italic">not </span>the case).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Malicious falsehood</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 We turn now to the claim in malicious falsehood. Lee Tat argues that the 1997 and 2007 Statements were false at the time they were made. It criticises the Judge’s finding that the “weight of judicial authority at the time of the [Statements] was firmly in favour of the MCST enjoying a right of way over the Servient Tenement” (see the Judgment at [110]). To the contrary, Lee Tat argues that in 1997, the Second Action had determined only that Lee Tat was not entitled to erect a gate and fence on the ends of the Servient Tenement. It had <span class="font-italic">not</span> been determined that the Right of Way could be used for the benefit of Lot 561. Furthermore, Lee Tat asserts that the Judge effectively disregarded the Court of Appeal’s finding in the Third Action that the Right of Way had already been extinguished by operation of law, and that the Extension Issue had never been decided on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 Lee Tat also argues that the Statements were made “carelessly, recklessly and/or with the dominant intention of injuring Lee Tat as a property developer”. It argues that the MCST was aware at all times that Lee Tat was a property developer and that, by asserting the Right of Way over the Servient Tenement, the MCST knew that it would “naturally injure” Lee Tat as such, by preventing Lee Tat from developing the Servient Tenement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 The MCST essentially argues that the Judge was right to find that the Statements were not made with knowledge of falsity or recklessness as to the truth because, among other things, the weight of judicial authority was in the MCST’s favour at the time.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law on malicious falsehood</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 As the Judge noted, there are four elements to the tort of malicious falsehood (see the Judgment at [93], citing <span class="font-italic">Golden Season </span>at [159] and <span class="font-italic">WBG Network </span>at [68]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the defendant must have published to third parties words which are false; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the words must refer to the claimant, his property or his business; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the words must have been published maliciously; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) special damage must have followed as a direct and natural result of the publication. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The parties’ arguments raise questions in relation to the first and third of these elements, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the Statements were false at the time they were made and whether the Statements were published maliciously. We address each of these issues in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The falsity of the Statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The 1997 Statement asserted that “the estate’s owners had the right to use the road forever – for walking as well as for driving”, and that “the residents could not give up the right to access because it was a valuable piece of land”. The 2007 Statement asserted that Grange Heights enjoyed “[c]onvenient access from Grange Road”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 There are essentially two planks in Lee Tat’s argument that these Statements were false at the time they were made:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the Statements were false because the MCST did not actually have any judicial authority supporting its claim that it was entitled to the Right of Way, whether in 1997 or 2007. In 1997, the Second Action had not actually determined that the MCST was entitled to use the Right of Way to access Lot 561. Further, in both 1997 and 2007, the Extension Issue had never actually been decided on the merits.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the Statements were false because the Right of Way had been extinguished in 1976 upon the amalgamation of Lots 111-34 and 561.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 In so far as the first argument is concerned, for the reasons stated by the Judge at [101]–[106] of the Judgment, we find that there is no merit whatsoever to Lee Tat’s contention that the courts in the Second and Fourth Actions had not actually determined that the MCST was entitled to use the Right of Way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 With regard to the Second Action, we agree fully with the Judge that the judgments were “clearly grounded on the premise that the MCST and Grange Heights residents were legally entitled” to use the Right of Way (see the Judgment at [103]). Lee Tat argues that the only issue determined in the Second Action was “whether Lee Tat was entitled to erect the gate at one [end], and, the fence at the other end of the [S]ervient [T]enement or do similar acts to prevent the MCST from using the [S]ervient [T]enement”. In our view, this argument is pedantic and entirely disingenuous. Obviously, the main issue in the Second Action was whether the MCST was entitled to an injunction preventing Lee Tat from obstructing the MCST’s access to the Servient Tenement. However, the point is that it would have been utterly meaningless for the courts to have granted the MCST such relief <span class="font-italic">unless </span>the MCST <span class="font-italic">was </span>entitled to the Right of Way. The fact that the High Court granted the MCST this injunction, and that this decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal, necessarily implied that the MCST was entitled to a right of way over the Servient Tenement. Thus the Judge was entirely justified in saying that the MCST had “[t]he weight of judicial authority” in its favour (see the Judgment at [110]) at the time when it made the 1997 Statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 As for the Third and Fourth Actions, for the reasons stated by the Judge in [104] of the Judgment, we wholly agree that the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (HC) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 4)</span><span class="font-italic"> (CA) </span>as well as the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (HC) </span>were made on the basis that the MCST and Grange Heights residents were entitled to use the Right of Way. Thus, we reject the argument that the MCST had no judicial authority supporting the 1997 Statement and the 2007 Statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 The true question, however, is not whether the Statements were supported by judicial authority, but whether they were <span class="font-italic">false</span>. The thrust of Lee Tat’s argument is that the statements <span class="font-italic">were </span>false because the “true legal position” was that the amalgamation of Lots 111-34 and 561 had extinguished the Right of Way in 1976.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 The question of whether the Statements were false when they were made is not a straightforward one to answer. As noted above, the state of play at the material times (both in 1997 and 2007) was such that there had been judicial pronouncements stating or suggesting that Grange Heights residents were entitled to use the Right of Way. On the other hand, it is now clear with the benefit of hindsight that the amalgamation of Lots 111-34 and 561 extinguished the Right of Way in 1976 (see [32] above). This was the finding of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Grange</span><span class="font-italic"> Heights (No 3) (CA)</span>. As the Judge acknowledged at [132] of the Judgment, that decision is retroactive in that the MCST’s Right of Way must be taken to have been extinguished at the point in time when Lots 111-34 and 561 were amalgamated. It is now also clear that based on the <span class="font-italic">Harris v Flower </span>principle, the Right of Way did not extend to Lot 561 (see [32] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Where a statement is made or an act is performed in reliance on a settled understanding of the law which is later overturned by subsequent judicial decision, the issue of whether the statement or act was “wrong” or “mistaken” can be a vexed question. In the domain of unjust enrichment, it has been held that where a payment is made in reliance on a settled understanding of law which is later, <span class="font-italic">after the time of payment</span>, overtaken by subsequent judicial pronouncement, that payment was made “under a mistake of law” at the time of payment, and is therefore liable to be repaid. This was the conclusion of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council </span>[1999] 2 AC 349 (“<span class="font-italic">Kleinwort Benson</span>”). The appellant bank in that case entered into various interest rate swap agreements with four respondent local authorities. After these agreements were entered into, a House of Lords decision, <span class="font-italic">Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council </span>[1992] 2 AC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Hazell</span>”), declared that such interest rate swap agreements with local authorities were <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>and void. The appellant bank sought to recover moneys paid over to the respondent local authorities on the basis that they had been paid under a mistake of law. The House of Lords allowed the appellant’s appeal by a three-to-two majority. The majority held that by virtue of the principle of retrospectivity, the law applicable <span class="font-italic">at the date of the payments </span>was that such interest rate swap agreements were <span class="font-italic">ultra vires </span>and void, notwithstanding that this position was only established in <span class="font-italic">Hazell</span> subsequently (see <span class="font-italic">Kleinwort Benson </span>at 379 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Goff of Chieveley). It followed that the appellant bank was operating under a mistake of law when it paid the sums over to the respondent authorities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 The example of <span class="font-italic">Kleinwort Benson </span>is, however, of limited assistance in this case given that it involves the specific context of unjust enrichment which carries with it unique considerations (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the judgment of Lord Hoffmann who suggested that it was inappropriate to consider “what counts as a mistake in too abstract a way, divorced from its setting in the law of unjust enrichment” (<span class="font-italic">Kleinwort Benson </span>at 398)). A further point of distinction is that in <span class="font-italic">Kleinwort Benson</span>, the parties had never subjected their dispute to prior litigation. In fact, their “settled understanding of law” that the interest rate swap agreements were <span class="font-italic">intra vires </span>and valid was not based on any prior judicial decision at all. In contrast, in the present case, the MCST and Lee Tat had<span class="font-italic"> </span>been through <span class="font-italic">prior litigation</span>, the upshot of which was to suggest that the MCST did enjoy the Right of Way. In other words, the MCST had made the Statements relying, <span class="font-italic">not</span> <span class="font-italic">merely </span>on some abstract principle of law, but on the strength of the decisions in the First, Second and Fourth Actions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 In our view, it is presently unnecessary to decide whether the Statements were false because, as we shall explain, the element of malice is not made out in any event. In the circumstances, we shall not express a definite view on the matter. Nevertheless, we would make the passing observation that the Judge’s view that the Statements were not false is consistent with the principle of finality, which requires that even erroneous decisions be given due effect (<span class="font-italic">TT International</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [71]). As we noted in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span>, the concern underlying the principle of finality is to give litigants the “assurance that they can – indeed <span class="font-italic">must </span>– order their affairs on the strength of judicial decisions relating to the matters which they are disputing” [emphasis in original] (at [192]). It would seem antithetical to this idea to hold that the Statements, which reflected and perhaps even relied on, the judicial pronouncements in the Second, Third and Fourth Actions, were false. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 In any event, even if we take Lee Tat’s case at its highest and assume that the 1997 and 2007 Statements were indeed false, Lee Tat’s claim for malicious falsehood would still fail because malice is not made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Malice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Malice is made out if (a) the defendant in publishing the falsehood was motivated by a dominant and improper intention to injure the plaintiff or (b) the defendant did not honestly believe that the statement was true or has acted with reckless disregard as to the truth of the statement (see the High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Maidstone Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Takenaka Corp </span>[1992] 1 SLR(R) 752 (“<span class="font-italic">Maidstone</span>”) at [48]–[49], citing the House of Lords decision of <span class="font-italic">Horrocks</span><span class="font-italic"> v Lowe </span>[1975] 1 AC 135 at 149–151). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Lee Tat argues that the making of the Statements was malicious because the MCST “had contrived to ensure that the [Extension] Issue was never decided” and then “made false Statements to the public … which it knew (or ought to have known) would, and did have, a tangible adverse effect on Lee Tat’s ability to develop its land”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 To begin with, Lee Tat has not even made clear whether it is suggesting that the MCST was acting with a dominant and improper motive to injure Lee Tat, or whether it is suggesting that the MCST did not honestly believe in the truth of the Statements. Either way, Lee Tat’s claim must fail. There is no evidence to suggest that the MCST’s dominant intention was to injure Lee Tat. Lee Tat claims that the MCST “knew (or ought to have known) [that the alleged falsehoods] would, and did have, a tangible adverse effect on Lee Tat’s ability to develop its land”, but the fact that a defendant knows that the publication would injure the plaintiff is insufficient to establish malice (<span class="font-italic">Maidstone </span>at [49]). In so far as Lee Tat’s claim hinges on the assertion that the MCST did not honestly believe in the truth of the Statements, we reject that assertion. As stated above, we agree wholly with the Judge that the “weight of judicial authority” at the material times was in favour of the MCST enjoying a right of way over the Servient Tenement. This militates against any suggestion that the MCST could not have had an honest belief in the truth of the Statements (even if it was a mistaken one).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 For this reason, we uphold the Judge’s decision to dismiss Lee Tat’s claim for malicious falsehood.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Trespass</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 We begin by noting that Lee Tat’s claim in trespass is necessarily limited to the period between 24 December 2006 and 1 December 2008. The Judge found that these were the only dates not excluded by virtue of s 6(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (see the Judgment at [119]), and that finding has not (correctly, in our view) been challenged on appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">187 In its written submissions, Lee Tat argued that the Judge was wrong to hold that the issue of Grange Heights residents’ entitlement to use the Servient Tenement was <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>because of the Court of Appeal’s decision in the Fourth Action. According to Lee Tat, the Court of Appeal decided as it did in the Fourth Action only because it was <span class="font-italic">misled </span>by the MCST that the Extension Issue had already been decided in the Second Action. Lee Tat contended that to allow the MCST to benefit from the judgments in the Fourth Action by excusing it from liability for trespass would be to allow the MCST to gain an advantage by its own wrong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">188 The above argument was not pursued by Lee Tat in oral submissions. Instead, learned counsel for Lee Tat, Mr Chelva Rajah SC (“Mr Rajah”), adopted a different approach, which focused the attack on the Judge’s holding that “the benefits that accrued as a result of the First, Second and Fourth Actions are not liable to be disgorged as damages for trespass <span class="font-weight-bold">as a result of the application of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Arnold</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> exception</span>” [emphasis added] (see the Judgment at [132]). Mr Rajah argued that this was wrong because the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA) </span>was not based on only the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception. Instead, it was also based on findings that the Extension Issue was not <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, and (the court deciding this issue afresh) that Grange Heights residents were not entitled to use the Right of Way to access Grange Road. In this regard, Mr Rajah relied on the following passage from <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">5) (CA) </span>(at [26]), where this court summarised the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 3) (CA) </span>as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">On 1 December 2008, the 2008 [Court of Appeal] delivered its judgment in [<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>] and allowed Lee Tat’s appeal on <span class="font-weight-bold">three separate and distinct grounds</span>, namely (see [<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>]<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [111]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The [Extension Issue] (…) was not <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>as a matter of law as it had never been decided on the merits by the courts in the previous proceedings from [<span class="font-italic">Grange Height</span><span class="font-italic">s (No 1) (HC)</span>] to [<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights No 3 (HC)</span>].

This was significant because in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> at [190], this court held that in order for the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception to be met, “there can be no attempt to claw back rights that have accrued pursuant to the erroneous decision or to otherwise undo the effects of that decision”. Applying this principle, the Judge dismissed Lee Tat’s claim in trespass on the basis that the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception did not permit the reopening or undoing of <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA)</span> (see the Judgment at [131]). However, Mr Rajah argued that the Judge had erred in reasoning this way, because quite apart from the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights </span><span class="font-italic">(No 3) (CA) </span>had overruled <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights </span><span class="font-italic">(No 4) (CA) </span>on the separate basis that the Extension Issue had not been decided. Thus, Mr Rajah submitted that Lee Tat was not subject to the restriction to the effect that there could be no attempt to claw back rights that had accrued pursuant to the decisions in the Fourth Action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 We shall first address this argument which Mr Rajah made in oral submissions before we turn to discuss the argument made on behalf of Lee Tat in its written submissions – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the MCST misled the courts in the Fourth Action and cannot be allowed to benefit from its own wrong. Before we turn to our analysis of these arguments, however, it is necessary to clarify a point concerning the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span>, in light of certain submissions advanced on behalf of the MCST.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The effect of </span><span class="font-weight-bold">TT </span><span class="font-weight-bold">International</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 The MCST argues that in so far as Lee Tat’s claim in trespass is premised on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>, it is unsustainable because the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>has held that the Third Action was “wrongly decided”. The MCST goes so far as to argue that the Second and Fourth Action have been “effectively restored”. It relies on the following observations in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> at [191]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It follows that, in our judgment, [<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>] was, with respect, <span class="font-weight-bold">wrongly decided</span>. It was held by the 2008 [Court of Appeal] in that case that, since the majority in the 2005 [Court of Appeal] had not decided the Main Issue of whether Grange Heights residents and visitors had a right of way over the Servient Tenement on the merits, [<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA)</span>] … could not give rise to issue estoppel on that issue (at [82]). But, in our view, <span class="font-weight-bold">that sidesteps impermissibly the true issue estoppel created by the decision of the majority in the 2005 [Court of Appeal]: </span>the majority held that Lee Tat was estopped by the earlier decisions of Coomaraswamy J and the 1992 [Court of Appeal] from arguing that Grange Heights residents and visitors did not enjoy a right of way over the Servient Tenement. Even if the majority in [<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA)</span>] might have erred in so ruling, that error did not affect the position that Lee Tat remained estopped from arguing in later proceedings that Grange Heights residents and visitors did not enjoy such a right of way. [emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 In <span class="font-italic">TT International</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>we acknowledged that “it may seem ironic that we are overruling a past decision of this court in the name of finality” (at [192]). What is perhaps even <span class="font-italic">more </span>ironic is that our decision in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span>, which emphasised the principle of finality, has now been relied upon by the MCST as a basis for denying the final effect of <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>. We therefore take this opportunity to clarify that when we in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> commented on <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span> and held that it was wrongly decided, we <span class="font-italic">did not </span>intend to revise the outcome of that decision as between the parties. We therefore reject the MCST’s suggestion that the decisions in the Second and Fourth Actions have effectively been restored. Indeed under the law as laid out in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span>, notwithstanding any errors that may have been made in the course of the decision, this court’s conclusions in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span> stand, and are final. Lee Tat’s claim in trespass must be approached on that basis. It would be antithetical to <span class="font-italic">TT International</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>itself to hold otherwise. Thus, notwithstanding our remarks in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span>, the conclusions reached by this court in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 3) (CA) </span>remain final and binding upon the parties. The question at the heart of Lee Tat’s claim in trespass is whether Lee Tat is estopped from pursing that claim, in light of the findings in the Fourth and the Third Actions. We therefore turn to address Mr Rajah’s oral submissions on this point.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lee Tat is estopped from pursuing the claim in trespass</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The argument that the decision in Grange Heights (No 3) (CA) was not only based on the </span>Arnold<span class="font-italic"> exception</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">193 In our view, Mr Rajah’s argument, in so far as it focuses on the fact that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA) </span>was not solely based on the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception, is somewhat imprecise. A careful reading of the Judge’s reasons suggests that the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception was central to his dismissal of the trespass claim <span class="font-italic">not </span>because it formed the basis of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>but because, in his view, it formed the <span class="font-italic">only possible basis on which he could undo the effects</span> of <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA)</span>. That is demonstrated by the following passage of the Judgment (at [131]): “By suing the MCST in trespass, Lee Tat <span class="font-weight-bold">sought to undo the effect of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">4) (CA)</span><span class="font-weight-bold">. The </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Arnold </span><span class="font-weight-bold">exception does not entitle it to do so.</span>” [emphasis added]. In other words, the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception was relevant because to allow Lee Tat’s claim in trespass would be to unwind the effects of <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 4) (CA)</span> and, in the Judge’s view, this could only be permissible if Lee Tat could bring itself within the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">194 It follows that the grounds on which this court in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA) </span>set aside the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA) </span>are not strictly relevant. Mr Rajah’s argument does, however, raise an interesting question – is the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception, or more generally the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>applicable here at all? The doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>ordinarily attaches finality to “a decision pronounced by a judicial … tribunal with jurisdiction over the cause of action and the parties, which disposes once and for all of the fundamental matters decided, so that, except on appeal, they cannot be re-litigated between persons bound by the judgment” (see the definition of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>in K R Handley, <span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower and Handley</span>: <span class="font-italic">Res Judicata </span>(LexisNexis, 4th Ed, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower and Handley</span>”) at para 1.01). Yet, the Court in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 3) (CA) </span>found that the Extension Issue had never been decided on the merits and thus reopened and effectively set aside the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 4) (CA)</span>. Arguably, that decision no longer comes within the definition of a <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>– it did not dispose of the “fundamental matters” once and for all. Those matters were <span class="font-italic">in fact </span>re-litigated between the parties in the Third Action, and were revisited on the basis that certain issues thought to have been decided between the parties were never actually decided after all. Why, then, should Lee Tat be estopped from challenging or undoing <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No 4</span><span class="font-italic">) (CA) </span>by arguing that Grange Heights residents never had a right to interfere with the Servient Tenement, and were therefore trespassing between 24 December 2006 and 1 December 2008? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 In our view, there are two reasons why Lee Tat is estopped from pursuing its claim in trespass by virtue of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA)</span>. Before we explain these reasons we emphasise that our decision on this point must be viewed within the <span class="font-italic">highly exceptional and unusual </span>facts of this particular case. The winding course of the dispute between Lee Tat and the MCST has given rise to a unique set of circumstances, the likes of which will probably not be seen again. It is extremely unusual that a matter, having been pursued to the furthest extent thought possible within the judicial system (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to an appeal to its apex court) would subsequently be reopened by a later sitting of that same court, on the basis of an alleged error by the earlier court. Indeed, the principles of finality as pronounced by this court in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> – including the rule that even erroneous decisions must be given effect,<span class="font-italic"> </span>and the narrowly confined exceptions to cause of action and issue estoppel – are intended to avoid precisely this type of situation, in which a final decision of the highest court is subsequently upended, giving rise to uncertainty and conflicting judgments. Bearing these considerations in mind, we find that Lee Tat is <span class="font-italic">not</span> entitled to pursue its claim in trespass for the following reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 First, while this court in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 3) (CA) </span>set aside the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA) </span>on the basis that the Extension Issue had never been decided, we have established in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that this was the wrong course because it “sidesteps impermissibly the true estoppel created by the decision of the majority in the [Fourth Action]” – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Lee Tat was estopped from disputing the MCST’s Right of Way by virtue of the findings in the Second Action (see <span class="font-italic">TT International</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [191]). Perhaps somewhat ironically, the doctrine of finality requires that we must give effect to <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>, even though we have established that the Court’s decision<span class="font-italic"> </span>to set aside <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 4) (CA) </span>was wrong. That means that the Court of Appeal’s decision in the Third Action to review the Extension Issue afresh, and the consequence of that review – which was to recognise that the MCST had no Right of Way over the Servient Tenement – cannot be reversed or questioned anymore. The MCST cannot, for example, seek to have the finding that it was not entitled to the Right of Way set aside on the basis that the issue was wrongly re-litigated in the Third Action. <span class="font-italic">However</span>, in so far as we have established that the Court in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 3) (CA) </span>was wrong to have found that no issue estoppel arose from the Fourth Action, there is no reason to perpetuate this error further by allowing Lee Tat to reach back in time to try to impose liability on the MCST for acts done in the interim period between <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA) </span>and <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>. This is closely related to our second point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 Our second point is this: Underlying the Judge’s analysis of Lee Tat’s claim in trespass, and in particular his consideration of the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception, was the assumption that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 4) (CA) </span>enjoys <span class="font-italic">some </span>measure of finality, notwithstanding that it was overturned in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>. The effect of that measure of finality is to enable the MCST <span class="font-italic">now</span> to rely on <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA)</span> as representing the prevailing and definitive authority on the parties’ rights during the period 24 December 2006 and 1 December 2008 notwithstanding that that decision was subsequently overruled by <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>. This explains why, in the Judge’s view, “the benefits that accrued<span class="font-italic"> </span>as a result of the First, Second and Fourth Actions are not liable to be disgorged” (see the Judgment at [132]).

There is also no doubt that that question was argued before the court. The majority concluded that the MCST </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">was </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">entitled to use the Right of Way by holding that the question had already been decided in an earlier decision – </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ie</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, the Second Action (</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">4) (CA) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [14]–[16]), and that the change in Lee Tat’s status from owner of two dominant tenements to the owner of the Servient Tenement made no difference to the MCST’s Right of Way (at [16]). No one has suggested that the court was not entitled to arrive at that conclusion in the manner that it did, even though the substance of that conclusion proved later to be wrong. Nor has anyone disputed that everybody at that time believed that that was what the court decided and was entitled to decide. In sum, the process by which the highest court in this jurisdiction arrived at its decision in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> 4) (CA)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> cannot reasonably be impugned, nor could its substance have been reasonably misunderstood. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The question, then, is which of what appear to be two equally final judgments should now be given effect as between Lee Tat and the MCST in respect of the interim period between the decision in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">4) (CA) </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">and </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">3) (CA)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">? The answer will not readily be found within</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">a conventional application of </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the doctrine of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">res judicata </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">because that doctrine is not designed to accommodate the situation where there are apparently </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">two</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> conflicting judgments which are </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">equally final</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. Indeed, that is the exact quandary which the doctrine is designed </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">to avoid, not to resolve</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. One therefore must look </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">beneath </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the conventional contours of the doctrine of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">res judicata</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> – beyond its concepts and theoretical constructs – at its axiomatic </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">rationale. That rationale is that parties must be able to </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">order their affairs on the strength of judicial pronouncements</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">That expression, which we employed in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">TT International</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [192], constitutes the heart of the meaning of finality</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">. And this rationale is by no means unfamiliar to the law. As this court recently held in a cognate but distinct area of the law relating to the effect of judgments, it is one of the reasons why there is no absolute rule that judgments have retroactive effect (see </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Adri</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Anton Kalangie </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">at [30] </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">per</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Sundaresh Menon </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">CJ). To be clear, we are not saying that </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">4) (CA)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">has no such effect, as we have indicated at [198] above.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">That rationale can lead to only one answer when the court is concerned with liability – as between Lee Tat and the MCST – for the acts that took place from 24 December 2006 to 1 December 2008. Logically, it cannot be that the court must give effect to the judgment in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">3) (CA)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, because that decision lay in the future and parties could not possibly order their affairs on the strength of it. The </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">court can only give effect to the judgment in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">4) (CA)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> for that decision, though no longer in effect </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">today</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">,</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">was the only judgment upon which the parties could order their affairs during that time period. It follows that </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">the MCST was entitled to “order their affairs on the strength of” the decision in </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">4) (CA)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">That expression is the normative basis for the right that the MCST is now entitled to assert, and there is no reason why Lee Tat should be permitted to impugn that right. Again, we stress that this must be seen in light of the exceptional facts of this case and, in particular, the fact that the MCST had pursued the matter to the highest court in the land. The same reasoning would </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">not </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">apply if, hypothetically, we were concerned with acts of trespass that took place in an interim period between a judgment of a lower court and the subsequent overturning of that judgment in a higher court. On the present facts, </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">however, </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">4) (CA)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> may have been stripped of its substance</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> on the more general plane, but the legitimacy </span>of its effect on the parties during the period between 24 December 2006 and 1 December 2008 cannot reasonably be questioned, <span class="font-italic">even now</span>, and in that sense, it preserves a measure of finality to this day. It would be wholly inimical to the spirit behind the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>to say that the MCST, having relied on the force of the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA)</span>, could nevertheless be liable for trespass from 24 December 2006 to 1 December 2008. We therefore see no reason to disturb the Judge’s finding that Lee Tat cannot now try to disgorge the benefits which Grange Heights residents enjoyed as a result of the findings in the Fourth Actions. That leaves us the task of discussing Lee Tat’s argument that the MCST obtained the judgment in the Fourth Action by misleading the Court, and cannot be allowed to benefit from its own wrong.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The argument that the MCST cannot be allowed to benefit from its own wrong</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 In substance, Lee Tat’s case is that the principle that one cannot gain an advantage by his own wrong renders the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>inapplicable. Put another way, Lee Tat is trying to carve out <span class="font-italic">another</span> exception to issue estoppel and to undermine the final effect of <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 In <span class="font-italic">TT International</span>, we foreclosed the possibility that other exceptions to issue estoppel exist (at [193]) – apart from fraud or collusion, and of course, the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception. To buttress the argument that the MCST cannot be allowed to rely on <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA)</span>, Lee Tat has latched onto remarks made in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">5) (CA) </span>at [99] stating that the MCST “appear[s] to have deliberately suppressed (by omission) the fact that its submissions on the <span class="font-italic">Harris v Flower </span>issue in [the Fourth Action] appeal … were contradictory to its submissions on that same issue in the [Second Action] appeal”. It says that the MCST obtained the judgment in its favour in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 4) (CA) </span>only through “its egregious misconduct in misleading the Court”, but it stops short of alleging fraud or collusion. The difficulty for Lee Tat is that in order for the doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>to be rendered inapplicable, “[t]here must be <span class="font-italic">actual fraud</span>, that is conscious and deliberate dishonesty, and the judgment must be obtained by it” (<span class="font-italic">Spencer Bower and Handley </span>[emphasis added] at para 17.03, citing the Court of Appeal in Chancery decision of <span class="font-italic">Patch v Ward </span>(1867) LR 3 Ch App 203 at 207). Lee Tat has no evidence whatsoever of actual fraud, or conscious and deliberate dishonesty. It only has the dicta in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">5) (CA)</span> which states in <span class="font-italic">tentative terms </span>that the MCST <span class="font-italic">may </span>have deliberately suppressed the contradictory positions which it took in the Fourth Action and the Second Action, but that will not suffice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Moreover, the requirement is that the judgment must be obtained <span class="font-italic">by </span>the fraud. Yet as the Judge noted (see the Judgment at [69]), even if it were true that in the Fourth Action proceedings, the MCST deliberately suppressed the fact that it had, in the Second Action, raised the argument that Lee Tat lacked <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>to raise the Extension Issue, it could not be said that it <span class="font-italic">obtained</span> the outcome of the Fourth Action <span class="font-italic">by</span> such dishonesty. Lee Tat itself asserted in the Fourth Action that it did not have <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>to raise the Extension Issue in the Second Action, and this was a point noted by the majority (<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA) </span>at [13]), even though the majority disagreed with it. Further, in Chao JA’s dissent, he noted that Lee Tat had been involved in the First and Second Actions in a different capacity as compared to the Fourth Action, because at that time it was not yet the owner of the Servient Tenement (<span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA) </span>at [66]). He also specifically noted the submissions advanced on behalf of Lee Tat that it <span class="font-italic">could not have raised </span>issues in the First and Second Actions which the owner of the Servient Tenement could (<span class="font-italic">Grange </span><span class="font-italic">Heights (No 4) (CA) </span>at [67]). In other words, the argument that the Extension Issue had not actually been decided in the Second Action because Lee Tat did not, at the time, have <span class="font-italic">locus </span><span class="font-italic">standi </span>to raise it was fully ventilated notwithstanding any purported attempt by the MCST to suppress this fact. In the circumstances, it is clear that the MCST’s failure to highlight this fact did not in any way affect the outcome of the decision in the Fourth Action on appeal. Clearly, then, the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA) </span>cannot be said to have been obtained by wilful suppression, let alone by any fraud or collusion on the MCST’s part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Finally, and for completeness, we would also note that Lee Tat cannot avail itself of the <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception. The <span class="font-italic">Arnold </span>exception is premised on the following conditions identified in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [190]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the decision said to give rise to issue estoppel must directly affect the <span class="font-italic">future </span>determination of the rights of the litigants;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the decision must be shown to be clearly wrong;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) the error in the decision must be shown to have stemmed from the fact that some point of fact or law relevant to the decision was not taken or argued before the court which made that decision <span class="font-italic">and </span>could not reasonably have been taken or argued on that occasion;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) there can be no attempt to claw back rights that have accrued pursuant to the erroneous decision or to otherwise undo the effects of that decision; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) it must be shown that great injustice would result if the litigant in question were estopped from putting forward the particular point which is said to be the subject of issue estoppel – in this regard, if the litigant failed to take advantage of an avenue of appeal that was available to him, it will usually not be possible for him to show that the requisite injustice nevertheless exists.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Quite clearly, these conditions are not satisfied in the present case. The decision said to give rise to an issue estoppel – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No</span><span class="font-italic"> 4) (CA) </span>– obviously does <span class="font-italic">not </span>directly affect the <span class="font-italic">future</span> determination of the rights of the litigants, because it has been reversed by virtue of <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">3) (CA)</span>. Furthermore, Lee Tat is clearly trying to “claw back rights that have accrued pursuant to [the decision in <span class="font-italic">Grange Heights (No </span><span class="font-italic">4) (CA)</span>] or to otherwise undo the effects of that decision” by seeking to make the MCST liable in trespass for Grange Heights residents’ use of the Servient Tenement prior to December 2008.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 For these reasons, we also uphold the Judge’s decision to disallow Lee Tat’s claim in trespass.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 For the reasons set out above, we dismiss the appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 Unless the parties are able to come to an agreement on costs, they are to furnish, within 14 days, written submissions limited to 10 pages each, setting out their respective positions on the appropriate costs orders for this appeal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 We observe that we commenced the present judgment by noting a general irony embodied in the present proceedings – that a bitterly fought dispute over several decades between two parties who have nothing but personal ill will towards each other has engendered (for Singapore law) questions of the first importance in relation to the development of the common law in general and tort law in particular. At this juncture, we note that, having arrived at our decision, we have also avoided a <span class="font-italic">further</span> potential<span class="font-italic"> </span>irony: If we had, as Lee Tat has urged, recognised the torts of malicious prosecution or abuse of process, <span class="font-italic">but</span> had found against Lee Tat on the relevant facts (as we indeed have done), then Lee Tat would by its own hand have sown the seeds of future proceedings against it by the MCST based on these <span class="font-italic">very same</span> torts<span class="font-italic">. </span>Such proceedings could have gone on <span class="font-italic">ad infinitu</span><span class="font-italic">m</span> with the parties taking turns to play plaintiff. And this possibility would not have been merely theoretical given the acrimonious relationship between Lee Tat and the MCST that has <span class="font-italic">already </span>stretched across more than four decades. As it turns out, this point is now moot since we have held that the aforementioned torts ought <span class="font-italic">not</span> to be recognised in the Singapore context. However, it also demonstrates – in a more concrete fashion – some of the many (at least potential) pitfalls that might have emerged if these torts had been recognised.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Finally, we would like to express our deepest appreciation to Prof Chan for his invaluable assistance.

<strong>
Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Justice Andrew Phang Boon
Leong):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The CoA holds that the tort of malicious prosecution should not be extended
to civil proceedings generally, that there is no tort of abuse of process,
and that the appellant is estopped by an overruled CoA decision from
bringing a claim in trespass.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    This appeal is about the consequences of a longstanding legal
    dispute over whether the residents of a condominium development
    called Grange Heights had a right of way over a strip of land to
    access a road in a prime district in the city. In 2005, the Court
    of Appeal held that they had such a right of way. But in 2008, the
    Court of Appeal overruled its 2005 decision, holding that any such
    right of way had been extinguished by law in 1976 when the two
    adjoining plots of land on which Grange Heights was built (Lots
    111-34 and 561) were amalgamated. In the proceedings from which
    this appeal arose, the owners of the strip of land, Lee Tat
    Development Pte Ltd (“Lee Tat”), sued the management corporation of
    Grange Heights (“the MCST”), claiming damages for the MCST’s (a)
    malicious prosecution of two previous actions to assert the right
    of way; (b) abuse of the court’s process, by asserting that right
    in four previous actions; (c) malicious expression of the falsehood
    that it possessed that right, on two occasions; and (d) trespass on
    Lee Tat’s property, by using the strip of land until the 2008
    decision was handed down in December that year.
    </p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    Today, for the reasons summarised below, the Court of Appeal
    upholds the High Court’s decision to dismiss all four claims. In
    particular, the Court declines Lee Tat’s invitation to extend the
    tort of malicious prosecution to civil proceedings generally, thus
    electing not to follow two recent decisions of the UK Supreme Court
    and the UK Judicial Committee of the Privy Council respectively,
    both decisions notably being the result of a sharply divided coram.
    The Court also declines to recognise the tort of abuse of process.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Malicious prosecution</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    The Court holds that although a party is entitled to recover
    damages for the malicious prosecution of criminal proceedings
    against him, he is not entitled to recover damages for the
    malicious prosecution of civil claims against him, except in very
    limited and defined categories of cases which are not applicable to
    the present case. This is for reasons of principle and policy. (            <strong>[85]</strong> and <strong>[128]</strong>)
    </p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    In terms of principle, essential differences between criminal and
    civil proceedings justify maintaining the distinction as to whether
    either is capable of giving rise to claims for malicious
    prosecution. In particular, the public character and the generally
    harsher consequences of criminal proceedings undergird the law’s
    recognition that those who suffer damage at the hands of
    prosecutors who abuse their function for malicious reasons deserve
    a remedy. Furthermore, extending the tort to civil proceedings
    generally is inconsistent with the principle that malice is
    generally irrelevant in the context of tort law, which assumes that
    if an act is lawful, a person has the right to do it despite any
    ill motives on his part. Finally, extending the tort that way would
    introduce uncertainty into cognate areas of law, such as the law of
    privilege. (<strong>[86]–[103]</strong>)
    </p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    In terms of policy, extending the tort would undermine the
    principle of finality in the law by encouraging needless satellite
    litigation of the kind exemplified by the present case. It would
    also have a chilling effect on regular litigation by deterring
    genuine claimants from invoking the court’s jurisdiction. It would
    also be incompatible with an increasing shift towards integrating
    mediation as a method of dispute resolution into the fabric of our
    legal system. Finally, there exist mechanisms in the current rules
    of civil procedure for bringing to a prompt and early end claims
    that would otherwise constitute malicious prosecutions. (            <strong>[104]–[127]</strong>)
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Abuse of process</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    The Court considers that the torts of abuse of process and
    malicious prosecution are similar not only as to their elements but
    also as to their underlying rationale. Accordingly, the policy
    reasons leading the Court not to extend the latter to civil
    proceedings also compel the Court not to recognise the former. In
    particular, recognising the tort of abuse of process would
    undermine the principle of finality. Although a claim in the tort
    need not be brought only after conclusion of the proceedings which
    are alleged to be abusive, such a claim can still be brought many
    years after, as has been done in the present case. Recognising the
    tort would also create a chilling effect for genuine litigants.
    Finally, there are existing rules of civil procedure which deal
    precisely with various aspects of abuse of process of the court. (            <strong>[150]–[161]</strong>)
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Malicious falsehood</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    The first statement Lee Tat claims is a malicious falsehood asserts
    that “the estate’s owners had the right to use the road forever –
    for walking as well as for driving” and that “the residents could
    not give up the right to access because it was a valuable piece of
    land”. The second asserts that Grange Heights enjoyed “[c]onvenient
    access from Grange Road”. The Court holds that both statements were
    not malicious falsehoods because they were not made with malice.
    There was no evidence that they were made with a dominant or
    improper intention to injure Lee Tat. Further, at the time the
    statements were made, in 1997 and 2007 respectively, there were
    judicial pronouncements stating or suggesting that Grange Heights
    residents had a right of way over the strip of land. This militates
    against any suggestion that the MCST could not have had an honest
    belief in the truth of the statements, or that the MCST made the
    statements with reckless disregard as to their truth. (            <strong>[181]–[185]</strong>)
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Trespass</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    Lee Tat’s claim in trespass is limited to the period between
    December 2006 and December 2008 as a result of the applicable
    limitation period. This was the period between (a) when time
    started to run for limitation purposes, which was during the period
    when the Court’s 2005 decision in the MCST’s favour prevailed; and
    (b) the Court’s 2008 decision which found that the MCST had no
    right of way over the strip of land. The Court holds that there are
    two reasons why Lee Tat is estopped from pursuing its claim in
    trespass in respect of this period. (<strong>[186] </strong>and            <strong>[195]</strong>)
    </p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    The first reason is as follows. In 2008, the Court set aside its
    2005 decision on the basis that in that decision, it had wrongly
    held that one of its previous decisions in this litigation, handed
    down in 1992, had determined the issue whether the right of way,
    which was granted for the benefit of only Lot 111-34, extended to
    Lot 561. In fact, the 1992 decision made no such determination.
    However, in setting aside the 2005 decision, the Court in 2008 had
    impermissibly sidestepped the truly determinative finding in the
    2005 decision, namely, that Lee Tat was estopped from disputing the
    MCST’s right of way. Even if the Court in the 2005 decision had
    erred in so finding, that erroneous decision should have been given
    effect because of the principle of finality. Thus, the Court in
    2008 was wrong to have set aside the 2005 decision, as had been
    recognised in <em>obiter dicta </em>in an unrelated 2015 decision
    of the Court,
    <em>
    The Royal Bank of Scotland NV (formerly known as ABN Amro Bank
    NV) and others v TT International Ltd (nTan Corporation
    Advisory Pte Ltd and others, other parties) and another appeal
    </em>
    [2015] 5 SLR 1104. However, although the Court had erred in setting
    aside the 2005 decision in its 2008 decision, the latter decision
    had to be given final effect. That said, there was no reason for
    the Court now to perpetuate this error by allowing Lee Tat to reach
    back in time to establish a claim in trespass. (            <strong>[196]</strong>)
    </p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    Second, the 2005 decision enjoys a measure of finality that enables
    the MCST now to rely on it as representing the definitive authority
    on the parties’ rights from the period of December 2006 to December
    2008. The fact is that the Court is now faced with two
    contradictory but final decisions of an apex court, namely, its
    2005 decision and its 2008 decision, and the question is which
    should be given effect as between Lee Tat and the MCST during that
    period. The answer has to be the 2005 decision because it was the
    only decision upon which the parties during that period could have
    ordered their affairs. (<strong>[197]–[203]</strong>)
    </p>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
    Finally, the Court holds that Lee Tat is unable to escape the issue
    estoppel arising from the 2005 decision. It is unable to show that
    the MCST obtained that decision by actual fraud. The only other
    recognised exception to issue estoppel is what is known as the            <em>Arnold</em> exception, which enables a decided issue to be
    reargued if, among other things, there is no attempt to claw back
    rights or benefits that have accrued pursuant to the decision.
    However, clawing back benefits that have accrued pursuant to the
    2005 decision is precisely what Lee Tat is attempting to do here. (            <strong>[204]–[208]</strong>)
