In <span class="font-italic">AYM</span>, the husband sought to vary a consent order which provided, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that the property was to be sold within six years and the proceeds were to be divided in the proportions of 80% to the wife and 20% to the husband if the sale price was equal to or less than $2.5 million. Should the sale price be more than $2.5 million, the proceeds would be divided in the proportions of 70% to the wife and 30% to the husband (at [2]). The basis of the husband’s application was his deteriorating financial situation. In brief, the husband’s business had begun to fail and he was suffering from a loss in income. The husband sought to vary the order such that he would receive an <span class="font-italic">equal</span> proportion of the asset. The court refused the husband’s application for a variation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The court laid down several important principles to guide the exercise of discretion under s 112(4) of the WC. These include the following:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Although the language utilised in s 112(4) of the WC is broad, the provision has a limited operation (<span class="font-italic">AYM </span>at [22]), especially because of the consideration of <span class="font-italic">finality </span>underpinning s 112 of the WC (<span class="font-italic">AYM </span>at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Where an order has been completely implemented, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the assets have been distributed to the parties, the court does not have the power to reopen the order (<span class="font-italic">AYM </span>at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Where an order for division has not been completely effected, the court can make necessary variations only where the order was unworkable or has become unworkable (<span class="font-italic">AYM </span>at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) New circumstances may emerge since the order which so radically change the situation such that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something radically different from what was originally intended. This would amount to unworkability (<span class="font-italic">AYM </span>at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Unworkability may also arise in the context of an order of a continuing nature (<span class="font-italic">AYM</span> at [27]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) A change in circumstances <span class="font-italic">invalidating the very basis on which the court made a continuing order</span>, amounts to a radical change in circumstances constituting unworkability (<span class="font-italic">AYM</span> at [27]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">AYM</span>, the court held that the husband’s business failure and loss of income were not sufficient to justify a variation of an order under s 112 of the WC (at [33]). Further, it was observed that the husband was merely attempting to obtain a greater amount (as compared to what he would have received under the original consent order) as the property had become worth more. In other words, the husband was seeking to undermine the finality of the consent order (at [33]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 I also considered the District Court decision in <span class="font-italic">CT</span><span class="font-italic"> v CU </span>[2004] SGDC 164 (“<span class="font-italic">CT</span>”), which was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AYM</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [24] and [25]). In <span class="font-italic">CT</span>, the husband and wife had recorded a consent order which provided for the matrimonial flat to be sold within 18 months of the date of the order, with the amounts utilised from the parties’ CPF accounts to be refunded and the outstanding housing loan and costs of the sale to be paid (at [1]). The court observed that the basis of the consent order was that there would <span class="font-italic">be sufficient proceeds</span> to pay off the outstanding housing loan, refund the parties’ CPF monies utilised by them for the purchase of the flat, and pay the costs of sale<span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [13]). Unfortunately, the value of the matrimonial property had fallen such that the sale proceeds would be insufficient to pay off the housing loan, refund the parties’ CPF monies and pay for the costs of sale (at [14]). If the property was indeed sold and the CPF monies refunded first, a sum of $258,020.76 would still be required to pay the outstanding mortgage on the property (at [16]). Both the husband and the wife did not have the capacity to pay off the outstanding mortgage. In the circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings would likely have been commenced against both of them. Having regard to a number of factors, including the extent of shortfall between the sale proceeds and the outstanding loan, as well as the likelihood of the husband’s bankruptcy if the sale proceeds were used to refund the parties’ CPF monies <span class="font-italic">first</span>, the court varied the consent order such that the sale proceeds would be used to pay off the outstanding housing loan in preference to the parties’ CPF monies (at [22]). In doing so, the court observed that it was not unreasonable for the husband not to want to be a bankrupt and that it would not be just and equitable to make an order of court which would doom one or both parties to bankruptcy (at [21]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In <span class="font-italic">TYA v TYB </span>[2018] 3 SLR 1170, the wife sought to vary the following consent order (at [5]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a) Delayed sale of matrimonial flat at [address redacted] until the youngest child turns 21 years old. Upon sale, the proceeds of sale shall be used to repay any outstanding mortgage thereafter to repay to the parties respective CPF accounts the sum used towards the purchase of the flat including accrued interest and the balance sum after paying for the cost of the sale shall be divided equally between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The wife argued that there should be an immediate sale of the property as the order had been rendered unworkable by the husband’s failure to contribute to mortgage payments. According to the wife, this failure went against the parties’ common understanding at the time they agreed to the consent order that the husband would be solely responsible for making the mortgage payments (at [14]). The husband agreed that the property should be sold immediately but disagreed on the basis on which the consent order was rendered unworkable (at [15] and [16]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The court identified the basis of the order to be one where “any contribution that any party might make to the mortgage payments would be refunded before the profits of the sale are divided equally” (at [43]). However, given that the consent order only provided for <span class="font-italic">CPF moneys to be refunded</span> and, since the husband had made payments in <span class="font-italic">cash</span>, the order had become purposively unworkable (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the order would not permit the refunding of the parties’ mortgage payments made in cash). Furthermore, the court noted that the wife was willing to move out of the flat in order to facilitate the return of her cash contributions. This undermined another aspect of the fundamental basis of the order (at [44]). The wife had also made contributions using CPF monies (at [50]). Accordingly, the court varied the earlier order such that the property was to be sold within six months, parties’ respective CPF contributions refunded and cash to be divided equally between the parties (at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In addition to the principles described above at [28]–[32], I was also cognisant of the observation in <span class="font-italic">AYM </span>that “the nature of an order for the division of matrimonial assets demands that finality and certainty are of paramount importance” (at [26]). In my view, the high threshold for invoking s 112 of the WC (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a radical change in circumstances amounting to unworkability) strikes the appropriate balance between <span class="font-italic">finality </span>and the need to achieve a <span class="font-italic">just and equitable result</span> where the facts of the case warrant it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Next, in granting any application for variation of an order under s 112 of the WC, the court must be alive to the possibility of abuse. In deciding to grant a variation application, the court should scrutinise the precise facts and circumstances to determine whether an applicant is bringing the application in good faith or simply re-opening old wounds and concluded orders. In general, any attempt to obtain a better deal in the guise of a variation application should be frowned upon. This point was emphasised in <span class="font-italic">AYM</span>, where the court cautioned against frivolous applications that would constitute an abuse of the process of court (at [23]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It was common ground between the parties that sub-orders 4 and 5 were “continuing orders”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Wife’s Submissions dated 27 November 2019, para 34. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I therefore applied the test in <span class="font-italic">AYM </span>at [27] and sought to determine whether there were new circumstances that had emerged since the Order which so radically changed the situation so that to implement it as originally made would be to implement something radically different from what was originally intended (<span class="font-italic">AYM </span>at [25]). More specifically, my analysis focussed on whether these circumstances invalidated the very basis on which the Order was made, this being an instance of radical change amounting to unworkability (<span class="font-italic">AYM </span>at [27]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Examining the language of sub-orders 4 and 5, I found that their basis was to provide the Wife with a place to live in by giving her exclusive occupation and control of the Matrimonial home. Hence, the question arising in this case is whether the circumstances raised by the Husband invalidated this basis. In my judgment, there was sufficient evidence of the Husband’s probable bankruptcy which would result in the forced sale of the Matrimonial home. This would undermine the basis of sub-orders 4 and 5 and thereby constitute a radical change in circumstances amounting to unworkability as required under <span class="font-italic">AYM</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 At the outset, I was of the view that although bankruptcy proceedings had not yet commenced, there was no reason to wait for OCBC to <span class="font-italic">actually </span><span class="font-italic">commence</span> bankruptcy proceedings before I exercised my discretion to vary the Order. Given the state of the Husband’s finances, it was only a matter of time before he faced bankruptcy proceedings<span class="font-italic">.</span> In my view, it was in both their interests, given their advanced age, for the matter to conclude expeditiously instead of waiting for bankruptcy to actually commence. Further, there is nothing in <span class="font-italic">AYM </span>which suggests that the court cannot consider a contingency, having regard to its probability in the overall circumstances of the case, in determining whether there will in all probability be a radical change in circumstances warranting variation. I also note that in <span class="font-italic">CT</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>, the court took into account the likelihood of bankruptcy in determining whether the consent order ought to be varied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I now detail my reasons for finding that the Husband would probably face bankruptcy proceedings. First and foremost, OCBC knew of his half-share interest in the Matrimonial home. Even if it did not already know, it would inevitably have found out. The “legal action” that OCBC appeared to contemplate in its letter to the Husband is, in my view, wide enough to cover bankruptcy proceedings. This must be so given that he appeared not to have other substantial assets which could be used to discharge his mounting debts. I also did not regard the Husband as exaggerating the poor state of his finances. Given his advanced age, the fact that the HDB Flat was potentially the subject of compulsory acquisition and SCB’s execution of a writ of seizure and sale against items of minor value in the HDB Flat, the Husband was clearly facing extreme financial difficulty.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Although the Husband did not provide payslips from his employer (as pointed out by the Wife), this was not entirely unreasonable given that he was not being paid regularly by his employer (see above at [6]). All things considered, I found that there was sufficient evidence to show that the Husband did not have any substantial assets. Having regard to the circumstances set out above at [4]–[13], I was also of the view that the Husband’s application was made in good faith. Given the Husband’s lack of funds, it was clear to me that he would probably be made a bankrupt by OCBC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Nonetheless, it was not bankruptcy <span class="font-italic">per se </span>which caused the Order to become practically unworkable. Instead, it was the likelihood of a forced sale of the Matrimonial Home. Upon the making of a bankruptcy order, the property of the bankrupt vests automatically in the Official Assignee by virtue of s 76(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Bankruptcy Act. The Official Assignee is empowered under s 111(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 112(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Bankruptcy Act to apply to court for an order of sale of the property in question. In <span class="font-italic">Su Emmanuel v Emmanuel </span><span class="font-italic">Priya Ethel Anne and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1222, the property was held by the husband, the wife, and the husband’s sister as tenants-in-common. The husband’s sister, who was facing bankruptcy proceedings (although these proceedings were not before the court), applied to court pursuant to s 18(2) read with the First Schedule of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) to sell the property. The Court of Appeal observed (at [76]) that if no order of sale was granted in her favour, “it would likely be the Official Assignee who would be seeking an order for the sale … in order to meet the claims of [her] creditors”. Similarly, in my judgment, upon the Husband’s bankruptcy, the Official Assignee would likely seek and obtain an order of sale of the Matrimonial home. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The order of sale of the Matrimonial home would undermine or invalidate the very basis of the Order, which was to provide the Wife with a home to live. This would constitute a radical change in circumstances amounting to unworkability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In the alternative, even if <span class="font-italic">bankruptcy per se </span>did not ensue, OCBC would likely be entitled to obtain judgment against the Husband and seek an execution of its judgment debt against his half-share of the Matrimonial home, particularly as he did not have any other substantial assets. Similarly, as in the case of bankruptcy (see above at [43]), such action would undermine the basis of the Order. This would equally be a radical change in circumstances resulting in unworkability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Another important consideration that I bore in mind was that the Husband was not seeking to vary the Order to have a second bite of the cherry. Unlike the applicant in <span class="font-italic">AYM</span>, the Husband was not seeking to increase the size of his existing share of the Matrimonial home. In essence, this was an application to facilitate a voluntary sale of the Matrimonial home on the open market before the consequences of the Husband’s probable bankruptcy began to bite. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In arriving at my decision, I carefully considered matters from the Wife’s perspective. I appreciated that she has been living in the Matrimonial home since 1994 and that the sale would inevitably cause her distress. Nonetheless, I paid due regard to the fact that the value of the Matrimonial home had risen considerably from the time of its purchase. It is now valued at between $5 to $6 million.

</div> There will be sufficient funds from the sale of the Matrimonial home for the Wife to buy another home to live. The Matrimonial home will fetch a higher price in the event of a voluntary sale. The sale proceeds could be used to give effect to the basis of the Order, which was to provide the Wife with a roof over her head. In this case, the Husband has fallen into financial hardship. Unfortunately, for both parties, bankruptcy was the probable outcome which would likely result in the forced sale of the Matrimonial home. Finally, I note that both the Husband and the Wife are already in their 70s. Life is finite and fragile. Having regard to all of these circumstances, it was in the interests of both parties for the sale to take place sooner rather than later.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For the above reasons, I allowed the Husband’s application for variation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Dedar Singh Gill  <span class="font-underline"> </span><br/>Judicial Commissioner  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Liaw Jin Poh (Tan Lee &amp; Choo) for the plaintiff;<br/>Seenivasan Lalita and Tay Min Hui (Virginia Quek Lalita &amp; Partners) for the defendant.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
