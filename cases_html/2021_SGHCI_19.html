In<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Baker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased) v BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others</span> [2020] 4 SLR 85 (“the Judgment”), we had found, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, that BCS and/or the third defendant, Renslade Holdings Limited (“Renslade (HK)”), held the Trust Assets and/or Trust Moneys and/or any other income or proceeds generated from the Trust Assets on trust for the plaintiff, Michael Baker (“Baker”), as executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison (“Chantal” or “the Estate”, as the case may be). Accordingly, we ordered BCS, Marcus Weber (“Weber”) and Renslade (HK) (collectively, “the Defendants”) to provide a detailed account of all transactions that had taken place in respect of the Trust Assets and/or Trust Moneys, and granted an order that the Defendants pay to the plaintiff all the sums due to the plaintiff on the taking of the account. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 After several rounds of correspondence, Baker remained dissatisfied with the account that the Defendants had provided. SUM 25 is Baker’s application for the Defendants to pay (a) US$10,313,895.25 and CHF1,662,894.67, being the amount that Baker claims is due to the Estate on the taking of the account of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys; and (b) interest on the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys at the rate of 5.33% per annum from 30 October 2017 until the date when the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys are fully paid and returned to him. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The detailed facts concerning this dispute can be found in the Judgment. For present purposes, we summarise the dispute between the parties and the decision of this court as found in the Judgment, which provides the context for the analysis below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Chantal was the co-inventor of Ethocyn. The Ethocyn Rights were initially assigned to California-incorporated companies controlled by Chantal (“the Chantal Companies”). The Chantal Companies entered bankruptcy proceedings in February 1999, and the Ethocyn Rights, among other assets, were sold to a New Zealand company (“Renslade (NZ)”) before being transferred to a Singapore company (“Renslade (S)”), and finally to BCS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In June 2003, the Defendants entered into an agreement with Nu Skin to supply Ethocyn (the “Nu Skin SDA”). These payments formed the bulk of moneys generated from the Ethocyn Rights, which we referred to earlier as the “Trust Moneys”. Sometime in or around 2007, the bulk of Trust Moneys were transferred from BCS to Renslade (HK). In or around 2014, Weber also withdrew a sum of CHF9.5m from the Trust Moneys. After Chantal passed away on 2 October 2016, Baker became the executor of the Estate. He sought to have the assets of the trust and Trust Moneys transferred to the Estate. When this was not done, Baker commenced the present suit (“the Suit”) in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the dispute and this court’s judgment</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The central issue in dispute in the Suit was the beneficial ownership of the Trust Assets and the Trust Moneys. Baker claimed that Chantal remained the beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights. She had entered into an agreement with Weber (“the Trust Agreement”) for Weber to acquire the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) and to hold any income or proceeds generated from the Ethocyn Rights on trust for her (we refer to this trust as “the Trust”). Under this Trust Agreement, the Defendants were entitled to retain only 5% of the proceeds generated. Further, although Chantal had agreed to loan Weber CHF6m, Weber then took the CHF9.5m from the Trust Moneys without her knowledge or consent. Baker therefore sought the return of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys, as well as a return of the CHF9.5m taken by Weber.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 After a trial of the matter, we issued our Judgment on 29 April 2020, in which we held as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was a Trust Agreement between Chantal and Weber. Renslade (NZ) had held the Ethocyn Rights on trust for Chantal. When the Rights were transferred to Renslade (S), Chantal remained the beneficial owner of those Rights. This remained the case when the Ethocyn Rights were assigned or transferred to BCS. Therefore, Chantal had always been the beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights, the Trust Moneys and the Trust Assets (see the Judgment at [187]–[188]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Weber had withdrawn CHF9.5m from the profits made under the Nu Skin SDA without Chantal’s knowledge or consent, and had not repaid that amount or rendered an account of any interest as of the date of the Judgment (see the Judgment at [199]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Trust Agreement was governed by Singapore law (see the Judgment at [214]). Under Singapore law, there was an express trust (at [226]) and, in any event, a resulting trust would also arise on the facts (at [230]). In the alternative, if the Trust Agreement were governed by California law, a trust would also have arisen (at [240]). We rejected the claim that the trust was unenforceable for illegality, finding that the Trust Agreement was enforceable under both Singapore (at [258]–[269]) and California law (at [298]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As the Trust Agreement was valid and enforceable, </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the Defendants had breached their fiduciary duty to Chantal by failing to provide an account of the Trust and the Trust Moneys;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the Defendants had breached the Trust Agreement by unilaterally increasing the commission from 5% to 10% from 2016 to 2017 without Chantal’s knowledge and consent; </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Weber had breached his fiduciary duty to Chantal by failing to procure BCS or Renslade (HK) to return the Trust Assets, and also breached his contractual obligation <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Chantal to return CHF9.5m with 3% annual interest; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) by claiming legal and beneficial ownership over the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys, the Defendants had conspired with the intention of injuring Chantal and/or the Estate (see the Judgment at [299]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 We therefore made orders pertaining to the relief sought by the plaintiff. The parties have since extracted the order of court in SIC/JUD 5/2020 (“the Order”), and we reproduce the relevant portions here:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. it is hereby declared that [BCS] and/or [Renslade (HK)] hold the intellectual property rights to the inventions and the patents of Ethocyn (‘the Ethocyn Rights’) and 95% of any income or proceeds generated from the Ethocyn Rights (‘the Trust Assets’) including 95% of the monies which were paid by Nu Skin International Inc to [BCS] and any other income or proceeds generated from the Trust Assets on trust for the Plaintiff (‘the Trust Assets and Trust Monies’);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. the Defendants are to provide a detailed account of all the transactions which have taken place in respect of the Trust Assets and Trust Monies within 14 days from the date of judgment; [we refer to this as the “Account Order”]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3. the Defendants are to account to the Plaintiff the Trust Assets and Trust Monies, and the Plaintiff is at liberty to trace and recover the Trust Assets and Trust Monies, if necessary.

</div> The two remaining prayers are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. the Defendants are to pay the Plaintiff US$10,313,895.25 and CHF1,662,894.67, being the amount due to the Plaintiff on the taking of the account of the Trust Assets and Trust Monies (as defined in paragraph 1 of SIC/JUD 5/2020);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. the Defendants are to pay the Plaintiff interest on the Trust Assets and Trust Monies, which shall accrue at the rate of 5.33% per annum from 30 October 2017 until the date when the Trust Assets and Trust Monies have been fully paid and returned to the Plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Baker argues that the account provided by the Defendants is defective in terms of the income and outgoings, and seeks to surcharge and falsify entries in the account. The bulk of SUM 25 deals with the specific contentions over the income and deductions. Further, Baker seeks pre-judgment and post-judgment interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum. Finally, Baker argues that there is no basis for a US$70m tax provision that the Defendants have sought to make.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Defendants’ case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Defendants argue that the account was properly given, and that no money is owing upon the account being taken. Further, no pre-judgment interest should be awarded, or, if there is to be pre-judgment interest, it is to be at the lower rate of 3.7% per annum. Finally, the Defendants should be allowed to make a tax provision to the value of US$70m due to an alleged tax liability in the US. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Based on the foregoing, the following issues arise for our determination:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, in relation to the account:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) whether the account should be surcharged with a sum of US$200,000; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) whether and to what extent the disputed outgoings should be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, whether and to what extent interest should be awarded on the sums due under the Trust. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, whether the Defendants should be allowed to make a provision of US$70m for the alleged tax liability. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Taking of the account</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable law and standards</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In the taking of accounts, it must first be decided whether the accounts should be taken on a common basis or on a wilful default basis (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin and others v </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong and others </span>[2019] 4 SLR 714 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span>”) at [71]). In the present case, we had already found various breaches of fiduciary duties on the Defendants’ part (Judgment at [299]). Notwithstanding this, the difference between an account on a common basis and a wilful default basis does not take centre stage in this case – there is no attempt by the plaintiff to require the Defendants to account for that which they <span class="font-italic">might</span> have received if it had not been for their default (<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>at [82]) or to ask the court to undertake a “roving commission” to inquire into all aspects of the Defendants’ administration of the Trust, including misconduct that was neither pleaded nor mentioned at the hearing at which the accounting was directed (<span class="font-italic">UVJ and others v UVH and others and another appeal </span>[2020] 2 SLR 336 (“<span class="font-italic">UVJ</span>”) at [36] and [47]). The only difference that we note in this case is that in an account on a wilful default basis, “the accounting party … carries a much more substantial burden of proof than that which applies to him in the case of a common account” (<span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim</span><span class="font-italic"> Lie Hoa and others </span>[2005] SGCA 4<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [55]). This point was not pressed by the plaintiff, but, in fairness and in recognition of the reality that this account is being taken after adverse findings were made against the Defendants, we take into account our findings relating to the Defendants’ conduct when we come to assess the specific entries in dispute. The extent of the effect of our findings will depend on the timing and nature of the specific outgoings in dispute.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 When a trustee provides an account which discloses what the beneficiary considers to be discrepancies, the beneficiary may choose to:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) falsify a wrongful expense or loss charged to the account, which would then require the expense or loss to be deleted or disallowed (<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>at [78]; <span class="font-italic">UVJ </span>at [28]); or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) surcharge an account, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, assert that the trustee has received more than what the account records (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>at [79]; <span class="font-italic">UVJ</span> at [28]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 When a beneficiary falsifies an entry in the account, the beneficiary is challenging or disputing the alleged use of funds. The burden then lies on the <span class="font-italic">trustee</span> to prove that the disbursement was authorised (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span> at [78], applied by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Dextra</span><span class="font-italic"> Partners Pte Ltd and another v Lavrentiadis, Lavrentios and another appeal and another matter </span>[2021] SGCA 24 at [46]). In contrast, when a beneficiary seeks a surcharge, the burden lies on the <span class="font-italic">beneficiary</span> to show that the trustee received more than the account records (see <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span> at [79]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 A related point concerns the right of a trustee to be indemnified out of trust property for costs and expenses incurred in the course of the trust. This right to be indemnified is not unqualified, as it does not extend to “costs and expenses incurred without authority, either in the trust instrument or from the beneficiaries”: <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span> at [63]. As an exception to this principle, “a trustee may nevertheless be entitled to claim an indemnity out of the trust property for unauthorised transactions which benefit the trust estate and which the trustee incurred in good faith”: at [64]. The High Court in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span> held that this was a matter within the court’s discretion. As the High Court noted in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>at [68], the question of whether a specific expense or cost was properly incurred overlaps with the question of whether a particular entry should be falsified. We adopt a similar approach, and treat the question of whether expenses were properly incurred together with whether specific deductions should be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In applying the burden of proof, the court will necessarily have regard to the fact that a trustee owes a duty to keep records and to be ready to give an account: Lynton Tucker, Nicholas Le Poidevin and James Brightwell, <span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts</span>”) at para 21-031. Further, as the High Court has summarised in <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span><span class="font-italic"> Shalini Gobind and another v Lalwani Ashok Bherumal</span> [2017] SGHC 90 (“<span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span>”) at [23]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As regards the level of disclosure necessary to discharge the duty to furnish account on a common basis, regard must be had to the twin purposes of this duty as identified above. At its core, the accounting process is a means to hold the trustee accountable for his stewardship of trust property. Accordingly, the trustee must by this accounting process give proper, complete, and accurate justification and documentation for his actions as a trustee. This requires information as to the current status of, and past transactions that relate to, each of the constituent trust assets actually received by the trustee (see <span class="font-italic">Glazier Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Men’s Health Pty Ltd (No 2)</span> [2001] NSWSC 6 at [38]). What precisely is required for the discharge of this duty is fact-specific. More will likely be required for the specific assets and transactions against which there are allegations of breach of trust. More will also likely be required of a professional trustee, as compared to a non-professional trustee who may be granted ‘fair and reasonable allowances’ (<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> at para 20-018). Thus, merely providing some financial documents in relation to the trust assets may not be enough (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Foo </span><span class="font-italic">Jee Boo</span> at [93]–[96]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">That there is an overlap between the nature of a trustee’s duty and what a trustee needs to produce in order to satisfy his burden of proof when a claim of falsification is made is only logical. This burden of proof and the trustee’s role in responding to a dissatisfied beneficiary’s objections reflect the trustee’s position in relation to the trust assets and beneficiaries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In this regard, the plaintiff urges us to consider the Defendants as professional trustees. In his submission, we should hold the Defendants to the standard of a professional trustee and be quicker to make adverse findings against them if inadequate records are kept. While the plaintiff has referred us to various documents, we do not think this submission is made out. While Weber may be a businessman, it is not clear that he was in fact a professional trustee. The plaintiff relied in particular on a letter written by Weber, apparently around 4 June 2016, in which Weber stated:

Without trust I don’t like to go on, also I was sure to be the best consultant and partner for you and your girls. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In context, we find that the reference to “trust” in that first sentence is not “trust” in the technical sense, but more generally, the trust that he had hoped had arisen between him and Chantal. We are unable to find in this correspondence any admission or recognition by Weber that he was a professional trustee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The plaintiff then referred us to our Judgment at [105], where we held, in reference to a facsimile dated 23 March 2000:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The whole tenor of this facsimile is that of an accountant or other professional agent – Weber – reporting back to the owner – Chantal – as to what he has done so far on the ‘agreed’ structure. … Crucially, Weber ended the telefax stating that he was working on Chantal’s files. This is wholly inconsistent with his case that Chantal was his business advisor and he was the purchaser of the Ethocyn Rights …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Our reference to Weber as “an accountant or other professional agent” was not a finding that Weber was a professional trustee. In that passage, we simply recognised that Weber was providing services for Chantal, and that these services were, at times, professional services. But we are unable to conclude from this fact that Weber was a professional <span class="font-italic">trustee</span>. A helpful indication of what a “professional trustee” is can be found in s 41Q(5) of the Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed) – in referring to this provision, we are only taking broad guidance as to what it might mean for a trustee to be acting in his professional capacity:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) For the purposes of this Part, a trustee acts in a professional capacity if he acts in the course of a profession or business which consists of or includes the provision of services in connection with —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the management or administration of trusts generally or a particular kind of trust; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) any particular aspect of the management or administration of trusts generally or a particular kind of trust,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">and the services he provides to or on behalf of the trust fall within that description.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 For the purposes of those provisions, a key aspect of a “professional trustee” is that the management or administration of trusts (generally) or a particular kind of trust, or any particular aspect of that management or administration, is part of the “course of a profession or business”. We think that this is a sensible definition of a professional trustee, and clarifies the scope of what that term means. This is why a professional trustee is held to higher standards, because the professional trustee has been engaged specifically for his expertise, or because the professional trustee is expected to have the experience and competence to properly administer a trust. There is no indication that Weber or the companies (BCS or Renslade (HK)) were in fact in such a course of a profession or business relating to trusts, either generally or of a particular kind. A professional trustee is not necessarily the same as a trustee who is otherwise a professional or businessman, or a company operating a business. Furthermore, we would highlight that the correspondence certainly did not refer to BCS or Renslade (HK) as professional trustees. We therefore do not find much merit to the plaintiff’s attempts to paint the Defendants as professional trustees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Having set out these general principles, we elaborate further on the approach that we take to the specific entries when dealing with the parties’ contentions below.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Income: whether US$200,000 should be surcharged</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The sole dispute over the income concerns US$200,000 which Baker argues that BCS had received from a company in the Republic of Korea, Webstone 21. Baker claims that this payment was made pursuant to a letter of credit that Baker had personally negotiated, and that the documentary evidence supports this claim.

</div> Although the handwritten amendments have blocked out some parts of the original letter of credit, Baker’s explanation that these were fictitious parties included for the purposes of using the letter of credit as a teaching aid is plausible. What is more telling, in respect of the letter of credit, is that (a) the sum of US$200,000 was stated on the first page; (b) Webstone 21 was referred to as the recipient of the goods (as Webstone 21 is identified as the notify party); and (c) BCS was identified as the beneficiary “before amndmt” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, before amendment).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 However, that is as far as the plaintiff’s case can go. As counsel for the plaintiff, Ms Woo Shu Yan (“Ms Woo”), rightly conceded before us, there was no evidence that the letter of credit was paid upon.

</div>
</div> We agree with the Defendants that the mere existence of the letter of credit does not necessarily mean that the transaction was completed or that payment was received by the Defendants. In our view, the surrounding evidence does not justify the inference sought by the plaintiff. First, while Baker has presented emails to show that sometime in mid-2004, a Korean company (which we accept is likely Webstone 21) was preparing to begin marketing Ethocyn products, there are no emails describing the specific transaction in question in September 2004, when the letter of credit was allegedly issued, or any confirmation that the business actually became operational. This is important as the absence of any emails or documentary evidence relating to the specific transaction makes it difficult to infer from the mere existence of a letter of credit that the transaction was completed. Further, even with respect to the general emails, there is no reply following Chantal’s email to show that any transfers were ultimately made. Second, on the face of the letter of credit, it is telling that there is no reference number provided by the receiver, suggesting that the letter of credit as presented by Baker was not issued or, at the very least, was not received by the receiving bank by the time the latest amendments were made on 21 October 2004. Third, even if some pattern of conduct is relied upon, no other evidence of the regularity of the transactions or the overarching contract involving Webstone 21 has been provided. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Hence, we conclude that Baker has not discharged his burden of proving that BCS had received US$200,000 from Webstone 21.

In short, Chantal <span class="font-italic">directed</span> the transfer of the alleged Trust Moneys to various entities and stated that these transfers were for operating expenses and costs related to the Ethocyn business. We also find that Chantal did, in a few instances, provide justifications for these transfers” [emphasis in original]: at [152]. This was “in accord with how many private limited companies operate within a private corporate group structure and is consistent with why Chantal, having chosen to keep her beneficial ownership opaque, was nonetheless driving the exploitation of her Ethocyn product”: at [153].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Chantal was the one who ran the Ethocyn business, while Weber was given the responsibility “to structure the business entities, manage accounts, and reap the profits”: see the Judgment at [237].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 On Weber’s own evidence in SUM 25, the day-to-day running of the Ethocyn business was done by Chantal herself, and “[t]he transactions and payments were carried out by [BCS’s] staff as instructed by Chantal”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The crux of the dispute, however, concerns how this court should approach an <span class="font-italic">absence</span> of documentary evidence of specific approval given by Chantal. Baker’s standard objection to many of the entries in the “Outgoings” is that they have not been supported by documentary evidence of Chantal’s approval or instructions. The Defendants’ response is that as Chantal was closely involved in the Ethocyn business, she would have been aware of all of these expenses and outgoings or, at the very least, would have implicitly approved of them insofar as they were for the purpose of the Ethocyn business.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> We find that neither extreme is sustainable, fair, or justified on the facts of this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 On the one hand, given the facts that we have identified above, it is clear to us that, in general, it was Chantal directing payments to be made. In fact, the Defendants are content, in their own submissions, to attribute <span class="font-italic">all</span> transactions and payments to Chantal’s instructions. In our view, it was incumbent on the Defendants to keep proper records of such instructions and approval, so that they would be able to render a proper account of the Trust to Chantal or whoever the eventual beneficiaries of the Trust may be. On the facts, we find it more likely than not that the expectation was that Chantal would be asked for approval for transactions and payments, and expenses incurred in relation to the Ethocyn business, especially in the light of the emails that she sent and received. As a starting point, therefore, an absence of documentary evidence would suggest that the Defendants cannot discharge their burden of proof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 On the other hand, we recognise the reality that there was an ongoing business relating to the Ethocyn rights, and that Chantal’s involvement in the business should count for something in assessing whether expenses and outgoings were approved or for the purpose of the Ethocyn business. In this regard, it is significant that Chantal gave instructions directly to the staff of the companies operating the Ethocyn business. In our view, the reality of an operational business may mean that strict records of instructions and approvals may not always be kept, or that certain payments may not necessarily be highlighted in each and every instance to Chantal. Furthermore, we are cognisant that Chantal is no longer able to provide evidence as to the specifics of the Ethocyn business, and that Baker, as executor of the Estate, may not be in full possession of the same facts and evidence as Chantal was. Baker’s repeated refrain that he was not aware of specific outgoings or companies is not, with respect, of much assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Hence, while the absence of documentary evidence would be a point counted against the Defendants in general, we think that it is only realistic and fair to be open to the possibility that, on an entry by entry basis, the Defendants may be able to otherwise establish that Chantal had approved the transactions even if no <span class="font-italic">direct</span> evidence is available, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, because it was part of a series of payments, an established pattern of conduct, or the nature of the payments indicates that they must have been for the Ethocyn business. This must be the case because even if a specific email or written approval is not recorded, the circumstances may lead to the inference that approval <span class="font-italic">was</span> given. In such instances, we would have regard to, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the alleged purpose of the payments, the connection that the payments have to the Ethocyn business or to Chantal’s personal requests, the timing of the payments in relation to the Defendants’ conduct (especially when they began to be in breach of their fiduciary duties), and the manner in which the outgoings have been quantified. This is not, we emphasise, a slackening in the standard of proof placed on a trustee – we caution trustees in general that they take on considerable risk if they do not keep proper records. Instead, this is a conclusion on the proper <span class="font-italic">application</span> of the burden of proof. The question of fact is ultimately whether, in each instance, there is sufficient evidence to show that the transaction was authorised.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Estoppel in relation to expenses and outgoings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The Defendants argue that Baker, as executor of the Estate, is estopped from rejecting the various outgoings as Chantal was informed of these expenses and she did not object. In their submission, it would be expected that if Chantal was not agreeable to the incurring of any of those expenses which she was informed of, then she would have said so. If she did not, then her silence and conduct can be construed as representations that she had no objection to the expenses of that nature and the Defendants were entitled to continue using those proceeds for such expenses, and as the Defendants relied upon the representations, she (and by extension, her Estate) would be estopped from denying that the outgoings were authorised.

The same questions of fact that would go towards establishing, as a question of proof, whether Chantal expressly or implicitly approved a particular outgoing would also be relevant to establishing the elements of estoppel. In particular, the same questions of whether Chantal was made aware of the particular expenses and outgoings, and how Chantal responded to such information (or how she might have been expected to respond), would be relevant to both issues. If it is concluded that the evidence does not justify a finding that there was implicit approval of the outgoing, it would be difficult to see how estoppel could nevertheless be made out. For this reason, it is sufficient to focus on the specific factual contentions in each instance, paying particular attention to the context and facts pertaining to each outgoing. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The scope of the 5% commission</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Among the various entries disputed by Baker, a significant number pertains to expenses or remuneration sought by various companies controlled by Weber, and by Weber himself. The question here concerns the scope of the 5% commission which we had found Weber was entitled to, and whether the Defendants are entitled to be paid anything in addition to that 5%. We note here that the Defendants also put forward an additional argument on the basis of estoppel. For similar reasons as those described at [43] above, we do not think that it is necessary to deal with the claim of estoppel separately given the overlapping arguments – it is sufficient for us to consider, on the facts, what was the arrangement between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Defendants take the position that the 5% of the revenue was intended to be a commission for “acquiring and holding the Ethocyn Rights”, but that they then provided various additional services which fell outside the scope of activities that formed part of the Trust Agreement.

</div> In contrast, Baker’s counsel argues that the Defendants’ position is inconsistent with [237] of the Judgment, and that the evidence shows that the 5% commission was paid “in respect of the Defendants’ entire services to Chantal and was not confined to merely acquiring and holding the Ethocyn Rights”.

This is <span class="font-italic">distinct</span> from the right of the trustee to be indemnified against costs and expenses that have been properly incurred as trustee (see [22] above). The scope of this prohibition against remuneration extends to “any allowance for his trouble and loss of time” and “payment for any professional or other special services rendered by him, even though payment for such services would properly be made to a person who is not a trustee” (<span class="font-italic">Lewin on Trusts</span> at para 20-001).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In our Judgment, we have already found that the 5% was intended to be the commission or remuneration for services provided by Weber to Chantal. We had referred to the 5% variously as a sum of money retained by Weber as a commission or remuneration (see the Judgment at [22(c)], [190], [221] and [223]), or retained by “BCS or Weber as commission” (at [25]), or as “compensation for services provided by Weber to her or BCS Pharma Corporation” (at [159]). At [188(k)], we concluded as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The retention of 5% of the proceeds … by BCS from the sale of the Ethocyn Products pursuant to the Nu Skin SDA and other similar agreements, if any, was commission or remuneration for Weber and the 1st and 2nd Defendants under the Trust Agreement between Chantal and Weber.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, we recognise that the exact scope of what this “commission” or “remuneration” was for was not in issue during the trial and we have not yet expressly considered this issue. We therefore now consider, on the submissions and evidence before us, what the scope of the commission/remuneration was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 First, we observe that Chantal’s references to this 5% commission or remuneration were ambiguous. The most probative email for Baker’s case was an email dated 24 May 2016 sent by Chantal to Weber, in which Chantal referred to the 5% as “our agreed compensation for your services provided me/BCS Pharma each year since our coming together”.

</div> However, here, the word “your” in this context refers to Weber, not BCS. Similarly, in another e-mail relied upon by Baker dated 9 June 2016 from Chantal to Mr Urs Wehinger (“Wehinger”), she stated that the “agreement from the beginning in 1999 was 5% participation to [S]ingapore in gross singapore [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] managed funds”, but in the context, this only referred to Weber’s claims for compensation.

</div> This is consistent with the fact that the 5% arrangement dated back to 1999, when BCS was not yet in the picture (as the Ethocyn Rights were first assigned to BCS in 2002) (see the Judgment at [138]). It seems to follow that the understanding was that the 5% was intended to be the personal commission paid to <span class="font-italic">Weber</span><span class="font-italic"> alone</span> for his assistance in Chantal’s business. To the extent that Weber was in control of the various companies which held the Ethocyn Rights on trust for Chantal, there may have been some blurring of the distinction between the entities, but it is not clear that the 5% commission/remuneration was intended by Chantal to be the cap of what could be deducted as expenses or costs, or even as compensation for services rendered by other entities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Baker attempts to rely on [237] of our Judgment, which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">From 2002, until her death in 2016, Chantal ran the Ethocyn business successfully. She arranged for and supervised the manufacture of Ethocyn, and she negotiated licensing agreements with distributors. She relied on Weber to structure the business entities, manage accounts, and reap the profits. He received a 5% commission for those services.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, this statement does not necessarily preclude other compensation for services provided by persons or entities <span class="font-italic">other than</span> Weber. In other words, it is consistent with the last two sentences quoted above for compensation to be payable in respect of services rendered by such other persons or entities, since the 5% was, based on what was written at [237] of the Judgment, only the commission for <span class="font-italic">Weber’s</span> services.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Secondly, on a related note, Chantal’s conduct showed that she made a distinction between the 5% commission/remuneration and other expenses and costs that were incurred in the Ethocyn business. It follows that a distinction must be drawn between remuneration (which is covered by the 5%) and reimbursement for expenses. Baker’s own case was that the 5% commission was already a part of the Trust Agreement from as early as 1999 (see the Judgment at [22]).

</div>
</div> At the same time, we had found at [146] of the Judgment that Chantal did reimburse Weber for expenses incurred for the Ethocyn business, even apart from the 5% commission that (on Baker’s own case) already applied from 1999 onwards:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">146 … Chantal would reimburse Weber for his out-of-pocket expenses that he incurred for the Ethocyn business. For example, on 16 August 2000 (before the Nu Skin SDA), Weber e-mailed Chantal requesting payments for (a) royalties, (b) invoices by other companies for business related expenses and (c) ‘invoice for [his] services’. In another email from Chantal to Weber on 8 September 2002, Weber informed Chantal that he would send her an invoice ‘for the expedition of the Ethocy[n] to USA’ and that he had paid for that invoice. On 20 September 2002, Chantal replied, reminding Weber to ‘always pay [his] expenses and needs/fees regarding [Ethocyn] from the money in Switzerland by Amalfino’, which was where Chantal would transfer the funds to. The Defendants did not challenge these documents in cross-examination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This distinction is consistent with the law relating to a trustee’s remuneration (see [46] above), which distinguishes between an indemnity for expenses and remuneration for services or time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Therefore, we find that Weber was only entitled to 5% of the revenue as his commission or compensation for any services that he rendered to Chantal and the Ethocyn business. However, there is insufficient basis on which to conclude that the 5% was the ceiling for <span class="font-italic">any and all</span> compensation or renumeration for all other services provided by other entities, even entities controlled by Weber, or reimbursement for expenses incurred by the Defendants (even by Weber) in the process of the provision of those services and in the conduct of the Ethocyn business. The question in relation to such other renumeration or reimbursement would be whether there was sufficient evidence of authorisation, and it is insufficient for Baker to simply point to the 5% commission/renumeration to preclude the deduction of such outgoings from the account.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Role and relevance of audited financial statements and expert opinions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Throughout their submissions, the Defendants have repeatedly referred to the facts (a) that certain financial statements, especially those of Renslade (HK), had been audited; and (b) that certain outgoings had been verified by their expert, Mr Chaitanya Arora (“Mr Arora”). Before turning to the specific entries, we deal here with the general question of the role and relevance of such financial statements and Mr Arora’s expert opinion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In relation to audited financial statements, we accept Baker’s point that mere provision of financial statements would not <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> suffice to discharge a trustee’s duty to account: see <span class="font-italic">Lalwani</span> at [33].

</div> Beyond merely showing that certain outgoings were incurred, an audited financial statement does not, in and of itself, mean that the outgoings were authorised or for the purpose of the Trust or Ethocyn business. This is particularly so if the outgoings identified by the financial statements are unexplained or if it remains unclear, on the face of the financial statements, what the outgoings were for. At the same time, if the purpose of the outgoings is clear on the face of the financial statements, it may be possible to draw the inference that the outgoings were part and parcel of the Ethocyn business and, in the light of any other evidence, may have been approved by Chantal. Once again, as we have repeatedly emphasised, the inquiry before this court is one of fact, and an audited financial statement would not be conclusive <span class="font-italic">either way</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Furthermore, even if particular statements or figures from such audited statements were provided to Chantal, this does not necessarily absolve the trustee of all further responsibility. The scope and specificity of the information provided to Chantal would have to be considered. For example, the Defendants emphasise an email sent to Chantal by Weber which incorporated a table of figures that they say match the figures from the corresponding audited financial statements.

</div>
</div> However, all that the table provided was an entry described as “Other fees” reflecting that sum, without providing any details as to what that category entailed. While the Defendants suggest that Chantal knew that there were audited financial statements and failed to request them, we fail to see how that would mean that the Defendants need not now provide an account of these figures. Chantal may not have raised any questions at the time for a variety of reasons, and the context of the discussions is important to consider. We would be slow to conclude that the mere provision of figures at that level of generality would satisfy a trustee’s duty to account, or, in the context of falsification, would mean that any claim to falsify deductions would necessarily fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Turning to Mr Arora’s expert opinion, we note the caution sounded by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span> at [32]–[36]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32 … Both parties engaged and adduced expert evidence from forensic accountants. The accountants have expressed views on whether an expense was incurred, in the sense that money was actually paid out; whether that money was paid out for a valid reason, in the sense that it was connected either directly or indirectly to the Wees’ investments; and whether the expense claimed was reasonable in amount. They have even expressed views on whether a disputed expense should be allowed or disallowed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 In expressing these views, both experts have ventured beyond the remit of an expert. These issues are not matters of accounting practice but issues of fact or law which the court has to decide. Both experts have also regrettably shown themselves too ready to adopt the views of the party who engaged them as to whether a disputed expense should be allowed or disallowed. In other words, the experts were wrong to express a view on an issue of fact or an issue of law and were even more wrong in being too ready to adopt a view that was not their own.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">34 This is impermissible on several levels. First, it is impermissible because the question whether any specific expense should be allowed or disallowed when taking an account on a wilful default basis in equity is outside the realm of a forensic accountant’s expertise.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 Second, and flowing from the first, expressing a view on this issue essentially contravenes the ultimate issue rule. That rule prohibits an expert from giving his opinion on the very issue which the court has to decide. While the rule has lost some force today, especially in civil cases, it remains live. On this point, the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Eu Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Hoklai v PP</span> [2011] 3 SLR 167 at [44] bear repeating:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ultimately, all questions – whether of law or of fact – placed before a court are intended to be adjudicated and decided by a judge and not by experts. An expert or scientific witness is there only to assist the court in arriving at its decision; he or she is not there to arrogate the court’s functions to himself or herself …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 Third, the expert’s duty to the court is to express his own <span class="font-italic">independent</span> view and not merely to adopt the views of the party engaging him. … Experts do not assist the court on matters within their expertise by merely adopting their client’s views.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Not all of the criticisms that the High Court had of the experts in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span> apply to Mr Arora’s opinion in this case. As we will discuss below at [70], Mr Arora was candid concerning the scope of his remit and the limitations of his analysis, and we do not think he was merely parroting his clients’ instructions or passing off their views as his own. However, the other cautions expressed in the quoted passage above remain relevant. Insofar as Mr Arora was expressing a view that certain expenses were documented to his satisfaction as a matter of accounting practice, we are willing to take that into account as part of the factual background for our determination. However, Mr Arora’s opinion will not, and cannot be, determinative of any matter that is properly for this court to decide, including whether outgoings were in fact incurred and, more importantly, whether they were <span class="font-italic">properly</span> incurred. Indeed, Mr Arora’s evidence has no real bearing on the latter question at all, since the question of falsification (which is a matter of this court’s supervision of the accounting process) is not, with all due respect, one that is properly within his expertise. Bearing in mind these principles, Mr Arora’s expert opinion is potentially relevant, but only to a narrow subset of the issues that are before us in this application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Specific entries</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Having set out our views on the issues of general dispute between the parties, and having considered the approach that we take in this case, we turn now to consider the specific entries. As will become apparent from our analysis, the burden of proof plays a central role in this application. The fundamental basis for our decision on each of these objections is whether, in our view, the Defendants have sufficiently discharged their burden of proving and justifying the relevant outgoings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 For the purposes of this judgment, we proceed on the basis of the categorisation of objections provided by Baker, as he is the party seeking to falsify the relevant entries. We deal with each category of objections in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Payment of US$15,400 from BCS to Renslade (S)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 This category pertains to S/Ns 4, 5 and 14 of the “Outgoings” in the Combined Account, on 20 October 2000, 29 December 2000 and 18 May 2001 respectively. These entries were described as being payments from BCS <span class="font-italic">to</span> Renslade (S) for consulting services provided in respect of the Ethocyn business. Baker’s primary argument relating to the sum of US$15,400 paid by BCS to Renslade (S) is that the Defendants are not entitled to claim any additional payment for any alleged consulting services as Chantal only agreed to 5% remuneration.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The dispute turns again on whether the payment of these fees was authorised. At the outset, based on our views above at [51], we do not think that the 5% commission due to Weber prevents these deductions from being proper, given that these were fees for services provided <span class="font-italic">by BCS</span> and not Weber personally. Further, we note that BCS became the holder of the Ethocyn Rights on 1 April 2002 (see the Judgment at [15]), that is, during the period when the management fees were paid by Renslade to BCS. Hence, in that sense, BCS was not a trustee of the Ethocyn Rights for most of this period. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Having regard to the evidence, we think that the management fees were justified expenses (at least in part) and were likely approved by Chantal. We note that these fees were justified by the Defendants as being for services provided to Renslade (S), which held the Ethocyn proceeds. Until April 2002, Renslade (S) was the holder of the Ethocyn Rights. There was therefore a good reason for BCS to be providing services to Renslade (S). As for the period after the transfer of the Ethocyn Rights, it is not implausible that some more work needed to be done to resolve any business that Renslade (S) had. We therefore find that the management fees are plausible in this context. Although the Defendants have not been able to show specific emails or documents in which Chantal authorised these payments, the inherent plausibility of BCS providing services to Renslade (S), together with the facts that Chantal “spearheaded and made key decisions in relation to the transfer of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (NZ) to Renslade (S)” (see the Judgment at [97]), that Weber was assisting in the setting up of this structure (at [107]), and that it was Chantal who “arranged for the transfer of the Ethocyn Rights from Renslade (S) to BCS” (at [135]), suggests that Chantal would have known about such payments and (given the fact that they were effected) approved them.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Therefore, we do not agree with the plaintiff that these entries should be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Payments to Plexus AG for a total of US$331,269.08</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 This concerns S/Ns 12 and 15 of the outgoings in the Combined Account.

First, Mr Arora was not able to verify the scope of services provided by BCS employees. Instead, the calculation was based on the <span class="font-italic">assumption</span> (provided by the Defendants themselves) that the services amounted to the annual work of one and a half full-time employees. This assumption remained unverified. Secondly, the calculation of US$150,000 was based on the assumption that the figures for compensation provided by the Defendants were accurate, given that the Defendants had not provided any specific documentation like employment records, salary slips or annual compensation letters. Thirdly, this was also based on the methodological assumption that “the average compensation per employee is indicative of those that performed work for the Ethocyn business”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the employees who provided that work were compensated along the lines of the average compensation per employee. Fourthly, a further assumption (implicit in the above), is that it was appropriate to draw an equivalence between the value of services provided and the compensation paid by BCS to its own employees. This, however, is open to question given the absence of any evidence as to whether any agreement was entered for BCS to provide these services and the fees for those services.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Further, even if the services were provided and the services cost US$150,000 per year, that is very different from establishing that Chantal in fact authorised BCS (expressly or implicitly) to deduct <span class="font-italic">this very sum</span> from the Trust Moneys every year. There is no evidence whatsoever of this. Indeed, the fact that the Defendants have had to resort to the speculative exercise described above suggests that there <span class="font-italic">was no</span> clear figure given to the fees that BCS would be allowed to charge for the services rendered to the Ethocyn business or that BCS would be able to claim back as expenses incurred. In the absence of such a clear figure at all, it is difficult to conclude that Chantal had authorised these deductions from the Trust Moneys. Instead, this appears to be an <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span> attempt by the Defendants to claim more moneys out of the Trust based on what they believed to be the value of the services rendered (assuming that they were indeed rendered) from 2002 onwards. In this regard, it does not help the Defendants to characterise these as payments for personnel and administrative costs. What the Defendants are seeking to do is, in effect, retrospectively identify a cost to be attributed to the services provided by BCS. This is, in substance, a matter of compensation for services, which would be prohibited unless authorisation had been given (see [46] above), not an indemnity for expenses incurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 For these reasons, these deductions are not allowed.

It must follow from the direction that these companies be set up and, in the absence of any direction to wind these companies up, maintained that the necessary expenses incurred in that process also be paid.

First, we note that a degree of opacity in the corporate structure of the Ethocyn business was a feature of Chantal’s business activities, and the mere fact that Baker claims not to have heard of these companies is neither here nor there. Secondly, it is not the Defendants’ case that these deductions were for the Ethocyn business <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, but that there were operational expenses consisting of the necessary fees and disbursements for the general and administrative costs of the companies, including filing, book-keeping, and secretarial fees.

At this point in time, around 24 October 2016, it was not yet clear that Weber would act contrary to the Trust, and this sum can be properly deducted from the Trust as an expense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 However, the fact remains that this transfer to BCS Cosmetics was never effected, and the present proceedings were commenced on 20 November 2017. In other words, based on the evidence before this court, it appears that BCS Cosmetics did not eventually carry out the Ethocyn business as the Trust Assets were not transferred to it. In our judgment, the entries for the latter two payments (S/Ns 412 and 415) in February and May 2017 respectively should be falsified. First, the timing of these payments is telling. By this time, the 12 December 2016 Meeting (see the Judgment at [181]) had already taken place, at which, according to Heika, Weber claimed for the first time that the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys belonged to him. Indeed, the Defendants’ case at trial concerning the 12 December 2016 Meeting was that it was a discussion concerning Heika’s interest in acquiring the Ethocyn business from BCS or Weber at arm’s length, a claim that was rejected by this court at [182] of the Judgment. It follows that, in truth, by this time, Weber was already acting in breach of the Trust. Secondly, it appears that although there was some plan for an Irish company to be used to transfer the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys to the Estate, this was never done and the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys were not transferred to the Estate (see the Judgment at [186]). The inference to be drawn is that the payments were not in fact properly made for the purpose of the Ethocyn business, since the plans involving BCS Cosmetics were not followed through with. Thirdly, the Defendants’ case that these sums of money (totalling over US$1.1m) was for “share capital” is not justified by any documents or evidence (since the documents presented only show that the sums were transferred out <span class="font-italic">to</span> BCS Cosmetics,

</div> These pertained to the expenses relating to domiciliation, directorship, taxes, filings, and secretarial fees. Insofar as there is no indication that Chantal had directed that Renslade (S) be wound up or that all activities in relation to that company should cease, it appears that these fees were just part of the general administrative and operational expenses of the company. We therefore find that these deductions are justified. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 For these reasons, we conclude that these entries should not be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(9) Payments to Wehinger for legal services for a total of US$24,629.38</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 This category concerns two payments that were made in relation to alleged legal services provided by Wehinger:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) S/N 17 of the “Outgoings” in the Combined Account, referring to a payment of US$6,040.50 to Wehinger on 20 June 2001 allegedly for legal services provided in relation to the Ethocyn business; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) S/N 413 of the “Outgoings”, referring to a payment of US$18,588.88 to Wehinger Kaelin Ferrari AG (Wehinger’s firm) on 11 April 2017, allegedly for Wehinger’s fees in meeting with Heika.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 There is sufficient evidence that the payments were actually made. The question here is whether they were authorised or properly incurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In relation to S/N 17, the payment of US$6,040.50, we see no reason to falsify the entry. Baker’s only objection is the standard objection based on the absence of documentary evidence of Chantal’s authorisation. However, in this instance, we think that the natural inference is that Wehinger was indeed providing legal services in relation to the Ethocyn business, and Chantal would likely have approved it (expressly or impliedly) in the process of conducting the Ethocyn business. This was in 2001, when relations were good between the various parties. As we observed at [98] of the Judgment, Chantal and Wehinger shared a working relationship from as early as 10 August 1989, and Wehinger was assisting Chantal in the Ethocyn business. The sum is not so significant relative to the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys as to warrant any doubt as to the veracity of the expense. Further, although Wehinger has subsequently adopted a position that he was never engaged by Chantal, it is sufficiently clear, on the facts before this court, that at around 2001, Wehinger was working with Chantal on the Ethocyn business, since Wehinger had confirmed in March 2000 that he, together with Weber, would support her business and assist with setting up the necessary corporate structure in Singapore (see the Judgment at [98]). Given our own clear findings in the Judgment, we proceed on this basis for the sum paid in 2001, and make an order consistent with the evidence before us. Wehinger’s position elsewhere is more relevant when there is uncertainty in the evidence, or to periods when the relationship may have soured.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 In relation to S/N 413, we begin by noting that the payment was made on 11 April 2017, after Chantal’s death. As Baker notes, he was not approached for approval as the executor of the beneficiary Estate.

While we declined to “determine the exact nature of Chantal’s relationship with Wehinger (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether he was in fact acting as Chantal’s lawyer) as it is not an issue raised by the parties” (at [163]), this court observed that “Chantal believed that Wehinger was acting on her behalf and, on the evidence before [the court], Wehinger never disabused her of her belief” (at [163]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There was an agreement at the 12 December 2016 Meeting, at which Wehinger was present, for the Defendants to transfer the Trust Assets and/or Trust Moneys to the Estate via an Irish company, but this was not done (see the Judgment at [188(q)]). It is Baker’s case that Wehinger had failed to act promptly and in doing so, supported the Defendants.

Further, he raises specific issues with particular outgoings, for example, a US$17,722.64 donation to Foundazione Eco Himalaya, payments to Dev and/or for the Arrowhead Property, bank charges for unauthorised transactions such as a CHF305,000 loan to Goldwing Investment Pte Ltd.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 At the outset, we reiterate that the mere fact that the audited financial statements may refer to these expenses does not mean that they were properly incurred and that they should not be falsified. Similarly, Mr Arora’s opinion that they are sufficiently supported by documentation does not resolve the issues that are before us for determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Our analysis below proceeds on the premise that Renslade (HK) was in fact the company which held the Trust Moneys beginning some time in 2007, after BCS/Weber retained a 5% commission/remuneration. That 95% of the revenue was channelled to Renslade (HK), which held the proceeds on trust (see the Judgment at [140(b)] and [223]). In our judgment, it follows that certain steps had to be taken for Renslade (HK)’s operations and administration, and that the expenses incurred in relation to those steps would be properly incurred. Baker appears to recognise this in that his objections do not extend to <span class="font-italic">all</span> of the expenses incurred by Renslade (HK). For example, he has not objected to deductions for auditor’s fees, postage and courier expenses, printing and stationery, telephone charges and most of the travelling expenses incurred prior to 2017. However, Baker does maintain objections to other categories of alleged expenses. His position on these categories can be summarised according to the types of expenses. Given the level of specificity at which the parties have joined issue, we provide our findings at a similar degree of granularity, according to the categories of expenses rather than the year in which they were incurred.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Administration, management, registered office and secretarial fees</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Although the administration, management, registered office and secretarial fees are listed separately in the Combined Account, we deal with these together as the evidence (from Renslade (HK)’s audited reports) shows that these fees were paid to BCS Connexion

</div> or, from 2012 onwards, an unspecified related company (as the audited financial statements did not provide a further breakdown of the specific related company the fees were paid to). We are satisfied that these expenses were properly incurred for the purposes of the functioning of the Ethocyn business and Renslade (HK). These expenses seem to us to be part and parcel of the operational costs of a business. Baker has provided no reason to doubt that these were actually paid to these related companies, or that these services were not actually rendered. The absence of direct evidence of Chantal’s approval of these expenses is not fatal to the Defendants’ case here as these fees appear, on the face of it, to pertain to the operation of Renslade (HK), which Chantal was aware of and wished to continue (in the absence of any direction to stop Renslade (HK)’s operations). These entries should therefore not be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) Bank charges and overdraft charges</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 We also find that the majority of the bank charges and overdraft charges were properly incurred. Baker’s arguments in this regard are primarily that the Defendants have not shown that the bank charges were incurred in relation to transactions directed or approved by Chantal, and that there is no evidence of any authorisation for Renslade (HK) to maintain an overdraft account and to incur overdraft charges thereon. We disagree. While it is true that the Defendants bear the burden of proving that outgoings were properly incurred, we are satisfied that bank charges would be incurred in the normal operation of a business, especially a company which held significant funds and made a significant number of transfers. As for the overdraft account, we do not think it implausible that an overdraft may be incurred as part of the normal operation of a company. On the whole, we are satisfied that the burden is sufficiently discharged given the inherent likelihood that these charges may be incurred in the course of operations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 As for the specific allegations of unauthorised transactions, however, we are prepared to make deductions accordingly. We proceed only on those transactions that have been highlighted to us given our views that bank charges would generally and normally be incurred in the course of an operational business. Two specific transactions have been highlighted by Baker. One is a transfer of US$50,000 to Your World Media. We do not think that this is ultimately unauthorised (see [118] below) and say no more in this regard. The other is a loan of CHF305,000 to one Goldwing Investment Pte Ltd (“Goldwing”). We agree that there is no indication of how Goldwing was related to the Ethocyn business, and note that the loan agreement with Goldwing that was tendered did have the preamble redacted. It is also telling that the loan agreement was signed by Weber for both sides.

</div> These entries, totalling US$14,488.41, should be falsified. Secondly, insofar as any payments were made to HKLW, being Wojtek’s law firm, in 2016 and onwards, we think that these should be falsified as well, for the same reasons as discussed in relation to Wehinger’s fees (see [101]–[102] above). In our view, there is sufficient basis on which for us to conclude that around 2016 onwards, Wojtek was not acting in the interests of the Trust – indeed, we found at [181] of the Judgment that Wojtek was representing BCS at the 12 December 2016 Meeting. Even though the Defendants claim that these services were incurred in connection with the Ethocyn business,

</div> we ultimately consider that the period of time when these services were allegedly rendered gives rise to the inference that even if the services were done for the Ethocyn business, they were ultimately done so for the Defendants’ benefit. As a matter of fairness, we see no reason why these should be charged to the Trust’s account. Hence, while we will allow the deduction for payments made in 2016 (since it is not clear when in 2016 Wojtek began to act exclusively for the Defendants at the Estate’s expense), we will not allow a deduction of the payments to HKLW in 2017. We note here that in an earlier version of the account, the Defendants had identified four payments to HKLW in 2017 totalling US$80,333.48:

</div> For the reasons noted at [76] above, we find that there is sufficient basis to conclude that Chantal had requested Your World Media to be set up and that expenses would be incurred by that company. While the specific purpose of the loan of US$50,000 is unclear, it appears sufficiently likely to have been part of the funds needed to operate and sustain Your World Media. Although there is no evidence that Chantal had specifically approved the writing off of this loan, given that this was a sum provided to a related company, this suggests that the loan was not intended to be repaid in the first place.

We agree with Baker that these entries should be falsified. It is clear to us that at least from 2017 onwards, the Defendants had adopted a position fundamentally contrary to their duty as trustees. As we noted at [19] above, this means that we should subject the expenses incurred at around this time to a higher degree of scrutiny. We have not been provided with any evidence of the purposes of these trips, or how they may have contributed to the Ethocyn business. Indeed, as Ms Woo highlighted in her submissions, it was not clear why there was a need to travel to Germany, for example, as there was no Ethocyn business there.

A breach is of a serious character for this purpose where it involves a bribe, misappropriation of property or a breach of fiduciary duty going to the root of the relationship, and is not merely an innocent or collateral breach. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The Defendants have not cited any contrary authority or disputed this principle.

</div> However, this misses the point. The issue of whether Weber is entitled to 5% of this particular transaction was not a question to be determined at trial. This is the appropriate point at which the objection is taken. We think that the principle put forward by Baker is sound – in this case, Weber had asserted his own interest contrary to the interest of the beneficiary, and in doing so, effectively denied the existence of the trust. From that point onwards, there is no basis on which Weber should be allowed to take the benefit of the alternative, that even if his denial of the trust is incorrect, he should be allowed to deduct his commission/remuneration as usual. The very denial of the trust is as fundamental a breach as can happen.

However, they maintain that these expenses were incurred and provide a number of examples:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Weber provided consulting services “to develop and expand the Ethocyn business that were clearly outside and beyond the scope of the services of a trustee”. Weber claimed that his hourly rate was US$400 from 2000 to 2010 and US$500 from 2001 to the present. For example, between 2000 and 2002, he assisted with the work necessary to review a new facility in Budapest, closing that facility, and finding another location for an Ethocyn purification laboratory. In 2000 and 2001, he advised Chantal with respect to the preparation of distribution agreements between different companies. He also provided advice “on all relevant business decisions”, helped to expand the business, including expanding into more international market, assisted to find potential packaging and filling suppliers in China in 2013–2014, making business plans for building a production and distribution facility in Europe, providing services in relation to the Nu Skin SDA, making contacts for Chantal in various countries, establishing multiple companies, planning for the transfer of the Ethocyn business to Ireland, discussing the establishment of a foundation, and having meetings with Chantal and her daughters.

</div> While the specific expenses under this category included estimations, these were extrapolations from other sources of information. We are not ultimately convinced by this explanation. While we have been willing to allow deductions on the basis of other evidence which has established to our satisfaction that certain deductions were properly incurred, even in the absence of clear documentary evidence of approval or instruction, this cannot go so far as to allow the Defendants’ wish to claim broad swathes of expenses with generic explanations. As such, when it comes to S/N 430, we start from the position that <span class="font-italic">none</span> of the deductions should be allowed unless the Defendants can show that they have satisfied their burden of proof. We turn then to the categories expressly referred to by the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130  First, in relation to Weber’s claims to be remunerated for his services, we find that these deductions are not warranted. In the first place, there is no evidence at all of any agreement between Chantal and Weber concerning his remuneration for these services, apart from the 5% commission/remuneration which we deal with in our next point. In this regard, if Weber was indeed providing professional consulting services, it is surprising that no documentation of any contract or retainer has been provided. Certainly, there is no evidence of any agreement as to the US$400 or US$500 hourly rate. In fact, when we sought clarification from Ms Chong concerning the nature of these claims, she candidly recognised that these were not claimed from Chantal or the Trust at the time, and agreed that this was, in effect, an attempt to retrospectively seek compensation.

</div> These were not actual payments out of the Trust Moneys, but some kind of notional estimation of the value of services that Weber considers that he has provided to the Ethocyn business. In any event, we find that these services were already compensated for by the 5% commission/remuneration. As we have discussed above at [47] and [51], we find that this 5% sum was intended to compensate Weber for all the services he provided to Chantal and the Ethocyn business. Hence, these deductions are not warranted and should not be charged to the account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Secondly, in relation to Renslade (S)’s alleged expenses, we find that these deductions should not be allowed. First, the Defendants’ explanation for why there are no documents is not convincing and, in any event, not excusatory. There is no reason why the documents should have been destroyed even if the statutory retention period had expired (assuming that it did) – any such period would only set the minimum period required, but does not (and Weber cannot suggest that it does) mandate that the documents be destroyed. The absence of documents is therefore a matter entirely within the Defendants’ (and particularly, Weber’s) responsibility. Further, it is a trustee’s duty to maintain records and documents, and any risk as to the absence of documents should be borne by the trustee and not the beneficiary. Secondly, there is no proof that these expenses to the sum of US$1.03m were incurred. The sum arrived at was based on an estimation drawing on the expenses incurred by Renslade (HK) from 2007–2019, and was not based on any evidence as to what was actually paid out. Again, the absence of evidence and documentation is a risk that the trustee is to bear, since the trustee was in a position to maintain accurate records. Thirdly, even this method of estimation is flawed, given that Renslade (HK) was actively receiving and handling the proceeds from the Nu Skin SDA, as these were transferred from BCS to Renslade (HK) to hold, in the period from 2007–2019. However, there is no indication of what Renslade (S) did from 2002–2007 and what expenses would be incurred in that regard, after the Ethocyn rights were transferred to BCS in 2002. Given the weakness in the justification for these expenses, and the absence of any real way of arriving at the expenses actually incurred by Renslade (S), we think that this sum should not be deducted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Thirdly, we turn to the deductions of US$10,000 for Birka’s medical expenses in 2016, and US$340,000 for the alleged blackmailing incident involving Heika. We think that the medical expenses of US$10,000 should not be deducted, as there is no indication that Chantal had instructed Weber to make that payment out of the Trust Assets. Indeed, Weber’s own evidence is that as Chantal “was already seriously ill at that time”, <span class="font-italic">he</span> paid for the necessary expenses.

</div> There is no reason to suggest why Weber should be taken to use the Trust Assets (noting that at the material time, <span class="font-italic">Chantal</span> was the beneficiary), and not his own personal funds. As for the US$340,000 deduction, however, we think that it is justified. The situation described by Weber is very specific, and Chantal’s request may (in the circumstances) reasonably not have been documented.

</div>
</div> There are no counterindications that this expense was not directed by Chantal, and, apart from Baker’s denial that this ever occurred, he has not put forward any evidence from Heika to dispute Weber’s account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Fourthly, in relation to the US$50,000 allegedly expended in setting up the Amarillis Foundation, we think that there is sufficient basis for this expense being deducted. This court found at [177] of the Judgment that “Weber had all along acted as a fiduciary for Chantal and <span class="font-italic">the May and July 2016 Meetings were for the purposes of discussing how to return the alleged Trust Assets/Moneys back to Chantal and her daughters, through the Foundation</span>” [emphasis added]. We also note (as above at [89]) that it was apparently only in the December 2016 Meeting that Weber claimed to be the beneficial owner of the Trust Assets (see the Judgment at [181]). At the time that the Foundation was set up and the arrangements were being made, therefore, it appears that there were in fact some steps taken towards effecting the transfer of the Trust Assets through the Foundation. Hence, it may be concluded that these expenses were incurred upon some arrangement for the return of assets to Chantal, and we think that even though this plan was not effected ultimately, the expenses were incurred at the time properly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 For the above reasons, we conclude that this category of miscellaneous outgoings should be reduced to US$390,000 only (being the sum of US$340,000 and US$50,000). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(13) Payment of CHF1,662,894.67 in relation to the CHF9.5m loan to Weber</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Apart from the outgoings generally, there are two specific disputes relating to how the Loan Repayment Order (see [8] above) was given effect to by the Defendants. We deal with these disputes here and in the following sub-section. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 This dispute relates to the Defendants’ inclusion at S/Ns 428 and 429 of the “Outgoings” in the Combined Account of a deduction of US$12,282,261.34 from the Trust Moneys (being the sum of US$11,498,045.20 and US$784,216.14 respectively). These sums are equivalent to the CHF9.5m loan that this court had ordered Weber to repay, together with the 3% interest from 30 June 2014 to 29 April 2020. Baker, however, argues that S/Ns 428 and 429 should not include the 3% interest to be paid on the CHF9.5m, which he calculates to be CHF1,662,894.67 (“the Loan Interest”), as Weber is to be personally liable for the 3% interest and should not be allowed to deduct it from the account.

It therefore appears that the 3% interest is an income to Renslade (HK) rather than an expense.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2.42 I further understand that the principal for the BD Finance Bonds and the associated interest income has already been paid to [Baker]. As a result, I consider that this item should not be included in the Combined Account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 We note here that Mr Arora’s opinion is not dispositive of this issue (see also [56] above), and that this is an issue of the proper characterisation of the 3% interest in law, rather than as a matter of accounting practice. This is so because the treatment of this 3% interest is tied up with Weber’s liability for CHF9.5m and the proper characterisation of that principal sum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 While it may be true that Weber had decided to use the CHF9.5m to invest in bonds, that does not change the fact that this was a sum loaned to him by Chantal (as we have found in the Judgment), and that there was an agreed 3% interest to be paid on that sum. The proper view of the CHF9.5m was that it was <span class="font-italic">removed</span> from the Trust Moneys at the time of the loan, becoming the subject of a personal obligation on Weber to repay the CHF9.5m with 3% interest. Whatever he chose to do with that sum of money, it was incumbent on him to return the principal and interest by the necessary date. The Loan Repayment Order extracted from our Judgment reflects this. Strictly speaking, instead of reflecting this as deductions in S/Ns 428 and 429 on the basis that these sums were paid to D&amp;N under the Court of Appeal’s order, the sum of CHF9.5m was instead to be deducted at the time when the loan was entered into, as that was when the CHF9.5m was, by Chantal’s directions, removed from the Trust and placed on loan to Weber. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Seen in this way, it is clear that only CHF9.5m was taken out of the trust and no longer needs to be accounted for in the Trust Moneys. However, any interest on the CHF9.5m is not related to the Trust, and should not be deducted from the Trust Moneys. The 3% interest is due on the <span class="font-italic">loan</span>, which is owed directly to Chantal and, now, her Estate. Weber is personally liable for the 3%, and should not be allowed to deduct that 3% from the Trust Moneys. As such, S/Ns 428 and 429 should be reduced by CHF1,662,894.67.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 We highlight for completeness that this does not result in double-counting of any sum of money. What this means is that CHF1,662,894.67 of the moneys transferred to D&amp;N (and hence, the plaintiff) pursuant to the Loan Repayment Order is to be considered as coming from Weber personally. Under the Combined Account, this sum had been incorrectly included in the deductions from the Trust. This means that, upon this correction being made, there remains an equivalent sum to be paid from the Trust Moneys on the taking of the account.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(14) Difference of US$19,495.02 relating to S/N 429 of the outgoings in the Combined Account</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 This dispute concerns the applicable exchange rate between US dollars and Swiss Francs for the purposes of deducting the payment made by the Defendants to D&amp;N in compliance with para 3 of CA/ORC 122/2020.The brief background to this particular head of dispute is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) After the Judgment, the Defendants applied for a stay of execution. The Court of Appeal decided in CA/ORC 122/2020 that Weber should pay D&amp;N CHF9.5m plus 3% interest from 30 June 2014 to 29 April 2020, for D&amp;N to hold pending the disposal of the Appeal.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) On 26 August 2020, D&amp;N received US$11,498,045.20.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 In our view, the ideal exchange rate to have applied would have been the exchange rate <span class="font-italic">when the CHF9.5m</span> <span class="font-italic">was first taken out of the Trust by Weber</span>. This follows from our view above that, in truth, when Chantal extended this loan to Weber, the sum was no longer part of the Trust but was the subject of a personal obligation owed by Weber. In reality, this sum ceased to be a trust asset when the loan was granted. However, no evidence has been led of the exchange rate on this date, and we determine this issue on the basis of the parties’ respective positions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 We find that the exchange rate as of 5 March 2021, the effective date of transfer, should be used. In contrast to the question of whether the full amount has been received by Baker (which justifies the use of the exchange rate on the date of receipt for to calculate the shortfall of the transfer on 26 August 2020), the exercise of accounting is concerned with arriving at the proper value of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys. In that sense, the relevant valuation is at the time the moneys are transferred out of the Trust Moneys, which would be the effective date of transfer, being 5 March 2021 in this case. Therefore, the appropriate value for the deduction would be US$778,462.38 instead of US$784,216.14, a difference of US$5,753.76. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(15) Conclusion on the specific entries in dispute</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 We therefore find as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) S/Ns 4, 5, and 14, referring to a total of US$15,400 by BCS to Renslade (S), should be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) S/Ns 6, 10, 11, 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 34 and 36, referring to the payment of US$25,142.97 of management fees to BCS should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) S/Ns 12 and 15, referring to the payment of US$331,269.08 to Plexus AG should be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) S/Ns 35, 39, 52, 68, 82, 100, 121, 158, 195, 231, 264, 305, 340, 378, 408, 420, 422 and 424, referring to the US$2.7m for BCS’s personnel and administrative overhead, should be falsified</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The entries for payments of US$59,145.57, US$109,334.51 and US$118,732.23 in respect of Legendary Cosmetic, Your World Media and BCS Pharma Pte Ltd should <span class="font-italic">not</span> be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) S/Ns 329, 362 and 372, referring to payments totalling US$9,523.65 to Dev, should be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) S/Ns 412 and 415, referring to payments totalling US$1,119,688.45 (being the sum of US$511,920 and US$607,768.45) should be falsified, while S/N 403 should not be falsified. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) Entries for expenses incurred by Renslade (S) to the value of US$8,716.73 and payments to BCS for US$8,500.42 should not be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Of the payments to Wehinger, S/N 413, referring to a payment of US$18,588.88 to Wehinger’s firm on 11 April 2017, should be falsified, but S/N 17 need not be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(j) Of the payments for Renslade (HK)’s general and administrative expenses, only US$265,824.19 should be falsified, while the remainder should not be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(k) S/N 426, an entry for US$100,000, being a claimed 5% commission/remuneration of the US$2m payment by Nu Skin to BCS Pharma Corporation in 2018, should be falsified.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(l) Of the “other outgoings” claimed under S/N 430, the entry should be falsified <span class="font-italic">except</span> to the extent of US$390,000, that is, to the value of US$3,269,469.30 (being US$3,659,469.30 – US$390,000).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(m) S/Ns 427 and 428 should be modified to only reflect the CHF9.5m principal that was deducted from the Trust Moneys when the loan to Weber was first made.

</div>
</div> There is therefore no dispute over the usual 5.33% per annum as post-judgment interest, and we are concerned here with pre-judgment interest. We address this in two steps: first, whether pre-judgment interest should be awarded, and if so, what the appropriate rate of interest should be.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether pre-judgment interest should be ordered</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The basis for the power to award pre-judgment interest is s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed), which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">12.</span>—(1) In any proceedings tried in any court of record for the recovery of any debt or damages, the court may, if it thinks fit, order that there shall be included in the sum for which judgment is given interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the whole or any part of the debt or damages for the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of the judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We note for completeness that the phrase, “any debt or damages”, has been construed broadly to also include sums recoverable in equity: see <span class="font-italic">Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 473 v De Beers Jewellery Pte Ltd </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 418 at [54], following <span class="font-italic">BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No 2)</span> [1983] 2 AC 352 at 373. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 While the Defendants are correct to note that the award of pre-judgment interest is a matter of the court’s discretion, the position is more nuanced than that. As the Court of Appeal stated in <span class="font-italic">Grains and Industrial Products Trading Pte Ltd v Bank of India and another </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1308 (“<span class="font-italic">Grains</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [138]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… While the recoverability of interest is a matter of the court’s discretion, we held in <span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltd</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 (‘<span class="font-italic">Robertson Quay Investment</span>’) at [100]–[103] that <span class="font-italic">as a general rule, damages should commence from the date of accrual of loss</span>. As a matter of principle, claimants who have been kept out of pocket without basis should be able to recover interest on money that is found to have been owed to them from the date of their entitlement until the date it is paid. The object of leaving it to judicial discretion as opposed to laying down a fixed rule making interest payable as of right is to enable the courts to achieve justice across the infinite range of factual permutations that may confront the court by tailoring the award to fit the unique circumstances of each case. Such discretion would extend to a determination of whether to award interest at all; what the relevant rate of interest should be; what proportion of the sum should bear interest; and the period for which interest should be awarded (Harvey McGregor, <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2014) at para 18-031). [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 The sole basis for the Defendants’ submission that this court should exercise its discretion <span class="font-italic">not</span> to award pre-judgment interest is that the Defendants had paid into court the sum of S$10,330,658.91 on 28 January 2020 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, prior to the Judgment which was handed down on 29 April 2020).

</div>
</div> However, in our view, this is not sufficient to justify not awarding pre-judgment interest. In particular, the span of time between that payment and the handing down of the Judgment (around three months) is much shorter than the span of time between 30 October 2017 (when the Defendants failed to comply with the demand for the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys to be accounted for and transferred) to the date of the Judgment or even the date when the initial sum was paid in January 2020. Further, as the rationale for pre-judgment interest is to compensate “a successful claimant for the time value of money the use of which was lost between the date on which the claimant’s cause of action arose and the date of the judgment” (<span class="font-italic">Grains</span> at [137]), the fact remains that even in respect of the S$10,330,658.91, the plaintiff did lose the time value of the money. We therefore find that pre-judgment interest should be awarded in this case in accordance with the general principle stated in <span class="font-italic">Grains</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 As for the date from which pre-judgment interest should run, we note that there is no dispute. We agree with Baker that this date should be 30 October 2017, which was the deadline given in the letters of demand sent to the Defendants for an account of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys, and for the return of the said assets and moneys. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The rate of pre-judgment interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Baker argues that 5.33% per annum should be the applicable interest rate, while the Defendants argue that the more appropriate interest rate is 3.7% per annum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 Baker’s position is essentially that 5.33% per annum is the default interest rate that the courts tend to apply, and that a party must show a reason for and adduce evidence to justify a departure from the 5.33%.

</div> They submit that the evidence pertaining to Renslade (HK)’s investments would reflect Chantal’s likely investment of the Trust Moneys, and that interest of 3.7% per annum accurately reflects the return on that hypothetical investment. The rate of 5.33% per annum would overcompensate the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 We agree with Baker that the authorities show that in the absence of any reason to depart from the default rate, the default interest rate of 5.33% per annum would apply, even in respect of pre-judgment interest: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Grains</span> at [143]; <span class="font-italic">Anuva</span><span class="font-italic"> Technologies Pte Ltd v Advanced Sierra Electrotech Pte Ltd and another suit</span> [2020] 4 SLR 569 at [70]. One example where the court had so departed was in <span class="font-italic">Ong Teck Soon (executor of the estate of Ong Kim Nang, deceased) v Ong Teck Seng and another</span> [2017] 4 SLR 819 (“<span class="font-italic">Ong Teck Soon</span>”), where the High Court held that the executor, after confronting the first defendant about the withdrawals, was <span class="font-italic">content for the funds to remain in the bank account</span>. As such, the court awarded interest at the actual rates earned in that account (<span class="font-italic">Ong Teck Soon</span> at [85]). It is worth pointing out, however, that this lower interest rate was in respect of the period from the accrual of the action to the date of the writ – the usual 5.33% rate applied from the date of the writ to the date of judgment (<span class="font-italic">Ong Teck Soon</span> at [80]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 In the present case, it is not necessary for us delve into the details of how Mr Arora arrived at the rate of 3.7% per annum. In our view, the Defendants’ position is based on a number of assumptions that are ultimately untenable, even apart from the question of how the specific number should be calculated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 First, the reliance on Renslade (HK)’s investments assumes that Chantal had agreed to these investments. We agree with Baker that the Defendants have not shown any basis for this as a matter of fact – the Defendants’ only argument is that this would have followed from Chantal’s direction of the Ethocyn business and the fact that she was informed of transactions. Further, the Defendants rely on the fact that she had given a CHF6m loan with interest of 3% per annum. However, in our view, this evidence is equivocal. As Baker notes, there is some indication that Weber made independent decisions as to investments, and it is not clear to what extent and to what degree of detail Chantal was updated on these activities.

However, there is no reason why this should be the case. Chantal had passed away on 2 October 2016. The pre-judgment interest sought in this case is from 30 October 2017, the deadline for the demands to be complied with by the Defendants. By that time, Baker was already the executor of the Estate, which would have received the payments. In that regard, it is what the <span class="font-italic">Estate</span> would have done upon receipt of the payments by 30 October 2017 that is relevant. This is consistent with the approach taken in <span class="font-italic">Ong Teck Soon</span> where the <span class="font-italic">executor’s</span> conduct (and not the testator’s) was taken as the relevant factor for adjusting the applicable interest rate. If the purpose of pre-judgment interest is to compensate for the time value relating to the use of the funds, given the fact that the funds <span class="font-italic">could only</span> have been used by the Estate, it follows that the relevant value must be considered in respect of what the Estate might have done. In this regard, the Defendants’ arguments are flawed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 Hence, we think that at a very fundamental level, the Defendants’ attempts to rely on the returns obtained by Renslade (HK) on its investments are flawed. In the absence of any evidence of what the Estate would have done with the sums that were due on 30 October 2017, there is no reason to depart from the usual rate of 5.33% per annum. As such, we find that the rate of 5.33% should also apply to the pre-judgment interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 There being no dispute over post-judgment interest, it follows that the appropriate interest payable on the sums due to the plaintiff on the taking of the account should be 5.33% per annum from 30 October 2017 until the sums of money are received by the plaintiff. In this regard, the interest on specific sums should only run until the specific sums are received by the plaintiff, if the payment is made in tranches. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Provision for alleged tax liability</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The final dispute between the parties concerns a tax provision of US$70m for alleged US tax liability that the Defendants have included in the Combined Account (see S/N 431). We note, at the outset, that it remains unclear to us what is sought by the inclusion of this tax provision. Ms Chong has clarified that this does not refer to a sum of money being held for this purpose.

</div> Instead, it appears that it is a notional sum which, we imagine, the Defendants would like to offset against any sums found to be due to the plaintiff. Whatever it may be, however, we find no basis at all for allowing the Defendants to make such provision for alleged tax liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The Defendants claim that Baker had written to Weber’s German counsel, Wojtek, stating that he or the other Defendants may be exposed to tax liability in the USA in connection with the Ethocyn business. Weber claims to understand that this refers to the tax liability related to the funds received by or due to Chantal and/or her Estate during her lifetime. Further, the Defendants argue, Baker’s own tax adviser, Mr Wayne Johnson, had given evidence in his affidavit filed on 6 December 2019 that once the Trust Assets were ruled to belong to Chantal, these assets became subject to the attachment of a lien, to secure any claims that the US Inland Revenue Service (“IRS”) would have for the taxes payable. The Defendants take the position that unless Baker has complied with all tax obligations in the US, it is reasonable and correct for a tax provision to be made. The Defendants rely on a report by Mr Robert McKenzie (“Mr McKenzie”) for an estimate of US$70m in tax provision.

Mr McKenzie’s report only states that the Estate and/or Baker (as executor of the Estate) would be liable to the IRS. Baker relies on the opinion of his US tax law expert, Mr Mark E Matthews (“Mr Matthews”), who has concluded that the Defendants would not be liable for any taxes if they return the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys to Baker, and that the Estate currently does not owe taxes.

While it is true that Mr Johnson had provided evidence that upon the decision of the court that the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys belonged to the Estate (as they belonged to Chantal), an inchoate lien would attach to secure the claims that IRS might have for estate taxes payable, Mr Johnson did not opine that there were any such outstanding tax liabilities. Indeed, he stated that “[a]t this point there has been no U.S. income tax assessed on the assets”, and it is only after the court finds that Chantal was the beneficial owner that Baker would have to report this income and pay any tax associated with it.

</div> This evidence is neither here nor there.

In his view, Chantal was the “grantor of a foreign grantor trust”, and therefore, had the obligation to file a number of forms with the IRS annually. Upon her death, the Estate, as beneficiary of the trust, had to file similar forms.

He refers to two provisions that could potentially impose liability on the Defendants, but concludes that these would not apply. Having considered Mr McKenzie’s report, he was also of the view that the majority of that report was irrelevant as it did not consider the question of the Defendants’ liability.

If there is no such liability, and if any liability at all would fall on the Estate, then there is no justification at all for a tax provision, since the Defendants would not be liable in the first place, and would certainly then not be liable upon the transfer of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys. Whatever liabilities would then be for the Estate to resolve and would not involve the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 The expert evidence does not establish that the Defendants would be personally liable for any taxes or penalties. Mr McKenzie’s report only deals with the <span class="font-italic">Estate’s</span> liabilities. Mr Matthews has provided the only indication of possible statutes under which the Defendants might be liable, and has concluded that these would not apply. There is no contrary submission based on US law. As such, the evidence points only one way, which is that the Defendants would <span class="font-italic">not</span> be personally liable for any taxes or penalties. It follows that the provision for tax is not justified, since the Defendants are not actually affected by any tax liability.

Chantal was the co-inventor of a compound called “Ethocyn” used in anti-aging skin products. The intellectual property rights in the Ethocyn (“the Ethocyn Rights”) were held by companies controlled by Chantal, which entered into bankruptcy proceedings in the US (“the US Bankruptcy Proceedings”). The Ethocyn Rights were acquired by Renslade New Zealand with the approval of the US Bankruptcy Court, and subsequently transferred to a Singapore company (“Renslade (S)”), and then to BCS. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 In November 2017, the Estate commenced suit (“the Suit”) against the Defendants, alleging that the Defendants were trustees of the Ethocyn Rights for the Estate, and had breached their fiduciary duties.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The SICC rendered its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Baker, Michael A (executor of the estate of Chantal Burnison, deceased) v BCS Business Consulting Services Pte Ltd and others</span> [2020] 4 SLR 85 (“the Judgment”) on 29 April 2020. In the Judgment, the court held that there was a valid and enforceable trust agreement governed by Singapore law as between Weber and Chantal. Chantal was the beneficial owner of the Ethocyn Rights, and the moneys and income generated therefrom (“the Trust Assets and Trust Monies”). The bulk of the Trust Monies were derived from a supply and distribution agreement between the Defendants and one Nu Skin International Inc. The court found that the Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, and ordered, among other things, that (a) the Defendants to provide a detailed account of all transactions that had taken place in respect of the Trust Assets and/or Trust Moneys;  and (b) the Defendants pay to the plaintiff all sums due to the plaintiff on the taking of the account. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The Defendants’ appeal against the Judgment (“the Appeal”) was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in January 2021</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The parties exchanged a series of correspondence over the issue of the account. The Defendants’ provided a combined account (“Combined Account”) which consisted of two parts: (a) “Income”, representing the income received; and (b) “Outgoings”, representing the amounts sought to be deducted from the income. Under the “Outgoings” was a tax provision of US$70m that the Defendants sought to make. On the Combined Account, no further payment was due from the Defendants to Baker. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 Baker was dissatisfied with the Combined Account, on the basis of the following objections: (a) an objection to the “Income” arising from an alleged failure to include US$200,000; (b) various objections to the “Outgoings” listed by the Defendants; and (c) consequently, a difference in view as to the amount due from the Defendants. Further, Baker disputed the tax provision the Defendants wished to make. The parties also disagreed on the interest that was to be paid on the sums due from the Defendants.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Applicable law and standards</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 Given that the account was being taken after adverse findings were made against the Defendants, the court took into account its findings in relation to the Defendants’ conduct when coming to assess the specific entries in dispute: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">19]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 When a trustee provided an account which disclosed what the beneficiary considered to be discrepancies, the beneficiary may choose to: (a) falsify a wrongful expense or loss charged to the account, which would require the expense or loss to be deleted or disallowed; or (b) surcharge an account, that is, to assert that the trustee has received more than what the account records. When a beneficiary falsified an entry, the burden lay on the <span class="font-italic">trustee</span> to prove the disbursement was authorised. In contrast, when a beneficiary sought a surcharge, the burden lay on the <span class="font-italic">beneficiary</span> to show that the trustee received more than the account recorded: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[20]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[21]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 A trustee had the right to be indemnified out of trust property for costs and expenses incurred in the course of the trust, but this right was not unqualified and did not extend to costs and expenses incurred without authority. Given the overlap between the question of whether a specific expense or cost was properly incurred and the question of whether a particular entry should be falsified, the court treated these questions together: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[22]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 In applying the burden of proof, the court would have regard to the trustee’s duty to keep records and to be ready to give an account. The plaintiff argued that the Defendants were to be held to a higher standard as they were professional trustees. However, on the facts of this case, the court did not agree, as there was no indication that the Defendants were in fact in a course of profession or business relating to trusts: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[23]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[26]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Objection to the income</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The sole dispute over the income concerned US$200,000 which Baker claimed had been received by BCS from Webstone 21, a company in the Republic of Korea. As Baker was pursuing a surcharge of the account, the burden lay on him to establish this claim. However, the evidence did not sufficiently establish Baker’s case. The highest that the plaintiff’s case could go was that there was a letter of credit, but there was no evidence that it was paid upon or that the transaction was completed: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[29]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[32]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Objections to the outgoings</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 There were four points of general disagreement between the parties. These were (a) the extent of Chantal’s involvement in the Ethocyn business and the implication of that involvement on the Defendants’ burden of proof; (b) whether Baker, as executor of the Estate, was estopped from disputing the outgoings; (c) whether the Defendants were entitled to compensation beyond the 5% agreed between Weber and Chantal; and (d) the role and relevance of audited financial statements and expert opinions.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. In relation to the first issue, it was clear that, in general, Chantal was directing payments to be made, and it was incumbent on the Defendants to keep proper records of such instructions and approval. However, the reality was that there was an ongoing business relating to the Ethocyn rights, and this meant that strict records of instructions and approvals may not always be kept or that certain payments may not be highlighted in each and every instance to Chantal. Hence, while the absence of documentary evidence would be counted against the Defendants in general, it was possible for the Defendants to establish, on an entry by entry basis, that Chantal had approved the transaction, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, because it was part of a series of payments, an established pattern of conduct, or the nature of the payments indicates that they must have been for the Ethocyn business: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[39]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[41]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. In relation to the second issue, it was not necessary to adopt an analysis of estoppel, as the same questions of fact that would go towards establishing, as a question of proof, whether Chantal expressly or implicitly approved a particular outgoing would also be relevant to establishing the elements of estoppel: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[43]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">c. In relation to the third issue, Weber was only entitled to 5% of the revenue as his commission or compensation for any services that he rendered to Chantal and the Ethocyn business. However, this did not mean that the 5% was the ceiling for any and all compensation, renumeration or reimbursement for all other services provided by other entities, even entities controlled by Weber, or for expenses incurred (even by Weber) in the process of the provision of those services and in the conduct of the Ethocyn business: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[51]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">d. In relation to the fourth issue, the mere provision of financial statements would not necessarily suffice to discharge a trustee’s duty to account. However, if the purpose of the outgoings is clear on the face of the financial statements, it may be possible to draw the inference that the outgoings were part and parcel of the Ethocyn business and, in the light of any other evidence, may have been approved by Chantal. Furthermore, even if statements or figures were provided, the court would have to consider the scope and specificity of the information provided. As for the evidence provided by the Defendants’ expert, the court would take into account his views that certain expenses were documented to his satisfaction, but that opinion could not be determinative of any matter that was properly for the court to decide, including whether the outgoings were in fact incurred and whether they were properly incurred: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[53</span><span class="font-weight-bold">] </span>to <span class="font-weight-bold">[</span><span class="font-weight-bold">56]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 The court then turned to the specific objections raised by Baker. Having regard to the principles stated above, and with particular attention paid to the burden of proof, the court falsified entries totalling US$7,835,517.31 and CHF1,662,894.67, as it was not satisfied that the Defendants had sufficiently proved that these deductions were authorised or approved. Furthermore, as modifications have been made to the Combined Account after it was furnished, these modifications were incorporated into the account. As a result, the Defendants were to pay $7,859,424.23 and CHF1,662,894.67: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[146]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[147]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Interest payable</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 The parties did not dispute that interest of 5.33% per annum should be ordered for interest running from the date of the Judgment. The parties disagreed, however, as to whether interest should be ordered to be paid on the sum due from the Defendants to the plaintiff until the date of the Judgment, and if so, the appropriate rate of interest: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[14</span><span class="font-weight-bold">9]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 The basis of the power to award pre-judgment interest was s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed). The Defendants argued that the court should exercise its discretion not to award pre-judgment interest as they had paid the sum of S$10,330,658.91 into court prior to the Judgment. However, this was not sufficient. The span of time between that payment and the handing down of the Judgment was much shorter than the span of time between 30 October 2017 (when the Defendants failed to comply with the demand for the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys to be accounted for and transferred) to the date of the Judgment or the date when that sum was paid into court. Further, even in respect of that sum paid into court, the plaintiff did lose the time value of the money. Therefore, pre-judgment interest would run from 30 October 2017, which was the deadline initially set for the account and return of the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[15</span><span class="font-weight-bold">2]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 The rate of pre-judgment interest was ordered to be 5.33% per annum. The authorities showed that, in the absence of any reason to depart from the default rate, the rate of 5.33% per annum would apply. The Defendants’ argument that the rate of 3.7% per annum should be used was based on an estimate of the returns on investments obtained by Renslade (HK) in the same period of time. This was flawed. First, there was no basis for assuming that Chantal had agreed to the investments made by Renslade (HK). Secondly, this assumed that the relevant investment strategy was Chantal’s, but she had already passed away in October 2016. By the time the Trust Assets and Trust Moneys were demanded, Baker was the executor of the Estate, and hence, it was what the Estate would have done on receipt of the payments by 30 October 2017 that was relevant. As there was no evidence what the Estate would have done with the sums due on 30 October 2017, there was no reason to depart from the usual rate of 5.33% per annum: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[15</span><span class="font-weight-bold">7]</span> to <span class="font-weight-bold">[16</span><span class="font-weight-bold">1]</span>.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Tax provision</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 There was no basis for the tax provision sought by the Defendants. The central issue was whether there was any basis for the <span class="font-italic">Defendants</span> to be personally liable for any unpaid tax or tax penalties in the United States. However, the expert evidence did not establish this personal liability. Instead, the evidence pointed only one way, which was that the Defendants would <span class="font-italic">not</span> be personally liable for any taxes or penalties: at <span class="font-weight-bold">[16</span><span class="font-weight-bold">9] </span>and <span class="font-weight-bold">[1</span><span class="font-weight-bold">70]</span>. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 For the reasons above, the court granted the following orders (at <span class="font-weight-bold">[17</span><span class="font-weight-bold">1]</span>):</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">a. The Defendants were to pay the plaintiff the sums of US$7,859,424.23 and CHF1,662,894.67, as the sums due from the Defendants on the taking of the account.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">b. The Defendants were to pay to the plaintiff interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum on the moneys paid to the plaintiff on the basis of the Trust, from 30 October 2017 until such date (or dates, if various sums are received at various time) that the sums are received by the plaintiff. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
