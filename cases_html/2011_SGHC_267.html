        Lee Seiu Kin J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application made by the plaintiff,
                    seeking moneys which she claims to be entitled to pursuant to three insurance
                    policies that her deceased husband, Mr Quick Cheng Gee (“the
                    Deceased”), had purchased after their marriage and which she has been
                    named the sole beneficiary of.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff was married to the Deceased on
                    November 1991. They have no children. The Deceased died intestate on
                    30 March 2005. Madam Lu Bah Bee (“Mdm Lu”) is the mother
                    of the Deceased. Pursuant to r 4 of s 7 of the Intestate Succession
                    Act (Cap 146, 1985 Rev Ed), both the plaintiff and Mdm Lu are entitled
                    to half of the Deceased’s estate (“the
                Estate”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Both Mdm Lu and the plaintiff were appointed
                    administratrices of the Estate under a grant of letters of administration
                    extracted on 9 February 2007. Following the grant, Mdm Lu and the
                    plaintiff opened a bank account to consolidate the Estate (“the DBS
                    Estate Account”). Both Mdm Lu and the plaintiff are joint signatories to
                    the DBS Estate Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The issue for this court’s determination
                    concerns the proceeds of the following three insurance policies (“the AIA
                    Insurance Policies”) purchased by the Deceased, which totalled
                    $339,125.37:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     AIA policy No L531438918:
                        $255,990.05</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     AIA
                        policy No L519010251: $29,325.86</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     AIA policy No L110433554: $53,809.46</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On the application forms for each of the AIA
                    Insurance Policies, the plaintiff’s name, <em>viz</em> “Lim Lina”, was written as the sole name under
                    the box labelled “Name of Beneficiary”. Her relationship as the
                    Deceased’s “wife” is also indicated under the box labelled
                    “Relationship”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The proceeds of the AIA Insurance Policies were
                    paid into the DBS Estate Account. The plaintiff believed that this payment was
                    erroneous as the proceeds of the AIA Insurance Policies were actually due to
                    her. Through her solicitors, she corresponded with Mdm Lu to request her
                    approval for the proceeds of the AIA Insurance Policies to be taken out of the
                    DBS Estate Account. However, Mdm Lu refused to approve the release of the
                    proceeds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Accordingly, the plaintiff made the present
                    application for a declaration that she was entitled to the proceeds of the AIA
                    Insurance Policies that have been paid into the DBS Estate Account, and that the
                    same should be released to the plaintiff solely. The Plaintiff’s argument
                    in support of her application was that the monies paid under the AIA Insurance
                    Policies did not form part of the Estate, and instead belonged solely to
                    her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Section 73(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of
                    Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLPA”) sets out
                    that monies payable under certain policies of assurance do not form part of the
                    estate of the insured in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Moneys payable under policy of
                            assurance not to form part of the estate of the
                        insured</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>73.</b> —(1) A <em>policy of assurance effected by any man on his own
                            life</em> and <em>expressed</em>, before the
                        date of commencement of section 10 of the Insurance (Amendment) Act
                        2009, <em>to be for the benefit of his wife or of his
                            children or of his wife and children or any of them</em>, or
                        by any woman on her own life and expressed, before the date of commencement
                        of section 10 of the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2009, to be for the
                        benefit of her husband or of her children or of her husband and
                        children or any of them, <em>shall create a trust in
                            favour of the objects therein named</em>, and the <em>moneys payable under any such policy shall not</em>,
                        so long as any object of the trust remains unperformed, <em>form part of the estate of the insured or be subject to
                            his or her debts</em>. </p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Section 73 of the CLPA had its predecessor in
                    s 11 of the Married Women’s Property Act 1882 (UK) (see <em>CH v CI</em> [2004] SGDC 131 (“<em>CH v CI</em>”) at [14]). The rationale for the English provision was to allow an
                    insured person to set up a separate fund exclusively for his immediate family on
                    which creditors could not possibly lay their hands, thus protecting the
                    immediate family members from the policyholder’s creditors (see Yeo Hwee
                    Ying, “Life Policies under a Statutory Trust” [1996] SJLS 342 at
                    342 and Debbie Ong Siew Ling, “Section 73 CLPA: Assurance for the Spouse
                    and Children” (1997) 9 SAcLJ 82 at 83). As explained by Deane J in
                        <em>Re Yeo Hock Hoe’s Policy</em>
                    (1938) MLJ 33 at 34, in the context of the then-equivalent of
                    s 73 of the CLPA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In other words the legislature viewing with sympathy any effort by a man
                        to provide for his wife and family after his death has provided that a man
                        may insure his life at any time for their benefit and any monies payable
                        under the policy shall not go to pay his debts, but shall be held in trust
                        for his family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I pause briefly to note that the legislative
                    framework surrounding s 73 of the CLPA was amended pursuant to the
                    enactment of the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2009. According to Hansard, such a
                    change was made because under the s 73 framework, there was some
                    uncertainty surrounding the disbursement of insurance policy proceeds (see
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (4 February 2009) vol 85 col 1630
                    (Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Minister for Trade and Industry)). The Insurance
                    (Amendment) Act 2009 was to “clarify the current uncertainty surrounding
                    the disbursement of insurance policy proceeds and give policy owners the
                    assurance that the proceeds from their insurance policies will be disbursed as
                    they intended” (<em>ibid</em>). Given, however, that
                    the AIA Insurance Policies were effected <em>before</em>
                    the amendments were made to the legislative framework, s 73 of the CLPA
                    remains applicable to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The key matter of interest in the present case
                    was whether the AIA Insurance Policies were “expressed” to be for
                    the benefit of the plaintiff, for the purposes of s 73 of the CLPA. It
                    appears from decided cases that there is no fixed format of
                    “expression” required in order for s 73 of the CLPA to be
                    brought into operation. For instance, in <em>Eng Li Cheng Dolly v
                        Lim Yeo Hua</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 577 (“<em>Dolly Eng</em>”) the policy contained the provision
                    “Beneficiary. Mdm Eng Li Cheng, wife of the life assured”. This
                    was found to be sufficient expression for the purposes of s 73 of the
                    CLPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It should further be noted that s 73 of
                    the CLPA need not be expressly mentioned in the policy of assurance because such
                    express mention is not a requirement in s 73 (<em>Dolly
                        Eng</em> at [14] <em>per</em> G P Selvam J). On
                    the facts of <em>Dolly Eng</em>, notwithstanding that
                    s 73 of the CLPA was not expressly mentioned, Selvam J held that s 73
                    of the CLPA applied to the facts of the case. More recently, in <em>CH v CI</em>, the district court held – citing
                        <em>Dolly Eng</em> – that “it is not
                    necessary to specifically invoke Section 73 in the life insurance policy
                    documents in order for a Section 73 trust to be created” (<em>CH v CI</em> at [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Application to the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In the present case, as mentioned above (at
                        <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>), the plaintiff’s name was
                    written under the column labelled “Name of Beneficiary”, and her
                    relationship as the Deceased’s “wife” is also clearly
                    indicated under the column labelled “Relationship”. This is
                    therefore sufficient to indicate that the policies were “expressed
                    … to be for the benefit of his wife” for the purposes of
                    s 73 of the CLPA. As such, s 73 of the CLPA was brought into
                    operation, and a trust was immediately constituted in favour of the plaintiff.
                    The proceeds of the AIA Insurance Policies thus do not form part of the
                    Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     I accordingly allowed the application. I also
                    ordered that costs of these proceedings to be paid by the Estate, on solicitor
                    and client basis.</p>
