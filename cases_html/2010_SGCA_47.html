        Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against a decision of the
                    trial judge (“Judge”) who dismissed a claim for the recovery of
                    certain unpaid debts on the ground that the claim by the plaintiff (as the
                    assignee of the debt) was subject to a prior equity of the debtor, <em>viz</em>, a right to a contractual set-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff in the action, and the appellant
                    in this appeal, is Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA (trading
                    as Rabobank International), Singapore Branch (“Rabobank”). It is
                    the Singapore branch of a bank incorporated in the Netherlands. The respondent,
                    the defendant in the action, is Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd
                    (“MEPL”), which engages in the manufacture and marketing of
                    telecommunication products. MEPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola Inc,
                    which also wholly owns another entity, Motorola Trading Center Pte Ltd
                    (“MTC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In 2003, Jurong Hi-Tech, a sole proprietorship
                    owned by Jurong Hi-Tech Industries Pte Ltd (“JHTI”), began
                    manufacturing electronic products for MEPL. On 28 July 2004, MEPL and JHTI
                    entered into a Manufacturing and Assembly Agreement
                        (“MAA”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Pursuant to this agreement, JHTI agreed to
                    manufacture electronic products for MEPL using materials purchased from MEPL
                    and/or suppliers approved by the MEPL. Clause 11.2 of the MAA allowed for the
                    set-off of accounts between MEPL and JHTI on the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where Materials are purchased directly from [MEPL], [MEPL] shall have the
                        right to offset payments due to it against amounts payable to [JHTI] for
                        such Materials. The payment shall be made in arrears against correct
                        invoices issued by [JHTI] for the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The agreement was for one year, subject to a further one year
                    extension. However, there was no evidence that this agreement had been extended
                    or otherwise renewed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 5 July 2005, MTC began to supply
                    materials to, and purchase electronic products from JHTI. On 28 March 2006,
                    Motorola Inc (“Motorola Inc”) and JHTI entered into a
                    Manufacturing Services Agreement (“MSA”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, for JHTI to
                    manufacture Motorola Inc products. Under cll 6b and 6c of the MSA, JHTI was
                    obligated to purchase materials from “Motorola” for the
                    manufacture of the products. In cl 2 of the MSA, “Motorola” was
                    defined as inclusive of Motorola Inc and its “affiliates”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... any corporation or other entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
                        under common control with a party. A corporation or other entity shall be
                        deemed to control another if it owns or controls more than fifty percent
                        (50%) of the voting stock or other ownership interest of the corporation or
                        entity. References herein to Motorola and Company shall be deemed to include
                        references to their Affiliates unless otherwise specified or the context
                        otherwise requires.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Unlike the MAA (which provided for a contractual right of set-off
                    between MEPL and JHTI), the MSA <em>did not</em> provide
                    for a contractual right of set-off between JHTI and “Motorola” as
                    defined in MSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 15 February 2007, Rabobank and JHTI
                    entered into a Master Receivables Purchase Agreement (“MRPA”)
                    under which Rabobank contracted to provide JHTI with receivables financing
                    facilities of up to US$20m. Pursuant to cl 2 read with cl 4 of the MRPA,
                    Rabobank could from time to time be offered receivables owing from MEPL to JHTI,
                    by way of a purchase request served by JHTI on Rabobank. Rabobank had the sole
                    discretion to decide whether or not to accept the offer and acquire those
                    receivables. Under cl 11(c) of the MRPA, JHTI represented itself as the legal
                    and beneficial owner of each receivable offered for purchase, and also that it
                    had not assigned or created any prior encumbrance over each receivable
                    offered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Pursuant to the MRPA, JHTI made various
                    assignments of debt to Rabobank between 22 June 2008 and 6 October
                    2008. However, on 7 October 2008, Rabobank decided to focus its attention
                    on corporate borrowers in the food and agricultural sector, and to exit from
                    non-core markets such as the telecommunications, media and internet market, in
                    which JHTI was trading. Thus, starting from 7 October 2008, Rabobank
                    decided not to accept new purchase requests, grant further new drawings or allow
                    a rollover of existing loans in order to facilitate an orderly exit from its
                    business relationship with JHTI. On 13 November 2008, the MRPA was
                    terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 17 November 2008, Rabobank notified MEPL
                    of various assignments of receivables from JHTI. However, omitted from this
                    notification were two assignments made on 28 July and 18 August 2008.
                    Subsequently, Rabobank remedied the situation by a further notification of
                    17 December 2008. Thereafter Rabobank demanded repayment from MEPL in
                    respect of all those assigned receivables. When no payment was forthcoming,
                    Rabobank filed a claim against MEPL on 22 January 2009, claiming eventually
                    (after amendments) for the total amount of US$5,178,212.41, which represented
                    the total net value of those assigned receivables.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 20 February 2009, JHTI was placed under
                    judicial management. Its parent company, Jurong Technologies Industrial
                    Corporation (“JTIC”), is presently also under judicial
                    management.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The trial below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       At the trial below, Rabobank pleaded a
                    straightforward case that it was entitled to payment from MEPL, being the
                    assignee of the receivables. In response to Rabobank’s claim, MEPL pleaded
                    that pursuant to an express and/or implied agreement entered into between MEPL,
                    MTC and JHTI on or around 5 July 2005 allowing for the tripartite
                    setting-off of accounts, the receivables in question had already been set-off on
                    22 October 2008 and 21 November 2008, prior to the receipt by MEPL of
                    the notification of assignments. In the light of the position taken by MEPL, the
                    existence of a tripartite set-off agreement of 5 July 2005 and the date of
                    receipt by MEPL of the letter of notification of Rabobank dated 17 November
                    2008 were central issues to the trial below. The Judge found that MEPL received
                    the letter only on 25 November 2008. In this appeal, the parties do not
                    challenge this finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As mentioned before, the pleaded tripartite
                    set-off agreement was an “express and/or implied” agreement. MEPL
                    did not plead an alternative defence of equitable set-off. At the trial, MEPL
                    argued that the express agreement to set-off was embodied in the MAA. The Judge
                    found this argument unconvincing because the MAA only provided for a mutual
                    set-off between MEPL and JHTI. MTC was not a party to that
                agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On the alternative plea of an implied
                    agreement, MEPL relied on the evidence of various alleged set-offs effected
                    periodically between the parties since 5 July 2005. In this regard, there
                    is the evidence of MTC’s finance manager since 2005 (cost accountant prior
                    to 2005), Mr Coimbatore Sahasranaman Lakshmanan’s
                    (“Lakshamanan”) and Motorola (China) Electronics Pte Ltd’s
                    accounting manager, Mr Vincent Luo Chen’s (“Luo”) who
                    said that there were regular bilateral set-offs between MEPL and JHTI, and
                    tripartite set-offs between MEPL, MTC and JHTI. Luo, who took over the
                    administration of the JHTI account (overseeing the external reconciliation,
                    internal reconciliation and external set-off processes every month) from Ng
                    Cheng Soon (“Ng”) (previously MEPL’s accountant) in October
                    2008, testified that every month, he would send an email to Lim Chai Lee
                    (“Chai Lee”), JHTI’s accountant, attaching a reconciliation
                    statement that listed all outstanding invoices issued by JHTI to MEPL and MTC,
                    and <em>vice versa</em>. If there were any inconsistencies,
                    Chai Lee would contact Luo. After the external reconciliation, all the invoices
                    issued by any of the three parties which had already fallen due would be removed
                    from the reconciliation statement and placed in a separate set-off statement. A
                    debit note would be raised by MEPL internally while a credit note would be
                    raised by MTC internally for the cross-entity set-off to be approved. A debit
                    note request form would then be raised by MEPL to set-off amounts owing by MEPL
                    to JHTI against amounts owing by JHTI to MTC. A debit note request form (from
                    MEPL) and a credit note request form (from MTC), both dated 24 June 2008
                    and referring to the “settlement” agreement between MEPL, MTC and
                    the JHT group were adduced as evidence in court to prove the existence of such a
                    process. This step was subsequently omitted to simplify the process. Under the
                    simplified process, a credit note would be raised by MTC for every set-off of
                    sums owed by MEPL to JHTI against sums owed by JHTI to MTC. MEPL would then pay
                    to MTC the sums owed by JHTI to MTC. The said monies owed by JHTI to MTC would
                    then be set-off against the sums owed by MEPL to JHTI, and the invoices which
                    had already been “knocked off” in this process would be removed
                    from the reconciliation statement for the following month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The set-offs had to be approved by
                    Lakshamanan, Ng, and John Kozlowski, the overall financial controller of
                    Motorola Inc’s businesses in Asia. Emails dated 22 October 2008 (sent
                    by Luo to Ng) and 17 November 2008 (sent by Luo to Ng and Lakshamanan) show
                    that Luo had sought approval by email from the relevant parties before effecting
                    the set-offs. Credit notes to be issued by MTC to effect a set-off between MEPL
                    and MTC were attached to these two emails from Luo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Luo testified at the trial that the monthly
                    reconciliation statements (as mentioned above, at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>) would be uploaded on Motorola’s Accounts Payables
                    Inquiry Application (“APIA”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> which was accessible by JHTI.
                    Extracts of information from this system were adduced before the court below.
                    The extract adduced contained records of invoices which documented MTC’s
                    accounts receivables and JHTI’s receivables. The said monies owed by JHTI
                    to MTC would then be set-off against the sums owed by MEPL to JHTI, and the
                    invoices which have already been “knocked off” in this process
                    would be removed from the reconciliation statement for the following month. Luo
                    would extract the information from the Accounts Payables Inquiry Application
                    (“APIA”) database and compile a table which summarised the
                    set-offs to be effected between the defendant, MTC and JHTI for a particular
                    month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     However, no documentary evidence was led to
                    show the genesis of the purported tripartite set-off agreement. MEPL argued that
                    the email correspondence wherein Ng or Luo would send Chai Lee monthly
                    reconciliation and/or “contra” statements (set-off statements) for
                    the period of December 2007 to November 2008 was evidence of a course of
                    dealings between MEPL, JHTI and MTC which gave rise to a tripartite set-off
                    agreement. MEPL relied, in particular, on the following emails. On
                    25 October 2008, Luo emailed Chai Lee to inform him that he had taken over
                    the job from Ng, for the “JHT[I] AR&amp;AP offset”. In an email
                    dated 28 October 2008, Luo informed Chai Lee that “for the dued
                        [<em>sic</em>] invoices as of 23 October 2008, it
                    is a net receivable from Motorola to JHT[I]”. Finally, there was another
                    email dated 24 November 2008 written by Luo to Chai Lee, attaching another
                    set-off statement, detailing the set-off of receivables against account payables
                    among the three entities effected on 21 November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     MEPL also relied strongly on three letters
                    dated 22 June 2007 which referred to the “on going [<em>sic</em>]” reconciliation exercise. The three
                    identical letters were sent to JHTI and another entity, Jurong Hi-Tech
                    Corporation (“JHTC”), (which relationship with JHTI is not clear
                    on the record), by Motorola Inc, MEPL and MTC respectively. The three letters
                    were identical and the purpose of the letters was to inform JHTI and JHTC about
                    the reconciliation exercise conducted. To each of these letters, a Final
                    Reconciliation Statement was attached. JHTI’s confirmation that no further
                    sums were owed by Motorola Inc to JHTI and JHTC was sought in these letters. As
                    the contents of the three identical letters are important to the question
                    whether an implied tripartite set-off agreement existed, we set out the
                    pertinent portions below:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">MEPL asserted at the trial that the existence of these three letters
                    was indicative of the existence of a course of dealing commencing from
                    5 July 2005 wherein the three parties, MEPL, MTC and JHTI regularly
                    effected tripartite set-offs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In response, Rabobank denied the existence of
                    the tripartite contractual set-off alleged by MEPL. Rabobank relied on the
                    evidence of its managing director for relationship management (from August 2005
                    to September 2009), Mr Richard Lee Seow Hong (“Richard Lee”).
                    On 11 November 2008, Richard Lee contacted Ms Lim Buay Eng Pauline
                    (“Pauline Lim”), MEPL’s Asia region credit director, to
                    inquire to whom in MEPL the notifications of assignments ought be sent, but
                    Richard Lee was not given any contact numbers. On 24 November 2008, after a
                    notification was sent on 17 November 2008 addressed to MEPL, Pauline Lim
                    informed Richard Lee that he could “attention” the assignments to
                    Mr Ng Beng Chong, who was the financial controller of MEPL at the material
                    time. When Richard Lee got in touch with Ng Beng Chong, the latter informed
                    Richard Lee that MEPL, MTC and JHTI had an existing tripartite set-off agreement
                    in place, and that MEPL would pay into a bank account in Rabobank as long as
                    JHTI instructed accordingly. Richard Lee then called Mr Chung Siang Joon
                    (“Chung”), JHTI’s finance director, to verify the existence
                    of the tripartite set-off agreement. In that phone call, Chung allegedly told
                    Richard Lee that it was MEPL who had unilaterally imposed a set-off against
                    JHTI, and that JHTI had persistently objected to the unilaterally imposed
                    set-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 25 November 2008, Rabobank’s
                    chief credit analyst, Mr Tan Wah Yam (“Tan”), Richard Lee and
                    several JHTI representatives had a meeting. At the meeting, JHTI representatives
                    once again asserted that MEPL had had liquidity problems since October 2008, and
                    had unilaterally imposed a set-off against JHTI. According to Richard Lee and
                    Tan, they were informed by JHTI representatives, its chairperson Joyce Lin, and
                    finance director, Chung, that no such set-off was allowed. This point was
                    reiterated again in two other meetings held on 3 December 2008 and
                    5 December 2008 respectively. It was only on 9 December 2008 that
                    Joyce Lin informed Rabobank that there might have been a mistake and that there
                    was a set-off arrangement in existence with MEPL. However, Rabobank was never
                    informed in all of those meetings that the set-off arrangement was tripartite in
                    nature involving MTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Although the case turned very much on whether
                    a tripartite agreement to set-off accounts involving MEPL, MTC and JHTI had been
                    made out, none of JHTI’s employees had been called as witnesses for the
                    trial by either Rabobank or MEPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Judge accepted that MEPL had made out its
                    defence that the receivables assigned by JHTI to Rabobank had been subject to a
                    set-off effected pursuant to the <em>implied</em>
                    tripartite agreement, and accordingly dismissed Rabobank’s claim. The
                    Judge held that the MRPA was a type of facultative agreement, which was only an
                    agreement to assign debts at a future point in time. Debts were assigned under
                    the MRPA only when purchase requests were submitted by JHTI and accepted by
                    Rabobank. Such assignments had to comply with s 4(8) of the Civil Law
                    Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed), which provides that an assignee of a debt or
                    chose in action takes subject to equities which existed prior to the date of
                    written notification to the debtor. The Judge held that since the set-offs
                    effected on 22 October 2008 and 17 November 2008 were prior to
                    25 November 2008, the date on which MEPL received notification of
                    assignment, the contractual set-offs amounted to prior equities to which
                    Rabobank took subject.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In coming to the conclusion that a tripartite
                    agreement to set-off existed, the Judge appeared to have accepted the
                    proposition that a low evidentiary threshold was applicable to determine whether
                    a set-off agreement should be implied. The Judge was satisfied that MEPL, MTC
                    and JHTI were at <em>consensus ad idem</em> since July
                    2005. She first held that the MSA ought to be read together with the three
                    letters dated 22 June 2007, referring to the “on going [<em>sic</em>]” reconciliation exercise between MEPL, MTC
                    and JHTI (see above, at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>). The Judge
                    referred to records of invoices, in particular JHTI’s accounts payables to
                    MTC from 23 August 2005 to 3 October 2009, read together with
                    JHTI’s accounts payables to MEPL from December 2004 to March 2009. She
                    also relied on set-off statements evidencing set-offs on 22 October 2008
                    and 21 November 2008, which were attached to correspondence between Luo and
                    Chai Lee at the time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In addition, we should also state that the
                    Judge relied on the following: (i) the correspondence between Luo and Chai Lee
                    dated 28 October 2008 which clearly stated that for “dued [<em>sic</em>] invoices dated 23 October 2008, it was a net
                    receivable from Motorola to JHT[I]” (see above, at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>) and which presupposed that the set-off had
                    already been effected; (ii) the correspondence between Luo and Ng on
                    22 October 2008 and 17 November 2008, proving the set-off of
                    JHTI’s debt to Motorola of $5,348,520.20 and $1,761,942.26 respectively;
                    (iii) the existence of credit and debit notes issued from MEPL to MTC and
                        <em>vice versa</em>, thus confirming Luo’s
                    account of the reconciliation process<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. Thus, the Judge accepted that
                    on the totality of the evidence before her, there was more than sufficient
                    evidence from which an ongoing tripartite contractual arrangement could be
                    implied, although the agreement was not embodied in any particular
                    document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Judge moreover held that since MEPL had
                    adduced more than sufficient evidence to prove the existence of an implied
                    tripartite agreement to set-off, there was no necessity for MEPL to call
                    JHTI’s personnel as witnesses to prove the same. The onus was on Rabobank
                    to call witnesses from JHTI to prove its assertion that it had been repeatedly
                    assured that there was no contractual set-off arrangement between the parties,
                    and it must suffer from the consequences of its failure to call witnesses in
                    support of its case. Thus, the alleged statements made by JHTI’s employees
                    to Richard Lee to the effect that there was no agreement to set-off between MEPL
                    and JHTI, as well as a judicial manager’s report to the same effect, were
                    excluded by the Judge as hearsay evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Since MEPL had made an offer to settle which
                    was rejected by Rabobank, the Trial Judge ordered costs against the latter on a
                    standard basis up to the date of the offer to settle, and indemnity costs
                    thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appellant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Rabobank argues that the Judge had erred in
                    several aspects. First, the Judge erred in finding that MEPL, MTC and JHTI were
                    at <em>consensus ad idem</em>. Secondly, and more
                    fundamentally, Rabobank submits that the Judge had erred in law by implying a
                    contract without having examined whether the parties showed any contractual
                    intention; while <em>consensus ad idem</em> is a necessary
                    prerequisite to the formation of a contract, it alone is not sufficient to
                    conclude that a contract has been entered into. Rabobank also contends that like
                    in the case of implied terms, the implication of a contract is permissible only
                    when it is necessary to do so. Rabobank submits that given that MEPL had entered
                    into elaborate and sophisticated written agreements with JHTI such as the MAA
                    and the MSA, it was incongruous to imply a separate unwritten agreement from the
                    parties conduct. Furthermore, the three letters of 22 June 2007, which
                    requested JHTI to “confirm [its] agreement with and acceptance of the
                    terms set out in this letter agreement” were inconsistent with
                    MEPL’s defence of a larger, overarching tripartite agreement entered into
                    between MEPL, MTC and JHTI on or about 5 July 2005 which would govern the
                    monthly set-offs between them. Given the gaping omission in the evidence adduced
                    by MEPL on the implied tripartite set-off contract that had allegedly
                    crystallized in 2005, Rabobank submits that the Judge had erred in finding that
                    MEPL had adduced “more than sufficient evidence” to discharge its
                    burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     It is also Rabobank’s contention that
                    the Judge had, in the circumstances, erred in holding that the burden had
                    shifted onto Rabobank to call witnesses from JHTI to disprove the existence of
                    the tripartite set-off agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The respondent’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     MEPL argues that the Judge did not err in law,
                    but rightly applied a lower evidentiary threshold towards the implication of an
                    implied contract to set-off from the parties’ course of dealing. While
                    MEPL accepts that contracts are not to be lightly implied, and must comply with
                    the contractual rules governing the formation of a contract, it nevertheless
                    contends that it was only just, on the facts, to imply a tripartite agreement to
                    set-off, giving effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties, who had
                    had a course of commercial dealings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     We note that at the hearing before us, counsel
                    for MEPL was unable to say for certain what the precise terms of the alleged
                    tripartite set-off agreement were. For instance, counsel for MEPL was unable to
                    tell the court under what conditions this purported agreement might be
                    terminated. Counsel for MEPL was also unable to indicate at which precise point
                    the alleged tripartite agreement to set-off arose. Nevertheless, MEPL urges the
                    court not to take an “overly mechanistic”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> approach, insisting on
                    “ideal” or “perfect” documentation, or to rigidly
                    adhere to the legal requirements for the formation of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     MEPL moreover avers that although it bore the
                    legal burden of proving its defence on a balance of probabilities, it had
                    adduced credible evidence establishing the existence of a defence to the claim,
                    which shifted the evidential burden to Rabobank, whose failure to adduce
                    rebuttal evidence was fatal to its claim. MEPL says that even without the
                    testimony of JHTI personnel, the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to
                    discharge its burden of proof. MEPL urges this court to read the written
                    agreements, <em>ie</em>, the MAA and MSA, together with the
                    documentary evidence and the testimony of its witnesses, Lakshamanan and Ng, and
                    to hold that on the totality of the evidence, the court ought to imply that a
                    tripartite set-off agreement existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     We will first deal with the preliminary issue
                    of whether Rabobank or MEPL bore the burden of proving the existence of the
                    tripartite set-off agreement. Thereafter, we will examine two related issues of
                    what is the requisite standard of proof to establish an implied contract for
                    tripartite set-offs, and whether in this case the party on whom the onus of
                    proof lay has adduced sufficient evidence to prove such a
                contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether MEPL or Rabobank bore the burden of proving a
                defence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">General principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is now trite law that there is a
                    distinction between the legal and evidential burden of proof. This court has
                    explained the distinction between the two concepts in <em>Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East Ltd</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 855 (“<em>Britestone</em>”) at [58]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">58    The term “burden of proof” is more
                            properly used with reference to the obligation to prove. There are in
                            fact two kinds of burden in relation to the adduction of evidence. The
                            first, designated the legal burden of proof, is, properly speaking, a
                            burden of proof, for it describes the obligation to persuade the trier
                            of fact that, in view of the evidence, the fact in dispute exists. The
                            obligation never shifts in respect of any fact, and only
                            “shifts” in a manner of loose terminology when a legal
                            presumption operates. The second is a burden of proof only loosely
                            speaking, for it falls short of an obligation to prove that a particular
                            fact exists. It is more accurately designated the evidential burden to
                            produce evidence since, whenever it operates, the failure to adduce some
                            evidence, whether in propounding or rebutting, will mean a failure to
                            engage the question of the existence of a particular fact or to keep
                            this question alive. As such, this burden can and will
                        shift.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Sections 103 and 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev
                    Ed) (“Evidence Act”), which place the burden of proving a fact on
                    the party who asserts the existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact
                    respectively, concern the legal rather than the evidential burden of proof. The
                    evidential burden, whilst not expressly provided for in the Evidence Act, exists
                    in the form of a tactical onus to contradict, weaken or explain away the
                    evidence that has been led: <em>Britestone</em>, at [59].
                    It is the latter form of burden which may shift from one party to the
                    other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In civil trials, the pleadings are central in
                    determining the occurrence of the burden of proof, because the pleadings state
                    the material facts establishing the legal elements of a claim or a defence:
                    Pinsler, <em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2010) at para 12.33;
                        <em>Phipson on Evidence</em> (Hodge M Malek gen
                    ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 17<sup>th</sup> ed, 2009)
                        (“<em>Phipson</em>”) at para 6-06.
                    The <em>legal</em> burden of proving a pleaded defence
                    rests on the proponent of the defence, unless the defence is a bare denial of
                    the claim: <em>Currie v Dempsey</em> [1967]
                    2 NSWR 532 at 539, followed by the Singapore High Court in <em>Wee Yue Chew v Su Sh-Hsyu</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 212
                        (“<em>Wee Yue Chew</em>”) at [3]. This
                    rule is consistent with the general principle underlying ss 103 and 105 of the
                    Evidence Act, <em>viz</em>, that he who asserts must prove.
                    As stated by Lord Maugham in <em>Constantine Line v Imperial
                        Smelting Corporation</em> [1942] AC 154 (“<em>Constantine</em>”) at 174:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The burden of proof in any particular case depends on the circumstances in
                        which the claim arises. In general the rule which applies is
                            “<em>Ei qui affirmat non ei qui negat incumbit
                            probatio</em>”. It is an ancient rule founded on
                        considerations of good sense and it should not be departed from without
                        strong reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We also refer to the commentary in <em>Phipson</em> on the above statement by Lord Maugham (at
                    para 6-06):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This rule is adopted principally because it is just that he who invokes
                        the aid of the law should be the first to prove his case; and partly
                        because, in the nature of things, a negative is more difficult to establish
                        than an affirmative. The burden of proof is fixed at the beginning of a
                        trial by the state of the pleadings, and it is settled as a question of law,
                        remaining unchanged throughout the trial exactly where the pleadings place
                        it, and never shifting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     However, in deciding whether a party is
                    asserting an affirmative, regard must be had to the substance of the issue, and
                    not merely to the manner in which a fact is grammatically stated in the
                    pleadings: <em>Phipson</em> at para 6-06. We find
                    helpful the observations made by Rix LJ in <em>BHP Billiton
                        Petroleum Ltd v Dalmine SpA</em> [2003] EWCA Civ 170
                        (“<em>BHP Billiton</em>”) at [28]
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... we think, with Lord Maugham [in <em>Constantine</em>], that the pleadings are likely to be a more
                        accurate guide to where the burden lies. It is true that they cannot be
                        definitive, for a party does not, we think, take upon himself a burden which
                        the law does not impose on him merely by volunteering a pleading which he
                        could properly have covered by a mere denial; nor will a claimant free
                        himself from a burden of proof which rests on him merely by pleading his
                        case inadequately. However, in most cases the pleadings are likely to be a
                        good guide, and <em>a fortiori</em> where, as here, no
                        one has been able to complain that the pleadings have fallen below the
                        mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>BHP Billiton</em>, a defendant consultant
                    had certified as compliant with the plaintiff’s specifications certain
                    pipes which had been manufactured by a third party for the plaintiff under a
                    contract for the purposes of erecting a pipeline. However, the manufacturer in
                    fact supplied the plaintiff with non-compliant steel pipes. It was not in issue
                    that the defendant had made a fraudulent misrepresentation to the plaintiff. The
                    issue was whether the defendant’s fraudulent misrepresentation had caused
                    the plaintiff’s loss, and whether the plaintiff bore the burden of proving
                    causation. The English Court of Appeal held that the court should eschew an
                    over-technical approach, and construe the pleadings to determine which party was
                    affirmatively asserting a particular fact, in order to determine on whom the
                    burden of proof lay. Since the defendant’s pleaded defence was that a
                    pipeline built with compliant pipes would have failed in any event, the English
                    Court of Appeal held that the pleaded defence was an affirmative which the
                    defendant had to prove. <em>BHP Billiton</em>, in our view,
                    is therefore illustrative of the principle that pleadings are central in
                    determining the occurrence of the burden of proof in any case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The burden of proving the tripartite set-off agreement in the present
                case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We now turn to construe the pleadings of the
                    parties in the present appeal. Rabobank did not make any mention of the
                    tripartite contractual set-off agreement in its pleadings, given that it was
                    only making a straightforward claim for the repayment of a debt in its capacity
                    as an assignee. In MEPL’s defence it pleaded the existence of a tripartite
                    agreement between MEPL, MTC and JHTI, and that set-offs pursuant to this
                    tripartite contract amounted to prior equities to which the receivables which
                    Rabobank took were subject. In this regard, it is necessary to scrutinise the
                    relevant portions of MEPL’s Defence (Amendment No. 2) to determine whether
                    the burden of proof fell upon it. The relevant portions are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    There was an express and/or implied agreement
                            between [MEPL], [MTC] and [JHTI], to set-off, on a monthly basis, the
                            sums owing by [MEPL] and MTC to [JHTI], being payment for the sale by
                            [JHTI] of electronic products under the MSA, against sums owing by
                            [JHTI] to [MEPL] and MTC, being payment for materials and components
                            supplied by [MEPL] and MTC to [JHTI] under the MSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">c. On or around 5 July 2005, MTC also began to supply materials and
                            components to, and purchase electronic products from, [JHTI]. <em>Since then, sums owing to and by [MEPL] and MTC to [JHTI]
                                were set-off, on a monthly basis, against sums owing to and by
                                [JHTI] to [MEPL] and MTC</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">d. The set-offs typically took place in the last 10 days of each
                            month. In particular, the set-offs which took place between [MEPL], MTC
                            and [JHTI] on 22 October 2008 and 21 November 2008 included, but were
                            not limited to, sums that were due from [MEPL] to [JHTI] under various
                            invoices...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Also, at paragraph 10a of the Defence (Amendment No. 2), MEPL averred
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [MEPL] is not liable to Rabobank for sums owing under the invoices...
                        totalling US$5,160,853.21, since the sums which were owed by [MEPL] to
                        [JHTI] under these invoices had already been set-off against the sums owed
                        by [JHTI] to [MEPL] and/or MTC on or around 22 October 2008 and 21 November
                        2008 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Thus, it would be seen that MEPL has asserted
                    affirmatively the following facts in its defence:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that an express/implied agreement to contractually
                            set-off debts on a tripartite basis existed;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that such an agreement was validly
                        formed;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that set-offs pursuant to the tripartite
                            contract which extinguished the debts due to Rabobank were effected
                            prior to the dates of notification of assignment; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">iv)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the receivables which Rabobank took from
                            JHTI were subject to prior equities, <em>ie</em>,
                            the set-offs.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Since MEPL’s defence was not one of bare denial, but the
                    assertion of a state of facts, MEPL bore the legal burden of proving the
                    existence of such facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What is the standard of proof in a case involving contractual
                set-off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     We now turn to the issue of whether MEPL has
                    adduced sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of proof. We would state
                    that the standard of proof required of MEPL to prove the defence of an implied
                    tripartite agreement of set-off was no different from proof of a fact in any
                    other civil claims. Before proceeding on to our analysis proper, we would refer
                    to Lord Brandon’s statement in the House of Lords’ decision of
                        <em>Rhesa Shipping Co SA v Edmunds (The Popi M)</em>
                    [1985] 1 WLR 948, with which we are in full agreement (at 955 -
                    956):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No judge likes to decide cases on the burden of proof if he can
                        legitimately avoid having to do so. There are cases, however, in which,
                        owing to the unsatisfactory state of the evidence or otherwise, deciding on
                        the burden of proof is the only just course to take.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We note that under ss 3(3) – (5) of the Evidence Act, there are
                    three possible conclusions which a court assessing the evidence before it may
                    make, <em>viz</em>, that a fact is proved, disproved, or
                    not proved, respectively. Where the evidence suffices to satisfy the court that
                    a fact exists, that fact will be held to have been proved. Conversely, where the
                    evidence suffices to satisfy the court as to the <em>non-existence</em> of a particular fact, that fact will be held to
                    have been disproved: <em>Loo Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo,
                        deceased</em> [2010] 1 SLR 286, at [22]. However, the
                    court is not bound to make a choice between finding that a fact is either proved
                    or disproved. It is open to the court to select a third option, <em>i.e</em>., that a fact is not proved. A statement that a fact
                    is not proved simply means that the court is unable to state affirmatively the
                    existence or non-existence of a particular fact given the state of the evidence:
                        <em>ibid</em> at [20].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The evidentiary threshold applicable to contracts to
                set-off</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On the face of the judgment, it was not clear
                    whether the Judge preferred the view that only slight evidence was required to
                    prove the existence of a set-off agreement, or that contracts ought not to be
                    lightly implied, two quite distinct concepts. The Judge first quoted the
                    following statement made by the Master of the Rolls, Sir Jekyll in the rather
                    dated decision of the Chancery Court, <em>Jeffs v Wood</em>
                    [1723] 2 P Wms 128 (“<em>Jeffs v Woods”</em>)
                    at 129:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true, stoppage [the historical term for set-off] is no payment at
                        law, nor is it, of itself, a payment in equity, but then a very slender
                        agreement for discounting or allowing the one debt out of the other, will
                        make it a payment, because this prevents circuity of action and multiplicity
                        of suits, which is not favoured in law, much less in equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...<em>the least evidence of an agreement for a stoppage
                            will do</em> ... and in these cases <em>equity will
                            take hold of a very slight thing to do both parties right</em>.
                        And it is still more reasonable, that where the matter of the mutual demand
                        is concerning the same thing, there the Court should interpose, and make the
                        balance only payable. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Judge then cited <em>Wallis
                        v Bastard</em> (1853) 4 De G M &amp; G 251 (“<em>Wallis v Bastard</em>”) for the following proposition of law
                    laid down by Lord Cranworth LC at 257:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This much, however, I think may be stated as a very safe proposition, that
                        the principle of set-off is quite consistent with natural equity, and that
                        where it can be adopted, <em>it is an arrangement which this
                            Court will be very ready to assist</em>, while it will look to any
                        circumstances that occurred at the time when persons became reciprocally
                        indebted, in order to say that a set-off did in fact take place. In the
                        present case, from the circumstance that possession was taken in 1842 by the
                        mortgagee, and that no claim was made for interest by either party, I infer
                        that, <em>whether expressed or not, it was the agreement
                            perfectly understood between the parties that the one debt should wipe
                            off a portion of the other debt;</em> in effect, that there should
                            <em>pro tanto</em> be a set-off. I do not,
                        therefore, feel called upon to speculate as to the exact course this Court
                        would have pursued if the parties had, in the year 1842, adversely asserted
                        against each other their mutual rights; but not having done so, they must be
                        understood, like reasonable persons, to have adopted an arrangement
                        perfectly obvious and in conformity with what ought to have been
                        done.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge also relied on <em>Lundy v McCulla</em>
                    (1865) 11 Gr 368, where it was held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In the view of equity</em> the setting off one
                        demand against another between the same parties is extremely just; and where
                        there is any technical difficulty in the way of its being done without an
                        agreement, the court <em>accepts slighter evidence of such an
                            agreement than is usually required in order to establish disputed
                            facts</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     After citing the above authority for the
                    proposition that a low evidential threshold is needed to show the existence of
                    an agreement to set-off, the Judge went on to state (at [64] – [65] of her
                    judgment) that a contract to set-off is but a species of contract, which ought
                    to be subject to the normal contractual rules such as offer and acceptance,
                    consideration, certainty of terms and intention to create legal relations. The
                    Judge then referred to Peel, <em>Treitel on the Law of
                        Contract</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2007) (“<em>Trietel</em>”) at para 4-021, for the proposition
                    that contracts were not to be lightly implied. With respect, we would at this
                    juncture observe that “a low evidential threshold” to prove an
                    implied agreement to set-off is hardly consistent with the principle that a
                    contract should not be lightly implied. Indeed, it is settled law that a
                    contract will only be implied if it is necessary to do so: see <em>The Aramis</em> per Bingham LJ at 224; <em>Baird Textiles Ltd v Marks &amp; Spencer plc</em> [2002] 1

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     We also note that unfortunately, a great deal
                    of uncertainty exists in the area of the law of set-off. In <em>OCWS Logistics Pte Ltd v Soon Meng Construction Pte Ltd</em> [1998]
                    3 SLR(R) 888, the High Court has set out the historical context of the
                    development of the law of set-off (at [7]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The development of the law of set-off is far from satisfactory. Before
                        1873 two main sets of courts could claim jurisdiction over the same cause of
                        action. However, they applied different rules. One applied common law and
                        the other applied equity. The common law courts were less receptive to
                        set-off than courts of equity ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Following the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vict c
                    66) (UK), the courts of law and equity were fused, and equitable defences could
                    be relied upon in actions at law, although the concepts of law and equity
                    remained distinct: <em>Pacific Rim Investments Pte Ltd v Lam Seng
                        Tiong and another</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 643
                        (“<em>Pacific Rim</em>”) at
                [25].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In Meagher, Gummow and Lehane, <em>Equity: Doctrines and Remedies</em> (Butterworths LexisNexis,
                        4<sup>th</sup> Edition, 2002), four types of set-offs
                    recognised in equity are identified at para 37-035 (also recognised in
                    Young, Croft and Smith, <em>On Equity</em> (Lawbook Co,
                    2009) at 993 – 995). They are:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">where a right of set-off exists at law, it will
                            be recognised in equity;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an equitable set-off will exist by analogy with
                            a legal set-off;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">an equitable set-off may exist by agreement;

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(iv)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">where a party can show some equitable ground for
                            being protected against his adversary’s demand.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The first is a species of equitable set-off and is no more than an
                    illustration of the general principle that all legal rights, titles and
                    interests are recognised in equity, while the second illustrates the principle
                    that equity follows the law. The third is markedly different from the fourth,
                    which is also known as the “substantive” form of equitable
                    set-off: see generally Rory Derham, <em>The Law of
                        Set-off</em> (Oxford University Press, 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    ed, 2003) (“<em>Rory Derham</em>”) at chapter
                    4. In the third form of set-off, equity will take hold of very slight evidence
                    of an agreement to set-off in order to establish a right to set-off between the
                    two parties to an action. This is in order to do justice between the two parties
                    who have had mutual dealings, and where it would be unjust to permit one party
                    to make a claim against another without allowing a set-off: see <em>Jeffs v Wood</em> (above, at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>), <em>Wallis v Bastard</em> (above, at
                        <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>) and Phillip Wood, <em>English and International Set-Off</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    1989) (“<em>Wood</em>”) at para 5-12.
                    The equitable set-off of the fourth variety, on the other hand, arises when a
                    claim and counterclaim arise out of the same set of facts and are so closely
                    connected that it would be inequitable not to allow a set-off: <em>Pacific Rim</em> (above, at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     We refer also to <em>Rory
                        Derham</em>, at para 3.03, where the author recognises that a
                    set-off by implied agreement in the case of insufficient evidence to prove a
                    contractual set-off is equitable in nature:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An equitable set-off can take a number of forms. There are some early
                        cases in which debts were set-off in equity based upon an implied agreement
                        that a set-off should occur, and indeed Sir Joseph Jekyll once said that
                        “the least evidence of an agreement for a [set-off] will do”,
                        and that “equity will take hold of a very slight thing to do both
                        parties right”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The author relied on the New Zealand decision
                    of <em>Commercial Factors Ltd v Maxwell Printing Ltd</em>
                    [1994] 1 NZLR 724. In that case, which was one of the cases which the
                    Judge here had placed much reliance, two parties entered into a cheque swapping
                    arrangement for a monthly settlement of their mutual dealings. Pursuant to the
                    arrangement, either party could refuse to provide a cheque in respect of its
                    indebtedness if it was not at the same time provided with a cheque in respect of
                    what was owed to it. Hammond J held (at 740) that an implied contract to
                    set-off mutual debts was made out on a balance of probabilities. However,
                    Hammond J stated that even if such an arrangement could not amount to a
                    contract at law, or a contract <em>strictu sensu</em>, it
                    nevertheless was an arrangement that equity would recognise. Hammond J did
                    not conflate the legal requirements for proof of a contractual set-off with an
                    equitable set-off which arose by an implied agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Reverting to the Judge’s judgment of the
                    present case, no distinction was made by the Judge between the rules applicable
                    under the common law of contractual set-off, and those applicable to equitable
                    set-off. The Judge appeared to have treated <em>Jeffs v
                        Wood</em> as authority for the proposition that all contracts for
                    set-off are subject to a lower standard of proof. However, <em>Jeffs v Wood</em> was in fact a case falling within the third
                    category of equitable set-off (see <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>
                    above), and was not authority for the modification of the common law on the
                    standard of proof required to establish the existence of a contract to set-off.
                        <em>Jeffs v Wood</em> was really concerned with the
                    imposition of an equitable set-off against the plaintiff, because it would be
                    unjust to ignore the defendant’s cross-claim against the plaintiff. A
                    court of equity would impose such an equitable set-off in the presence of slight
                    evidence to ameliorate the harshness of the strict legal requirement of proof of
                    a contract or agreement to set-off, implied or otherwise, even where there was
                    in fact no such contract or agreement. The present case, however, is not such a
                    situation. It concerns sophisticated and large commercial parties (indeed MEPL
                    and its parent company are a multinational group) which have earlier defined
                    their rights and obligations in relation to their dealings in clear written
                    documents (<em>eg</em> the MAA and the MSA), or in
                    correspondence. In this regard we are reminded of the following general comment
                    made by the Privy Council in the case of <em>Meates v Westpac
                        Banking Corporation Ltd</em> [1991] 3 NZLR 385 at 404 where
                    their Lordships stated at 404:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To say that, as a general rule, governments and large corporations intend
                        to be bound only by formal written engagements assumed after matured
                        consideration, reflection and negotiations may seem something of a
                        truism.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Moreover, we must not lose sight of the fact that here, we are
                    concerned with setting-off of debts not as between two parties (JHTI and MEPL)
                    but three, the third being MTC. While the Judge did at [64] note that the
                    aforesaid cases, which she also considered, dealt with bilateral set-offs rather
                    than tripartite set-offs (like in the present case), she nevertheless took the
                    view that the “low evidential threshold in implying a contractual set-off
                    agreement” which those cases expounded still applied to tripartite
                    set-off because in both scenarios, the court is being asked to imply a contract.
                    She relied, <em>inter alia</em>, upon para 4-021 of
                        <em>Treitel</em> to reach this view, which we now
                    quote:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question of contractual intention is, in the last resort, one of fact.
                        In deciding it, a distinction must be drawn between implied and express
                        agreements. Claims based on implied agreements are approached on the basis
                        that “contracts are not to be lightly implied and that the court must
                        therefore be able to “conclude with confidence that ... the parties
                        intended to create contractual relations”. The burden of proof on
                        this issue is on the proponent of the implied contract …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">But nothing in this passage suggests that “slight
                    evidence” is sufficient to imply a contract. Indeed, on the contrary, the
                    passage says that a contract should not be lightly implied (see also comment in
                        <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above).To imply a contract the
                    court must be confident that the parties intended to create contractual
                    relations. Cases such as <em>Jeffs v Wood</em> and
                        <em>Lundy v McCulla</em> were decided on equitable
                    principles in the factual context of two parties who had mutual debts. A case
                    involving tripartite set-off is distinguishable from cases such as <em>Jeffs v Wood</em> and <em>Lundy v
                        McCulla</em> in which it would have been unjust not to imply an
                    agreement to set-off, despite only slight evidence to that effect, between two
                    parties who owed mutual debts. In a tripartite situation where Company A owes a
                    debt to Company B who in turns owes a debt to Company C, it is not at all clear
                    why it would be unjust <em>not</em> to invoke equitable
                    principles for the implication of a set-off agreement among all three parties.
                    Company B could well have intended for Company A to be its debtor at law. Thus,
                    we are of the view that a court should be slow to, and indeed should not apply
                        <em>Jeffs v Wood</em> to a case where different
                    circumstances and different considerations prevail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The applicable standard of proof on the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In this appeal, counsel for MEPL has conceded,
                    in our view quite rightly, that it bore the legal burden of proving the
                    existence of a tripartite agreement on set-off on a balance of probabilities.
                    For the reasons stated above, as the Judge had in fact applied the
                    “slight evidence” threshold, we are of the view that she has, with
                    respect, erred. We ought to mention that the pleaded case of MEPL for a right of
                    tripartite set-off is based on express or implied contract, (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above) not on equity. Moreover, for the
                    reasons alluded to in [43], we do not think the equity expounded in <em>Jeffs v Wood</em> can apply here. In any event, it is trite
                    law that equitable defences must be specifically pleaded, and full particulars
                    given: <em>Singapore Civil Procedure</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell Asia, 2007) (“<em>White Book</em>”)
                    at p 270; <em>Singapore Court Practice</em>
                    (LexisNexis, 2009) at p 411. We are of the view that a defence of equitable
                    set-off is a matter which must also be specifically pleaded: see <em>White Book</em> at para 18/8/34. It seems to us that the
                    requirement that an equitable set-off be specifically pleaded is but an
                    application of the rule in O 18 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), the object of which is to prevent unfair
                    surprise to an opponent in litigation. O 18 r 8(1) states:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We now turn to examine the issue of whether
                    MEPL has proven the existence of such a valid implied contract, <em>ie</em>, a contract which satisfies all the elements for the

                    a course of conduct or dealings between the parties or from correspondence or
                    all relevant circumstances. However, facts supporting the existence of implied
                    contracts should be subject to the same level of scrutiny as express contracts.
                        <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        30<sup>th</sup> ed, 2008) Vol 1 (“<em>Chitty on Contracts</em>”), states at para 1-076
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Contracts may either be express or implied. The difference is not one of
                        legal effect but simply of the way in which the consent of the parties is
                        manifested. Contracts are express when their terms are stated in words by
                        the parties. They are often said to be implied when their terms are not so
                        stated, as, for example, when a passenger is permitted to board a bus: from
                        the conduct of the parties the law implies a promise by the passenger to pay
                        the fare, and a promise by the operator of the bus to carry him safely to
                        his destination ... Express and implied contracts are both contracts in the
                        true sense of the term, for they both arise from the agreement of the
                        parties, though in one case the agreement is manifested in words and in the
                        other case by conduct. Since, as we have seen, agreement is not a mental
                        state but an act, an inference from conduct, and since many of the terms of
                        an express contract are often implied, it follows that the distinction
                        between express and implied contracts have little importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is also stated in <em>Trietel</em> that where
                    it is alleged that an implied agreement exists, the court will scrutinise the
                    facts to determine whether there was an intention on the part of the parties to
                    create legal relations and here we would again cite the passage (at
                    p 186):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question of contractual intention is, in the last resort, one of fact.
                        In deciding it, a distinction must be drawn between implied and express
                        agreements. Claims based on implied agreements are approached on the basis
                        that “contracts are not to be lightly implied” and that the
                        court must therefore be able to conclude with confidence that... the parties
                        intended to create contractual relations”. The burden of proof on
                        this issue is on the proponent of the implied contract, and in a number of
                        cases claims or defences based on implied contracts have been rejected
                        precisely on the ground that contractual intention had not been shown by
                        that party to exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This passage in <em>Treitel</em> is based on the
                    comments of Bingham LJ in the <em>locus classicus</em>
                    on implied contracts, <em>Blackpool and Fylde Aero Club v
                        Blackpool Borough Council</em> [1990] 1 WLR 1195, where he
                    stated that (at 1202):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I readily accept that <em>contracts are not to be lightly
                            implied</em>. Having examined what the parties said and did, the
                        court must be able to conclude with confidence both that the parties
                        intended to create contractual relations and that the agreement was to the
                        effect contended for. It must also, in most cases, be able to answer the
                        question posed by Mustill L.J. in <em>Hispanica de Petroles
                            S.A. v. Vencedora Oceanica Navegacion S.A. (No. 2) (Note)</em>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, all the requirements for the formation of a contract,
                        <em>viz</em>, offer and acceptance, consideration,
                    intention to create legal relations, and certainty of terms must be satisfied
                    before the court will imply the existence of a contract: <em>Modahl v British Athletic Federation Ltd</em> [2002]

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Of course, the existence of offer and
                    acceptance may be implied from conduct. The implication of contracts in the
                    absence of direct evidence of an offer or an acceptance is permissible, because
                    the parties’ conduct may demonstrate <em>consensus ad

                    example, in <em>British Bank for Foreign Trade v
                        Novinex</em> [1949] 1 KB 623, the defendant wrote a letter
                    to the plaintiff to introduce a client who was interested in purchasing oilskin
                    suits from the defendant. In return, the defendant promised to pay the plaintiff
                    a certain amount of commission on all trades on oilskins with the client.
                    Following from the introduction, the defendant traded with the plaintiff’s
                    client in oilskins, and other products. The defendant refused to pay commission
                    on those other trades (other than on oilskin), on the ground that the parties
                    had not agreed on the quantum of commission for those trades. However,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I turn next to the main question: Is this an enforceable agreement? A
                        number of authorities have been cited to us, to which I do not propose to
                        refer in detail, because, in my view, the effect of the authorities is
                        stated correctly in the learned judge's judgment where he said: “The
                        principle to be deduced from the cases is that if there is an essential term
                        which has yet to be agreed and there is no express or implied provision for
                        its solution, the result in point of law is that there is no binding
                        contract. In seeing whether there is an implied provision for its solution,
                        however, there is a difference between an arrangement which is wholly
                        executory on both sides, and one which has been executed on one side or the
                        other. In the ordinary way, if there is an arrangement to supply goods at a
                        price 'to be agreed,' or to perform services on terms 'to be agreed,' then
                        although, while the matter is still executory, there may be no binding
                        contract, nevertheless, if it is executed on one side, that is if the one
                        does his part without having come to an agreement as to the price or the
                        terms, <em>then the law will say that there is necessarily
                            implied, from the conduct of the parties, a contract that, in default of
                            agreement, a reasonable sum is to be paid</em>.” With that
                        statement of the principle of law, I respectfully agree. My difference with
                        the learned judge is only on the question whether he has correctly applied
                        that statement of principle to the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Principles similar to those outlined in the
                    preceding paragraphs have been applied in the Straits Settlements as early as
                    1878. In <em>Mcgregor v Tanjong Pagar Dock Co Ltd</em>
                    [1878] 1 Ky 461, certain wharfingers unloaded goods due for another
                    port by mistake. The wharfingers were engaged by the vessel owners on an
                    informal basis. This mistake was not notified to the vessel owner in a timely
                    manner. As a result, the vessel owner sustained huge losses, and commenced
                    proceedings against the wharfingers. The Straits Settlements Supreme Court held
                    the wharfingers liable for breaching the implied contract between them and the
                    vessel owner. The contract contained a term that the wharfingers were to use
                    reasonable care and skill in unloading the goods from the vessels owned by the
                    plaintiff, and to inform them within a reasonable time if any goods were
                    unloaded by mistake. The Straits Settlements Supreme Court stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... To use the words of Lord Tenterden, CJ, however, in
                            <em>Mazette v Williams</em> 1 B &amp; Ad
                        423:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“The only difference between an express and implied contract is
                            the mode, of substantiating it. An express contract is proved by an
                            actual agreement, an implied contract by circumstances and the general
                            course of dealing between the parties; but where a contract is once
                            proved, the consequences resulting from the breach of it must be the
                            same, whether it be proved by direct or circumstantial
                            evidence.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     More recently, in <em>Tribune
                        Investment Trust Inc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd</em>
                    [2000] 2 SLR(R) 407, this court considered the question of
                    whether a contract may be inferred from correspondence and contemporaneous
                    conduct of the parties in the absence of an express written agreement and stated
                    (at [40]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principles of law relating to the formation of contracts are clear.
                        Indeed the task of inferring an assent and of extracting the precise moment,
                        if at all there was one, at which a meeting of the minds between the parties
                        may be said to have been reached is one of obvious difficulty, particularly
                        in a case where there has been protracted negotiations and a considerable
                        exchange of written correspondence between the parties. Nevertheless, the
                        function of the court is to try as far as practical experience allows, to
                        ensure that the reasonable expectations of honest men are not disappointed.
                        To this end, it is also trite law that the test of agreement or of inferring
                            <em>consensus ad idem</em> is objective. Thus, the
                        language used by one party, whatever his real intention may be, is to be
                        construed in the sense in which it would reasonably be understood by the
                        other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In summary, while the outcome of each case
                    would necessarily depend on the fact situation of the case, the above analysis
                    shows that a contract implied from conduct must satisfy all the elements
                    necessary for the formation of a contract, including, offer and acceptance,
                    consideration, intention to create legal relations, and certainty of terms. As
                    stated in paragraph 5-17 of <em>Wood</em> (above, at
                        <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a>), a passage also cited by the
                    Judge;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A contract to set-off must satisfy the normal contractual rules as to
                        formation of contract, eg, offer and acceptance and communication of the
                        acceptance, as to whether an offer is merely an invitation to treat, and as
                        to certainty of terms and contractual intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, the mechanism for offer and acceptance may be conduct rather
                    than an express written or oral agreement. In a case where the court is faced
                    with a claim that an agreement has been entered into by conduct, it ought to
                    scrutinise the evidence before it carefully to determine whether the existence
                    of a contract, compliant with all the requirements for contract formation, has
                    been proven on a balance of probabilities. In other words, all the surrounding
                    circumstances must be considered objectively to determine whether or not a
                    contract may properly be implied. No assumptions should be made, since contracts
                    are not to be “lightly implied”. We would hasten to add that the
                    fact that the existence of a contract may be implied from conduct does not mean
                    that the legal requirement of offer and acceptance in the formation of a
                    contract is in any way compromised. This is no more than recognition that offer
                    and acceptance may be manifested in a variety of forms. Cooke J in
                        <em>Meates v Attorney</em>-<em>General</em> [1983] NZLR 308 aptly put the position as
                    follows (at 377):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I would not treat difficulties in analysing the dealings into a strict
                        classification of offer and acceptance as necessarily decisive in this
                        field, although any difficulty on that head is a factor telling against a
                        contract. The acid test in the case like the present is whether, viewed as a
                        whole and objectively from the point of view of a reasonable person on both
                        sides, the dealings show a concluded bargain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Judge erred in finding that there was sufficient evidence
                to justify the implication of a tripartite set-off agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     We have noted that MEPL has adduced voluminous
                    documentary evidence in the form of email correspondence between MEPL and MTC as
                    well as emails between MEPL or MTC and JHTI, and reconciliation and set-off
                    statements during the period from January 2008 to November 2008. However, the
                    emails between MEPL and JHTI evidenced reconciliation of accounts and set-offs
                    between them but nothing in these emails shows a tripartite arrangement for
                    set-off which also involved MTC. The communications between MTC and JHTI were to
                    similar effect. As the proponent of a defence that an agreement to set-off
                    indebtedness on a monthly and tripartite basis existed from 5 July 2005,
                    the burden was on MEPL to prove that such a tripartite set-off contract was
                    indeed formed, had been regarded as binding, was complied with by the parties
                    and had remained in force as at the date of the purported set-offs in question,
                        <em>ie</em>, 22 October 2008 and 21 November
                    2008. MEPL’s focus on showing to the court that the parties had taken
                    steps to seek a set-off on a tripartite basis on these two material dates were
                    insufficient to discharge its burden of proof. Two occasions of attempted
                    set-off in late 2008, when things were turning bad for JHTI could hardly be
                    adequate proof of an agreement which was supposed to have originated in July
                    2005. We do not see any evidence of the assertion that the tripartite set-offs
                    were carried out on a monthly basis from July 2005. Only some isolated credit
                    and debit invoices with the corresponding credit and debit note request forms
                    dated June 2008 were produced. The excuse was made that MEPL did not want to
                    inundate the court with voluminous documentation and thus only produced the
                    recent ones and just those alone amounted to 43 arch-lever files. Of course the
                    court would not expect the parties to produce every document generated during
                    that period. But the court would have expected, bearing in mind the issues
                    brought out in the pleadings, that only the most relevant documents to the
                    issues, which show how the alleged implied agreement in July 2005 came about,
                    should and need be produced. Selective production of pertinent documents over
                    the entire period, from July 2005 to November 2008, should have been the course
                    adopted. That was not done and the court cannot help but conclude that there
                    were really no helpful documents during the relevant period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Interestingly, reliance is placed by MEPL on
                    the three letters dated 22 June 2007 (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above) as evidence of the implied agreement. We say
                    “interestingly” because these three letters had not been produced
                    by MEPL, but rather by Rabobank who obtained them from JHTI’s judicial
                    managers. In any case, we are unable to see how they could be regarded as
                    evidence of a tripartite agreement for set-off from July 2005. First, we note
                    that the letter referred to the reconciliation exercise as being “over
                    the past few weeks”. Second, this exercise was in respect of services and
                    products “up to and including 7 May 2007”, a specific date;
                    nothing suggested that it was a monthly exercise. Third, each party agreed to
                    treat the financial statement pursuant to the exercise as final and that no
                    further claims would be made by any party in respect of any matter covered by
                    the exercise. We must observe that there was nothing in this letter to suggest
                    that the reconciliation exercise was pursuant to any prior understanding or
                    agreement between the three parties. On the contrary, its entire tone would
                    suggest that it was a one-off exercise. Fourth, it is strange that if there was
                    in existence a tripartite agreement, why did MEPL and MTC (and even Motorola
                    Inc) write separately to JHTI on 22 June 2007? It should have been a joint
                    letter by MEPL and MTC to JHTI. Fifth, Lakshamanan had conceded in his testimony
                    in court that the three letters were not evidence of a broader agreement, given
                    that none of the three letters expressly incorporated the three parties, JHTI,
                    MEPL and MTC. Each letter at best formed a separate agreement between Motorola
                    Inc, MEPL and MTC respectively with JHTI and JHTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We would, in this regard, point out that if,
                    as alleged by MEPL, there was an implied tripartite set-off agreement between
                    MEPL and MTC on the one side and JHTI on the other from July 2005, one would
                    have expected the parties to incorporate the implied agreement into the MSA, a
                    formal document executed some eight months later on 28 March 2006. The MSA
                    defined the rights and obligations governing the commercial relationship between
                    Motorola Inc and its affiliates on the one part and JHTI and its affiliates on
                    the other. That would have been the natural and logical thing to do. Instead,
                    that was not done. Not only is the test of necessity to imply a contract not
                    satisfied, this fact indeed militates against there being in existence an
                    implied agreement for tripartite set-off. The objective inference from all the
                    circumstances is that there was no such implied agreement. Moreover, there is
                    one other pertinent factor which we must allude to. MEPL’s pleaded case is
                    that both the MAA and the MSA were alive in October and November 2008. As
                    mentioned above (at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>), the MAA has a
                    clause for set-off as between MEPL and JHTI. It is wholly incongruous to suggest
                    that there was a separate stand-alone unwritten implied agreement for tripartite
                    set-off, a course completely out of line with the manner in which the parties
                    had conducted themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In the light of the foregoing, we find, with
                    respect, difficulty with the reasoning in the following passage of the Judge at
                    [78]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of the evidence adduced read together with the set-off
                        provision under clause 11.2 of the MAA between the defendant and JHTI, as
                        well as the MSA which was a contract between, inter-alia, JHTI, MTC and the
                        defendant, I have no doubt that the defendant has discharged its burden of
                        proof on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As we have stated at [54], MEPL’s argument that there were then
                    in operation the MAA and the MSA did not advance MEPL’s case. As stated in
                        <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above, the MAA was only to operate
                    for one year. There is no evidence that the term of the MAA had been extended.
                    On MEPL’s stand that it was extended, presumably implicitly, the MAA only
                    provided for bilateral set-off between MEPL and JHTI. It is not in line with
                    logic and common sense to suggest that the parties had also impliedly agreed to
                    a tripartite set-off involving in addition MTC. Unlike bilateral set-offs ,
                    tripartite set-offs are certainly more involved, especially in a case like the
                    present where there were running accounts between JHTI and MEPL and similar
                    accounts between JHTI and MTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Finally, we would refer to the case of
                        <em>Latreefers Inc. (In liquidation) v Tangent Shipping Co
                        Ltd</em> [2000] BCLC 805 (“<em>Latreefers”</em>) where the court held that, in the light of
                    the correspondence between the parties accountants and solicitors, a tripartite
                    arrangement was intended by the parties and authorised by their representatives.
                    There, Tangent owed a debt to Latreefers and Latreefers owed a debt of a larger
                    sum to Latstrand. Tangent was a subsidiary of Latstrand. Both Latstrand and
                    Latreefers were subsidiaries of Latmar and Latmar was a subsidiary of Latvian
                    Shipping Company. All three parties to the tripartite set-off agreement were
                    related or affiliated companies. The case concerned inter-company indebtedness.
                    The court held that there was a duly authorised tripartite set-off. Two points
                    about the case should be noted. First, the tripartite set-off was a one-off
                    transaction unlike the present case where running accounts were involved: see
                        <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a> above. Second, there was a lapse of
                    some five years after the set-off and it would not be difficult to imagine this
                    fact could also give rise to other defences <em>eg</em>
                    estoppel. Clearly, the facts in <em>Latreefers</em> are
                    quite distinct from those in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     To reiterate, MEPL’s pleaded case is
                    that an agreement arose by virtue of the conduct of MEPL, MTC and JHTI sometime
                    around 5 July 2005. The burden is on MEPL to adduce evidence to show that
                    the parties have behaved in a manner which gave rise to an implied agreement and
                    that the parties have regarded themselves as being bound thereby. However, MEPL
                    has adduced no evidence to substantiate that. With respect to the Judge, she
                    appeared to have applied an equitable rule governing bilateral set-off in
                    implying the existence of a tripartite set-off agreement. MEPL’s omission
                    or inability to adduce evidence of the genesis of the agreement, and its mere
                    reliance on the set-off statements and the email correspondence generated during
                    the period of December 2007 to December 2008, as well as the testimony of its
                    employees, were hardly adequate to discharge its burden of proof. We would
                    further add that those documents, except in respect of the period from October
                    to November 2008, do not evidence any tripartite set-off arrangement. The
                    totality of the evidence in fact militates against the existence of any
                    unwritten tripartite agreement to set-off debts which arose from the
                    parties’ course of dealing. In this regard, we are especially swayed by
                    the following two factors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     First, no explanation was offered for the
                    parties’ failure to put the alleged tripartite contractual agreement to
                    set-off in writing. As stated in <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a> above,
                    one would have expected that sophisticated commercial parties like MEPL and JHTI
                    would not have agreed to deal with each other without ensuring that their
                    contractual arrangements have been comprehensively evidenced by proper legal
                    documentation. All the more so in a case like the present where the tripartite
                    set-off was not in relation to a single debt but on-going accounts. The fact
                    that the only hint of an agreement to set-off is found in cl 11.2 of the MAA,
                    which provided only for a mutual set-off between MEPL and JHTI, is more
                    consistent with the absence of such a tripartite agreement to set-off rather
                    than with its existence. MEPL explained that it was only logical that the MAA
                    provided for a bilateral set-off, since at the time of its conclusion on 28 July
                    2004, MTC had yet to be JHTI’s supplier of manufacturing materials. Thus,
                    MEPL argued that the MAA ought not to be treated as a factor negating the
                    existence of a tripartite set-off agreement formed by the conduct of MEPL, MTC
                    and JHTI. Be that as it may, it still does not explain why the parties had not
                    put the tripartite contractual arrangement down in writing, especially bearing
                    in mind that Motorola Inc and JHTI had thought it fit to enter into the MSA, and
                    earlier MEPL had executed the MAA with JHTI. Here we are not dealing with two
                    individuals, or small entities, which have carried on their business
                    relationship in an informal manner. We are instead talking about large,
                    commercially-savvy parties who have been dealing with one another at arm’s
                    length on the basis of written contracts, and who would, had that been their
                    intention, have surely taken care to enshrine the purported tripartite set-off
                    agreement in writing. They would not have left their intended course to be
                    inferred from their conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     MEPL also explained that the MSA was only a
                    broad umbrella agreement governing dealings of Motorola Inc and/or its
                    “affiliates” as defined in cl 2 of the MSA (see above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>) and suppliers generally. Thus, the MSA could
                    not have provided for specific terms governing the tripartite relationship
                    between MEPL, MTC and JHTI, and its existence therefore should not have
                    prevented the Judge from finding that a separate contract could be implied from
                    the three parties’ conduct. Again, we find this argument unsustainable.
                    Clause 1a contemplates the conclusion of more specific agreements between
                    parties, which would override the terms of the MSA in the event of
                    inconsistency:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>1</b>.    
              <b>Scope of this MSA</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a.    This MSA establishes the terms and conditions which
                            will apply each time Motorola engages Company to render manufacturing
                            services for a Product. The parties will enter into a separate Product
                            Specific Agreement (“PSA”) for each Product (or for each
                            group of Products that shares common characteristics) to establish the
                            specific terms and conditions applicable to that Product or group of
                            Products. The terms and conditions of this MSA will be incorporated into
                            each PSA with or without express reference to this MSA ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In particular, the MSA contemplates parties entering into more
                    specific written agreements on payment terms. Clause 5a of the MSA provides that
                    the pricing of products will be confirmed in the Product Specific Agreement.
                    Clause 5b provides that the MSA incorporates the payment terms stated in the
                    “FCA Company’s Factory (Incoterms 2000)”, unless otherwise
                    agreed by the parties in writing. It seems to us that if at all there was an
                    arrangement for a tripartite set-off, it would at least have been provided for
                    in the Product Specific Agreement, or the “FCA Company’s Factory
                    (Incoterms 2000)”. The alleged implied tripartite set-off agreement is
                    clearly inconsistent with these terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Secondly, as mentioned above at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>, the letters dated 22 June 2007 (which
                    are relied upon by MEPL) in fact undermine rather than support MEPL’s
                    defence. This is because the letters not only made no reference, either direct
                    or indirect, to the purported overarching tripartite agreement which was formed
                    on or about 5 July 2005, they also showed that the arrangement proposed
                    therein was really an ad hoc arrangement and this was evidenced by the fact that
                    JHTI was asked to give its written consent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In the result, we hold that although the
                    documentary evidence showed that moves were afoot by MEPL, MTC and JHTI to
                    effect set-offs on the relevant dates of 22 October 2008 and
                    21 November 2008, there is no evidence that the set-offs were undertaken
                        <em>pursuant</em> to an implied tripartite agreement
                    between the three parties which arose by a course of dealing sometime around
                    5 July 2005. No evidence at all was adduced to prove the existence of two
                    crucial elements necessary for the formation of a contract, <em>consensus ad idem</em> and an intention to create legal relations.
                    Moreover, quite apart from its pleaded case and even if we were minded to
                    consider whether those two set-offs could be regarded as completed set-offs
                    independent of the implied tripartite agreement, the fact remains that there is
                    no evidence that JHTI had given its final consent to the reconciliation
                    statements in connection with the set-offs of 22 October 2008 and
                    21 November 2008. The 22 June 2007 letters showed that that was how
                    the parties effected set-offs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observations on the calling of witnesses from JHTI</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     There was some controversy as to who should
                    have called the management of JHTI as witnesses at the trial. Undeniably, the
                    legal burden was on MEPL to prove the existence of an implied tripartite
                    agreement for set-off. For that purpose, it could, if it wished, have called
                    witnesses from JHTI. It is only when MEPL has proven that fact on a balance of
                    probabilities that an evidential burden will arise for Rabobank to rebut.
                    Rabobank could do so by calling either witnesses from JHTI or any other relevant
                    person. As we have found (see above, at <a href="#p1_61">[61]</a>) that MEPL had failed to prove its assertion that an implied
                    tripartite contract to set-off existed from July 2005, it is thus immaterial
                    that Rabobank did not call witnesses to prove a negative, <em>ie</em>, that no such tripartite agreement to set-off was in
                    existence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In the light of the above, there is no
                    necessity for this court to consider the issue of whether certain evidence
                    relied upon by Rabobank to prove the non-existence of an implied tripartite
                    set-off agreement was properly excluded as hearsay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issue of costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     On 6 January 2010 (approximately 1 week
                    before the trial date), MEPL made an offer to settle to Rabobank in the
                    following terms (“offer to settle”):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Plaintiff shall discontinue this Suit with no

                            in respect of this Suit within seven (7) days of the date of acceptance
                            of the Offer to Settle.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Each party shall bear its own costs arising out of
                            or in connection with this Suit, save where the Court has expressly
                            ordered costs in favour of one party against the other prior to the date
                            hereof;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The terms in this Offer to Settle constitute a full

                                assignments had been made pursuant to the Master Receivables
                                Agreement dated 15 February 2007 between them, and whether or

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Given that Rabobank is successful in this
                    appeal, the issue of whether Rabobank ought to bear the adverse cost
                    consequences in accordance with O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court is now
                    academic. It is also unnecessary for this court to pronounce its views on
                    whether Rabobank has acted reasonably in rejecting the offer to settle which
                    seemingly encompasses the settlement of disputes other than that which is the
                    subject of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In the light of the above, we allow the
                    appeal. Rabobank is thus entitled to the amount of US$5,150,853.21, which is the
                    difference between the US$5,178,212.41, the sum claimed by Rabobank and the
                    amounts rightly excluded by the Judge for being invoices not subject to the
                    MRPA, which is US$17,359.20. Interest at the usual rate of 5.33 % will apply on
                    the judgment sum from the date of the writ. MEPL is to bear the costs here and
