The difference in the new s 370(2) CPC is that this requirement is further subject to ss 370(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)-(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) CPC such that s 370(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) will not apply if the property falls within one of the categories in ss 370(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to 370(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>). This difference may hence affect the relief that is available to a person who is entitled to possession of the seized property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It should be noted that it is not entirely clear which version of s 370(2) CPC applies as s 128 of the CJRA which deals with saving and transitional provisions, the 2nd Reading of the Criminal Justice Reform Bill 2018 (Bill 14 of 2018) found in  <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report, </span>(19 March 2018) vol 94 at <span class="font-underline">https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/fullreport?sittingdate=19-03-2018</span> (14 January 2020), as well as the Explanatory Statement to the Criminal Justice Reform Bill 2018 (Bill 14 of 2018) are all silent as to which version of s 370 CPC should apply. In the absence of any express provision, and if it had been necessary to decide this issue, I would have been inclined to find that the provision at the time of the latest application for continued seizure should apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 It is not necessary for me to reach a decision on which version of<br/>s 370(2) CPC applies as regardless of which version of s 370 is considered,<br/>s 370(2) CPC will not apply if s 370(3) CPC applies, and I find that s 370(3) CPC applies in the present case (see below). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 370(3) CPC and the requirement for reasonable basis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Under both versions of the CPC, s 370(2) CPC is subject to s 370(3) CPC. Section 370(3) CPC reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The relevant court must not dispose of the property if — </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) there is any pending court proceeding under any written law in relation to the property; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the relevant court is satisfied that the property is relevant for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under any written law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Under s 370(3) CPC, the Magistrate must not dispose of the property if: (a) there is any pending court proceeding under any written law in relation to the property in respect of which the report referred to in s 370(1) is made; or (b) it is satisfied that such property is relevant for the purposes of any: (1) investigation; (2) inquiry; (3) trial; or (4) other proceeding under any written law. This list of four purposes in s 370(3) is exhaustive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It should be pointed out that under the previous version of s 370(3) CPC, the phrase “other proceeding under any written law” was originally “other proceeding under this Code”. This difference is not material, as the Respondent did not make submissions that the seized funds are relevant for either proceedings under the CPC, or proceedings under any written law, and does not appear to be relying on this ground of relevancy.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In determining whether the property is relevant for a s 370(3) CPC purpose, there should be enough information put before the court so that the Magistrate can have a reasonable basis for concluding that these statutory requirements are met (<span class="font-italic">Rajendar</span> at [48]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 The Prosecution would also have to inform the Magistrate of the justification for the extension and of such facts as form the basis of its request. I accept that notwithstanding the passage of a year since the seizure, investigations might not yet be complete. But this does not mean that a bland assertion from the IO to the effect that investigations are continuing and that the seized assets are relevant will suffice. In such circumstances, the Magistrate would be entitled to some explanation for the delay. The short point is that the Magistrate should be provided with such information as would enable her to be satisfied that there is a <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span> basis for thinking that the seized property is “relevant for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under [the CPC]” if, as is the case here, that is the basis on which the required extension is being sought.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Further, sufficient information has to be put before the court, otherwise, no real purpose is served by the involvement of the court (<span class="font-italic">Rajendar </span>at [49]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [if insufficient information is put before the court], the Magistrate would be reduced to acting in a purely formal role to endorse whatever she was presented with, without any basis for satisfying herself that these assertions were validly made, and it is meaningless in such circumstances to speak of judicial oversight of the seizure process, as was contemplated in [<span class="font-italic">Mustafa CA</span>].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The threshold for the information required is higher than that for the initial seizure (<span class="font-italic">Rajendar </span>at [50]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 In my judgment, the threshold for <span class="font-italic">continued</span> seizure under s 370 of the CPC should be and is more stringent than the threshold for <span class="font-italic">initial</span> seizure under s 35 of the CPC. This follows from the fact that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) by the time the matter is reviewed under s 370, a period of up to one year would have passed;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) judicial oversight is introduced at this stage and this is only meaningful, as I have noted above, if the court is presented with enough information to assess and calibrate the balance between the private interests of an applicant who has not yet been convicted and the public interest in the contemplated prosecution; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) otherwise, the only remedy in respect of a seizure under s 35 would be judicial review, which as I have noted at [41] above presents a demanding threshold to meet given the broad powers conferred upon the Police by s 35.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In summary, therefore, an extension should be supported by: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sufficient information instead of mere bland or bald assertions;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Information on the state of investigations; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Timelines on the expected progress of the investigations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In determining whether the information disclosed is sufficient to provide reasonable basis for thinking that the seized property is relevant to a specified purpose under s 370(3), the court is entitled to take into account, <span class="font-italic">inter alia, </span>the period which has elapsed since the property was first seized, and the nature of the wrongdoing which gave rise to the investigation or inquiry (<span class="font-italic">Mustafa CA </span>at [84]). The longer the period the property has been seized and detained, the greater will be the justification needed to show that it is still relevant to the investigation or inquiry (<span class="font-italic">Mustafa CA </span>at [84]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 370(2) CPC and the requirement for lawful entitlement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Section 370(2) CPC applies if s 370(3) CPC does not apply. Under<br/>s 370(2) CPC (s 370(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the new version), an order to release the seized funds to the person seeking release is only required when the person seeking release proves that he is entitled to the possession of the property. In <span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>at [46]<span class="font-italic">, </span>Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon interpreted the phrase “entitled to the possession” to mean that “the person in question must be able to show that the property was ‘legally acquired by him’”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Although the relevant provision that was interpreted in <span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>was s 392(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC 1985”), I am of the view that the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>can be extended to the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Firstly, s 392(1) CPC 1985 appears to be the predecessor provision to s 370(2) CPC as the two provisions are substantially similar. Section 392(1) CPC 1985 reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">392.—(1) The seizure by any police officer of property taken under section 29 or alleged or suspected to have been stolen, or found under circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence shall be forthwith reported to a Magistrate’s Court which shall make such order as it thinks fit respecting the delivery of the property to the person entitled to the possession of it or, if that person cannot be ascertained, respecting the custody and production of the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Code Bill (Bill 11 of 2010), s 392(1) CPC 1985 was removed and s 370 CPC was added instead. The two provisions are similar as they deal with the procedure after police have seized property, and both set out the situations where a court must make an order as it thinks fit, including ordering delivery of the seized property to the person entitled to the possession of it. Given the similar wording, <span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>can be extended to the present case. <span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>in itself was an extension of the rule in previous cases, as the provision in <span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>was similarly worded to those previous cases (<span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>at [47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Secondly, more than anything else, the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye</span> is persuasive. <span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>distinguished actual possession from lawful entitlement to possession and held that a person in actual possession may not be the person in lawful possession, depending on the circumstances (<span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>at [49]). A person in actual possession of traceable proceeds of a crime has no basis for asserting any enforceable proprietary interest in such property (<span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>at [49]). Instead, the person seeking delivery of the property has the burden of proof of showing such lawful entitlement to possession (<span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>at [46]; s 103 of Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)). The distinction drawn in that case between “actual possession” and “entitlement to possession” is logical and since s 370(2) CPC requires “entitlement to possession”, it should be a requirement for the person seeking delivery to prove lawful entitlement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I also note that the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Jeremy Lee </span>had similarly extended the rule in <span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>to apply to s 370 CPC (<span class="font-italic">Jeremy Lee </span>at [115]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For these reasons, I find that the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>is similarly applicable to s 370(2) CPC. Since a person not legally entitled to possession has no legal right to demand delivery of the property to him, substantive injustice will only be caused to a person who can prove that he is legally entitled to possession (<span class="font-italic">Oon Heng Lye </span>at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Reasonable basis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The first question then is whether the second District Judge had a reasonable basis for believing that the seized funds were relevant for one of the specified purposes under s 370(3) CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As set out above at paragraph 27, the Respondent submitted that the seized funds are relevant for the purposes of preventing the dissipation of the assets, and for returning them to their rightful owners.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 However, the Respondent’s stated purpose for the continued seizure differs from the second District Judge’s Order. The second District Judge in the Order specifically ordered for the “[e]nforcement agency to retain the seized property for the purposes of investigations”,

Instead, the issue is whether the second District Judge had reasonable basis to believe that the seized property is relevant to the purpose stated in the Order,<span class="font-italic"> </span>namely, for the purposes of investigations. This issue should hence be examined in relation to the second District Judge’s Order and not the Respondent’s newly stated purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In any event, it is unclear if the Respondent’s newly stated purpose even falls within the ambit of one of the four specified purposes set out in s 370(3) CPC. At face value, the purpose of preventing dissipation of assets and returning assets to their rightful owner does not seem to fall within the ambit of either: (1) investigation; (2) inquiry; (3) trial; or (4) other proceeding under any written law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In <span class="font-italic">Rajendar</span>, Menon CJ held that an extension of seizure under s 370 CPC can be allowed for the purpose of preserving assets for a disposal order under s 364 CPC (<span class="font-italic">Rajendar </span>at [49]). However, the Respondent themselves distinguished the case of <span class="font-italic">Rajendar</span> by stating that extension of the seizure of funds in that case was for the purposes of obtaining a disposal order under s 364 CPC, whereas in the present case, the seizure is sought for the purpose of returning the funds to the rightful owner lawfully entitled to them.

</div>  The former would constitute a “proceeding under this Code” and would fall under the ambit of one of the s 370(3) CPC purposes, whereas the latter would not.

Contrary to the assertion of the Respondent, there is nothing in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd report explicitly stating CAD’s intention to return the funds to the rightful owners. Even if such intention can be implied, it was not stated that this was the basis of the continued seizure sought. Instead, the 1st and 2nd reports make clear that the basis for seeking extended seizure was that the funds were relevant to investigations. Paragraph 7 of the 1st report states that “the seized property continues to be relevant to investigations”,

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that the above information was only just sufficient at this stage of proceedings and by the next court review, more information should be provided given the substantial time that has already passed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I appreciate that it is difficult to estimate the time that may be taken by investigations. But the longer investigations are carried out, the greater the degree of clarity one would expect, unless complications arise.  If there are such complications, they should be stated.  It would not be either realistic or useful to specify the degree of detail or support that is required. If at one end of the spectrum, bald statements are not sufficient, at the other end, one would not require copious details or extensive support.  What is stated should at least show that the extension is <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span>, that there are investigations still ongoing, and what progress has been made or not made since the last report, and at least a brief explanation for any delay or need for further time.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 It is appreciated that cross-border crimes may be complex, and that there will generally be some delay in communications with foreign agencies, as both the local and foreign investigative and prosecution agencies will need to work through their own structures in requesting and responding to requests, as well as in clarifying matters. In a large jurisdiction such as Russia, this may sometimes require communications between the headquarters or capital and officers further afield, through its own chain of communications.  On the other hand, the rights of the persons affected by the seizure also need to be considered; the court needs to balance facilitating investigations while ensuring that any release is not unduly or inappropriately held up.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 I note that the Applicant argues that the level of certainty in the CAD’s own reports about the traceability of the funds to the subject of the alleged offences appeared to have gone down, as compared to the initial reports. Nevertheless, this did not indicate the lack of reasonable basis by the second District Judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 But on the next round one would expect, if things have not yet been brought to a conclusion, at least such information as would explain the need for further investigations, and what has happened in the meantime. As judgment is issued shortly before the next court review, it may be appropriate for the next Magistrate to consider a shorter extension to allow further details to be given at an intermediate point in time, rather than giving the maximum twelve month extension.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Since there is reasonable basis for the second District Judge’s Order, s 370(3) CPC is satisfied and there is no need to discuss whether the Applicant is entitled to possession under s 370(2) CPC. However, for completeness, I will proceed to do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Lawful entitlement to possession </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I accept the contentions of the Respondent that the Applicant has failed to show that it is lawfully entitled to the possession of the funds. It is insufficient to show that the funds were seized from the Applicant. Some evidence should be disclosed to show that the funds were lawfully obtained, or that there was some legitimate source, whether from investments, trading or otherwise. Without this, the Applicant would not be able to make out a right to the possession of those funds. Such evidence was not presented in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The following factors further cast doubt that the Applicant has lawful entitlement to possession of the funds:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 22 February 2017, Boytsov sold all his shares in the Applicant to Ang for US$10,000.00,
