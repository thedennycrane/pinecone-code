        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the judgment of the
                    High Court Judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Ng Chee Weng
                        v Bryan Lim Jit Ming and another</em> [2011] SGHC 120
                    (“the Judgment”). It concerns an application to amend a Statement
                    of Claim. However, since the case involves both an alleged settlement agreement
                    as well as an original cause of action based on a trust, difficult questions of
                    procedure are raised.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 26 May 2009, Ng Chee Weng (“the
                    Appellant”) commenced an action in Suit No 453 of 2009 against Bryan
                    Lim Jit Ming (“the First Respondent”) and Teo Soo Geok Josephine
                    (“the Second Respondent”). The First Respondent and Second
                    Respondent are husband and wife. Since the Second Respondent plays no material
                    role in the present proceedings, all subsequent references to “the
                    Respondent” shall refer to the First Respondent only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the original Statement of Claim, the
                    Appellant alleged that the Respondent held some shares in SinCo Technologies Pte
                    Ltd (the “Company”) on trust for him. The Appellant wanted to
                    claim the dividends declared by the Company between 2003 and 2007 from the
                    Respondent, amounting to some $8.88 million. We shall refer to the dividend
                    claim as “the original cause of action”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Besides the original cause of action, the
                    Statement of Claim also contained certain paragraphs that made reference to
                    settlement discussions between the Appellant and the Respondent. We note that
                    the Appellant stopped short of alleging that he arrived at a settlement with the
                    Respondent in the Statement of Claim itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Respondent applied to strike out those
                    paragraphs in Summons No 2966 of 2009 (“SUM 2966/2009”)
                    on the basis that the discussions were “without prejudice”
                    communications that were privileged from disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The High Court judge who heard
                    SUM 2966/2009 granted the application and struck out the paragraphs in
                    question. The Appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal
                    No 93 of 2009 (“CA 93/2009”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Over the course of arguments before the Court of
                    Appeal, the Appellant put forward amendments to his Statement of Claim
                    (“the First Proposed Amendment”) to plead a claim to enforce a
                    settlement agreement as an alternative claim to the original cause of action.
                    The essence of this amendment is found in paragraph 33 of the First
                    Proposed Amendment, as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 31 March 2009 the Plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup>
                        Defendant entered into another oral Settlement Agreement under which
                        agreement <em>the 1</em><sup>st</sup><em>Defendant agreed to pay the Plaintiff
                            S$4.5 million</em> in discharge of the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant’s liability as trustee to
                        account for dividends declared and paid by the Company to the
                            1<sup>st</sup> Defendant for the period 2003-2007, ...
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The critical change in the First Proposed Amendment was that the
                    Appellant now alleged that settlement negotiations had in fact concluded in a
                    settlement agreement under which the Respondent agreed to pay the Appellant
                    $4.5 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal in
                    CA 93/2009 and disallowed the First Proposed Amendment. However, the Court
                    of Appeal issued the following addendum to their order of 19 May 2010, as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Addendum to Order of 19 May 2010 in CA 93 of 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The dismissal of the appeal should not be taken as precluding the
                        appellant from applying for leave to make such further amendments to his
                        statement of claim as he may deem fit, subject always to the right of the
                        respondent to object to the same in accordance with general principles.
                            <em>However, any proposed amendment which is in the
                            precise form and sequence as set out in the draft enclosed in the
                            appellant’s submission to this court on 18 May 2010 should
                            not be allowed as we have already ruled that that draft was not in
                            order.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whether any “without prejudice” evidence (“the
                        contested evidence”) may be permitted to be adduced in the
                        proceedings would have to be determined in accordance with the general law
                        and in the light of any future amendments to pleading (if any) as may be
                        allowed. For the avoidance of doubt we should state that the dismissal of
                        the appeal does not mean that we have ruled that the contested evidence is
                        inadmissible under any circumstances. We have only determined that the
                        contested evidence is inadmissible on the basis of the existing
                        pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Appellant then brought the present
                    application to amend his Statement of Claim for a second time (“the
                    Second Proposed Amendment”) in Summons No 3969 of 2010
                    (“SUM 3969/2010”). This time, the Appellant has <em>reversed</em> the order of his respective causes of action.
                    In particular, the Appellant is now pleading that he had arrived at a settlement
                    agreement with the Respondent, pursuant to which he (the Appellant) would
                    receive $4.5 million; and, in the alternative, if the court finds that
                    there is no settlement agreement, that he is entitled to the dividends declared
                    on the shares held on trust for him by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The essence of this amendment is contained in
                    paragraphs 29 to 37 of the Second Proposed Amendment, as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In the Judgment, the Judge affirmed the

                    held (see the Judgment at [17],

                            under contract, on the basis that the plaintiff and the first defendant
                            had agreed to settle his claim for the claim for

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    These two claims are mutually exclusive. <em>If there was a settlement agreement</em>, it

                            dividends claim if it is found at trial that there was no settlement
                            agreement. That explanation did not remove the need to elect if he was
                            allowed to plead in the alternative in the manner set out in the
                            application. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    
              <em>The plaintiff had to confront a
                                basic issue, whether he was entitled to plead in the alternative as
                                set out in his application. Holding the plaintiff to his case, he
                                had compromised the dividends claim by the time he commenced this
                                action</em>. There was one surviving claim, the claim under
                            the settlement agreement. He cannot be allowed to maintain the dividends
                            claim when his case was that the claim had been compromised. It is not a
                            question of election because election implies that the elector has two
                            proper claims between which he must choose, and there was only one
                            claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34    For the reasons stated in [21] and [22] <em>supra</em>, the alternative claim for the dividends
                            disclosed no reasonable cause of action and is an abuse of the process
                            of court, and the [Second Proposed Amendment] cannot be
                        allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     From the extract above, it is clear to us that
                    the Judge was not persuaded by the Appellant’s submissions that he was
                    entitled to plead in the alternative in manner as set out in the Second Proposed
                    Amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Judge also found that the Appellant could
                    not maintain the original cause of action when his case was that the original
                    cause of action had been compromised by a settlement. Therefore, the learned
                    Judge concluded that Second Proposed Amendment could not be allowed because it
                    disclosed no reasonable cause of action and was an abuse of the process of
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Appellant’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On appeal, the Appellant’s main case is
                    that if he were to be put to an election as to which cause of action (<em>ie</em>, the dividend claim or the settlement claim) he
                    wishes to pursue, this would result in patent unfairness to him. This is
                    because, at this stage, the question of whether or not there was a settlement
                    agreement has not been determined by the Court. If he were compelled to elect,
                    and he chose to pursue the settlement claim, then he would be left with nothing
                    should that claim fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Appellant submits that, as a matter of law
                    and logic, this outcome cannot be right because it is settled law that, if the
                    court determines that there is no settlement agreement reached, the original
                    cause of action survives as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Furthermore, the Appellant submits that his
                    application satisfies the requirements at law that govern amendments because the
                    Second Proposed Amendment is not substantially in the same form and sequence as
                    the First Proposed Amendment which this court previously disallowed. Indeed, as
                    we have noted above (at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a>), the Appellant
                    has <em>reversed</em> the order of his respective causes of
                    action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Appellant also submits there is no rule of
                    law that requires him to issue fresh proceedings in order to bring a claim;
                    conversely, bringing both claims in the same suit prevents duplicity of actions
                    and hence leads to savings of cost and time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Respondent’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Respondent’s main case is that an
                    issue of election arises, and that the Appellant has chosen and must stand by
                    his choice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Respondent further submits that the Second
                    Proposed Amendment is inconsistent, dishonest and an abuse of process and that
                    the Appellant is estopped from pleading both claims in the same
                action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The main issues that have arisen for decision
                    in the present appeal are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Appellant can plead in
                        the alternative in the manner set out in the Second Proposed Amendment
                        (“the First Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the Appellant is precluded from amending his
                        pleadings because he had elected otherwise, or because, for some other
                        reason, allowing the amendment will result in injustice to the Respondent
                        (“the Second Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the appeal ought, in any event, to fail as the
                        Second Proposed Amendment discloses no reasonable cause of action, or,
                        alternatively, is an abuse of the process of court (“the Third
                        Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The First Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law on the amendment of pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The law that governs amendment of pleadings is
                    well-established. This court held in <em>Wright Norman and
                        another v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd</em> (“<em>Wright Norman</em>”) [1993] 3 SLR(R) 640 (at
                        [6]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is trite law that an amendment which would enable the real issues
                        between the parties to be tried should be allowed subject to penalties on
                        costs and adjournment, if necessary, <em>unless the amendment
                            would cause injustice or injury to the opposing party which could not be
                            compensated for by costs or otherwise</em> ... [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     We pause to observe that, over the course of
                    the parties’ lengthy submissions, there was not a single occasion where
                    the principle in <em>Wright Norman</em> was mentioned,
                    either expressly or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The rationale behind the principle in
                        <em>Wright Norman</em> is obvious. The court should be
                    extremely hesitant to punish litigants for mistakes they make in the conduct of
                    their cases, by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights: see,
                    for example, <em>per</em> Bowen LJ in the English
                    Court of Appeal decision of <em>Cropper v Smith</em> (1884)
                    26 Ch D 700 (“<em>Cropper</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     However, the principle in <em>Cropper</em> has been qualified by Lord Griffiths in the House of
                    Lords decision of <em>Ketteman </em><em>v
                        Hansel Properties Ltd</em> [1987] AC 189 (“<em>Ketteman</em>”), where the learned law lord observed
                    that the judge must also consider all the circumstances of the case because
                    “justice cannot always be measured in terms of
                money”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The qualification in <em>Ketteman</em> has been repeatedly endorsed in local cases, and most
                    recently in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Tang Chay
                        Seng v Tung Yang Wee Arthur</em> [2010] 4 SLR 1020,
                    where Tan Lee Meng J held (at [10]–[11])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    It does not always
                            follow that an amendment should be allowed where the other party can be
                            compensated with costs. In <em>Ketteman
                                </em><em>v Hansel Properties Ltd</em>
                            [1987] AC 189 (“<em>Ketteman”</em>) Lord Griffiths, who pointed out, at
                            220, that “justice cannot always be measured in terms of
                            money” explained as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[A] judge is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the
                            litigation imposes on litigants, particularly if they are personal
                            litigants rather than business corporations, the anxieties occasioned by
                            facing new issues, the raising of false hopes, and the legitimate
                            expectation that the trial will determine the issues one way or the
                            other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    The courts have been careful to differentiate
                            between an amendment that merely clarifies an issue in dispute and one
                            that raises a totally different issue at too late a stage. As Lords
                            Griffiths said in <em>Ketteman</em>, at 220,
                            “to allow an amendment before a trial begins is quite different
                            from allowing it at the end of the trial to give an apparently
                            unsuccessful defendant an opportunity to renew the fight on an entirely
                            different defence”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Indeed, in has been stressed in the Singapore
                    High Court decision of <em>United Overseas Bank Ltd v Ng Huat
                        Foundations Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 2 SLR(R) 425 that procedural
                    justice is an important aspect of the holistic ideal and concept of justice
                    itself. It was held in that case (at [5])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the court must be extremely wary of falling into the flawed
                        approach to the effect that “the ends justify the means”. This
                        ought never to be the case. The obsession with achieving a substantively
                        fair and just outcome does not justify the utilisation of any and every
                        means to achieve that objective. There must be fairness in the <em>procedure or manner</em> in which the final outcome is
                        achieved. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Applying the above principle in the context of
                    amendment of pleadings, even if a litigant has a seemingly meritorious claim, an
                    amendment to the pleadings will be refused if it causes injustice to the
                    opposing party. This is because, if the procedure used to achieve the outcome is
                    not fair, that itself will taint the outcome.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, it also follows that, if there will
                    be no injustice caused save some inconvenience that can be compensated by costs,
                    and the amendment is in order, the court will lean favourably towards allowing
                    the amendment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Second Proposed Amendment is in order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     An amendment is in order if it complies with
                    the established rules of pleading set out in Order 18 of the Rules of Court
                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”) as well as under
                    the common law. Specifically, the rules under Order 18 that arise as issues
                    for consideration in this appeal are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     Order 18 Rule 7;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Order 18 Rule 19.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As the applicability of
                    Order 18 Rule 19 is more germane to the Third Issue, we will discuss
                    Order 18 Rule 7 first.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Order 18 Rule 7</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The applicable law on alternative pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Order 18 Rule 7 requires that only
                    facts, and not evidence, be pleaded. However, unlike the civil procedure rules
                    of many other jurisdictions, our Rules of Court are silent as to whether
                    inconsistent alternatives can be pleaded. Hence, the common law rules on
                    alternative pleadings continue to apply in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The common law rules on alternative pleadings
                    are succinctly explained by the authors of <em>Mallal’s
                        Supreme Court Practice</em> (Vol 1, 2nd Ed, 1983), which
                    refer (at para 18/7/4) to a rule that is <em>in pari
                        materia</em> to our Order 18 Rule 7, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Alternative pleas:</b> A plaintiff may base his
                        claim alternatively, upon two or more different sets of facts, each
                        entitling him to the relief sought, or of some modifications of it. A
                        plaintiff may rely upon different rights alternatively and there is nothing
                        in these rules to prevent a party from making two or more inconsistent sets
                        of allegations and claiming relief in the alternative. <em>The object of permitting alternative reliefs to be claimed in one
                            litigation is to obviate the necessity of another litigation to dispose
                            of the same controversy or the subject-matter of the same
                            relief</em>, though the ground upon which the relief is claimed
                        may be different. [original emphasis in bold, emphasis added in
                        italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The above passage is an accurate statement of
                    the common law. Brett LJ held in the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Philipps v Philipps</em> (1878) 4 QBD 127
                        (“<em>Philipps</em>”) that a party is
                    allowed to include two or more inconsistent sets of material facts and claim
                    relief to each set in the alternative. He held (at 134) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plaintiff is relying upon several different rights, and I may take it
                        that he is relying upon them alternatively although they may be
                        inconsistent. <em>As to each of those he ought to set out the
                            facts upon which he would have to rely as facts to maintain that
                            right.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The requirement that the facts relied upon by
                    each alternative separately be set out is important, because failure to do so
                    will likely result in confusion and embarrassment. The learned authors of
                        <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2007</em>
                    (G P Selvam ed-in-chief) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007)
                    explain (at para 18/7/20) that, as a matter of practice:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whenever alternative cases are alleged, the facts belonging to them
                        respectively ought not to be mixed up, but should be stated separately, so
                        as to show on what facts each alternative relief is claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The above principles were endorsed and
                    qualified by our High Court in <em>Chong Poh Siew v Chong Poh
                        Heng</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 188 (“<em>Chong Poh Siew</em>”), where
                    M P H Rubin J held (at [61] and [62])
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Given the conflicting nature of the interests, I am of the opinion
                        that this alternative plea is simply not available to the plaintiff. It is
                        settled law that a plaintiff may rely on several different rights
                        alternatively though they may be inconsistent (<em>per</em> Brett LJ in <em>Philipps v
                            Philipps</em> (1878) 4 QBD 127 at 134). ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Though the plaintiff is technically the legal owner of the disputed share
                        by virtue of the deed of assignment, having regard to his underlying stance

                        unfavourable to him, <em>it will not, in my opinion, commune
                            with common sense and justice</em> to order the release of the
                        proceeds of the disputed share to him. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The suggestion in <em>Chong Poh
                        Siew</em> that, while a party has the right to plead inconsistent
                    rights in the alternative, the alternatives cannot offend common sense and
                    justice represents the law in Singapore. Indeed, in <em>Brailsford v Tobie</em> (1888) 10 ALT 194 (“<em>Brailsford</em>”), it was held that an exception to
                    the general rule is that alternative statements of fact are not permitted if one
                    statement or the other must, to the knowledge of the pleader, be
                false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     This exception highlights the tension the law
                    faces in deciding whether or not to permit parties to plead inconsistent causes
                    of action in the alternative. While the pleader should be free to plead
                    inconsistent causes of action in the alternative, the inconsistency cannot
                    – particularly in relation to the facts pleaded – offend common
                    sense. One obvious example of an inconsistency that will offend common sense is
                    when the pleader has actual knowledge of which alternative is true, as was the
                    case in <em>Brailsford</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Indeed, in the latest edition of a leading
                    practitioners’ text on civil procedure in Singapore, it was observed as
                    follows (see <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em>
                    (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 18/1/5):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<em>Combining various causes of
                            action, pleas and parties</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Claims which are inconsistent with each other may be pleaded but
                        should be alleged in the alternative (<em>Bagot v
                            Easton</em> (1877) 7 Ch D 1). For instance, a claim for
                        fraud might be coupled with an alternative claim for negligence. If the
                        plaintiff pleads fraud solely but is only able to prove negligence, he will
                        not be able to obtain his remedy (<em>Connecticut Fire
                            Insurance v Kavanagh</em> [1892] AC 473). However, the
                        court may be unwilling to accept an alternative plea if, in the
                        circumstances, this would not be in the interests of justice (see <em>Chong Poh Siew v Chong Poh Heng</em> [1995]
                        1 SLR 135, at 151). ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Applying the above principles to the facts of
                    the present appeal, we are of the view that the approach taken in <em>Chong Poh Siew</em> is sound and that the Appellant is not
                    precluded from pleading the inconsistent causes of action in the <em>alternative</em>, as long as the facts are not mixed up and
                    are stated separately in order to demonstrate on what facts each alternative
                    relief is based.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     This is exactly what the Appellant did in his
                    Second Proposed Amendment (as to which, see above at <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     At paragraphs 29 to 33, the
                        Appellant sets out the facts that give rise to the settlement. At
                        paragraphs 39(1) and (2), the Appellant sets out the relief sought
                        under those facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     At paragraphs 17 to 28, and 34 to 35, the Appellant sets out the
                        facts that give rise to the original cause of action. At
                        paragraphs 39(3) to (6), he claims, <em>in the
                            alternative</em>, the relief sought under those
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     What the Appellant has done is clearly in line
                    with <em>Philipps</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>), as well with the general practice set out
                    in the relevant texts (see above at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a>). Therefore, the inconsistent
                    causes of action pleaded do not form a basis for the court to deny the
                    Appellant’s Second Proposed Amendment because those inconsistent causes of
                    action are indeed properly pleaded in the alternative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Second Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In addition to the submission that the
                    Appellant’s Second Proposed Amendment is not in order, the Respondent
                    raised several other objections to the Second Proposed Amendment. The main
                    objections can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Appellant is precluded by the
                        doctrine of <em>election</em> from making the
                        amendment. From the way the Appellant conducted his case, he is no longer
                        entitled to sue on the settlement agreement because he had already elected
                        to sue on the original cause of action when he first commenced proceedings
                        (“the issue of election”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_b"></a>(b)     By suing initially on the original cause of
                        action, there is now total failure of consideration on the part of the
                        Appellant (“the issue of total failure of
                        consideration”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Appellant is trying to use the Second Proposed
                        Amendment as a backdoor to bring in “without prejudice”
                        evidence that was struck out by the Court of Appeal in CA 93/2009
                        (“the issue of “without prejudice”
                        evidence”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_d"></a>(d)     As a matter of policy, allowing the Second Proposed Amendment in this
                        case would have a chilling effect on settlement proceedings in general
                        (“the policy issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_42-p2_e"></a>(e)     Having dragged the Respondent through two years of
                        litigation, it is now too late for the Appellant to change their mind
                        because they are estopped from doing so (“the issue of
                        estoppel”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     We have considered all the above submissions
                    and are not persuaded by any of them for reasons set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(a)   The issue of election</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The submissions on the issue of election
                    formed one of the major planks in the Respondent’s case before this court.
                    The crux of the submissions on this issue is that the Appellant must elect which
                    claim to pursue, because the Appellant cannot sue on both claims at the same
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The Respondent further submits that, having
                    elected to pursue the original claim for dividends, the Appellant must stand by
                    his election and can no longer pursue the settlement claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We are unable to agree with the
                    Respondent’s submissions on this point. Keeping in mind the law on
                    alternative pleadings, we have, with respect, found these arguments to be
                    without merit. The fact that the Appellant cannot succeed on both claims at the
                    same time does not disentitle him to plead both claims in the alternative within
                    the same suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In our view, the question of election does not
                    even arise at this stage. In order to understand why this is so, we must analyse
                    the authorities cited by the Respondent in greater detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The Respondent relies, in the main, on three
                    cases: <em>Lam Fung-ying v Ho Tung-sing and Another</em>
                    [1993] 2 HKLR 187 (“<em>Lam
                    Fung-ying</em>”); <em>Deman Construction Corp v
                        1429036 Ontario Inc.</em> 64 CLR (3d) 82 (“<em>Deman</em>”); and <em>The
                        “Dilman Fulmar”</em> [2004] 1 SLR(R) 140
                        (“<em>Dilman Fulmar</em>”) to support his
                    argument that the need to elect arises at this stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In a more general vein, the cases relating to
                    settlement agreements can be analysed from two perspectives – first, where
                    the existence of the settlement is not in dispute and, secondly, where (in
                    contrast) the existence of the settlement is in fact in dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Where the existence of the settlement agreement is not in
                dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Issues of election might arise where the
                    existence of the settlement agreement is not in dispute. The precise legal
                    effect would depend on whether or not it is the defendant or the plaintiff who
                    is in repudiatory breach of the settlement agreement. (see generally David
                    Foskett, <em>The Law and Practice of Compromise</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2010) (“<em>Foskett</em>”) at Chapter 8) However, as this is not the
                    situation that is before this court in the present appeal, we would venture to
                    say no more.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Where the existence of the settlement agreement is in
                dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Where, however, the existence of the
                    settlement agreement is in dispute (which is the situation in the context of the
                    present appeal), <em>that</em> question <em>must first be settled by the court before</em> a party can be said to
                    have breached the settlement. As a matter of logic, the existence of a
                    settlement agreement <em>must necessarily </em><em>precede</em> a determination of whether either party breached
                    the settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     At this stage, <em>neither</em> party is put to an election. The need for election
                        <em>does not arise yet</em> because the question of
                    whether or not there is a settlement agreement to breach <em>has
                        not yet been decided</em> by the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Rather, the innocent party should apply for
                    the question of whether or not a settlement agreement exists to be tried as a
                    preliminary issue. There is local authority that adopts precisely such an
                    approach. Judith Prakash J in the Singapore High Court decision of
                        <em>T2 Networks Pte Ltd v Nasioncom Sdn Bhd</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 1 found no difficulty in dealing with the issue as to whether
                    or not there was a settlement agreement as a preliminary issue. After
                    Prakash J determined that there was no settlement agreement between the
                    parties, she proceeded to determine the merits of dispute in the original cause
                    of action. All these issues were determined within the same trial. Hence, we are
                    of the view that, in the interests of practicality, a plaintiff is entitled to
                    sue on both the alleged settlement agreement and the original cause of action
                    (by way of alternative pleadings) in the same suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     If the court determines that there was indeed
                    a settlement agreement, and one party is in repudiatory breach of the
                    settlement, the other (innocent) party will then (as alluded to at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above) be put to an election as to whether to
                    affirm or to terminate the settlement agreement instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     On the other hand, if the court determines
                    that there was no settlement agreement arrived at between the parties, the
                    original cause of action is not affected. Since there was no settlement
                    agreement, a plaintiff can proceed to sue, and a defendant remains liable to be
                    sued, on the original cause of action. It is clear that no issue of election
                    arises in such a situation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Therefore, we consider, with respect, the
                    Respondent’s submissions on election to be both premature and, hence,
                    misconceived, since the court has not yet decided whether or not there was a
                    settlement agreement arrived at between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     We pause for the moment to observe the reason
                    as to why the present proceedings have unfolded in such a tangled fashion.
                    Usually, if the terms of the settlement agreement are favourable to the
                    defendant, he or she would want to enforce the settlement agreement rather than
                    be sued by the plaintiff on the original cause of action. However, we could
                    envision certain situations where the defendant would prefer to be sued on the
                    original cause of action rather than on the settlement agreement. This might be
                    due to various tactical reasons: for example, the defendant might think that the
                    plaintiff’s claim under the original cause of action is weaker than his or
                    her claim under the settlement agreement; or, as appears to be the case here,
                    there might be “without prejudice” evidence that can be kept out
                    of the trial of the original cause of action, but not out of the trial of the
                    settlement claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     However, if the defendant chooses not ask the
                    court to determine whether or not there was a settlement agreement, he cannot
                    proceed to allege that the plaintiff is in repudiatory breach of the settlement
                        <em>as if there was a settlement</em><b>.</b> This is <em>not</em> permissible because,
                    to use the words of the Respondent, a party cannot have his cake and eat it too.
                    As we have emphasised earlier, the question of whether or not there is a
                    settlement agreement <em>should always precede</em> the
                    question of whether or not there was a repudiatory breach <em>of
                        the settlement agreement</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In fact, upon closer scrutiny, whilst the
                    Appellant has put forth two inconsistent claims, the Respondent has <em>himself also</em> put forth two inconsistent defences.
                    Essentially, the Respondent is alleging that there was no settlement agreement
                    and, <em>in the alternative</em>, if there was a settlement
                    agreement, the Appellant had acted in repudiatory breach and the Respondent had
                    thereby terminated the settlement agreement. The defences are inconsistent
                    because surely the Respondent cannot succeed on both defences at the same
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In future cases, and for the avoidance of
                    doubt, if the existence of a settlement agreement is in question, it should
                    generally be determined as a preliminary issue. Either party could make such an
                    application. Where no application to such effect is made, but the pleadings
                    disclose that such an issue exists, the court could, on its own motion, make a
                    direction to determine the question as a preliminary issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The relevance of the cases cited by the Respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     We have considered the three cases cited by
                    the Respondent (see <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> above) to support
                    his argument that the need to elect arises at this stage of the proceedings.
                    However, we are not persuaded by any of the three cases cited. The factual
                    matrix of the present appeal is very different from that in all of the three
                    cases cited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     From the foregoing analysis, the issue of
                    election might become relevant only <em>if the court were to find
                        that a settlement agreement exists.</em> Since the court has not yet
                    made a finding of whether or not a settlement agreement exists between the
                    Appellant and the Respondent, cases where the existence of a settlement
                    agreement is not in dispute are relevant in so far as they analyse the rights of
                    the innocent party (including the issue of election) only <em>after</em> the court makes a finding that a settlement agreement
                    exists in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In the circumstances, it follows that all
                    three cases cited are neither relevant nor persuasive authority for us to decide
                    the present appeal. However, for completeness, we shall set out the specific
                    reasons as to why we are not persuaded by those three cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lam Fung-ying</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     
          <em>Lam Fung-ying</em> is
                    a decision by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal. The Respondent cited <em>Lam Fung-ying</em> as authority for the proposition that the
                    Appellant, having elected to prosecute the original action, could not later
                    resile from that election and set up the compromise instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In <em>Lam
                    Fung-ying</em>, settlement negotiations were entered into only after the
                    trial of the original cause of action had begun. The parties discussed
                    compromise in the middle of trial, and it was unclear on what terms the oral
                    compromise was reached. The plaintiff then tried to assert the compromise by
                    consent judgment in the original cause of action and this was denied by Master
                    Woolley. Instead of appealing against Master Woolley’s decision, the
                    plaintiff elected to proceed with the original cause of action. Subsequently,
                    the plaintiff then tried to institute fresh proceedings to set up the
                    compromise. The Hong Kong Court of Appeal held that the fresh proceedings should
                    be struck out on the basis that the plaintiff, having elected to pursue her
                    original claim rather than appeal against the Master Woolley’s finding,
                    could not now resile from that and set up the compromise instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     We agree with the outcome of the case.
                    Initially, the plaintiff thought that she had come to a compromise with the
                    defendant. However, when the plaintiff tried to enter a consent order, the
                    defendant resisted the order by alleging that no compromise had been reached.
                    Godfrey J held (at 190) that, in that situation, the plaintiff is faced
                    with three options, specifically:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Her first option was to accept the defendants’ repudiation of the
                        compromise and to get on, or attempt to get on, with the original action.
                        This was not ideal, for she would thereby lose the benefit of the compromise
                        which she had obtained (or, at any rate, thought that she had
                        obtained).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Her second option was to attempt to assert the compromise by seeking to
                        enforce it in the original action. This was not ideal, either; for, in the
                        absence of an endorsed consent summons, she might have difficulty in
                        persuading the court to make the appropriate order. ... And even if the
                        issue <em>was</em> decided in favour of the plaintiff,
                        it might be possible for the defendants, having lost on the issue, then to
                        go on to argue that the compromise had the effect, not of entitling the
                        plaintiff to an order in the terms of the proposed consent summons, but of
                        entitling the plaintiff merely to damages for breach of the compromise
                        agreement (a claim which she would be able to advance only in a fresh
                        action).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The plaintiff’s third option was to attempt to assert the compromise
                        in precisely that way; i.e. by bringing a fresh action against the
                        defendants for damages for breach of the compromise agreement. But this
                        would be even less satisfactory; for the plaintiff would have lost her right
                        to get on with her original action (if indeed that right had survived the
                        compromise agreement) and also her right to a consent order embodying the
                        terms which had been agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     With the greatest respect, we are unable to
                    agree with the Hong Kong Court of Appeal’s analysis of the
                    plaintiff’s options. We would have thought that, in so far as the first
                    option is concerned, if the plaintiff had chosen to accept the defendants’
                    repudiation of the compromise, she would not have lost the benefit of the
                    compromise because she would have been entitled to sue on the defendants’
                    repudiatory breach of the settlement to recover damages. Therefore, we reject
                    the Respondent’s submissions on this particular aspect of <em>Lam Fung-ying</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In any event, the above passage was strictly
                        <em>obiter</em> to the resolution of <em>Lam Fung-ying</em>. Indeed, by the time of the trial, the plaintiff
                    had already elected to proceed on the second of the three suggested options.
                    Godfrey J proceeded to hold (at 190) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first step the plaintiff took after the defendants repudiated the
                        compromise was to apply for a judgment on terms carrying into effect the
                        compromise agreement; <b><em>she went for the second
                            option</em></b>. But, on 23rd January 1992, Master Woolley rejected
                        her application. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>The plaintiff was now faced with another choice; i.e.
                            whether or not to appeal against Master Woolley’s refusal of her
                            application</em></b> or to write off the repudiated compromise and get
                        on with her original action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>She elected not to appeal against the decision of
                            Master Woolley. Instead, she elected to get on with her original
                            action</em></b> ...<b><em> The conduct of the plaintiff
                            just described is consistent only with an election</em></b> (it does
                        not matter whether it was wise or foolish, or even whether it was
                        permissible) <b><em>to get on with the original action rather
                            than to seek to assert the compromise.</em></b> By her conduct, too,
                        the plaintiff communicated her election to the defendants who, by giving the
                        particulars requested, accepted and acted on it, incurring costs in doing
                        so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But then the plaintiff had second thoughts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 1st April 1992, the plaintiff instituted the subsequent action, setting
                        up the compromise agreement and seeking to enforce it. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>In our judgment, this was a step which the plaintiff
                            was not entitled to take, having regard to her earlier election (in the
                            light of the defendants’ repudiation of the compromise agreement
                            and the master’s rejection of her application to enforce it) to
                            prosecute the original action.</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It is clear to us that the passages in bold
                    italics above form the <em>ratio decidendi</em> in
                        <em>Lam Fung-ying</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     We agree fully with the <em>ratio decidendi</em> in <em>Lam Fung-ying</em>.
                    By not appealing against Master Woolley’s decision, and by, instead,
                    reverting back to the original cause of action and taking active steps in those
                    proceedings, the plaintiff in <em>Lam Fung-ying</em> had
                    made an unequivocal election and was therefore estopped from subsequently
                    instituting fresh proceedings to set up the settlement. Indeed, when the
                    plaintiff in <em>Lam Fung-ying</em> purported to institute
                    fresh proceedings, the Court of Appeal struck out her claim on the basis of
                    abuse of process. This was because, so long as Master Woolley’s decision
                    stood, the settlement claim was bound to fail even if the amendment was
                    allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     However, we are of the view that the <em>ratio decidendi</em> in <em>Lam
                        Fung-ying</em> can be distinguished from the present appeal on the
                    following grounds. In <em>Lam Fung-ying</em>, Master
                    Woolley had already decided that there was no settlement between the parties,
                    and this decision constituted a binding judicial pronouncement on the merits of
                    an issue, <em>ie</em>, whether a settlement agreement was
                    reached. This must be contrasted with the present appeal, where there has not
                    been a judicial pronouncement on whether or not settlement has been
                    reached.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The distinguishing feature of <em>Lam Fung-ying</em> from the present case is that plaintiff in
                        <em>Lam Fung-ying</em> had an opportunity before Master
                    Woolley to be heard on her claim that there was an oral compromise. The fact
                    that Master Woolley found against her was irrelevant. This must be contrasted
                    once again with the present appeal, where the Appellant has not been heard on
                    the issue of whether or not a settlement agreement had been reached. In fact,
                    the actual trial has not even begun. One must not lose sight of the fact that
                    the Appellant is simply applying to amend his Statement of Claim in the context
                    of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In the circumstances, we are not persuaded
                    that <em>Lam Fung-ying</em> is relevant to the present
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Deman</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     
          <em>Deman</em> is a
                    decision by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The Respondent cited
                        <em>Deman</em> for the proposition that where an offer
                    to settle had been repudiated and where the plaintiff had continued his original
                    claim, the plaintiff did not have the option of pursuing the settlement
                    agreement as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     It should, however, be noted that the
                    existence of a settlement was not in dispute in <em>Deman</em>, where van Rensberg J held (at [23]-[24]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In my view the evidence is clear and beyond doubt that
                            the parties entered into a binding settlement agreement.</em>
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The defendants failed to perform their obligations
                            under the Settlement Agreement and instead took the position that there
                            was no enforceable agreement</em> because the Rompsen financing
                        had fallen through. Contradictory evidence was offered by the defendants on
                        this point. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Furthermore, whether or not the plaintiff in
                        <em>Deman</em> could enforce the settlement turned
                    chiefly upon the interpretation of Rule 49.09 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em> (RRO 1990, Reg 1994) in
                    Ontario: a rule which has no direct or close equivalent in Singapore. Therefore,
                    we are not persuaded that <em>Deman</em> is relevant in the
                    context of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Dilman Fulmar</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     We now turn to the third case relied upon by
                    the Respondent. The Respondent cited <em>Dilman
                    Fulmar</em>, a Singapore High Court decision, for the proposition that in
                    the event of a repudiation of a settlement agreement, the innocent party is
                    required to elect between suing on the settlement agreement and suing on the
                    original claim. We agree with the Respondent’s interpretation of what
                        <em>Dilman Fulmar</em> stands for. However, we do not,
                    with respect, see the relevance of that case to the present
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In <em>Dilman
                    Fulmar</em>, as in <em>Deman</em>, the existence of a
                    settlement was not an issue. The defendant in <em>Dilman
                        Fulmar</em> repudiated the settlement and on a true construction
                    certain clauses of the written settlement agreement, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J
                    held that the original claim could be revived by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The factual context in <em>Dilman Fulmar</em> is therefore quite different from that in the
                    present appeal. In particular, we emphasise once again that, in the present
                    appeal, the question as to whether a settlement exists has not yet been
                    resolved. Therefore, we are also not persuaded that <em>Dilman
                        Fulmar</em> is relevant in the context of the present
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that,
                    before a court determines the issue of whether or not a settlement exists
                    between the parties, the doctrine of election does not apply. This is precisely
                    the situation in the present appeal. We now turn to the four other issues raised
                    by the Respondent under the Second Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(b)   The issue of total failure of consideration</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     The Respondent submits that, by putting
                    himself in a position where it becomes impossible to perform his obligation, the
                    plaintiff is in repudiatory breach of the settlement. The Respondent further
                    submits that this amounts to total failure of consideration on the part of the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     We do not see, however, how this question of a
                    total failure of consideration can arise at this stage of the proceedings, which
                    relates only to the pleadings. In his original Statement of Claim, the
                    Appellant’s cause of action was based entirely on a trust, although facts
                    relating to a settlement negotiation were alluded to. When the matter came
                    before us in CA 93/2009, the Appellant sought to amend his Statement of
                    Claim by claiming, first, on a trust or, in the alternative, on the basis of a
                    settlement. Whilst we dismissed that appeal and did not allow the First Proposed
                    Amendment sought by the Appellant, we expressly stated (as noted above at
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>) that the dismissal of the appeal did
                    not preclude the Appellant from making further amendments (albeit not in exactly
                    the same form as those which were sought to be made in
                CA 93/2009).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Now, in the Second Proposed Amendment, the
                    Appellant wishes to amend his Statement of Claim to base his claim, firstly, on
                    an alleged settlement arrived at between the parties or, in the alternative, on
                    trust (which was, as noted above, the original claim) in the event that the
                    court should hold that there had been no such settlement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Looked at in this light, we are indeed
                    surprised that this particular ground (<em>viz</em>, total
                    failure of consideration) is being raised against the Second Proposed Amendment
                    at this stage of the proceedings. At no time hitherto in the proceedings below
                    (whether in the pleadings or in the affidavits filed) has the Respondent
                    asserted that a settlement had in fact been arrived at between the parties.
                    Neither has the Respondent alleged that he had either made or offered to make
                    payment to the Appellant pursuant to a settlement. In the present circumstances,
                    whether or not there was in fact such a settlement arrived at between the
                    parties would be the first issue to be decided at during the trial. If the court
                    should find that there had in fact been such a settlement, the next question to
                    be determined would be whether any party was in breach of it. Both these issues
                    are fact-sensitive. It is therefore, in our view, entirely premature to talk
                    about a total failure of consideration in relation to the alleged settlement at
                    this particular juncture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Although we have explained above how no issue
                    of failure of consideration would arise at this stage, we should, for
                    completeness, add an observation. The doctrine of total failure of consideration
                    operates as a restitutionary remedy enabling an innocent party to recover money
                    paid under a contract because, by virtue of the other party’s breach, the
                    innocent party has not enjoyed the benefit of any part of what it has bargained
                    for: see the oft-cited House of Lords decision in <em>Fibrosa
                        Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd</em>
                    [1943] AC 32. Under the common law, the failure of consideration must
                    be <em>total</em>, and not <em>partial</em>. Hence, assuming that it is established that a
                    settlement between the parties was arrived at and that the settlement sum had
                    been paid by the Respondent to the Appellant, the Respondent would need to
                    demonstrate that the Respondent has not enjoyed the benefit of any part of what
                    was intended under the settlement – in particular, that he has not enjoyed
                    the benefit of not being sued by the Appellant from the day the settlement was
                    allegedly concluded right up to the commencement of the present suit. This is
                    also a question of fact that ought to be placed before the trial
                judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(c)   The issue of “without prejudice”
                evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The procedural question in the present appeal
                    is whether the court can determine the issue of the existence of a settlement
                    within the same trial as the original cause of action. This issue is complicated
                    by the fact that “without prejudice” evidence can be adduced to at
                    the trial of the settlement to prove its existence, but not with respect to the
                    trial of the original cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Luk Por v Chau Kim Hung</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The Respondent cited <em>Luk
                        Por v Chau Kim Hung</em> [2001] 1 HKC 674 (“<em>Luk Por</em>”) for the proposition that it is most
                    undesirable that evidence of the “without prejudice” negotiations
                    should be admitted at the trial of the original action as it might well
                    prejudice the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     
          <em>Luk Por</em> is a
                    decision by the Hong Kong Court of First Instance. The plaintiff in <em>Luk Por</em> had a claim against the defendant and sued him
                    on the claim. The parties then enter into settlement negotiations during trial.
                    The plaintiff then applied to amend his pleadings to plead the new settlement
                    claim in the alternative. The defendant denied reaching settlement with the
                    plaintiff. The amendment was refused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The chief distinguishing feature of <em>Luk Por</em> from the present appeal is that the settlement
                    negotiations in <em>Luk Por</em> were entered into during
                    the trial of the original cause of action. Therefore, even if the settlement
                    existed, it did not exist as of the date of the plaintiff’s original
                    pleadings, and cannot be pleaded within the same action as the original cause of
                    action. As Sakhrani J rightly held (at 677A):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… this is the sort of situation which requires the plaintiff
                        to bring a fresh action to seek redress under the compromise between the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In addition, the plaintiffs in <em>Luk Por</em> pleaded the original claim as the primary claim,
                    and the settlement claim in the alternative. It is in this context that
                    Sakhrani J made the statement (at 677F) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is most undesirable that evidence of the ‘without
                        prejudice’ negotiations should be admitted at the trial of the
                        original action as it might well prejudice the defendant. The defendant
                        might also be cross examined on the settlement terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Sakhrani J is undoubtedly correct on this
                    point, because, quite apart from the issue of “without prejudice”
                    evidence, pleading in that order would result in embarrassment. Indeed, this was
                    that the Appellant attempted to do in his First Proposed Amendment, and this
                    court had already disallowed the amendment on the basis that it was not in
                    order. In fact, this court had expressly stated in the Addendum to
                    CA 93/2009 (above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Whether any “without prejudice” evidence (“the
                        contested evidence”) may be permitted to be adduced in the
                        proceedings would have to be determined in accordance with the general law
                        and in the light of any future amendments to pleading (if any) as may be
                        allowed. <em>For the avoidance of doubt we should state that
                            the dismissal of the appeal does not mean that we have ruled that the
                            contested evidence is inadmissible under any circumstances. We have only
                            determined that the contested evidence is inadmissible on the basis of
                            the existing pleadings.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Looking at the Second Proposed Amendment, the
                    Appellant has sought to bring <em>the settlement claim</em>
                    as his <em>primary</em> claim, and the original dividend
                    claim as his <em>alternative</em> claim. In our view, the
                    Second Proposed Amendment has cured the embarrassment that was inherent in the
                    original Statement of Claim. We fail to see how this equates to exploiting a
                    legal backdoor to the “without prejudice” rule in the manner
                    argued for by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Therefore, we are of the view that the
                    holdings in <em>Luk Por</em> are only relevant to the First
                    Proposed Amendment and are not relevant to the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Using “without prejudice” evidence to prove the fact
                that a settlement agreement exists</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The law is well-established inasmuch as, when
                    the issue is whether or not the negotiations resulted in an agreed settlement,
                    “without prejudice” evidence exchanged over the course of
                    negotiations is admissible at trial. <em>Foskett</em> (at
                    para 19-28) states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>The fact of
                        agreement</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One aspect of Hoffmann L.J.’s analysis that survives these
                        reservations is the proposition that <em>the evidence showing
                            that an agreement had been concluded is simply </em><em>relevant to a fact that needs to be proved and there is no
                            countervailing public policy requirement that the evidence to support
                            such a fact should be excluded.</em> On any analysis it has always
                        been the position that the contents of without prejudice negotiations can be
                        revealed and considered by the court if an issue arises as to whether an
                        agreement has been concluded. <em>The whole purpose of the
                            privilege would be negated if it were not possible to lift the veil on
                            the negotiations to determine whether an agreement had
                            crystallised.</em> If the result of that determination is that no
                        agreement was concluded, the veil can be drawn again over the contents of
                        the negotiations.</p>

                            the oft-cited English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Tomlin v Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd</em> [1969]
                            1 WLR 1378 (“<em>Tomlin</em>”), where Danckwerts LJ endorsed (at
                            1382-1383) the important <em>dicta</em> by
                            Lindley LJ in the (also) English Court of Appeal decision of
                                <em>Walker v Wilsher</em> (1889) 23 QBD
                            335). In <em>Walker v Wilsher</em>, Lindley LJ
                            had observed as follows (at 337):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">What is the meaning of the words ‘without prejudice’? I
                            think they mean without prejudice to the position of the writer of the
                            letter if the terms he proposes are not accepted. If the terms proposed
                            in the letter are accepted a complete contract is established, and the
                            letter, although written without prejudice, operates to alter the old
                            state of things and to establish a new one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Danckwerts LJ went on to hold in <em>Tomlin</em> (at 1383) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">That statement of Lindley L.J. is of great authority and seems to
                            me to apply exactly to the present case if, in fact, there was a binding
                            agreement, or an agreement intended to be binding, reached between the
                            parties, and, accordingly, it seems to me that not only was the court
                            entitled to look at the letters, though they were described as
                            ‘without prejudice,’ but it is quite possible (and, in fact,
                            the intention of the parties was) that there was a binding agreement
                            contained in that correspondence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It should be mentioned that, although Ormrod J dissented in <em>Tomlin</em>, this was only on the issue of application
                        and not principle. <em>Tomlin has, in fact, been cited and
                            applied in numerous English decisions (including Rush &amp; Tompkins at
                            1300 and Unilever at 2444). Indeed, this particular exception is firmly
                            established in the local context</em> (see, <em>eg</em>, Jeffrey Pinsler, <em>Singapore Court
                            Practice </em><em>2006</em> (LexisNexis,
                        2006) at para 24/3/10 (and the authorities cited therein) and <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 10(2)
                        (LexisNexis, 2006 Reissue) at para 120.430; general reference may also
                        be made, in the context of this particular exception, to Vaver (<a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> <em>supra</em>) at 143-147).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     From the foregoing analysis, it is clear that,
                    in Singapore, the “without prejudice” rule is not an absolute rule
                    and is subject to a number of exceptions, the most important being the exception
                    in <em>Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd v Greater London
                        Council</em> [1989] AC 1280. In our view, the
                    Appellant’s case falls squarely within this exception to the
                    “without prejudice” rule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Hence, if a judge finds that a settlement
                    agreement has not been concluded, the veil can be drawn over the “without
                    prejudice” evidence again. As a matter of procedure, if a trial judge who
                    is cognisant of the “without prejudice” evidence feels that he or
                    she is unable to exclude such evidence from his or her mind in the subsequent
                    trial of the original cause of action, he or she can recuse himself and have
                    another judge conduct the trial of the original cause of action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(d)   The policy issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The Respondent submits that allowing the
                    Second Proposed Amendment will have a chilling effect on settlement negotiations
                    in general; and therefore, as a matter of policy, the Second Proposed Amendment
                    should not be allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     We do not think that allowing the Second
                    Proposed Amendment in the present case would lead to the outcome suggested by
                    the Respondent. On the contrary, we are of view that by <em>not</em> allowing the Second Proposed Amendment, we would disturb an
                    entire line of local authority that makes it clear that there are certain
                    exceptions to the “without prejudice” rule, and this would lead to
                    a chilling effect on settlement negotiations in general. Therefore, we are not
                    persuaded by the submissions on this issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">(e)   The issue of estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Finally, the Respondent submits that having
                    been dragged through two years of litigation, it is now too late for the
                    Appellant to change his mind because he is estopped from doing so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In our view, such an argument is circular in
                    nature and therefore cannot be accepted. The fact that a party is seeking leave
                    to amend suggests that his pleading is defective and he wishes the cure the
                    defect. The other party cannot, as it were, put the cart before the horse and
                    resist the amendment on the basis that the original pleading is defective. The
                    rules that govern amendment of pleadings in this case are the rules stated in
                        <em>Wright Norman</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The law is trite that an amendment duly made
                    takes effect from the date of the original document which it amends. After the
                    amendment, the amended document will be taken to have existed in the amended
                    form right from the start. Indeed, Sakhrani J in <em>Luk
                        Por</em> held (at 677G to H) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is a further reason why the said amendment should not be allowed.
                            <em>It must be remembered that an amendment duly made
                            takes effect, not from the date when the amendment is made, but from the
                            date of the original document which it amends.</em> The original
                        statement of claim is dated 30 September 1997. As at that date the
                        cause of action based on the new claim under the settlement agreement did
                        not even exist. The settlement agreement is said to be made on 11 June
                        1999. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The amendment application also failed in
                        <em>Luk Por</em> because the settlement negotiations
                    were entered into <em>after</em> the plaintiff had sued on
                    the original cause of action, and therefore the settlement could not have been
                    pleaded together with the original cause of action in the same statement of
                    claim filed before the settlement negotiations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    However, in the present case, the alleged
                    settlement negotiations were entered into and concluded on 31 March 2009,
                        <em>before</em> the Appellant commenced Suit
                    No 453 of 2009 on 26 May 2009. If the Second Proposed Amendment was
                    allowed, there would be no problem of timing as there was in <em>Luk Por</em>. The amended pleading would be take effect from the date
                    of the original pleading, as if the pleading existed in the amended form right
                    from the start.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Hence, we cannot accept the
                    Respondent’s argument that it is now too late for the Appellant to turn
                    back via the Second Proposed Amendment. In fact, more than two years has passed
                    since the commencement of the suit, yet the actual trial has not even begun
                    because the Respondent has been valiantly resisting every single application of
                    the Appellant at the interlocutory stage. The Respondent cannot then set up this
                    resistance as a reason to deny the Appellant his day in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Third Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The law on striking out</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Even if an amendment is in order, the court
                    will not allow the amendment if it is obvious that the amended claim would be
                    struck out at trial. We pause to observe – parenthetically – that,
                    whilst the Respondent raised a whole battery of arguments in support of his
                    argument that the Appellant’s Second Proposed Amendment was an abuse of
                    the process of the court, the only substantive argument centred, in our view, on
                    Order 18 Rule 19 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    For ease of reference, the circumstances
                    under which a pleading can be struck out pursuant to Order 18 Rule 19
                    of the Rules of Court are set out, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Striking out pleadings and
                            endorsements (O. 18, r. 19)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>19.</b> —(1) The Court may at
                        any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any
                        pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in
                        any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as
                        the case may be;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the
                        action; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be
                        entered accordingly, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) No evidence shall be admissible on an application under
                            paragraph (1) (<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) This Rule shall, as far as applicable, apply to an
                        originating summons as if it were a pleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the Second Proposed Amendment ought to be struck
                out</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The Judge held that the Second Proposed
                    Amendment ought to be struck out pursuant to limbs (a) and (d) of
                    Order 18 Rule 19(1) (see generally the Judgment at [29]-[34]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Order 18 Rule 19(1)(a)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The Judge held that the claim for dividends
                    disclosed no reasonable cause of action because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_109-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Appellant had not taken a
                        consistent position in his affidavits as to whether or not he had accepted
                        an offer the $4.5 million or not; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_109-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Appellant had taken opposite positions on different
                        times with equal conviction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    We respectfully differ from the Judge with
                    regard to this aspect of his decision. The draconian power of the court to
                    strike out a claim at the interlocutory stage under limb (a) of
                    Order 18 Rule 19(1) can only be exercised when it is patently clear
                    that there is no reasonable cause of action on the face of the pleadings. The
                    mere fact that a case is weak and not likely to succeed is not a valid ground
                    for striking out a claim under this ground. In the Singapore High Court decision
                    of <em>Active Timber Agencies Pte Ltd v Allen &amp;
                        Gledhill</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 334, M P H
                    Rubin J held (at [13]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… On the subject of reasonable cause of action, cases
                        annotated in the <em>Supreme Court Practice</em> 1995
                        (see para 18/19/11) support the view that a reasonable cause of action
                        means a cause of action with some prospect of success when only the
                        allegations in the pleadings are considered (<em>per</em> Lord Pearson in <em>Drummond-Jackson v
                            British Medical Association</em> [1970]
                        1 All ER 1094 (CA)). <em>Another principle
                            enunciated by the courts over the years underpins the proposition that
                            so long as the statement of claim or the particulars disclose some cause
                            of action or raise some question to be decided by a judge or a jury, the
                            mere fact that the case is weak and not likely to succeed, is no ground
                            for striking it out.</em> The central point which seems to emerge
                        in all the decided cases is that the object of the rule is to stop cases
                        which ought not to be launched - cases which are <em>obviously unsustainable</em> or patently frivolous or vexatious
                        (see the observations of Lindley LJ in <em>Attorney
                            General of the Duchy of Lancaster v London And North Western Railway
                            Company</em> [1892] 3 Ch 274 at 277). [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The above principles were cited with
                    approval by this court in <em>The “Tokai
                        Maru”</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 646. Although that
                    case involved an application to strike out a defence, the principles enunciated
                    by this court are equally applicable to a statement of claim as well. It was
                    held (at [44]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…The hearing of the application should not therefore involve a
                        minute examination of the documents or the facts of the case in order to see
                        whether there is a reasonable defence. <em>To do that is to
                            usurp the position of the trial judge and the result is a trial in
                            chambers, on affidavits only, without discovery and without oral
                            evidence tested by cross-examination in the ordinary way</em> (see
                            <em>Wenlock v Moloney</em> [1965]
                        2 All ER 871). … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    Therefore, we consider the law relating to
                    Order 18 Rule 19(1)(a) to be relatively well established. We pause to
                    emphasise that the requirement under Order 18 Rule 19(1)(a) is strict.
                    The pleading itself must fail to make out a reasonable cause of action without
                    reference to other evidence before it can be struck out under limb (a).
                    Such is the rationale behind Order 18 Rule 19(2), which prevents
                    parties from adducing evidence on an application under Order 18
                    Rule 19(1)(a).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In our view, a reasonable cause of action is
                    disclosed on the face of the Second Proposed Amendment. It therefore follows
                    that the Second Proposed Amendment cannot be struck out under Order 18
                    Rule 19(1)(a) if we were to allow it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Order 18 Rule 19(1)(b)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    We are of the view that there is no issue
                    that the Second Proposed Amendment is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious within
                    the meaning of Order 18 Rule 19 (1)(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Order 18 Rule 19(1)(c)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The First Proposed Amendment was disallowed
                    on the basis that it was legally embarrassing. By pleading the dividend claim as
                    the primary claim and the settlement claim in the alternative, the Appellant had
                    put himself in a legally embarrassing position because, after the court rules on
                    the original cause of action, the court cannot then proceed to rule on the
                    settlement claim. A judicial pronouncement on the original cause of action is
                    premised upon the absence of a settlement. Regardless of the outcome of the
                    ruling on the original cause of action, the Appellant cannot subsequently sue on
                    the settlement after obtaining judgment on the original cause of
                action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    An amendment that purports to do the above
                    is undoubtedly embarrassing. However, we are of view that, by reversing the
                    order of the claims and pleading the claims in the alternative, the Second
                    Proposed Amendment has cured the embarrassment. Hence, Order 18
                    Rule 19(1)(c) does not apply in the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Order 18 Rule 19(1)(d)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Besides holding that the amendment disclosed
                    no reasonable cause of action, the Judge also held that the application to make
                    the Second Proposed Amendment was an abuse of process because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_a"></a>(a)     after the First Proposed Amendment
                        was rejected by the Court of Appeal, the Appellant simply reversed the order
                        of the claims and filed the Second Proposed Amendment;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Appellant
                        has equivocated over the negotiations and the settlement since May 2009, and
                        has taken contradictory positions without regard to consistency and
                        credibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    We respectfully disagree with the Judge on
                    this aspect of his decision as well, because the Appellant did not simply
                    reverse the order of the claims, but rather, as we have explained at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>–<a href="#p1_41">[41]</a> above, it is clear in the Second Proposed Amendment that
                    the two causes of action are being pleaded <em>in the
                        alternative</em>, with the relevant facts in support of these causes
                    of action being pleaded separately.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Furthermore, taking inconsistent positions
                    at different points during negotiations as shown in the affidavit only affects
                    the fact finding exercise at trial, and is not, <em>per
                        se</em>, an abuse of the process of court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    In the circumstances, we are of view that
                    the Second Proposed Amendment does not constitute an abuse of the process of the
                    court within the meaning of Order 18
                Rule 19 (1)(d).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    For the reasons set out above, we allow the
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    With regard to the issue of costs, however,
                    we note that, by framing his respective causes of action in the way he did at
                    the outset, the Appellant was, in part, the author of the manner in which the
                    present events unfolded, culminating in the present appeal. That said, the
                    present appeal was also due, in part, to the Respondent’s
                    misinterpretation of the Addendum issued by this court in
                    CA 93/2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In the circumstances, therefore, we order
                    that the Respondent pay the Appellant half of the Appellant’s costs of the
                    present appeal. There will be no order as to costs with regard to the
                    proceedings before the Judge and the AR. The usual consequential orders are to
                    apply.</p>
