The Alleged Overarching Agreement was for the Plaintiff to sell 90,000,000 shares in Sincap Group Limited (“SGL”), which was a majority and controlling stake, to Zheng and his company, Evancarl, so that Zheng can execute a reverse takeover (the “RTO”) of SGL. After this RTO has been executed, the Defendants were to procure the transfer of SGL’s shares in two of its subsidiaries, Beijing Sino-Lonther International Trading Co Ltd (“SL”) and Shandong Luneng Taishan Mining Co Ltd (“LTM”), to the Plaintiff. Zheng was also to procure the transfer of 12,226,500 SGL shares to the Plaintiff, in order for the Plaintiff to hold 50,000,000 SGL shares ultimately. The Plaintiff contends that these obligations were reduced to writing in two sale and purchase agreements, two procurement agreements, and a deed in which Zheng personally guaranteed Evancarl’s procurement obligations. The subject matter of the dispute concerns the obligations under the two procurement agreements and the deed (collectively “the Disputed Written Agreements”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Subsequently, the Plaintiff transferred his entire shareholding in a company he controlled, which owned 45,999,900 SGL shares, to one Simson Kwok. The Plaintiff also transferred 44,000,100 SGL shares to one Joseph Yeo. The Plaintiff claims that this was in performance of the two sale and purchase agreements. Accordingly, the Plaintiff claims that Simson Kwok and Joseph Yeo are Zheng’s nominees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Because the Defendants allegedly did not perform their alleged obligations under the Disputed Written Agreements, the Plaintiff commenced this action against them for breach of contract and claims, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, damages arising therefrom.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Zheng denies the existence of the Alleged Overarching Agreement. He only accepts that there was a sale and purchase agreement for 45,000,000 SGL shares between him and the Plaintiff, and Simson Kwok was indeed his nominee. Zheng claims that he purchased SGL shares merely because he thought that their value would rise over time. He claims that Joseph Yeo is not his nominee. Zheng argues that, although he did sign the Disputed Written Agreements, he did so merely as a favour to the Plaintiff; the Disputed Written Agreements were thus not intended to be performed. Zheng also argues that the Disputed Written Agreements were illegal and thus void and unenforceable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The Plaintiff is a businessman.

Zheng was therefore incentivised to contemplate an RTO at the time of entering into the Written Agreements and would have likely done so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Indeed, Zheng’s testimony at trial also indicates that he had intended to effect an RTO through SGL.

These purported creditors were worried that the Plaintiff would sell his SGL shares and leave China for good without repaying them. Hence, the Disputed Written Agreements were to be signed “as a comfort to these Chinese backers”.

</div> Even more strangely, when questioned about his lack of reaction, Zheng’s response was that he felt that he did not need to react to it and that he did not think that the Plaintiff would dare to initiate a lawsuit. Legal proceedings are serious and expensive matters, and one would expect anyone to react to receiving a letter of demand.  If Zheng had indeed done the Plaintiff a favour in signing these sham agreements, one would have expected that he would have reacted strongly to such a brazen betrayal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For the above reasons, I am not convinced that the Disputed Written Agreements were sham agreements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Joseph Yeo was the Defendants’ nominee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The issue of whether Joseph Yeo was the Defendants’ nominee affects whether the 2nd SPA is indeed part of the five Written Agreements constituting the Alleged Overarching Agreement.

</div>
</div> but I find that the plaintiff has discharged this burden on the facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 To begin with, I have found above at [62] that the parties contemplated that Zheng would implement an RTO using SGL at the time of entering into the Written Agreements. It follows that Zheng would require a majority and controlling stake in SGL to do so. The 1st SPA alone would not grant Zheng sufficient shares in this regard. Hence, it is likely that Joseph Yeo was Zheng’s nominee, such that the 2nd SPA would grant Zheng sufficient shares to constitute a majority and controlling stake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 For the avoidance of doubt, my reasoning in the preceding paragraph does not put the cart before the horse. I am alive to the possibility that, conversely, finding that Joseph Yeo was Zheng’s nominee could support finding that the parties had contemplated an RTO when entering into the Written Agreements. However, I arrived at my finding at [62] without having to consider whether Joseph Yeo was Zheng’s nominee, as the extant evidence was already sufficient. Having made this finding, it follows that it is likely that Joseph Yeo was Zheng’s nominee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I am fortified, in my view, by the manner in which the 1st and 2nd SPA were performed. As the Plaintiff submits, the number of SGL shares actually transferred to Simson Kwok and Joseph Yeo of 45,999,900 and 44,000,100 respectively did not correspond with the 1st and 2nd SPA which each contemplated the sale of 45,000,000 shares.

</div>
</div> Nevertheless, the two amounts of shares actually transferred add up neatly to 90,000,000 shares. The Plaintiff submits that this manner of transfer evidences that Zheng, being the ultimate buyer of the 90,000,000 shares, had the freedom to decide how he wanted to allocate the shares among his nominees. I agree with this submission. It could be said, to Zheng’s benefit, that <span class="font-italic">both parties</span> wanted the transfer of the specific number of 45,999,900 SGL shares simply because it was expedient to procure the transfer of the entire shareholding of Estelle to Zheng’s nominee, Simson Kwok, such that Zheng would receive the beneficial interest of the same (see [27] above). This is consistent with Zheng’s explanation for having received this specific number of shares.

</div> However, one should crucially note that 44,000,100 shares neatly make up the remainder of the 90,000,000 shares.

</div> Contrary to Zheng’s testimony, the Plaintiff submits that the use of a cashier’s order indicates that it was likely that it was <span class="font-italic">Zheng</span> who had procured the cashier’s order. I find that there is some force to the Plaintiff’s submission. If Joseph Yeo was indeed purchasing SGL shares for his own use, it would be most convenient to make his payment using a cheque. However, if he was purchasing these shares to hold it for Zheng’s benefit, it is plausible that Zheng or someone under Zheng’s control would have purchased a cashier’s order to ensure that the monies are ultimately transferred to the Plaintiff. A cashier’s order would prevent situations where Joseph Yeo could have made off with the monies after Zheng has transferred them to him. For example, after Zheng has transferred the sum to him, Joseph Yeo could issue a cheque to the Plaintiff, but withdraw the sum before the cheque is cleared. Hence, I find that the use of a cashier’s order does support the Plaintiff’s case. I also note that the discrepancy of S$50 between the amount stated in the cashier’s order (S$2,444,500) and the amount that Zheng alleged (S$2,444,450)

</div> This is because the Plaintiff has acknowledged that the PRC Subsidiaries were worth about S$10,000,000, which is more than the S$6,000,000 stipulated under the LD clause, which the Defendants were liable to pay on breach.

</div> It therefore follows that 1st  Procurement Agreement was not meant to be performed. I do not see the merit in this argument.  The Plaintiff may have valued the PRC Subsidiaries at S$10,000,000 but the parties have agreed that the quantum of the liquidated damages should be set at S$6,000,000, which is a sum that is not unreasonable in the circumstances.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Secondly, the Defendants argue that since the Written Agreements were negotiated through Ng, Ng’s testimony is needed for the Plaintiff to prove his case.

</div> It is thus clear that the Defendants rely on Ng’s testimony more heavily than the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Thirdly, the Defendants submit that the 1st SPA, the 2nd SPA, and the 1st Procurement Agreement contain entire agreement clauses and these clauses effectively erase any legal consequences that might have ensued from prior discussions or negotiations and signify that the contractual relationship between parties is now circumscribed by the signed agreements and those alone (<span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 537 at [28]). Accordingly, pre-contractual negotiations cannot be referred to and no party can rely on any term not contained within these agreements. In my view, this submission is irrelevant. The Plaintiff’s case is that the Alleged Overarching Agreement was “the backdrop leading to the five Written Agreements, and the Plaintiff is suing the Defendants on the clear terms under the 1st and 2nd Procurement Agreements and the Deed”.

Perhaps the only argument in favour of the Defendants is that the Plaintiff did not explain why he wanted to retain the specific number of 50,000,000 SGL shares ultimately.

</div> Firstly, the Defendants entered into the 1st and 2nd Procurement Agreements in consideration of the Plaintiff entering into the 1st SPA with Evancarl.

The series of correspondence leading up to the signing of the POA and the Waiver Letter between the plaintiff and the defendant demonstrated that both parties had originally been locked in a dispute, but subsequently wished to work out an amicable solution on the basis of a friendship that they once enjoyed.

</div> Accordingly, they argue that the requirement of delivery was not satisfied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In <span class="font-italic">Unitrack Building Construction Pte Ltd v GHL Pte Ltd</span> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 967, the High Court canvassed the law on delivery of deeds at [18]–[21] and approved of the position set out in English textbooks and decisions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">18 GHL wrote in for further arguments and I heard parties again on 23 February 1999. The thrust of the submission by GHL’s counsel this time was on the aspect of “delivery”. Citing passages from textbooks and a number of decisions from England, counsel argued that it was not necessary that the deed be actually delivered to the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">intended beneficiary</span>. The learning referred to me included a passage from para 1329 of <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of England</span> vol 12 (Butterworths, 4th Ed) which reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In order to be effective a deed must be delivered as the act and deed of the party expressed to be bound by it, as well as sealed. <span class="font-italic">No special form or observance is necessary for the delivery of a deed, and it may be made in words or by conduct</span>. <span class="font-italic">The usual form of delivering a deed by words is for the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">executing party</span><span class="font-italic"> to say, while putting his finger on the seal, ‘I deliver this as my act and deed’.</span> It is <span class="font-italic">not necessary, however, to follow this form of execution</span>; <span class="font-italic">nor is it necessary that the deed should actually be delivered over into the possession or custody either of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">person intended to take the benefit of the deed</span><span class="font-italic">, or to a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">third person to the use of the party taking the benefit of the deed</span>; though if the party to be bound so hands over the deed, that is sufficient delivery without any words.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">What is essential to delivery of the document as a deed is that <span class="font-italic">the party whose deed the document is expressed to be (having first sealed it) shall by words or conduct expressly or impliedly acknowledge his intention to be immediately and unconditionally bound by the provisions contained in it.</span> Thus, where a deed has been executed by an attorney in excess of his power, a subsequent acknowledgement by the principal, whether oral or in writing, that the deed expresses his intentions amounts to a delivery or re-delivery of the deed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19 Similarly in <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (27th Ed) para 1-031, it is stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘Where a contract is to be by deed, there must be a delivery to perfect it.’ ‘Delivered,’ however, in this connection does not mean ‘handed over’ to the other party. It means <span class="font-italic">delivered in the old legal sense</span>, namely, <span class="font-italic">an act done </span><span class="font-italic">so as to evince an intention to be bound</span>. Any act of the party which shows that he intended to deliver the deed as an instrument binding on him is enough. He must make it his deed and recognise it as presently binding on him. <span class="font-italic">Delivery is effective even though the grantor retains the deed in his own possession</span>. There need be no actual transfer of possession to the other party: ‘the efficacy of a deed depends on its being <span class="font-italic">sealed and delivered </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">by the maker of it</span>, <span class="font-italic">not on his ceasing to retain possession of it</span>.’ Where a solicitor or licensed conveyancer in the course of a transaction involving the disposition or creation of an interest in land, purports to deliver an instrument as a deed on behalf of a party to the instrument, it shall be conclusively presumed in favour of a purchaser that he is authorised so to deliver the instrument.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20 In <span class="font-italic">Vincent v Premo Enterprises (Voucher Sales) Ltd</span> [1969] 2 QB 609 at 619, CA, a case concerning a lease document, Lord Denning MR observed:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The law as to ‘delivery’ of a deed is of ancient date. But it is reasonably clear. A deed is very different from a contract. On a contract for the sale of land, the contract is not binding on the parties until they have exchanged their parts. But with a deed it is different. <span class="font-italic">A deed is binding on the maker of it, even though the parts have not been exchanged, </span><span class="font-italic">as long as it has been signed, sealed and delivered. ‘Delivery’ in this connection does not mean ‘handed over’ to the other side. It means delivered in the old legal sense, namely, an act done so as to evince an intention to be bound.</span> <span class="font-italic">Even though the deed remains in the possession of the maker, or of his solicitor, he is </span><span class="font-italic">bound by it if he has done some act evincing an intention to be bound, as by saying: ‘I deliver this my act and deed.’</span> He may, however, make the ‘delivery’ conditional: in which case the deed is called an ‘escrow’ which becomes binding when the condition is fulfilled.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 The authorities referred to above cannot be second-guessed. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics and in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">From the above extract, it is apparent that: (a) the onus is on the executing party to procure delivery to the intended beneficiary and (b) delivery simply requires an act done so as to evince an intention to be bound, so delivery can be effected even if the deed remains in the possession of the executing party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Given that the Deed is Zheng’s personal guarantee of Evancarl’s obligations to the Plaintiff, the onus is on <span class="font-italic">Zheng</span> as the executing party to deliver the Deed to <span class="font-italic">the Plaintiff</span>, the intended beneficiary.

I briefly summarise the legal position below:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first stage of the inquiry is to ascertain whether the contract was prohibited either pursuant to a statute (expressly or impliedly) and/or an established head of common law public policy. If the contract is thus prohibited, there could be no recovery pursuant to the illegal contract.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) This strict position at the first stage of the inquiry is subject to an important caveat that was elucidated in <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span>. In <span class="font-italic">Ting Siew May</span>, it was recognised that there was a broad and general category of contracts illegal at common law comprising contracts which were not unlawful <span class="font-italic">per se</span> but entered into with the object of committing an illegal act.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Whether a contract falls under this category depends on the intention of one or both of the contracting parties to break the law at the time the contract was made. It includes:</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(A) contracts entered into with the object of using the subject matter of the contract for an illegal purpose;</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(B) contracts entered into with the intention of using the contractual documentation for an illegal purpose;</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(C) contracts which were intended to be performed in an illegal manner; and</div><div class="Judg-4 mb-3 text-justify">(D) contracts entered into with the intention of contravening a statutory provision, although not prohibited by that provision <span class="font-italic">per se</span>.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) It is only in this category that the principle of proportionality applies to determine if the contract was enforceable. In other words, the principle of proportionality does not apply where there was statutory illegality that prohibited the contract concerned and/or a situation under common law illegality where the contract was prohibited under any of the established heads of common law public policy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At the second stage of the inquiry, a party who had transferred benefits pursuant to the illegal contract might be able to recover those benefits on a restitutionary basis (as opposed to recovery of full contractual damages). There were three possible legal avenues for such recovery: (a) not <span class="font-italic">in pari delicto</span>, (b) <span class="font-italic">locus poenitentiae</span>, and (c) independent cause of action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 160(1) of the Companies Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I deal with s 160(1) of the Companies Act first.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 Section 160 of the Companies Act states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">160.—(1) Notwithstanding anything in a company’s constitution, the directors shall not carry into effect any proposals for disposing of the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s undertaking or property unless those proposals have been approved by the company in general meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Citing <span class="font-italic">KJ Kim Company (Pte) Ltd v Buck &amp; Company (Pte) Ltd</span> [1997] SGHC 166, the Defendants argue that s 160(1) of the Companies Act “was directly intended to target situations such as the present, where parties would agree to the disposal of a company’s assets to an extent that would prevent it from carrying on its business”.

</div> Presumably the Defendants are referring to the 1st Procurement Agreement in which the PRC Subsidiaries are to be transferred to the Plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The Alleged Overarching Agreement, specifically the 1st Procurement Agreement, obliges Evancarl to procure the transfer of the shares in the PRC Subsidiaries to the Plaintiff.  Zheng would have to perform this obligation as Evancarl’s sole director. However, the 1st Procurement Agreement does not oblige Evancarl and by extension, Zheng, to do so without complying with the relevant law. It is up to Zheng to fulfil this obligation in full compliance with any regulatory or legal requirement. So, if it is necessary to get the approval of the company in a general meeting under s 160(1) of the Companies Act, it is for Zheng to secure such approval. Indeed, cl 3.1 of the 1st Procurement Agreement requires Evancarl to obtain the approval of concerned stakeholders and to obtain any consent required for that purpose.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The market price rule is set out in the Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">Auston International Group Ltd and another v Ng Swee Hua </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 628 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Hua</span>”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 In that case, the first appellant was a company listed on the Singapore Exchange, while the second appellant was its wholly-owned subsidiary. By an investment agreement dated 15 December 2005, the appellants agreed to issue to the respondent convertible bonds of an aggregate principal of S$200,000 which were convertible into shares of the first or second appellants or a combination of both. The investment agreement also provided that the respondent’s existing loan of $200,000 to the first appellant would be utilised as consideration for the bonds. On 3 November 2006, the respondent sent a conversion notice to the appellants directing them to procure the issuance of 5,000,000 ordinary shares of the first appellant to a securities account designated by the respondent. The first appellant failed to issue the shares to the respondent, and the respondent sued the appellants for breach of the investment agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judge’s finding that the appellants had breached their obligation under the investment agreement in failing to issue the shares to the respondent (at [37]). However, the Court of Appeal did not agree with the trial judge’s decision that damages be assessed on the basis of the loss of chance. Instead, the Court of Appeal held (at [39] and [42]–[43]) that this was an ordinary case of breach of contract for failing to deliver shares, and the normal measure of damages would be based on the market price of the shares at the contractual time for delivery:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">39 In the present case, the respondent’s loss as a result of his being deprived of his conversion was due to a <span class="font-italic">breach of contract by the appellants</span>: it had nothing to do with the hypothetical action of a third party. This is an <span class="font-italic">ordinary case of </span><span class="font-italic">breach of contract for failing to deliver shares</span>. The respondent did not lose any chance to acquire the Conversion Shares and thereafter sell them at a higher price at a later date because he could have gone into the market upon breach to purchase the equivalent 5m Auston shares. His loss, if any, would be the difference between the total cost of purchasing 5m Auston shares in the market and $200,000. The issue the court will have to decide is the relevant date on which the respondent should have gone into the market to buy 5m Auston shares.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">42 The general principles applicable in determining damages on the seller’s failure to deliver securities are set out in <span class="font-italic">McGregor</span> where the point is made (at para 24-003) that <span class="font-italic">“[t]he normal measure of damages is the market price of the shares at the contractual time for delivery less the contract price”</span>. <span class="font-italic">This would represent</span> <span class="font-italic">the amount that the buyer must obtain to put himself in the position he would have been in had the contract been performed, since to do so he must purchase equivalent shares in the market</span> (at para 24-003). It is also observed that the cases that have been adjudicated upon “indicate an application of [such] common principles while at the same time bringing out small differences” (<span class="font-italic">McGregor</span> at para 24-005). Thus, <span class="font-italic">the date of breach may be postponed if the seller had sought more time to issue the shares and the buyer was willing to grant such indulgence, and the market price on the postponed date will therefore be the relevant one</span> (<span class="font-italic">at para 24-005</span>, citing <span class="font-italic">Wilson v London and Globe Finance Corp</span> (1897) 14 TLR 15). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether these principles apply depend on the facts of the cases on which they were based</span>. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43 <span class="font-italic">What this date is depends on the facts</span>. In the present case, there appears to be some evidence on record indicating that the appellants had asked the respondent for time to sort out the problem of getting shareholders’ approval, which the respondent appeared to have agreed to, although it led to nothing. Nevertheless, the period of indulgence given by the respondent <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">may</span> have to be factored into determining the relevant date for the respondent to go into the market to purchase the shares (see <span class="font-italic">McGregor</span> at para 24-005).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics and in italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The above extracts further elucidate that: (a) the market price of the shares is determined using the time at which the plaintiff could have himself bought the shares from the market and (b) depending on the facts at hand, the date of the defendant’s breach can be postponed by a period of indulgence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where the defendant sought more time to procure the shares and the plaintiff was willing to grant such time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Three issues arise from the foregoing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The first issue is: is the market price rule applicable? Zheng clearly disagrees as he submits that the Plaintiff is merely entitled to nominal damages since the Plaintiff allegedly has not proven damage at all.

On the other hand, a <span class="font-italic">control premium</span> may be applied if the said block of shares would give the buyer the ability to affect (or extract) value from the company in one way or another: <span class="font-italic">Oei Hong Leo</span><span class="font-italic">ng</span> at [84]. In this regard, expert evidence is required but has not been adduced. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 Zheng also oddly submits that, because Zheng paid S$5,000,000 for 90,000,000 SGL shares, the shares are valued at S$0.055 per share (calculated by straightforward division using the two figures).

</div> It is unclear what the significance of this alleged share price is, but Zheng concludes that it supports the understanding that the Plaintiff’s case is really that these shares were sold to Zheng outright, with the proviso that Zheng would ensure that the Plaintiff will receive the shares for free by 30 April 2015.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 In my judgment, the above submissions are without merit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 To begin with, it follows from my finding that the Alleged Overarching Agreement exists that the Plaintiff does not strictly receive the 12,226,500 SGL shares <span class="font-italic">for free</span> under the 2nd Procurement Agreement. It has to be borne in mind that the 2nd Procurement Agreement was entered into in consideration of the Plaintiff entering into the 1st SPA with Evancarl. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 Next, the Plaintiff’s submissions on the market price rule squarely address the issue of his expectation loss, since it “represent[s] the amount that the buyer must obtain to put himself in the position he would have been in had the contract been performed, since to do so he must purchase equivalent shares in the market” (<span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Hua</span> at [42]). Furthermore, <span class="font-italic">Ng Swee Hua</span> concerns the defendant’s failure to procure the issuing of shares by a stipulated date; I find these facts are analogous to the present case, which concerns the failure to procure the transfer of shares by a stipulated date. Hence, <span class="font-italic">p</span><span class="font-italic">rima facie</span>, the market price rule is applicable on the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I turn to consider whether a control premium or block discount on the share price is applicable.

</div> I accept this submission, which is against his interests. As for a block discount, Zheng argues that the situation here is that of a sale of shares (as opposed to a purchase of shares), because “the Plaintiff is seeking a money sum to place him in the position he would have been in if the agreement had not been breached”. Thus, Zheng submits that the relevant question is: what would the Plaintiff have been able to <span class="font-italic">sell</span> the shares for had Zheng performed the 2nd Procurement Agreement? This submission is wrong. The Plaintiff’s case is that he wanted to eventually <span class="font-italic">retain</span> 50,000,000 SGL shares ultimately,

Hence, as he rightly submits, the situation here involves the situation of a <span class="font-italic">purchase</span> of a block of shares (as opposed to a <span class="font-italic">sale</span>), and the question is whether a premium ought to be applied.

Here, the Plaintiff could not have bought SGL shares on the date of Zheng’s breach, 30 April 2015. He could only do so on the next trading day, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 4 May 2015.

The Plaintiff acknowledges that he had given the Zheng time to comply with his obligation under the 2nd Procurement Agreement. However, he argues that there is no need to factor this period in to postpone the date at which the market price should be determined, because these indulgences were extended on a without prejudice basis, in his letter of demand to Zheng dated 19 October 2015.

Suit No 298 of 2019</span></em></p>
<p><span>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the General Division of the High Court (delivered by Justice Lee Seiu Kin):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome: High Court awards over S$7 million in damages for breach of two share procurement agreements and a deed.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Pertinent and significant points of the judgment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Where a party pleads an overarching agreement as merely forming the background facts to the written agreements, this agreement is not a separate agreement: at [86].</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">From the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Lim Zhipeng v Seow Suat Thin and another matter</em> [2020] 2 SLR 1151, a person who has executed a document that states it has been “signed, sealed and delivered” would, in the usual course, be estopped from denying the sealing if he has delivered the document to the other party knowing that the latter will rely on the document and that party did indeed rely on it to its detriment; for a party to rely on this argument, that party would have to first plead estoppel. However, that party cannot be expected to plead estoppel if the other party did not first plead that the deed was not sealed: at [107].</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The onus is on the executing party to deliver a deed to the intended beneficiary to satisfy the requisite formalities of a deed, and the latter does not have to further procure the delivery of the deed back to the former: at [109] to [111].</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In a case of breach of contract for failing to deliver shares by a stipulated date, the measure of damages would be based on the market price of the shares at the contractual time of delivery as a starting point: at [134] to [145].</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The issue of whether a premium reflecting the party’s control over the company in purchasing of a controlling stake should be applied on top of the market price of the shares can only be decided with the aid of expert evidence: [146].</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Where one party agrees to grant the other party in breach of his obligations under the contract more time to fulfil those obligations on a without prejudice basis, that additional period of time will not be taken into account when determining the date at of the applicable market price: at [148].</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Background to the dispute</strong></p>
<p><span>1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The plaintiff, Fu Hao, had a majority and controlling stake in Sincap Group Limited (“SGL”), which was the holding company of Beijing Sino-Lonther International Trading Co., Ltd (“SL”) and Shandong Luneng Taishan Mining Co., Ltd (“LTM”).</span></p>
<p><span>2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The plaintiff claims that there were five written agreements (“Written Agreements”) concluded pursuant to an overarching agreement (“Alleged Overarching Agreement”). Under two sale and purchase agreements (the “1<sup>st</sup> SPA” and “2<sup>nd</sup> SPA” respectively), the plaintiff was to sell 90,000,000 SGL shares, which was a majority and controlling stake to Zheng Jiabin (“Zheng”) and his company, Evancarl Limited (“Evancarl”), the defendants. The purpose of this sale was for Zheng to execute a reverse takeover of SGL (“RTO”). Thereafter, under one of the Written Agreements known as the “1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreement”, Evancarl was to procure the transfer of SGL’s shares in SL and LTM to the plaintiff. Zheng personally guaranteed this obligation under a deed (“Deed”). Under another one of the Written Agreements known as the “2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement”, Zheng was to procure the transfer of 12,226,500 SGL shares to the plaintiff.</span></p>
<p><span>3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Subsequently, the plaintiff transferred his entire shareholding in another company that he controlled, which owned 45,999,900 SGL shares, to one Simson Kwok. The plaintiff also transferred 44,000,100 SGL shares to one Joseph Yeo. The plaintiff claims that this was in performance of the 1<sup>st</sup> SPA and 2<sup>nd</sup> SPA, and that Simson Kwok and Joseph Yeo are Zheng’s nominees.</span></p>
<p><span>4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Because the defendants did not perform their obligations under the 1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreement, 2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement, and the Deed, the plaintiff commenced an action in breach of contract against the defendants and claims damages arising therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span>5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Zheng denied the existence of the Alleged Overarching Agreement. He only accepted that the existence of the 1<sup>st</sup> SPA and that Simson Kwok was his nominee. He claimed that the 1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreement, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement, and the Deed were sham agreements. In the alternative, he claimed that they were illegal and thus void and enforceable.</span></p>
<p><span>6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>As for the issue of damages, the defendants did not dispute the applicability of the damages clause and the liquidated damages clause in the 1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreement, which was cll 3.3 and 5 of that agreement respectively. However, they did dispute the applicability of the damages clause in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement, which was cl 8 of that agreement. They submitted that cl 8 was unenforceable for want of certainty because it provided for the “actual cost” of the plaintiff acquiring the 12,226,500 SGL shares in the shortest possible time from the market, but the plaintiff did not actually go to acquire these shares from the market. Thus, an issue arose to the applicable measure of damages if cl 8 did not apply.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The court’s decision</strong></span></p>
<p><span>7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court found that the Alleged Overarching Agreement exists: at [87]. The evidence showed that (a) the parties did contemplate that an RTO would be implemented by Zheng using SGL at the time of entering into the Written Agreements, (b) the 1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreements were not sham agreements, and (c) Joseph Yeo was the defendants’ nominee: at [62], [71] and [82]. </span></p>
<p><span>8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>It was important to note that the Alleged Overarching Agreement was the backdrop leading to the five Written Agreements, so the defendants’ argument premised on entire agreement clauses in some of these agreements was a non-starter: at [86].</span></p>
<p><span>9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Because the Alleged Overarching Agreement exists, the court found that the parties did enter into the 1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreement, 2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement, and the Deed with the intention to be bound: at [90] to [93].</span></p>
<p><span>10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court found that no situation of past consideration invalidating the 1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreement, 2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement and the Deed arises. It was sufficient that the agreements were entered into contemporaneously, <em>ie</em>, at or around the same time: at [94] to [103].</span></p>
<p><span>11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court found that the Deed was valid because it was signed, sealed and delivered. The defendants dispute the sealing and the delivery of the Deed. </span></p>
<p><span>12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>In respect of sealing, the defendants did not plead this point and that was sufficient to dispose of the issue: at [106]. Nevertheless, the court made an observation regarding one of the defendants’ arguments at trial. In the Court of Appeal’s decision <em>Lim Zhipeng v Seow Suat Thin and another matter</em> [2020] 2 SLR 1151, a person who has executed a document that states it has been “signed, sealed and delivered” would, in the usual course, be estopped from denying the sealing if he has delivered the document to the other party knowing that the latter will rely on the document and that party did indeed rely on it to its detriment. In that case, the court stated that for a party to rely on this argument, that party would have to first plead estoppel. Here, because the defendants did not plead that the Deed was not sealed to begin with, there was no need for the plaintiff to rely on an estoppel: at [107].</span></p>
<p><span>13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>In respect of delivery, the court found that the onus was on Zheng, the executing party, to deliver the Deed to the plaintiff, the intended beneficiary, and the latter did not have to further procure the delivery of the deed back to the former: [109] to [111].</span></p>
<p><span>14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court found that the Alleged Overarching Agreement is not illegal as Zheng was obliged to fulfil his obligations under the 1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreement, 2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement, and the Deed in full compliance with any regulatory or legal requirement: at [118] and [120].</span></p>
<p><span>15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>From the above, the court found that the 1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreement, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement and the Deed, were breached: at [121] to [123].</span></p>
<p><span>16<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>In respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreement and the Deed, it was undisputed the quantum of damages was provided by cll 3.3 and 5 of the 1<sup>st</sup> Procurement Agreement. This yielded a sum of $6,416,589 that was due and payable: at [124] to [129].</span></p>
<p><span>17<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>In respect of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement, the court held that, regardless of whether cl 8 applied, the applicable measure of damages was the same. </span></p>
<p><span>18<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>As a starting point, the measure of damages would be computed using the market price of the SGL at the date of the breach: at [134] to [145]. </span></p>
<p><span>19<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Next, a control premium or a block discount was not applicable on the facts. A control premium would be applied to a purchase of shares where these shares would give the buyer the ability to affect or extract value from one way or another. A block discount would be applied to a sale of shares where the block is so large relative to normal trading volume that either an instant sale would be at a discounted price compared to the prevailing market or else it would take a long time to sell. The plaintiff conceded that whether a control premium was applicable can only be decided with the aid of expert evidence: at [146]. The issue of whether a block discount should be applied did not arise in this case as the facts concerned the purchase of shares by the plaintiff, as opposed to a sale: at [146].</span></p>
<p><span>20<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Lastly, there was no need to postpone the date at which the market price is determined even though the plaintiff allowed Zheng additional time to comply with his obligations under the 2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement. This was because the plaintiff did so on a without prejudice basis, and had thereby reserved his right to argue that the date of breach was the relevant date for determining the market price of the SGL shares: at [147] to [148].</span></p>
<p><span>21<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court thus found that the quantum of damages flowing from the breach of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Procurement Agreement was S$806,949: at [149].</span></p>
<p><span>22<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court awarded the total sum of S$7,223,538 in damages to the plaintiff, with interest on that sum: at [150].</span></p>
