<strong>Judgment</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><u><strong>(Costs)</strong></u></font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">1.    When we delivered our judgment on 21 November 2001, we had

reservations whether the general rule that costs follow the event should apply in the circumstances

of this case. We therefore invited counsel to submit written arguments on the question of costs.

Accordingly, written arguments from counsel were submitted, which we have now considered.</p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">2.     We

think that there are good reasons why we should not apply the general rule here with regard to costs

here and below. In the proceedings below, BNP raised numerous claims against the respondents, which

took up a great deal of the time and occasioned considerable costs. In our view, their claims

against the respondents for dishonestly assisting Gary to commit a breach of his fiduciary duties to

BNP, for procuring Gary to commit a breach of contract, for conspiracy to injure BNP, and for breach

of duty by the respondents to BNP, had no merits and should not have been raised at all. These heads

of claim formed a very substantial part of what they had pleaded in the amended statement of claim.

From the judgment below, it appears that lengthy arguments had been addressed to the judge on these

claims. Instead, BNP should have focussed their attention on the following issues: (i) whether the

respondents knew or were aware that Gary was carrying out the transactions in question in their

names and for their account, and (ii) whether Gary had actual and/or apparent authority to carry out

such transactions.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">3.     In

our judgment, BNP had raised claims and issues which unnecessarily protracted proceedings below and

added to the complexity of those proceedings. In the circumstances, they should not be allowed the

whole of the costs below. We would award BNP only 25% of the costs below. We so order.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">4.    

Before us, counsel for BNP submits that a certificate of two counsel under O 59, r 19 should be

allowed on the ground that the appeal involved complex issues of fact and law, and the documents and

record of the trial were voluminous. We do not agree. We did not find any complex issues of fact or

law raised in the appeal. The main issues were the two referred to in  2 on which we said that BNP

should have focussed their attention. It is true that the documents and record of the trial were

voluminous, but that was due substantially to the manner in which BNP had presented their case

below. Further, a great deal of the documents before us consisted of forms of acknowledgements and

confirmations, which in substance were repetitive.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">5.    

Next, counsel for BNP seeks an unusual order. Shee Chin and Nancy were separately represented by

solicitors and counsel in the proceedings below and before us, and on that ground counsel for BNP

asked that their clients be awarded a set each of costs against Shee Chin and Nancy. It is

best we set out their arguments verbatim:

<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">
<p align="justify">7. This is on the basis that the Respondents chose two separate sets of

  solicitors even though they were, essentially, running the same defence and the Appellant had to

  meet two separate submissions and cases.</p>
<p align="justify">8. In fact, the Respondents were each awarded a separate set of costs of the

  trial and the same should be applied against them when the appeal has been allowed. The Appellant

  relies on the case of <i><b>Lim Heng Hoo v Tan Hock Hai &amp; Ors</b></i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=32897&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1976] 2 MLJ 159</a>.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">This argument has absolutely no merit, and we have no hesitation in rejecting it.

The respondents, though separately represented, raised the same defences in law. Their interests in

the proceedings coincided and no separate issues were raised. The position would still be the same,

if they were both represented by the same solicitors and counsel. There was no reason to award to

BNP a separate set of costs payable by each of the respondents.</p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">6.     We

now come to the issue of whether BNP should be allowed the full costs of the appeal. In the

Appellants Case, and also in the arguments before us, BNP still maintained their claim against

the respondents for dishonestly assisting Gary in committing a breach his fiduciary duties to BNP

and devoted a substantial part of the arguments on that issue. As we have said, this claim had no

merit. It unnecessarily incurred costs and added to the complexity of the appeal.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">7.    

Lastly, although BNP in their Case dealt at great length with the facts showing that the respondents

knew or were aware that Gary was carrying out the transactions in question in their names and for

their account, on the issue of law on the actual and apparent authority, we did not find that BNP

provided much assistance. No authorities were cited by them in support of their arguments on the

question of actual or apparent authority.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">8.     In

all the circumstances, we would allow BNP only 40% of the costs of the appeal. We so order. There

will be the usual consequential order for the refund to BNP or their solicitors of the deposit in

court, with interest, if any.</font>
