DECISION</u><em>

                   

Curia Advisari Vult</em></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p></p></font><font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">1        This

appeal raises the single issue as to whether a developer of a condominium is obliged under

s 37(4)(b) of the Land Titles Strata Act, Cap 158 (LTSA) or any other law, to surrender

the original accounting records and contracts relating to the maintenance fund to the

management corporation (MC), after the latter has been established. At the High Court, Lai

Siu Chiu J ruled in favour of the MC, the respondent in this appeal.</font>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The facts</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2        The

appellants, Regenthill Properties Pte Ltd (Regenthill), were the developers of a

condominium located along Yio Chu Kang Road known as "Regent Park Development".

By the end of December 1996 the construction of the condominium was completed. On 6

January 1997, a temporary occupation permit (TOP) for the condominium was issued by the

relevant authority. The effect of the issue of the TOP was that the subsidiary proprietors

were obliged and did pay contributions to a maintenance fund which Regenthill were

required to set up under s 9 of the Building and Common Property (Maintenance and

Management) Act (BCP Act).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3        On 20 April

1998, pursuant to s 33 of the LTSA, the MC for the condominium was constituted. Its first

annual meeting was held on 6 May 2000. Shortly after, Regenthill handed over to the MC all

the documents (including accounting documents) in respect of the period after the

constitution of the MC. The dispute concerns the documents relating to the maintenance

fund for the period from TOP to the formation of the MC.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4        We should

explain here that even after the establishment of the MC, the developer is still obliged

under s 34 of the LTSA to undertake the following duties:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) open a bank account in the name of the

  MC;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) cause to be kept such accounting and

  other records as well, inter alia, as would sufficiently explain the transactions and

  financial position of the MC up to the first annual general meeting.</font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The rationale for this provision would

appear to be the recognition by the legislature that while a MC might have been set up it

may not have, until the first AGM, the means to discharge its duties. Thus the developer

is made to operate the MC account.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5        There are

therefore three distinct periods which one has to bear in mind:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) first period : from TOP to the

  establishment of the MC where contributions by subsidiary proprietors are paid into a

  maintenance fund managed by the developer.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) second period : from the

  establishment of the MC up to approximately the holding of the first AGM, where

  contributions are paid by the subsidiary proprietor into an account in the name of the MC

  but managed by the developer.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) third period : on and after the

  first AGM: the MC will assume all charge of the financial affairs of the condominium.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6        On 11 January

2001, the solicitors for the MC wrote to Regenthill, asking, pursuant to s 37(4) of the

Act, for the delivery of the following documents:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) all plans, specifications,

  certificates (other than certificates of title for lots), diagrams and other documents

  obtained or received by you and relating to the parcel or building; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) if they are in your possession or

  under your control, any notices or other records relating to the subdivided building.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7        In response to

Regenthill’s request for particulars of the documents, the solicitor for the MC

furnished a list. This was followed by a series of correspondence between them. The upshot

of it all was that the parties could not agree whether the MC is entitled to the originals

of the accounting records relating to the management fund (the first period). They

included payment vouchers, journal vouchers, cash book, cheque butts, bank statements

(current and multi-link), financial statements, invoice, official receipt, accounts

receivable, audit reports, fixed deposit slips/statements and bank-in slips. Regenthill

even sought the assistance of the Commissioner of Buildings (under the BCP Act) on the

dispute but the latter was not able to assist. Eventually, Regenthill indicated that they

were prepared to allow the MC to inspect the accounting documents at their premises but

the documents could not be transferred as the property in the documents remained vested in

them.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8        It soon became

inevitable that the MC had to file an Originating Summons to have the issue determined,

which it did. At the hearing, the MC also orally asked for the contracts relating to

various matters (cleaning, security, management and staff). Giving it a purposive

interpretation, the judge ruled that most of the documents asked for by the MC came within

the scope of s 37(4)(b). She said:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"On a purposive interpretation, it is

  hard to envisage that Parliament, in enacting the section, intended only for documents

  such as plans, certificates and diagrams and other documents <i>ejusdem generis</i> with

  this class of documents to be handed over to the management corporations. Under the Act,

  upon the formation of a management corporation, the same takes over control, management

  and administration of the common property as well as its records and accounts. In order to

  properly exercise its powers and perform its duties and functions, a management

  corporation would need to have possession of necessary records relating to the subdivided

  building, including accounting records."</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9        The trial

judge held that the originals of the following documents be delivered to the MC:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Contract on cleaning services</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Contract on Security</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Water and electricity bills</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Contract on management fees</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(e) Contract on staff costs</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(f) Printing/stationery and postages</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) payment vouchers</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) journal vouchers</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) cash book (soft copies or print out

  copies)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) invoices/statements</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(v) official receipts</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(vi) accounts receivables/interest

  computation</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(vii) fixed deposit slips (photocopies

  only)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(viii) bank-in slips</font></p>
</ol>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Issues</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10        The

substantive issue formulated by Regenthill is as follows:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Whether Regenthill are obliged under

  s 37(4) to deliver up the original copies of the contracts and accounting records relating

  to the maintenance fund to the MC."</font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Regenthill accept that they are obliged in

law to allow the MC to inspect the accounting records and to make copies thereof. So the

battle line is drawn on just the narrower issue as to whether Regenthill are obliged to

hand over the originals of the accounting documents to the MC.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11        However,

beside this, Regenthill have also raised two preliminary/procedural issues, which they

also did in the hearing below. First, they say that the Originating Summons (OS)

instituting the proceeding is flawed because it did not identify the specific classes of

documents which the MC would want Regenthill to deliver, thus contravening O 7 r 3(1) of

the Rules of Court. Second, they contend that the MC does not have the right to commence

an action under s 37(4). Before the court below, both issues failed. We shall deal with

them in turn.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Regularity of OS</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12        To determine

this issue, it is necessary for us to set out the provisions of O 7 r 3(1) as well as the

precise formulation of the OS:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"3(1) Every originating summons must

  include a statement of the questions on which the plaintiff seeks the determination or

  direction of the Court or, as the case may be, a concise statement of the relief or remedy

  claimed in the proceedings begun by the originating summons with sufficient particulars to

  identify the cause or causes of action in respect of which the plaintiff claims that

  relief or remedy."</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13        In the OS,

after reciting ss 37(4), 65 and 121 of the LTSA at the heading, the MC sought an order to

compel Regenthill to deliver the following:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"(i) all plans, specifications,

  certificates (other than certificates of titles for the lots), diagrams and other

  documents obtained or received by the Defendants relating to Regent Park Condominium;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) any notices or other records relating

  to Regent Park Condominium, other than any such documents which exclusively evidence

  rights or obligations of the Defendants and which are not capable of being used for the

  benefit of the Plaintiffs or any of the subsidiary proprietors, other than the

  Defendants."</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14        Essentially,

the point made by Regenthill is that the OS only stated in very vague and broad terms what

the MC wanted and did not identify the specific classes of documents which Regenthill are

required to deliver. They relied upon the High Court decision in <i>Engineering

Construction Pte Ltd v AG</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=6729&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1993] 1 SLR 390</a>.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15        It will be

seen that under O 7 r 3(1) there are two alternative manners in which a plaintiff in an OS

could formulate his case. One is to include a statement as to the question on which the

court’s determination is sought (first limb). The other is to set out concisely the

relief or remedy claimed, with sufficient particulars to identify the cause or causes of

action (second limb). Having regard to the manner in which the present OS is formulated it

is clear that it does not fall under the first limb.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16        The question

is: does the OS, as filed, fulfil the second limb? Regenthill contend that it was only in

the affidavit filed in support of the OS did the MC list out the classes of document which

the MC wanted. They submit that these particulars should have been stated in the OS. While

in a broad sense the basis of the claim is indicated, as the OS has cited s 37(4), we

would agree with Regenthill that the relief claimed lacks sufficient particulars.

Comparing the two prayers in the OS with s 37(4) (set out later at 29), it is apparent

that the MC had merely copied the provisions of that section. It should have identified

the classes of documents which it required Regenthill to deliver. It did this only in the

affidavit in support. Any person reading the OS would not know the specific types of

documents which the MC is seeking. Accordingly, the OS is defective. The fact that the

specifics were given in the affidavit does not cure the defect.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17        As indicated

in 9 above, six additional classes of documents, besides those set out in the affidavit,

were also asked for orally at the time of the hearing and in respect of which an order was

granted by the court below. Although the appellants had lodged the appeal, they had

nevertheless on 26 December 2001 handed these six classes of document to the MC.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18        What then is

the effect of non-compliance with O 7 r 3(1)? The answer is to be found in O 2 r 1(1)

which provides that "where, … there has, by reason of anything done or left

undone, been a failure to comply with the requirements of these Rules, whether in respect

of … form or content … the failure shall be treated as an irregularity and shall

not nullify the proceedings." Under r 1(2), where there is such a failure, the court

may set aside the proceeding wholly or allow amendments to be made.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19        In the court

below, the judge seemed to think that the OS is in order. She said:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"In my view, the plaintiffs, in

  listing down the types of accounting documents which they required, had given sufficient

  particulars to identify the cause of action in the originating summons. It would be most

  unreasonable to require the plaintiffs to further itemise every single specific document

  in the categories which they had listed, as the plaintiffs could not be expected to be

  able to identify specific documents which were not in their possession."</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20        With respect,

we think she misunderstood the contention of Regenthill. From the passage cited above, it

is clear that she thought Regenthill were saying that particulars of each document should

be set out in the OS when they were only asking that the categories or classes of document

be set out, as the MC did in its affidavit in support.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21        Be that as it

may, there are two reasons why this objection has to be rejected. First, under O 2 r 2, it

is provided that an application to set aside for irregularity "shall not be allowed

unless it is made within a reasonable time and before the party applying has taken any

fresh step after becoming aware of the irregularity." Regenthill should have objected

upon being served with the OS. Instead, they proceeded to file their substantive affidavit

in response. Having taken a "fresh step" in the proceeding, it shall be deemed

that they had waived that irregularity; see <i>Rein v Stein</i> (1892) 66 LT 469 at 471

and <i>Ong Heok &amp; Anor v Ooi Bee Tat &amp; Ors </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=37086&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1982] 2 MLJ 326</a>. It was too late

to raise it at the time of the hearing.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22        Second, even

if the point was raised timely, the court would not have exercised its discretion to set

aside the OS for non-compliance. Although spelling out in the affidavit the classes of

document required to be delivered does not regularise a defective OS, it nevertheless does

indicate clearly to the defendants what the plaintiff, in fact, wants. Such an

irregularity is in no sense serious. As far as Regenthill were concerned, they were not

prejudiced. They knew the case they had to meet notwithstanding that the MC even made some

oral additions at the hearing. We find support for this approach from the case, <i>Metroinvest

Ansalt v Commercial Union</i> [1985] 1 WLR 514, where Cumming-Bruce LJ said,</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"I would say that in most cases the

  way in which the court exercises its powers under Order 2, rule 1(2) is likely to depend

  upon whether it appears that the opposite party has suffered prejudice as a direct

  consequence of the particular irregularity, that is to say, the particular failure to

  comply with the rules. But I would construe Order 2, rule 1(2) as being so framed as to

  give the court the widest possible power in order to do justice …"</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23        We are

confident that if the judge had not misunderstood the point taken, she would have given

leave to the MC to amend, as we ourselves would be inclined to do. But the proceedings

having come to this stage, we see no point in granting leave to the MC to amend.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24        The case <i>Engineering

Construction,</i> relied on by Regenthill, concerned proceedings relating to the

construction of a contract. There, on the facts, the High Court held that the originating

summons contained enough particulars to identify the cause of action as it referred to a

contractual clause in issue and the relief sought.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Right to institute proceedings</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25        This point

rests entirely on s 39 of the Interpretation Act which provides that –</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The imposition of a penalty by any

  written law, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, shall not relieve any

  person from liability to answer for damages to a person injured."</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">26        Regenthill

argued that this section implies that, where there is criminal sanction for contravention

of a written law, like s 37(4) read with s 37(8), no civil suit may be brought by any

other person unless the latter has been injured or suffered damages. In the present case,

as it has not been alleged that the MC was injured or suffered damages the MC are,

therefore, not entitled to commence the present action.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">27        This point is

wholly without merit and was rightly rejected by the court below. It is based on a

misunderstanding of the scope of s 39. This section is merely a provision to clarify

matters. It does not seek to take away the rights of any party. We endorse the following

views expressed by the judge (except in relation to the scope of s 37(4) which will be

dealt with next):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"In my view, s 39 of the

  Interpretation Act is merely a clarification provision which makes it clear that even when

  there is an imposition of penalty, civil recovery is not necessarily denied. However, it

  does not mean that only when there are damages, would one be allowed to bring a civil

  action. Section 37(4) of the Act imposes a duty on the proprietor of the land to hand over

  certain documents to the management corporation. In this case, the cause of action lies in

  requiring the delivery-up of documents which the plaintiffs believed to fall within the

  ambit of s 37(4). Section 39 of the Interpretation Act should not be used to limit the

  positive obligation found in s 37(4) of the Act to deliver up documents required by the

  management corporation, otherwise, the provision would be rendered otiose when it was

  meant for the party entitled to the documents i.e., the management corporation to sue for

  the same. The plaintiffs need not show that damages have been suffered before they can

  bring this application."</font></p>

</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">28        We now turn

to the substantive question of this appeal. The problem arose because under the LTSA,

subsidiary proprietors of units in a condominium are allowed to take possession when the

temporary occupation permit (TOP) is issued by the relevant authorities. Between the issue

of the TOP and the establishment of the MC, the developer is required to establish a

maintenance fund, into which contributions from the subsidiary proprietors of the units

within the condominium are to be paid and which fund is to be used for the maintenance of

the undivided building and the common property. Once the MC is established, it will take

over the functions of the developer in that regard and the developer shall transfer any

remaining money in the maintenance fund to the MC: see ss 9 and 10 of BCP Act and s 34 of

the LTSA.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">29        As the issue

concerns the interpretation of s 37(4) of the LTSA, we shall set it out in full:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The proprietor of the land comprised in a

  strata title plan shall deliver to the management corporation at its first annual general

  meeting –</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) all plans, specifications,

    certificates (other than certificates of title for the lots), diagrams and other documents

    obtained or received by him and relating to the parcel or building, and,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) if they are in his possession or under

    his control, any notices or other records relating to the subdivided building.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">other than any such documents which

  exclusively evidence rights or obligations of the proprietor and which are not capable of

  being used for the benefit of the management corporation or any of the subsidiary

  proprietors, other than the proprietor."</font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The judge found that the accounting

documents requested came within the ambit of s 37(4)(b). </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">30        Before us the

main contention of Regenthill is that the accounting documents relating to the maintenance

fund are not "notices or other records relating to the subdivided building"

within s 37(4)(b). They say that the maintenance fund is for the upkeep of the common

property and the subdivided property and as s 37(4)(b) only refers to notices and other

documents relating to the subdivided building, that clearly indicates that documents

relating to the common property and the maintenance fund are not within contemplation.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">31        They pointed

out that "subdivided building" is defined in the LTSA to mean any one or more

buildings comprised in a strata subdivision plan approved by the relevant authority. On

the other hand "common property" is defined as –</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"(a) in relation to subdivided

  buildings in an approved plan bearing the title of "condominium" and issued by

  the relevant authority, means so much of the land for the time being not comprised in any

  lot shown in a strata title plan or in any parts of any building unit (partially erected

  or to be erected) intended to be included as lots in a strata title plan to be lodged with

  the Registrar after strata subdivision of the building unit has been approved by the

  relevant authority;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) unless otherwise described

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(i) foundations, columns, beams, supports,

  walls, roofs, lobbies, corridors, stairs, stairways, fire escapes, entrances and exits of

  the building and windows installed in the external walls of the building;"</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">32        From these

definitions, Regenthill contended that while the "subdivided building" would

include some parts of the common property, it does not encompass all the common property.

The maintenance fund required to be set up by the developer as provided in s 9 of the BCP

Act is intended for maintenance of the "subdivided building" and "common

property". As non-compliance with s 37(4) would attract penal sanction, a strict

interpretation should be adopted. Regenthill also refer to the equivalent New South Wales

provisions to support their contention.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">33        We must, at

this stage, point out that this argument, based on the distinction between

"subdivided building" and "common property" was not taken at the

hearing below. It is a new point. Before the judge, the contention centred on the

application of the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule to the construction of s 37(4). Having said

that, it does not mean that this argument, which is a point of law, may not be raised in

this appeal (see O 57 r 9A[4]).</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Common property" and

"subdivided building’</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">34        Central to

the contention of the appellants is the issue whether there is a difference between

"subdivided building" and "common property". As defined, a subdivided

building effectively refers to any building in a strata title plan. Of course, a building

would include, <i>inter alia</i>, foundations, columns beams, walls, roofs, lobby,

corridors, stairways. As these are also part of the common property as defined, it is true

to say that a subdivided building or buildings would include some parts of the common

property. But as not all the common property in a strata title plan is found in a

subdivided building, and notwithstanding some overlap, the two terms are distinct

concepts. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">35        Section 34(a)

of the LTSA refers to the maintenance fund set up by the developer as being a fund

"for the maintenance of the subdivided building and the common property".

Clearly the draftsman of the LTSA viewed the "subdivided building" as being

distinct from the "common property", even though some parts of the

"undivided property" are also common property. This distinction is also

maintained in section 35(1) of the LTSA which refers to contributions made by subsidiary

proprietors to the MC for the maintenance of the subdivided building and the common

property. There are, therefore, merits in the argument that if the draftsman had intended

to refer to the maintenance fund he would have referred to the common property as well,

instead of only the subdivided building. Indeed, if the accounts of the maintenance fund

were contemplated, there is no reason why the draftsman would not refer expressly to the

maintenance fund.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">36        We are

reinforced in this view when we trace the source of s 37(4). It was added to the LTSA in

1987. Indeed the entire Part IV of the LTSA on "Management of the Subdivided

Building" was revised extensively and re-enacted by the 1987 Amendment Act. Section

37(4) would appear to have been modelled after s 57(4) of the New South Wales Strata Tiles

Act (NSW Act). The initial version of s 57(4) (1973 version) reads:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"An original proprietor shall not

  fail or neglect to deliver to the body corporate at its first annual general meeting

  –</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) all plans, specifications,

  certificates (other than certificates of title for lots), diagrams and other documents

  (including policies of insurance) obtained or received by him and relating to the parcel

  or building; and </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) If they are in his possession or under

  his control, <i>the certificate of title for the common property, the strata roll, the

  books of account</i> and any notices or other records relating to the <i>strata scheme.</i></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">other than any such documents which

  exclusively evidence rights or obligations of the original proprietor and which are not

  capable of being used for the benefit of the body corporate or any of the proprietors,

  other than the original proprietor." (emphasis added).</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">37        In 1984, s

57(4)(b) of the NSW Act was amended, and a new subsection 4(c) added, as follows:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"(b) if they are in his possession or

  under his control, the certificates of title for the common property, the strata roll and

  any notices or other records relating to the strata scheme; and </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) the accounting records kept pursuant

  to s 68(1)(g) and the last preceding financial statements prepared in accordance with s

  68(1)(h) …</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">38        At the time

our Parliament enacted the revised Part IV and added s 37(4), it would have been aware of

the two versions of the NSW provisions. It would appear that the draftsman chose to follow

the 1973 version but deleting the reference to "certificate of title for the common

property, the strata roll, the books of account." The term "strata scheme"

is defined in the NSW Act to cover the whole scheme of development, including "the

manner of division … of a parcel into lots and into lots and common property."

It seems to us that the equivalent to "strata scheme" in our Act is "strata

title plan". Why did the draftsman delete the reference to "books of

account"? Why did it adopt just "subdivided building" instead of

"subdivided building and common property" or "strata title plan"?

Obviously, he must have had something different in mind. After all, just a couple of

sections before [in ss 34(a) and 35(1)] the draftsman had referred to "subdivided

building and common property".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">39        In any case,

looking at s 37(4) as a whole, in relation to both limbs (a) and (b) therein, it seems to

us clear that the subsection has nothing to do with the maintenance fund or the

maintenance of the common property. It has all to do with title, rights and designs of the

condominium and subdivided building. We also think it rather odd that the draftsman would

have referred to the accounting documents relating to the maintenance fund as "any

notices or other records relating to the subdivided building."</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">40        For

completeness, we would add that we agree with the judge below that those same accounting

documents could not, applying the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule, come within the meaning of

"other documents" in limb (a) of s 37(4).</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Common Law</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">41        It will be

recalled that it is s 9 of the BCP Act which requires the developer to set up a

maintenance fund upon the issuance of TOP. Section 10(2) of the BCP Act provides that the

developer shall hold all moneys in the maintenance fund on trust for the subsidiary

proprietors. Section 10(4) requires the developer to transfer the surplus moneys in the

maintenance fund to the MC upon its establishment. However, s 10 does not state what would

be the position with regard to the accounting documents relating to the maintenance fund.

It seems to us that the answer is to be found in common law. We would be inclined to think

that s 10(4) of the BCP Act and s 34(a) of the LTSA only provide for the transfer of the

money in the maintenance fund to the MC upon its establishment because the position of the

accounting documents in relation thereto is abundantly clear under general principles.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">42        The judge

below who also relied upon general principles to order Regenthill to release the documents

said:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">As trustee of the maintenance fund, a

  developer would have to be accountable to the owners and purchasers of all the flats in a

  condominium for the monies in the maintenance fund. As representative of the owners and

  purchasers of all the flats in the condominium, the properly constituted management

  corporation has a right to ensure such accountability on the part of the developer. </font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">43        Regenthill

argued that the judge below had over-extended the duty of a trustee as far as delivering

trust documents is concerned. They said that a beneficiary is only entitled to see and

inspect the accounts and if he wants a copy he must pay for it. For this proposition they

relied on <i>Ottley v Gilby</i> (1845) 8 Beav 602. They also relied on a passage in <i>Hanbury

&amp; Martin on Modern Equity (14<sup>th</sup> Edn)</i> at p. 539 where this principle is

recited.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">44        With respect,

we think that counsel for Regenthill has misapplied <i>Ottley v Gilby </i>to the fact

situation in the present case. Here is not a case where a beneficiary requests to see the

accounts of the trust or the delivery of trust documents. The true position here is that

the MC has become the new trustee in place of Regenthill and is asking for all documents

relating to the trust. In as much as moneys in a trust do not belong to the trustee (in

this case Regenthill), so are the documents of the trust. Trust assets would include trust

documents.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">45        While there

could be some difficulties in defining "trust documents", as recognised by

Salmon LJ in <i>In Re Londonderby’s Settlement</i> [1965] 918 at 938, he nevertheless

ventured to suggest that they would have these common characteristics:-</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) they are documents in the possession

  of the trustees as trustees; (2) they contain information about the trust which the

  beneficiaries are entitled to know; (3) the beneficiaries have a proprietary interest in

  the documents and, accordingly, are entitled to see them."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">There cannot be any dispute that all three

characteristics are satisfied in relation to the documents of account asked for by the MC.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">46        Under s 10(4)

of the BCP Act, upon the establishment of the MC, Regenthill were obliged to pay into the

bank account of the MC the surplus moneys in the maintenance fund. This means that

trusteeship has come to an end and all moneys and related documents must be passed over to

the successor trustee. It stands to reason that the MC, as the person stepping into the

shoes of Regenthill, should be entitled to have all the records of the trust. The

following passage in Regenthill’s Case demonstrates that they have miscomprehended

the position:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">If the Appellants are obliged to hand over

  the original accounting documents before the constitution of the Respondents by reason

  that they are trustees of the maintenance moneys, this would mean that each and every

  subsidiary proprietor will be entitled to ask for delivery up of the original accounting

  documents as the monies in the maintenance fund is held on trust for owners and purchasers

  of all the flats in the development according to s 10(2) of the BCPMMA. Surely, this

  cannot be correct and could impose an administratively onerous and impossible burden on

  the Appellants since condominiums may have hundreds of units. Hence, the Appellants submit

  that at best, the owners, subsidiary proprietors and/or the Respondents are only entitled

  to inspection of these records and should they require copies, to be furnished copies. The

  originals of these accounting records should remain with the Developers.</font></p>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The MC is not a "beneficiary" or

"subsidiary proprietor".</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">47        It is settled

law that the new trustees are entitled to all the documents of the trust. <i>Lewis on

Trusts (17<sup>th</sup> Edn)</i> states at 12-55 that "a new trustee is entitled to

require the outgoing trustees to deliver up to him all records, books and other papers

belonging to the trust" and cites in support of this proposition the case <i>Tiger v

Barclays Bank Ltd</i> [1952] 1 All ER 85.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">48        In <i>Wentworth

v De Monsfort &amp; Ors</i> [1988] 15 NSWLR 348, the Court of Appeal of New South Wales

held that where a solicitor was acting only as an agent for a client who was his principal

in the doing of some act, the ordinary rules of agency applied to him and a document

brought into existence or received by him when so acting belonged to the client. Hope JA

said (at 356):-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Normally when a trustee ceases to hold

  office, either on appointment of a new trustee or the determination of the trust, he would

  be required to handover all trust property, including documents and financial records, to

  the new trustee, or to the sole beneficiary or all the beneficiaries if more than one, if

  required to do so. In <i>Re Cowin</i> (1886) 33 Ch D 179 at 185, North J quoted with

  approval the following passage in <i>Lewin on Trusts</i>, 8<sup>th</sup> ed (1885) at 975:

  "All documents held by the trustee in that character must be produced by him to the <i>cestuis

  que trust</i>, who in equity are the true owners." This position would generally

  apply to a trustee who is a solicitor, but there are important qualifications in some

  cases. If he is solicitor for the client as well as trustee, he is required by law (as I

  shall describe later) to maintain and to retain proper financial records. He is entitled

  to retain these records, some of which may refer to other clients as well as the trust but

  the beneficiary should be provided with copies if asked for.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">49        Counsel for

Regenthill argues that the situation here comes within the exception referred to by Hope

JA. For this contention, Regenthill rely upon s 10(5) of the BCP Act which provides:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The developer shall –</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) cause proper books of accounts to be

  kept in respect of all sums of money received for and all payments out of the maintenance

  fund, specifying the matters in relation to which the receipts and expenditure take place;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) file with the Commissioner a certified

  true copy of the audited accounts within 28 days of the accounts being audited;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) permit the Commissioner, or any person

  authorised by him to act on his behalf, at all reasonable times full and free access to

  accounting and other records of the maintenance fund and permit the Commissioner or the

  person to make copies or make extracts from those accounting or other records; and </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(e) furnish a certified true copy of the

  accounts to the Commissioner at such intervals as may be required by the Commissioner.</font></p>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">50        It would

appear that the exception referred to by Hope JA is a narrow one and relates to the

special position of a solicitor. Here Regenthill were trustees simpliciter of the

maintenance fund although the trust was imposed under the BCP Act. While it is true that

under s 10(5), the Commissioner had the responsibility of ensuring that Regenthill

discharged their duties of trustee properly, this, in our view, must relate to the period

while Regenthill were the trustees of the fund. Upon the closure of the maintenance fund,

with the moneys therein being transferred to the account of the MC, the trusteeship ended.

At that point, Regenthill must hand everything relating to the trust, including the

documents, to the MC and account to the MC in respect of the transactions effected while

the maintenance fund was under their stewardship.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">51        It seems to

us clear that s 10(5) is to ensure that the interests of the subsidiary proprietors are

protected during the interim period between the issue of the TOP and the constitution of

the MC. While we see that s 10 of the BCP Act does not deal expressly with the question of

the accounting documents of the trust, it is our opinion that this point is not expressly

addressed because it is a settled principle that where there is a change of stewardship,

the documents of account of a trust must follow the trust and be delivered to the new

trustee. We agree with the following observations of the judge below:-</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"… a plain reading of s 10(5) of

  the Management Act makes it patently clear that it does not impose any obligation on the

  developer to keep the accounts continually or exclusively. Section 10(5) merely requires

  the developer to have proper accounts in respect of the maintenance fund and to file the

  audited accounts with the Commissioner. The Commissioner is empowered under the section to

  verify the accounts. However, it is my view that the developer only remains accountable to

  the Commissioner for the period of which he (the developer) is in charge of the monies in

  the maintenance fund.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">All the remaining monies in the

  maintenance fund have to be transferred over to a management corporation upon its

  formation. Thenceforth, it would be the management corporation who would be managing the

  funds for the benefit of the subsidiary proprietors or residents of the condominium. It

  seems rather nonsensical to say that the developer has to continue to keep proper accounts

  of a fund of which he is no longer in control and that the Commissioner could verify such

  accounts."</font></p>
</ol>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Section 199 of the Companies Act</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">52        The final

argument of Regenthill concerns s 199 of the Companies Act which requires a company to

keep such accounting and other records "as will sufficiently explain the transactions

and financial position" of the company for a period of 7 years after the completion

of the transactions. Therefore, they cannot part with the physical possession of the

accounting records relating to the maintenance fund.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">53        There is a

serious flaw in this argument. The documents to which s 199 applies are those relating to

the "transactions and financial position" of the company. As far as the moneys

in the maintenance fund are concerned, Regenthill stands in the position of a trustee.

Documents relating thereto are not documents relating to the "transaction and

financial position" of Regenthill but to a fund in respect of which s 10 of the BCP

Act has rendered Regenthill to be a trustee. The "transactions" which Regenthill

had undertaken on behalf of the maintenance fund were not the transactions of Regenthill.

They did not affect the financial position of Regenthill. The records maintained by

Regenthill in respect of those transactions were clearly records maintained under s 10(5)

of the BCP Act. With respect, the reference to s 199 of the Companies Act is a red

herring.</font></p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Judgment</font></p>
</b>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">54        In the result

the appeal is dismissed. On the question of costs, the following two points need to be

noted. First, the MC made the application essentially on the ground of s 37(4) of the

LTSA, and the parties’ submissions were largely on the construction of that section,

even though the judge in coming to her decision also, to an extent, relied on common law.

Second, the argument which Regenthill raised before us in relation to s 37(4)(b) was not

raised in the court below. How the court below would have construed s 37(4)(b) had this

argument been raised is a matter of speculation. In the circumstances, even though the

appellants have failed, we do not think the MC should obtain full costs of the hearing

here and below as the MC has failed on its main point, the construction point. Viewing the

matter as a whole, we think a fair order would be that the respondent, the MC, shall only

have 40% of the costs, here and below. The security for costs, together with any accrued

interest, shall be released to the MC to account of the latter’s costs.</font></p>
