text-justify">2 On 22 August 2023, four shareholders (“the Convening Shareholders”) of ASTI Holdings Limited (“ASTI”), a public company limited by shares, called an extraordinary meeting (“the EGM”) where special resolutions were passed to remove and replace ASTI’s directors (“the Set A Directors”) with another group of directors (“the Set B Directors”) with effect from the date of the EGM.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Set A Directors were not present at the EGM and refused to comply with the resolutions passed. The Convening Shareholders filed HC/OA 855/2023 (“OA 855”) against the Set A Directors and ASTI to secure their compliance with the resolutions. In turn, ASTI commenced HC/OA 861/2023 (“OA 861”) to seek a declaration that the EGM was not a valid EGM of ASTI and that the resolutions passed were not valid. The defendants in OA 861 are the Convening Shareholders, who are the first to fourth defendants, and the Set B Directors, who are the first and fifth to eighth defendants.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 ASTI is a company listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange (“the Exchange”). On 5 June 2019, ASTI was placed on the Exchange’s watchlist (effective 6 June 2019) as it had incurred pre-tax losses for the three most recently completed consecutive financial years and an average daily market capitalisation of less than $40 million over the six months prior to 6 June 2019. The Exchange gave ASTI 36 months from 6 June 2019 to meet its criteria in order to exit the watchlist. ASTI failed to do so. On 6 June 2022, the Exchange sent ASTI a notification of delisting. As part of the delisting process, the Exchange required ASTI to make a general takeover offer to all of ASTI’s shareholders to purchase their shares at a fair and reasonable price. On 5 July 2022, trading of ASTI’s shares was suspended until the completion of the exit offer.

</div> The Board responded, stating that it did not have sufficient information to conclude that it would be in ASTI’s best interests for the three directors to resign, that “doing so might destabili[s]e the Company to the detriment of (among others) its shareholders” and invited the Convening Shareholders to furnish certain additional information in order for the Board to “properly consider” their request to replace the three directors.

As ASTI’s shares had been suspended since 5 July 2022, the list was requested “on or after 11 July 2022”.

</div> ASTI acknowledged the request on 14 April 2023 and noted that the purpose of the request was presumably to despatch notices to the shareholders about the EGM. The letter stated that whilst trading in ASTI’s shares had been suspended, there could “likely” have been, for instance, shareholders who have changed their addresses since 11 July 2022, and urged the Convening Shareholders to provide instead “a recent or future date”. Nonetheless, the letter also stated that if ASTI did not hear from the Convening Shareholders’ solicitors, Rajah and Tann Singapore LLP (“R&amp;T”), by the same day, ASTI would assume that the shareholding list was continued to be requested as of any date after 11 July 2022.

</div> Even on the assumption that it was procedural, there was substantial prejudice to ASTI and the general body of shareholders because had the EGM been properly called and conducted, more shareholders carrying a greater number of votes would have attended and the result of the votes might have turned out differently.

</div> Alternatively, the irregularity was substantive in nature as the purpose of the EGM was to remove the Set A Directors but they were denied the right given by Art 76 of the constitution to attend and participate in the meeting.

In so far as there was any irregularity in notice, there was no substantial injustice and s 392 of the Act could apply to validate the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Nevertheless, the meeting was not properly conducted. I answer (c) and (d) in the negative. Section 177 of the Act does not give the Convening Shareholders the power to conduct the meeting. Whether they could do so depended upon ASTI’s constitution. Art 76 of the constitution gave the directors a right to attend the meeting and to be heard. Further, the purpose of the meeting was to discuss a special resolution to remove the Set A Directors, and s 152 of the Act also furnishes the incumbent directors a right to be heard on their removal. Despite this, the Convening Shareholders on 2 August 2023 informed the Set A Directors that they were barred from attending the EGM on 22 August 2023. In doing so, the Convening Shareholders failed to give due regard to Art 76 of ASTI’s constitution. In the present case, special notice was given by the Convening Shareholders to remove the incumbent directors under s 152 of the Act, and s152 of the Act provides for the incumbent directors to be heard. The breach of Art 76 of ASTI’s constitution is not of a procedural irregularity in this context, and the rights granted by s 152 of the Act are substantive in nature. Section 392 of the Act was therefore of no assistance to the Set B Directors.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 My reasons follow.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was notice validly issued?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Convening Shareholders rely on s 177 of the Act to call the EGM.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This was a bare assertion without any material or other assertion in support.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 I reject ASTI’s argument that an advertisement is not “written notice”. An advertisement is a notice in writing and qualifies as written notice under s 177(2) of the Act. Section 2 of the Interpretation Act 1965 (2020 Rev Ed) defines <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">“writing” and expressions referring to writing to include “printing, lithography, typewriting, photography and other modes of representing or reproducing words or figures in visible form”. </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">ASTI’s submission has conflated the issue of the form of notice with that of the service of notice. The latter is dealt with under s 177(4) of the Act, which expressly refers to the company’s constitution. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The salient issue is therefore the interpretation of ASTI’s constitution. Here, ASTI’s argument fails again for three reasons:</span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Art 48 states specifically that “the non-receipt of notice by any person entitled thereto shall not invalidate the proceedings at any General Meeting”. It further provides that “in the case of any [EGM] at which it is proposed to pass a Special Resolution, … [the notice] shall be given by advertisement in the daily press and in writing to [the Exchange]”.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The structure and flow of ASTI’s constitution reflects that Art 48 is not applied in addition to Art 141(A). Art 141(A) comes in at a much later section of the constitution that deals with “Notices”, being general notices. Art 48, on the other hand, deals with the specific situation of “Notice of General Meetings”. A company’s constitution is a contract between the shareholders and the company, as well as the shareholders <span class="font-italic">inter se</span>:<span class="font-italic"> </span>s<span class="font-italic"> </span>39(1) of the Act. In construing the terms of the constitution, I am mindful of the relevance of the usual canons and techniques of contractual interpretation, including, in this case, that “a more precise or detailed provision should override an inconsistent or widely expressed provision” (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior </span><span class="font-italic">Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> at [131]). The requirements that must be fulfilled are therefore only those of Art 48. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) My conclusion at [32(b)] above is further confirmed by the text of Art 141(A). The opening text of Art 141A is drafted in a way that suggests it is allowing a manner of serving documents where no other provision applies: “Any notice or document (including a share certificate) <span class="font-italic">may</span> be served …” [emphasis added]. The use of “may”, in context, suggests it functions as a default provision for notices or documents not previously listed. The section does not mandate that such notice is required for all notices and it does not impose any specific requirement for notices of general meetings. The section in which Art 141A is located contains other articles that deal with procedures to be followed for the sending and receipt of notices or documents pursuant to that article. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Therefore, reading Art 141(A) in its proper context, the provision does not impose a requirement for notices <span class="font-italic">of general meetings</span> to be delivered personally to the shareholders. <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">T</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">here is no necessity for notices of general meetings to be served under Art 141(A). Only the requirements of Art 48 need to be fulfilled, and accordingly, </span>the notice given for the 22 August EGM was properly served.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Would s 392 in any event apply to cure any irregularity of notice? </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In any event, s 392 of the Act would apply to deficiencies of notice.

</div> whose addresses stated in the August 2023 list differed from the July 2022 list. These shareholders owned a total of 2,240,700 shares. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">ASTI had 3,295 shareholders. For (a), there is no information that the additional ten shareholders voted on 22 August 2023 despite no longer being shareholders. For (b), there is also no indication that any of the 37 who have changed addresses has complained about the non-receipt of the notice nor asserted that any substantial injustice was occasioned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In this context, s 392(3) of the Act is also relevant as it specifically stipulates that the <span class="font-italic">non-receipt by any person of notice</span> would not invalidate any proceeding save where there is a Court order on an application of a person entitled to attend. ASTI submitted that s 392(4) of the Act only applies to cases of accidental omission to give notice. However, the preceding subsection makes clear that there are two disjunctive situations where the subsection would apply. Aside from accidental omission, the non-receipt by any person is a separate scenario. There is nothing in the section that precludes the operation of s 392(3) to instances where, for the want of an updated shareholder list, notice was not sent to a person entitled to attend, or where such notice was sent to an incorrect address. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Therefore, in the event that, and in so far as there was any irregularity in notice, s 392 of the Act could apply to validate the resolutions passed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was the EGM validly conducted?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The conduct of the meeting is a more complex matter. ASTI made two related contentions in respect of the conduct of the EGM: first, that the Chairman of its Board ought to have presided, and second, that the meeting ought to have been conducted by its Board. The chairing of the meeting by Mr Ng and his conduct of the meeting invalidated the proceedings. The Set A Directors emphasised that directors have a right to be heard. As I explain below, the need for directors to conduct the meeting and the need for directors to be heard are separate and yet related issues. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Could the EGM be conducted without the directors’ presence?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Relevance of s 177 of the Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The Convening Shareholders assert that s 177 of the Act permitted them to conduct the meeting. They argue that their ability to call the meeting includes an ability to conduct the meeting. In response, ASTI and the Set A Directors emphasise that s 177 only furnishes a right to call a meeting and this right does not include a right to conduct the meeting so called. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In interpreting a statutory provision, the court must have regard not just to the text of the provision but also to the context of that provision within the written law as a whole. The court should strive to ascribe significance to every word in an enactment as it is taken that Parliament shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain: <span class="font-italic">Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</span> [2017] 2 SLR 850 at [37]–[38]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the present case, the plain words of s 177 use “call”, which refers ordinarily to convening or arranging a meeting. In contrast, “conduct” would refer to the running of the meeting.

There, ten shareholders of CellOS Software Ltd (“CellOS”), holding almost 7% of the issued shares, called for an EGM of the company under s 249F of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). However, the board of directors of CellOS sought to postpone the proposed EGM so as to coincide with the same day the annual general meeting was to be held. The dispute therefore centred around the validity of this postponement. Section 249F reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Calling of general meetings by members</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) Members with at least 5% of the votes that may be cast at a general meeting of the company may call, and arrange to hold, a general meeting.

Middleton J answered the question in the negative, finding (at [50]) that a distinction exists between the calling and holding of a meeting and s 249F did not confer on shareholders the additional right to hold or conduct a meeting. Middleton J stated (at [48]) that “[o]nce the meeting is held, <span class="font-italic">in the </span><span class="font-italic">normal course</span> it would be conducted by the chair of the existing board, according to <span class="font-italic">the normal procedures</span><span class="font-italic"> applicable</span> <span class="font-italic">to</span> the general meeting of shareholders” [emphasis added]. He therefore concluded that “[t]he provisions of the constitution of the company or the general law dealing with such matters as adjournments, quorum, voting and proxies will apply to the meeting”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Convening Shareholders argue in their supplemental submissions that <span class="font-italic">Wun</span> is neither binding nor persuasive because of the material differences in the legislative provisions between the Singapore and Australian legislation.

</div> That the provisions are different is not disputed. Middleton J’s reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Wun</span> is, notwithstanding, useful and relevant.

</div> No particular extraneous material evincing Parliament’s intention was relied upon. The material parts of s 176 read: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Convening of extraordinary general meeting on requisition</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">176</span>.—(1) The directors of a company, despite anything in its constitution, must, on the requisition of members holding at the date of the deposit of the requisition not less than 10% of the total number of paid-up shares as at the date of the deposit carries the right of voting at general meetings or, in the case of a company not having a share capital, of members representing not less than 10% of the total voting rights of all members having at that date a right to vote at general meetings, immediately proceed duly to convene an extraordinary general meeting of the company to be held as soon as practicable but in any case not later than 2 months after the receipt by the company of the requisition. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) If the directors do not within 21 days after the date of the deposit of the requisition proceed to convene a meeting, the requisitionists, or any of them representing more than 50% of the total voting rights of all of them, may themselves, in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which meetings are to be convened by directors convene a meeting, but any meeting so convened must not be held after the expiration of 3 months from that date.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4)  Any reasonable expenses incurred by the requisitionists by reason of the failure of the directors to convene a meeting must be paid to the requisitionists by the company, and any sum so paid must be retained by the company out of any sums due or to become due from the company by way of fees or other remuneration in respect of their services to such of the directors as were in default.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 On a plain and ordinary reading, ss 176 and 177 of the Act do function harmoniously to give meaningfully differentiated relief, without the additional need for s 177 to provide a power to shareholders to conduct the meeting. My conclusion in this regard is confirmed by the legislative purpose of the two provisions that emanates from their clearly-drafted words. There is no need for the additional power suggested by the Convening Shareholders. Section 177 allows shareholders to call a meeting themselves. If they choose instead to requisition a meeting using s 176, their expenses incurred by the directors’ failure to call such a meeting must be paid by the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In this context, s 176 allows shareholders to require directors to “convene” an EGM, while s 177 provides for shareholders to “call” a meeting. In its ordinary meaning, “convene” and “call” are synonyms, save that because directors ordinarily have the power and duty to arrange meetings, convene is an appropriate word to be used in the context of directors. Shareholders, on the other hand, do not ordinarily arrange for meetings, and thus the word “call”, which carries the meaning of a summons to attend, is more appropriate to be used in the context of shareholders. In my opinion, both ss 176 and 177 are consistent and there is nothing within them to suggest that the shareholders who have requisitioned directors or called a meeting may conduct the meeting so arranged. Both sections are silent on the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I deal here with the authorities which the Convening Shareholders cited to argue for an expansive reading of s 177, namely, that “call” encompasses the entire process of convening a meeting and the conduct of that meeting.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The Convening Shareholders rely on the Supreme Court of New South Wales decision of <span class="font-italic">Beck v Tuckey Pty Ltd</span> [2004] NSWSC 357 (“<span class="font-italic">Beck</span>”). <span class="font-italic">Beck</span> involved a plaintiff seeking an order of the court, under s 249G of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), to call a meeting of the first defendant, Tuckey Pty Ltd, so as to deliberate the removal of two other defendants as directors of the company. Section 249G(1) reads, “[t]he Court may order a meeting of the company’s members to be called if it is impracticable to call the meeting in any other way.” </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 At issue was whether the court’s power to grant relief arises only when it was impracticable to <span class="font-italic">call</span> a meeting or included the situation when it was impracticable to <span class="font-italic">conduct</span> a meeting. The court noted (at [39]) that the statutory provision had previously contained a second alternative condition, which read “… if for any reason it is impracticable to call a meeting of the company in any manner in which meetings of that company may be called, <span class="font-italic">or to conduct the meeting of the company in manner prescribed by the articles or this Act</span>” [emphasis added]. This second alternative condition was removed by an amendment in 1998 (at [44]). However, the court was satisfied (at [45]) from the explanatory memorandum to the 1988 bill that the 1998 amendments were meant to simplify drafting and not meant to make any substantive changes to the law. In the result, the court held (at [45]) that even though the second alternative condition was removed, the phrase “it is impracticable to call the meeting in any other way” in the present provision should be read to implicitly include the second alternative condition. It was in this context that the court opined that “it is possible to read the word ‘call’, in the new simplified language, as a word of more expansive meaning than the word ‘convene’ in the immediate predecessor legislation, or even the word ‘call’ in the older legislation” (at [46]). The legislative history relevant to <span class="font-italic">Beck</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>as stated above, is not applicable to our Act. Further, the statutory provision at issue in <span class="font-italic">Beck</span> deals with the court’s supervisory jurisdiction. This supervisory width ought in principle to be expansive wherever shareholders require assistance. Otherwise, company matters would be stymied. As an example of statutory width in this area, our own s 182, as mentioned at [41] above, gives the court power to give directions both on the call and conduct of a meeting.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Reliance is also placed on paragraph 4403 of <span class="font-italic">Woon’s Corporations Law</span> (Walter Woon SC gen ed) (LexisNexis Singapore, 2022) (“<span class="font-italic">Woon’s Corporations Law</span>”), which reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">S 177(1) convening extraordinary general meetings </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any general meeting other than the annual general meeting is an extraordinary general meeting. The constitution may provide that the directors have power to convene extraordinary general meetings. This section gives members holding the specified proportion of the voting rights in the company the power to convene a meeting themselves. It differs from the previous section in that the directors are not involved. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 This extract does not support the position that shareholders are entitled to <span class="font-italic">conduct</span> a meeting called under s 177. <span class="font-italic">Woon’s Corporations Law</span> merely restates the principle in s 177 of the CA that the shareholders are entitled to convene a meeting of the company by themselves. It does not go further to say that they are entitled to conduct that meeting without the involvement of the directors. The Convening Shareholders’ reliance on the sentence, “[i]t differs from the previous section in that the directors are not involved”, is misconceived. What is meant by the extract is that, unlike the process under s 176 of the Act, the directors are not involved in <span class="font-italic">calling</span> the meeting in the process under s 177. This adds nothing to the text as s 177 is a mechanism to empower shareholders to call a meeting of the company <span class="font-italic">without</span> first requisitioning the directors to do so as required under s 176 of the Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Finally, the Convening Shareholders rely on an article issued by the Singapore Exchange Regulation (also known as “SGX RegCo”) on 27 April 2023 entitled “Regulator’s Column: What boards and requisitionists should take note of in shareholder-requisitioned meetings”. However, nothing in the article says that the requisitionists under s 177 should have sole conduct of the meeting to the exclusion of the directors. The article states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where requisitionists decide to avail of the mechanism in Section 177 of the Companies Act, they should note that the burden falls on them to ensure that all applicable procedural requirements relating to the convening, and conduct, of the Requisitioned Meeting … are adhered to …</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">This extract does not assist the Convening Shareholders. To the contrary, it is a reminder that all requirements relating to the conduct of the meeting must be met, and the onus of fulfilling the conditions would be on the Convening Shareholders.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I sum up my views on s 177 of the Act. The section enables the Convening Shareholders to call a meeting. To call a meeting and to conduct it are separate concepts under the Act, however, and therefore the right to conduct the meeting may not be implied from the right to call the meeting. Nevertheless, the section does not expressly disentitle shareholders from conducting a meeting they have called. The section is silent on the matter, which then becomes an issue to be decided by reference to the company constitution. In the present proceedings, therefore, the relevant inquiry is that concerning ASTI’s constitution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">ASTI’s constitution </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 ASTI relied on Art 52 of the constitution for its assertion that the Chairman of the Board of Directors ought to have chaired the EGM. Art 52 reads as follows:

ASTI and the Set A Directors contend that the circumstances took them out of the ambit of Art 52. In particular, they were told on 2 August 2023 not to turn up at the EGM. Nevertheless, from the words of Art 52, the constitution did envisage a situation where a meeting could validly continue “if no Director be present”. The remainder of the section also does not mandate that any number of directors be present. Two members present would be sufficient for a quorum. One consideration is that in relation to proxies, the Company has rights and duties, which must be exercised by its directors. The directors also have various powers in relation to proxies and security measures. There is nothing in the constitution that states a meeting cannot go on without the Company exercising proxy rights, or directors exercising their discretionary powers. While ASTI and the Set A Directors contend that Art 52 only applies where they were voluntarily absent or declined to chair, the article itself is factually expressed and does not explicitly so specify.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Art 76, however, is a different matter.

Their dispute is that the Convening Shareholders had informed them on 2 August 2023 that they were not to attend the EGM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In this context, while the Set A Directors relied on Art 76 because of its broader width, I also note that the EGM was one for which special notice had been given under s 152 of the Act and the section itself provided for the Set A Directors to be heard. Subsections 152(1)–(3) read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Removal of directors</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">152.</span>—(1) A public company may by ordinary resolution remove a director before the expiration of his or her period of office, despite anything in its constitution or in any agreement between it and the director but where any director so removed was appointed to represent the interests of any particular class of shareholders or debenture holders the resolution to remove the director does not take effect until the director’s successor has been appointed. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Special notice is required of any resolution to remove a director of a public company under subsection (1) or to appoint some person in place of a director so removed at the meeting at which the director is removed, and on receipt of notice of an intended resolution to remove a director under subsection (1) the company must immediately send a copy thereof to the director concerned, <span class="font-italic">and the director, whether or not he or she is a member of the company, is entitled to be heard on the resolution at the meeting.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where notice is given pursuant to subsection (2) and the director concerned makes with respect thereto representations in writing to the public company, not exceeding a reasonable length, and requests their notification to members of the company, the company must, unless the representations are received by it too late for it to do so —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)  in any notice of the resolution given to members of the company state the fact of the representations having been made; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)  send a copy of the representations to every member of the company to whom notice of the meeting is sent, whether before or after receipt of the representations by the company, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">and if a copy of the representations is not so sent because they were received too late or because of the company’s default the director may, without affecting the director’s right to be heard orally, require that the representations must be read out at the meeting.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Therefore, because of Art 76 of ASTI’s constitution and s 152 of the Act, the Set A Directors had a right to attend and speak at the 22 August 2023 EGM and to be heard on the special resolution relevant to their removal as directors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In this context, the 2 August 2023 letter disallowing the directors to attend the EGM becomes important. The Set A Directors emphasise that they were told on 2 August not to turn up. This letter ignored both Art 76 of ASTI’s constitution and s 152 of the Act. The Convening Shareholders make the point that the Set A Directors did not exercise their right to be heard. The Set A Directors conceded at the hearing that they did not state they had a right to be heard under Art 76 nor did they insist that s 152(2) of the Act implied they could not be refused permission to attend the meeting. Confusingly, their communications with the Convening Shareholders centred on the validity of the notice, and thereafter, on their right to conduct the meeting (see [9]–[12] above). The right that the Set A Directors asserted was not the right to be heard on the special resolution, but the right to conduct the meeting and their responsibility to deal with proxy issues or to exercise their discretion in relation to issues as to security.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Section 152 of the Act prescribes a process that must be followed whenever a resolution is proposed for a director to be removed. Special notice was sent as required. The section then gives the director a right to be heard on the matter. There was therefore some cogence to the Convening Shareholders’ argument that the Set A Directors ought to have asserted any right to be heard against their removal. In the present case, special notice was issued as required and the Set A Directors did not assert their rights under that section. Nevertheless, the Convening Shareholders’ letter of 2 August 2023 interrupted the schematic flow that the section envisaged. It was also followed on with further letters to rebuff attempts to meet to discuss the conduct of the meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In this context, Art 76 of ASTI’s constitution goes further than s 152. It furnished the incumbent directors with rights <span class="font-italic">to attend </span><span class="font-italic">and to speak</span> at General Meetings, which the 2 August 2023 letter denied. Reading the constitution as a unified whole, if the Chairman of the Board had attended the meeting, as was his right under Art 76, Art 52 also furnished the Chairman of the Board with a first option to chair the meeting if he so wished. This right then devolves to other members of the Board present, prior to that of any shareholder present. Therefore, ASTI’s and the Set A Directors’ assertion that the Chairman of the Board or the incumbent directors had the right to conduct the meeting, if he wished to do so, reflected the practical effect of Arts 76 and 52, when considered together. The right to conduct the meeting, if the Chairman of the Board so chose to exercise it, followed from his right to attend the meeting. The effect of Arts 76 and 52, when read together, is that other shareholders could only conduct the meeting if, having been notified, the directors omitted to attend or declined to conduct the meeting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Convening Shareholders make the point that the Set A Directors could have attended on 22 August 2023, notwithstanding their letter of 2 August 2023. Instead, they encouraged shareholders not to attend. Nevertheless, the Convening Shareholders had brushed aside Art 76 and also rebuffed efforts made by the Set A Directors to set up meetings to discuss conduct of the EGM. Prior to the EGM, the Set B Directors had barred Set A Directors from a meeting with SIAS. The Convening Shareholders point out that the Set A Directors were of the view that the meeting on 22 August 2023 was not a valid EGM. But the issue as to notice of meeting and the issue as to conduct of the meeting are two separate issues and the parties could have dealt with the issues in that light. It would be speculative to assume that, if Art 76 had been given due recognition, the two sides could not have worked out an orderly manner of procedure and argument at the meeting. The Set A Directors had not been given an opportunity. Further, in the event that the opportunity had been granted and it became impossible for the two sets of directors to work together such that any conduct of the meeting became impracticable, they could have applied under s 182 of the Act for guidance from the court. ASTI’s AGM is an illustration where such court direction was sought, and 60.7% of ASTI’s shareholders attended, whereas the EGM was attended by only 34.29% of shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Section 392 in this context  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In my view, s 392 of the Act may not be used to validate resolutions passed without due account being given to Art 76 of the constitution or s 152 of the Act. The right to attend and to speak conferred by Art 76 could not be characterised as procedural in this context, where the incumbent Directors and the Convening Shareholders had deferring views. The agenda on 22 August 2023 was the removal of the Set A Directors, the very persons who were not granted the right to attend and speak. Section 152 rights are substantive in nature as they allow the director to protest his removal (see <span class="font-italic">Monnington v Easier plc </span>[2005] All ER (D) 265 at [39], dealing with the English equivalent of s 152(2)).  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Accordingly, OA 855 is dismissed. At the hearing, the Convening Shareholders drew my attention to an alternative Prayer 5 for the court to give directions under s 182 of the Act. However, the section may only be used on the specific criterion that to call or to conduct a meeting would be impracticable. The facts show that to call a meeting is not impracticable; and there is insufficient evidence to show that the proper conduct of such a meeting would be impracticable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In respect of OA 861, I grant a declaration that the resolutions passed at the meeting on 22 August 2023 are invalid and of no legal effect, being the second of the two alternatives in prayer 2.
