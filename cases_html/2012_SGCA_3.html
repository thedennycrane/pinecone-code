<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the ancillary orders made by the High Court Judge
                    (“the Judge”) in <em>AQR v AQS</em>
                    [2011] SGHC 139 (the “GD”) pursuant to the
                    parties’ divorce. The appellant is the wife (“the wife”) and
                    the respondent is the husband (“the husband”). The parties had
                    their marriage dissolved by Interim Judgment on 30 March 2010. The Judge
                    made her ancillary orders on 14 January 2011. We heard the parties on
                    30 September 2011 and allowed the appeal in part. We now set out the
                    grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The husband is an American citizen of German origin. The wife is a Vietnamese
                    citizen. Both have been Singapore Permanent Residents since 18 January
                    2002. At the time of the ancillaries, the husband was 50 years old and the wife
                    42 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The parties met in 1993 in Hanoi where the husband was working for a foreign
                    company and the wife was employed as a hotel bar waitress. They married in Hanoi
                    on 22 August 1996.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At the time, the wife was a single parent with a daughter, [C]), whom she had
                    had in 1990 out of wedlock. At the time of the hearing before us, [C] was 20
                    years old. It was undisputed that the husband financially supported and cared
                    for [C] as part of the matrimonial household since the parties married.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The parties moved to Singapore in February 1998 when the husband found a job
                    in Singapore. Their only child, [B] was born in Singapore in July 1999. At the
                    time of the hearing before us, she was 12 years old.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       During the subsistence of the marriage, the wife was a full-time homemaker and
                    the husband worked as a director of sales in an American company in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The matrimonial home and the Memorandum signed by husband on
                5 April 2006</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The matrimonial home at [address redacted] (“the matrimonial
                    flat”) was acquired between 2005 and 2006. The Option to Purchase the
                    matrimonial flat (“the Option”), dated 14 December 2005, was
                    originally in the husband’s sole name.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The exercise of the Option, dated 28 December 2005, was however
                    in the names of both the husband and wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Subsequently, the husband’s solicitors wrote a letter dated
                    27 February 2006 to the solicitors of the vendors of the matrimonial flat,
                    stating that they had received instructions from the husband and wife that the
                    conveyance was to be in the wife’s sole name. The reason for this was a
                    “private family arrangement” between the husband and wife.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The husband also wrote a letter, dated 20 March 2006, to his
                    property agent directing that the matrimonial flat be transferred to the sole
                    name of the wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Significance was placed by the wife as to the aforesaid sequence of
                    events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Furthermore, on 5 April 2006, the husband signed a memorandum “To
                    Whom It May Concern” (“the 5 April 2006 Memorandum”)
                    where he stated that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I, [the husband], hereby certify that, in case of a divorce between my
                        wife, [the wife], and me, the paramount decision on dividing assets is the
                        future wellbeing of our children, [C] and [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Therefore, I will commit to leaving 70% of our common assets at the time
                        of divorce at the disposal of my wife and my children.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The 5 April 2006 Memorandum was signed only by the husband. The wife
                    relied heavily on this 5 April 2006 Memorandum in the ancillaries below and
                    in the appeal before us.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The breakdown of the marriage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The husband left the matrimonial flat in December 2006 after a domestic
                    conflict.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Unusually, [C] left the matrimonial flat to live with him. [C] gave evidence
                        that<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When I found out the [husband] was moving out of the home, I had
                        voluntarily asked him if I could move out together with him as I have been
                        very traumatised by the [wife’s] behaviour and abuse, pushing me into
                        depression, and I no longer wanted to live in constant fear of being
                        attacked by her everyday.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     However, the husband continued to return to the matrimonial flat and
                    interacting with the wife and [B], including helping [B] with her homework and
                    even having sexual relations with the wife,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> though their relationship continued to be problematic. The
                    husband’s Statement of Particulars in the divorce suit (see below at
                        <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>) – in both the original and
                    amended versions – included lengthy details of the wife’s
                    unreasonable behaviour both before and after December 2006 when he left the
                    matrimonial flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The husband filed for divorce on 25 April 2008 on the basis of
                    s 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev
                    Ed)(the “Women’s Charter”), <em>ie</em>, that the wife had behaved in such a way that the husband could
                    not reasonably be expected to live with her. The wife initially contested the
                    divorce and filed a defence on 13 June 2008. Subsequently, however, parties
                    agreed to an Amended Statement of Particulars<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>, and the husband’s suit proceeded on an uncontested basis on
                    the ground of the wife’s unreasonable behaviour. Interim Judgment was
                    granted on 30 March 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The ancillary proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As at the date of the ancillary hearing, the husband resided at rented
                    premises which he had leased at $2,700 per month for his own and [C]’s
                    accommodation. The wife resided at the matrimonial flat with [B], and it was
                    undisputed that the husband nevertheless continued to pay for all the outgoings
                    of the matrimonial flat.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The custody, care and control and access to [C] were never issues in the
                    ancillary proceedings. The wife requested that no order be made in respect of
                    the custody, care and control, and access of [C].<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> At the time of the hearing before us, [C] was still living with the
                    husband and being financially supported by the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The ancillary matters that came up for hearing before the Judge pertained
                    to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     Custody, care and control of [B];</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     Division of the matrimonial assets including the matrimonial flat;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     Maintenance for the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The husband and wife eventually consented to joint custody of [B] with care
                    and control to the wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Only four assets were really in contention in the ancillaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The first asset was the matrimonial flat. Both the husband and wife claimed a
                    100% share of this in the division of matrimonial assets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The second and third assets were two properties the parties had acquired in
                    Australia (“Gracemere Gardens” and “Gracemere
                    Waters” respectively; collectively “the two Australian
                    Properties”). The husband asked for a 100% share in these properties
                    whereas the wife asked for 70%, allegedly in accordance with the 5 April
                    2006 Memorandum, or in the alternative at least 50% as a “just and
                    equitable” division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The fourth asset was the various bank accounts of the parties <em>other than</em> the bank accounts for the mortgage loans
                    taken out for the matrimonial flat and the two Australian properties. One bank
                    account was in the husband’s sole name, one in the wife’s sole name
                    and the remaining four were in their joint names, but it was undisputed that the
                    husband was the exclusive source of funds in all. The wife asked for an equal
                    division of all the accounts in credit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The remaining properties owned by either or both parties – namely, the
                    wife’s properties in Vietnam, the bank accounts for the mortgage loans
                    taken out for the matrimonial flat and the two Australian properties, and the
                    parties’ respective CPF accounts – were not in dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The wife alleged that husband had not disclosed certain assets<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> such as bonuses, incentives, and other financial benefits under his
                    employment contract; insurance policies; other bank accounts; rental income from
                    Gracemere Gardens property; tax refunds; and stock options under Clause IIIA of
                    his Employment Contract<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. She also denied that he was liable to pay tax to the US
                    authorities, as he had claimed in his affidavits. However, the Judge rightly
                    held that the wife provided completely no documentary evidence to back up such
                    allegations, and the husband provided cogent rebuttals of her assertions in the
                    Plaintiff’s 3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit (see GD at [34]). The wife quite rightly dropped these
                    assertions in the appeal before us. However, the one matter she did pursue was
                    her allegation that the husband failed to disclose his stock options under
                    Clause IIIA of his Employment Contract. The Judge in [34] of the GD accepted the husband’s
                    explanation that his stock options had no value because the company had not gone
                    public – his company was a small start-up company and had no plans to go
                    public and therefore had not attached any monetary value to its stock. We will
                    address this further at <a href="#p1_45">[45]</a> below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision Below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Other than the matters pertaining to the custody, care and control of [B], the
                    Judge made, <em>inter alia</em>, the following
                    orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_a"></a>(a)     The wife was to transfer to the husband all her rights, title, and
                        interest in the matrimonial flat as well as her rights, title and interest
                        in two Australian properties without consideration. The cost of transfer for
                        all three properties was to be borne by the husband;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_b"></a>(b)     The husband was to pay the wife a lump sum maintenance of $250,000 as well
                        as a one-off payment of $10,000 to assist her in shifting out of the
                        matrimonial flat, totalling $260,000;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_c"></a>(c)     The husband was to meet [B]’s expenses, including but not limited to
                        schools, tutors, school bus operators, guitar tutor, life and accident
                        insurance companies, handphone service operator, doctors and dentists, by
                        direct payment to these third parties or by GIRO arrangements;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_d"></a>(d)     The husband was to continue to maintain [C] who was at liberty to continue
                        to reside with the husband;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_e"></a>(e)     The wife, at the husband’s expense, was to seek counselling for
                        anger management for a period of six months from a psychiatrist whose
                        services should first be approved by the husband;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_f"></a>(f)     Other than the transfer of the properties set out in (a) above, the
                        parties were to retain their assets which were in their sole names including
                        the wife’s two properties in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_g"></a>(g)     The wife was to remove her name from the two<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> joint accounts maintained by the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In the appeal before us, the wife argued:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Judge erred in holding that the wife had a violent disposition as
                        alleged by the husband and [C];</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Judge erred by placing undue weight on the contents of the affidavit
                        of [C];</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Judge erred in ordering all the matrimonial assets to be transferred
                        to the husband with no consideration to the wife;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     The Judge erred in concluding that the wife had failed to contribute
                        towards the welfare of the family for the duration of the marriage of 14
                        years;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_e"></a>(e)     The Judge erred in concluding that the 5 April 2006 Memorandum was
                        signed by the husband under blackmail and as such was not binding;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_f"></a>(f)     The Judge erred in finding that the transfer of the matrimonial flat to
                        the wife’s sole name was procured under duress and blackmail and was
                        therefore invalid;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_g"></a>(g)     That the transfer of the matrimonial flat was a gift from the husband to
                        the wife;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_h"></a>(h)     The Judge erred in finding that the wife had not made any contribution
                        towards the acquisition and improvement of the matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_i"></a>(i)     That the sum of $260,000 ordered to be paid as lump sum maintenance to the
                        wife was not fair or reasonable;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_j"></a>(j)     That the Judge failed to give due weight to the wife’s expenditure,
                        needs and lifestyle when awarding $260,000 as lump sum maintenance for her;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_k"></a>(k)     The Judge erred by failing to make a maintenance order in respect of [B]
                        and ordering instead that the husband pays directly to third parties for her
                        expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The husband argued:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the Judge was right in ordering the transfer of the matrimonial
                        properties to the husband with no consideration to the wife;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_b"></a>(b)     That the matrimonial flat was not a gift to the wife;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_c"></a>(c)     That the lump sum maintenance of $260,000 was fair and reasonable;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_d"></a>(d)     That the Judge’s order that the husband pay for [B]’s expenses
                        directly to third parties should be upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As was apparent from the issues raised by the wife (at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above), and the parties’ written
                    submissions before us, there was extensive dispute between the parties as to
                    many aspects of their marriage, and many allegations on both sides as to the
                    conduct of the other. These ranged from whether the wife had a violent
                    disposition and whether the husband had many affairs and used prostitutes to
                    whether [C] chose to live with the husband because she had been alienated by the
                    wife’s violent behaviour or because the husband was having a sexual
                    relationship with her. <em>We should stress that these were
                        irrelevant to the real issues before us.</em> Ancillary proceedings
                    should hardly encourage parties, and should not be used by the parties, to
                    engage in mudslinging and dwelling on each other’s misconduct. However,
                    the Judge did make many findings of fact on the conduct of the parties,
                    including finding that the husband’s version of events was more credible
                    than the wife’s (see GD at [29]),
                    that the wife was vindictive (see GD at [32]) and selfish (see GD at [37]) whereas the husband was “not only selfless but
                    magnanimous” (see GD at [38]).
                    This perhaps explained why the parties’ characters and conduct featured so
                    significantly in the wife’s appeal. Insofar as these findings of fact
                    formed the basis of the Judge’s order for the division of matrimonial
                    assets, we will elaborate below as to why we thought this was wrong in law. For
                    now, we stress that despite the various issues framed by the parties, there were
                    really only four issues before us:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Judge’s orders with regard to the division of the
                        matrimonial assets should be upheld;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the Judge’s order for lump sum maintenance of $260,000
                        should be upheld;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the Judge’s order that the husband pay for [B]’s
                        expenses directly to third parties should be upheld; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     Whether the Judge’s order that the wife attend anger management
                        counselling with a psychiatrist approved by the husband, at the
                        husband’s expense, should be upheld;</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     When it comes to the division of matrimonial assets, an appellate court will
                    only overturn an order if it can be shown that the judge below had erred in law
                    or had clearly exercised his discretion wrongly or had taken into account
                    irrelevant considerations or had failed to take into account relevant
                    considerations (<em>Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and
                        another appeal</em> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 at [80]
                        (“<em>Nancy Tay</em>”)). In this case,
                    before we turn to consider the question of what a just and equitable division of
                    the matrimonial assets should be, we first deal with the wife’s arguments
                    that (i) the matrimonial home should be solely allotted to her because it was a
                    gift from the husband and (ii) 70% of all other matrimonial assets should be
                    given to her either because they were gifts to her or because they were the
                    subject of the 5 April 2006 Memorandum – more particularly, whether
                    these precluded the court from dividing the matrimonial assets in proportions we
                    held to be just and equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the matrimonial flat and 70% of all other matrimonial assets
                were gifts to the wife and/or the subject of an agreement made in contemplation of
                divorce</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<u>The matrimonial flat</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The wife’s position was that she should be allowed to
                    ‘retain’ the matrimonial flat wholly because it was in her sole
                    name, it being a gift from the husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     First and foremost, insofar as the wife’s arguments relied on the mere
                    fact that the matrimonial flat was in her sole name, they were irrelevant to the
                    question of division of matrimonial assets. Matrimonial assets by definition
                    include assets owned only by one party (s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter),
                    which are liable to division upon divorce. Moreover, while the wife was the sole
                    legal owner of the matrimonial flat, the husband was the sole equitable owner
                    because it was undisputed that he made all the financial contributions towards
                    its purchase. <em>The material question was whether placing the
                        matrimonial flat in his wife’s sole name evinced an intention on the
                        part of the husband to make a gift to the wife</em>. The Judge held
                    that the husband had no such intention. She accepted the husband’s
                    explanation that at that time he had only transferred the matrimonial flat to
                    the wife’s sole name because he feared that if he did not give in to her
                    demands, she would subject him to physical and mental torture and not allow him
                    to see the two children (see GD at [35]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In our view, the wife’s explanation of the husband’s intention to
                    gift her the matrimonial home was somewhat unbelievable: she alleged that after
                    the Option was exercised in both their names, she “spoke to the Plaintiff
                    and reminded him of his assurances [made before their marriage, to provide her
                    with a house in their country of residence], and the Plaintiff gladly,
                    voluntarily, gave specific instruction to our solicitors to have the matrimonial
                    home registered in my name only.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Be that as it may, it was not necessary for us to make any specific
                    finding as to whether the husband only transferred the matrimonial flat to her
                    solely on account of duress (however see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> below) because <em>even if the husband did
                        intend to make a gift of the matrimonial flat to the wife, this did not in
                        law preclude it from being regarded as a matrimonial asset to be
                        divided</em> (<em>Yeo Gim Tong Michael v Tianzon
                        Lolita</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 633 at [12]). Where the courts have exercised their discretion and not
                    divided gifts made by one spouse to another, circumstances were exceptional in
                    the sense that the gift was made for a specific purpose such that it would be
                    inequitable to allow the giving party to renege on the gift: for example, in
                        <em>Wong Ser Wan v Ng Cheong Ling</em> [2006]
                    1 SLR(R) 416 (see [75]-[78]), the husband made the gift to induce the
                    wife to halt the divorce proceedings against him; in <em>Lee Leh
                        </em><em>Hua v Yip Kok Leong</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 554 (“<em>Lee Leh </em><em>Hua</em>”), the husband made the gift specifically as
                    compensation for abandoning his wife. That the circumstances in <em>Lee Leh </em><em>Hua</em> were
                    exceptional was affirmed in <em>Yow Mee </em><em>Lan v Chen Kai Buan</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 659 at [62],
                    which also affirmed the general rule that where one spouse makes a gift to the
                    other, the court can still exercise its powers to divide the gift as a
                    “matrimonial asset” falling within s 112(10) of the
                    Women’s Charter. Ultimately, whether the court should decide to exercise
                    those powers depends on the particular circumstances before it, with the aim of
                    achieving a just and equitable division of matrimonial assets between the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In this case, there was no evidence that the husband gifted the matrimonial
                    flat to the wife for a specific purpose such that it would be inequitable for
                    the court to now divide the matrimonial flat between the parties. Of course, we
                    noted that the wife had argued that she originally married the husband in 1996
                    only on the basis of his promise to provide her with a house in her country of
                    residence and 70% of all matrimonial assets, but she adduced no objective
                    evidence of this whatsoever, other than what she asserted. In fact, we found it
                    difficult to believe her claim for the reasons which we elaborate at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>-<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a>
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">
<u>70% of all other matrimonial assets</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The wife further argued that she was entitled to 70% of all common assets
                    because the husband had expressly so promised her. According to her, this
                    agreement was evidenced by the 5 April 2006 Memorandum (referred to at
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>-<a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     First, even accepting the fact that the husband had voluntarily agreed to give
                    the wife 70% of the matrimonial assets as gifts, as we already explained at
                        <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a> above, those gifts were also liable
                    to division as matrimonial assets save for exceptional circumstances which did
                    not arise in this case. Second, insofar as this argument pertained to an
                    agreement in contemplation of divorce, the credibility of this argument was
                    somewhat undermined by the wife’s inconsistent accounts of the purported
                    agreement. The wife argued below that she agreed to marry the husband “on
                    the assurances” that he would provide her with a house in her country of
                    residence and a 70% share in all other assets acquired during the
                        marriage”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> However, there was completely no evidence that this was the original
                    basis of the marriage, with the wife’s only evidence being the
                    5 April 2006 Memorandum<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. In the first place, this begged the question as to why the
                    memorandum was only signed some ten years later on 5 April 2006 if it were
                    the basis of the marriage in 1996. In the second place, and more importantly, if
                    her position was that the agreement to give her a 70%-share in all common assets
                    was the basis of the marriage in 1996, this was fundamentally inconsistent with
                    what was clearly stated in the 5 April 2006 Memorandum that it was an
                    agreement made <em>in contemplation of divorce</em>, for
                    the purposes of s 112(2)(e) of the Women’s Charter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In any case, an agreement between the parties made in contemplation of divorce
                    could not be decisive. It is only one of the factors listed in s 112(2) of
                    the Women’s Charter that the court must take into account as part of its
                    overarching duty to reach a just and equitable division in light of all the
                    circumstances of the case. This Court affirmed in <em>TQ v TR and
                        another appeal</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 961 at [75] that
                    even though post-nuptial agreements could be accorded more weight than
                    pre-nuptial agreements, how much weight was to be allocated to a postnuptial
                    agreement must ultimately depend on the precise circumstances of the case. In
                    this case, we were of the view that the 5 April 2006 Memorandum should be
                    accorded little weight because it seemed dubious. Its form was somewhat unusual:
                    it was not really an agreement between both parties in the usual form but a
                    unilateral declaration of intent signed by the husband with the heading,
                    “To Whom it May Concern”, without further elaboration as to what
                    the context of such a unilateral memorandum was. Furthermore, the wife’s
                    inherently incredible explanation of how the memorandum came about (<em>ie.</em> that it was made pursuant to the parties’
                    agreement prior to marriage) did seem to suggest that the only possible
                    conclusion was per the husband’s version of events <em>ie</em> that he had only signed the memorandum under some sort of
                        duress.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Therefore, in our opinion little or no weight should be accorded to the
                    5 April 2006 Memorandum. It could not preclude this Court from dividing the
                    matrimonial assets in a manner which was just and equitable. It is to this
                    question which we now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Just and equitable proportions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     This case was straightforward in the sense that it was undisputed that the
                    husband made all financial contributions towards the acquisition of assets
                    during the marriage. The only issue was to determine what a just and equitable
                    division should be where, as in this case, the husband made all the financial
                    contributions and the wife’s contributions were exclusively
                    non-financial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Case law has established that a homemaker wife can receive a significant
                    proportion of the matrimonial assets even if she has made no financial
                    contributions whatsoever. This is especially so if the couple has children. It
                    has been observed that generally, the proportion ordered for a homemaker wife
                    has not fallen below 35% (Leong Wai Kum, <em>Elements of Family
                        Law in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2007) at pp 741-745). In the
                    recent decision of this Court in <em>Nancy Tay</em>, the
                    proportion ordered for the homemaker wife was 35% even when the husband’s
                    financial contributions were deemed to be “<em>extraordinary</em>” [emphasis added] (<em>Nancy
                        Tay</em> at [80]). There is only one qualification which we would add.
                    It does not follow that this will be the appropriate division in all situations.
                    The length of the marriage is very much a relevant and important consideration.
                    The parties married in August 1996 and the marriage effectively broke down in
                    December 2006. The husband filed for divorce in April 2008. An interim judgment
                    to dissolve the marriage was made in March 2010. If one takes the date of
                    effective breakdown to determine the length of the marriage, it was a ten year
                    plus marriage, not entirely a short marriage. But neither could it be regarded
                    as a long marriage. If one takes the date of the interim judgment as the cut-off
                    date, then it would be a thirteen-and-a-half year marriage. Whichever view one
                    might take as to the length, even it were just ten years as the Judge seemed to
                    take, we could not fail to note that her grant of 0 % to the wife was of
                    unprecedented severity, bearing also in mind that there was one child to the
                    marriage. As for the Vietnamese properties in her sole name, and which the wife
                    was allowed to retain, the fact was that these were not part of the pool of
                    matrimonial assets in the first place because they were assets “acquired
                    by one party…by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially
                    improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the
                    marriage” (s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter). It seemed to us that
                    the grant of 0% to the Wife could be justified only on the basis <em>that the wife had made no contributions to the marriage
                        whatsoever.</em> In implicitly making this finding, the Judge relied
                    on two grounds: (i) the wife’s character flaws and misconduct which made
                    the husband’s marriage to her “a misery”; and (ii) that she
                    had domestic help and there “one wonders how large a role she played as a
                    homemaker bearing in mind her other roles as wife and mother left much to be
                    desired” (see GD at [33]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     With respect to the first ground, while we note that divorce is no longer
                    based on fault, conduct of the parties in relation to the family is nevertheless
                    a relevant consideration in the division of matrimonial assets. Here, we would
                    refer to s 112(2)(d) of the Women’s Charter which provides that the
                    court, in determining the division of matrimonial assets, shall have regard to
                    “the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the
                    family, including looking after the home or caring for the family...”. In
                    this case, as the wife did not make any financial contributions towards the
                    acquisition of the matrimonial assets, her contributions would have to be in
                    respect of “the welfare of the family, including looking after the home
                    or caring for the family”. The Judge was, therefore, not wrong to
                    consider her contributions in that regard. The fault which the Judge found
                    against the wife was her temperament. Besides the husband, her older daughter,
                    [C], also confirmed that. While her temperament might have made the
                    husband’s life miserable, the fact remained that he was, during the
                    marriage, holding a full-time employment which sometimes required him to travel.
                    It would have been the wife, a full-time homemaker, who attended to the home and
                    the needs of the children while he was at work. These contributions must be
                    worth something and should be given their due credit. Of course, on an issue
                    such as this relating to the care of the family by a spouse, it is very much
                    fact-sensitive. No two cases will be the same. But the court should be conscious
                    of the need to exercise caution when confronted with allegations of this nature
                    made by one spouse against the other. To find a wife, a full-time home-maker,
                    particularly where there are children, to have made zero contributions to the
                    family, the facts must be extreme and also undisputed. Where parties were
                    clearly in a highly acrimonious relationship and they have alleged various
                    counts of misconduct against each other, the court should not too readily sift
                    through the facts and evidence in order to assign relative blame for the
                    purposes of dividing matrimonial assets. The temptation by the parties to make
                    such allegation, whether with or without foundation, will be great. As stated by
                    Woo Bih Li J in <em>YG v YH</em> [2008] SGHC 166
                    at [32]), the court has a
                    “reluctance to engage in minute scrut<em>iny of</em>
                    the <em>conduct and contributions of both
                        spouses.”</em> In relation to the present case, although the
                    husband alleged that the wife was abusive and violent, it should be noted that,
                    by the husband’s own admission<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, the allegations of abuse set out in the Amended Statement of
                    Particulars did not involve actual violence: rather they consisted of behaviour
                    such as threatening to beat the children, issuing threats to the husband,
                    throwing the husband out of the house, picking fights with the husband in front
                    of the children, threatening the husband that he would never see the children
                    again if there was a divorce and shouting at the husband that he was a bad
                    father. Of course, such behaviour was far from ideal in a marriage – and
                    indeed that was why it founded a divorce on the basis of the wife’s
                    unreasonable behaviour – but it does not quite make out the Judge’s
                    finding that the wife had a “violent disposition” of which the
                    husband and children were victims (see GD at [29]). There was only one instance of actual physical assault on
                    the husband – this was the incidence where the photographic evidence
                    thereof was relied upon by the Judge in [28] of the GD – but this occurred only in 2009 after the
                    husband had left the matrimonial flat in 2006. In the light of other disturbing
                    facts such as the wife’s counter-allegations of the husband’s
                    violence and the PPO against the husband and the troubling question as to why,
                    if the wife’s violence was really so bad, the husband never applied for a
                    PPO on behalf of himself and his children, we found that the wife’s
                    abusive nature was not of an extreme one-sided nature or undisputed such that
                    the court could comfortably find that it <em>completely negated
                        her contributions as a homemaker</em>. Ultimately, where the evidence
                    shows a marital relationship as acrimonious and dysfunctional as the
                    parties’ here, it is inappropriate for a court to make findings as to how
                    good or bad a wife and mother a party was (as the Judge did at [33] of the GD or how good or bad a husband or
                    father a party was. In our opinion, in the circumstances here, we did not think
                    that the Judge should have found that the wife contributed nothing at all to the
                    family purely on the basis that she made the husband’s life a “a
                    misery”. His life could not have been a misery from day one otherwise the
                    marriage would not have lasted until December 2006 when the husband walked out
                    of the home. There would have been an early period of happiness. When the change
                    occurred was not something we needed to go into.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The second ground relied upon by the Judge, <em>ie</em>
                    that it was doubtful how much of a homemaking role the wife played because she
                    always had domestic help, was also, with respect, erroneous. Having domestic
                    help does not mean the wife made no contributions as a homemaker at all,
                    especially when the parties’ household here included two children. In
                        <em>Lee Chung Meng Joseph v Krysgman Juliet Angela</em>
                    [2000] 3 SLR(R) 965, Tay Yong Kwang J rejected the husband’s
                    argument that the <em>wife did not make indirect contributions as
                        a m</em>ain caregiver to the children because they had domestic help.
                    In Tay J’s words at [41] of
                    the judgment, “Having a maid in the household, or a number of maids for
                    that matter, does not mean <em>abdication of parental
                        responsibility</em>” [emphasis added]. Once again, we must
                    stress that the last thing a court should embark upon is to adjudicate upon
                    snipes and counter-snipes between the parties as demonstrated in this case: the
                    husband argued that the wife merely shouted at the maids to do work, and the
                    wife countered as to how much she had supervised the maids, and so on and so
                    forth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Therefore, with respect, the Judge erred in holding that the wife made no
                    contributions at all to the family, especially when this could not be said to be
                    a short marriage of just a couple of years and when the wife bore one child and
                    the marital partnership included the raising of two children. It might well be
                    that in the later years, the wife’s traits as a mother left something to
                    be desired, but that could not render her contributions to the family as being
                    zero.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     All considered, we held that a just and equitable division would be to give
                    the wife a 20% share of the matrimonial flat and the two Australian properties,
                    the total value of which was assessed to be approximately $2.5m. We indicated at
                        <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above that there was one more asset
                    being disputed <em>ie</em> the bank accounts, but as the
                    total value of these six bank accounts together was very low (<em>ie</em> less than $4000), we felt it unnecessary to divide it. We
                    further ordered that the 20% share of the matrimonial flat and the two
                    Australian properties be paid by the husband to the wife within 6 months from
                    date of our order on 30 September 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Stock Options</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     At this point, we would briefly address the wife’s contention that the
                    pool of matrimonial assets should have included the stock options which the
                    husband had in the company he worked in, and that the Judge should have drawn an
                    adverse inference against the husband for failing to disclose these
                        assets<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. While it is undisputed that certain categories of stock options can
                    constitute matrimonial assets (<em>Chan Teck Hock David v Leong
                        Mei Chuan</em> [2000] SGHC 150), the husband had already
                    explained in his affidavits that that his stock options had no value because the
                    company had not gone public – his company was a small start-up company and
                    had no plans to go public and therefore could not attach any monetary value to
                    those options. The wife provided no evidence to prove otherwise, and we held
                    that the Judge was right in accepting the husband’s explanation (see GD at
                        [34]) by not regarding the options
                    as an asset of value.</p>

                    family’s only source of income was from the husband, who earned $12,600 a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     On this basis, at the hearing before the Judge, the wife asked for maintenance
                    of $12,000 for herself and $4000 a month for [B]<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. On appeal before us, however, she moderated this claim downwards to
                    “at least $5000 a month”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The husband asserted that the wife’s monthly expenses were inflated, and
                    that the wife’s monthly expenditure – as evidenced by how much she
                    withdrew from the joint account into which he banked money every month –
                    was $1250 (consisting of transport, food, maid, toiletries, clothing, and
                    medical expenses).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> He also asserted that many of the items listed in the table at
                        <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above were paid every month by him
                    and should not be reckoned as part of the wife’s expenses.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Judge’s order</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As stated at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above, the Judge’s
                    order was for the husband to pay the wife a lump sum maintenance of $250,000 as
                    well as a one-off payment of $10,000 to assist her in shifting out of the
                    matrimonial flat, making a total of $260,000. As for the maintenance of [B], the
                    Judge granted the husband’s request to pay for all of [B]’s expenses
                    directly to third parties rather than to the wife. The order for the
                    wife’s maintenance was based on a base figure of $1000 per month computed
                    over 20 years, totalling $240,000, which would “serve as adequate
                    provision for the wife’s maintenance until she turned 62 on the basis she
                    would work and continue working until she reached that age”. The Judge
                    then added $10,000 to this figure to assist the wife in meeting the expenses of
                    shifting out of the matrimonial flat into rented premises if she so desired (see
                    GD at [44]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     There were two issues to be determined on appeal with respect to maintenance:
                    (i) whether the Judge’s order that the husband pay for [B]’s
                    expenses directly to third parties should be upheld; (ii) whether the
                    Judge’s order for lump sum maintenance of $260,000 should be
                    upheld.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     On the first issue, we found there to be no particular reason to disturb the
                    Judge’s order. Although the wife raised it as an issue<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>, she did not actually make any arguments as to why this order should
                    be overturned. In our view, the Judge was entitled to take into account the
                    husband’s fear that the wife would use the money for herself. More
                    importantly, [B]’s needs were not prejudiced by this order – in fact
                    her needs were more comprehensively provided for than if a round figure were
                    ordered to be paid to the wife every month. For these reasons, we were of the
                    view that the Judge did not exercise her discretion wrongly, and upheld her
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     As for the lump sum maintenance of $260,000 for the wife, we thought this
                    amount appeared low, especially when she was not given any share of the
                    matrimonial assets. She would need to find accommodation for herself. We agree
                    with the Judge that the wife is not at an age where she will be unable to find
                    work. She has skills in the beauty industry and there is no reason why she could
                    not put those skills to profitable use. However, in our opinion, given our award
                    of 20% share of the matrimonial assets to the wife that would make a difference
                    to the picture (see s 114(1)(a) of the Women’s Charter and <em>BG v BF</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [75]). The table at
                        <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a> above does suggest that the Judge
                    was right to hold that the wife had deliberately inflated her maintenance claim
                    (see GD at [25]) – transport
                    expenses of $1500 and entertainment expenses of $1000 are two clear examples. It
                    is also clear that items such as mortgage expenses, property tax, utilities and
                    telephone expenses, maintenance of the matrimonial flat, were attempts to
                    inflate her expenses, given that the husband paid for these. Her claims for
                    groceries and household at $1200 and for food at $1000 seemed to us also
                    inflated. By the husband’s estimate, the wife’s monthly expenses
                    amounted to approximately $1250 (see above at <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a>), which made a sum of $1000 a month slightly low, but when
                    it is viewed against the fact that the maintenance for the wife is to be paid in
                    a lump sum up-front and further we have, in this appeal, granted her 20% of the
                    matrimonial assets, we did not think that the circumstances called for an
                    intervention in the maintenance award made by the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Although the wife was right to argue that under s 114(1)(c) of the
                    Women’s Charter, the court in arriving at a maintenance sum must take into
                    account the standard of living that she was accustomed to<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> and that s 114(2) directs the court to endeavour to place the
                    parties in the financial position in which they would have been had the marriage
                    not broken down<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>, these are not absolute considerations but are subject to “so
                    far as it is practicable”, “having regard to their conduct”
                    and “just to do so”. In this regard, we should further point out
                    that those considerations must also be balanced against the husband’s
                    financial needs and obligations (s 114(1)(b)). In this respect, we noted that
                    the husband is solely responsible to provide for both [C] and [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Order to attend anger management counselling</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The last issue to be dealt with is the Judge’s order for the wife to
                    attend anger management counselling with a psychiatrist to be approved by the
                    husband, at the husband’s expense. In our view, there was sufficient
                    evidence that it would be in [B]’s best interests for the wife to attend
                    the same – even discounting the evidence given by [C] and the husband,
                    which the wife hotly disputed, there was sufficient evidence in the agreed
                    Amended Statement of Particulars founding the divorce (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above) for the Judge to have found that the
                    wife “had serious anger management issues that needed to be
                    addressed” (see GD at [29]). In
                    light of [B]’s best interests and the fact that the husband was to bear
                    the cost of such counselling, we upheld the Judge’s order. We further
                    directed that this was to take the form of four (4) quarterly sessions with the
                    psychiatrist for the period of a year starting in October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In summary, we ordered the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_a"></a>(a)     The wife was awarded 20% of the matrimonial assets (consisting of the
                        matrimonial flat and the two Australian properties assessed at $2.5m). This
                        was to be paid by the husband to the wife within 6 months from date of this
                        order;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_b"></a>(b)     The outstanding maintenance payments <em>ie</em>
                        $200,000 was to be paid in four (4) equal quarterly instalments commencing
                        on 31 October 2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Judge’s order that the wife was to attend anger management
                        counselling with a psychiatrist approved by the husband and at the
                        husband’s expense was to remain. We further directed that this was to
                        take the form of four (4) quarterly sessions with the psychiatrist for the
                        period of a year starting in October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_d"></a>(d)     The wife was to move out of the matrimonial flat and hand over the keys to
                        the husband on or before 30 November 2011;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_e"></a>(e)     All other orders made below remained; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_f"></a>(f)     The wife was awarded costs of $5000 plus disbursements;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     We heard parties again on 8 November 2011 at the wife’s request and
                    granted the wife an extension of time till 15 February 2012 to vacate the
                    matrimonial flat and hand over the keys to the husband. We indicated that there
                    would be no further extension of time.</p>
