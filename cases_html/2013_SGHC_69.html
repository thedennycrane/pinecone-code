<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These three criminal revision applications were
                    filed pursuant to s 404 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (Act 15 of
                    2010) (“CPC 2010”) by three petitioners seeking the revision of
                    orders made by the District Court on 23 November 2012. The underlying legal
                    dispute revolved around the Prosecution’s discovery obligations under the
                    Criminal Case Disclosure Conference (“CCDC”) regime introduced by
                    the CPC 2010. In particular, it pertained to the extent to which the summary of
                    facts in the disclosed Case for the Prosecution had to contain particulars
                    “in support of” the charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The 1st petitioner, Mr Li Weiming (alias
                    Stephen), was an employee of ZTE Corporation (“ZTE”) in 2006 and
                    was ZTE’s chief representative for Brunei, Papua New Guinea and the South
                    Pacific Islands from 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> ZTE is
                    headquartered in Shenzhen, the People’s Republic of China, and is a large
                    vendor of information technology (“IT”) and telecommunications
                        equipment.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>
                    Sometime in 2010, ZTE was awarded a project worth US$35m as the main contractor
                    for an ambitious community college project in Papua New Guinea. The project
                    envisioned the creation of a virtual university network anchored by 89 community
                    colleges throughout the country.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> All three petitioners were
                    involved in the discussions which led to the award of the project to
                ZTE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The 2nd petitioner, Ms Lim Ai Wah, is the
                    director of Questzone Offshore Pte Ltd (“Questzone”), a British
                    Virgin Islands company of which she is the sole member apart from her sister,
                    Ms Lim Swee Kheng, who is a nominal director.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Questzone was allegedly set up for the sole
                    purpose of receiving commission payments from ZTE arising from the award of the
                    community college project in Papua New Guinea.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The 3rd petitioner, Mr Thomas Philip
                    Doehrman, is Ms Lim Ai Wah’s husband. He assists the Papua New Guinea
                    government under a trust for the community college project (“the ITE
                        trust”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Together with the 2nd petitioner, he is
                    also a director of Quest Petroleum (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Quest
                    Petroleum”), which provides consultancy, natural resource, IT and mining
                    services to foreign companies.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Quest Petroleum was created in the late 1990s
                    when the 3rd petitioner began to conduct business in Papua New
                        Guinea.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Each of the petitioners faces six charges. These
                    consist of a single charge under s 477A read with s 109 of the Penal
                    Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”), and five
                    charges under s 47(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Corruption,
                    Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act
                    (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The charge under s 477A of the Penal Code
                    (“s 477A PC”) relates to an alleged conspiracy between the
                    petitioners to issue an invoice dated 15 July 2010 that “falsely
                    purported to seek payment to Questzone as a sub-contractor under a fictitious
                        sub-contract”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> This invoice was
                    issued by Questzone to ZTE. The CDSA charges pertain to five separate payments
                    made by Questzone to the petitioners out of the proceeds gained from the
                    s 477A PC offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The prelude to the present applications</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Case for the Prosecution in respect of the
                    charges brought against each of the petitioners was filed and served on
                    13 September 2012. Each Case for the Prosecution contained the relevant
                    charges, a list of witnesses, a list of exhibits, statements from the petitioner
                    charged and a summary of facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The summary of facts for the s 477A PC
                    charge replicated the charge apart from additional details as to the events
                    which followed from the alleged offence. It stated that sometime in July 2010,
                    the 2nd petitioner passed the allegedly falsified invoice dated 15 July
                    2010 to the 1st petitioner in Singapore, which the 1st petitioner then forwarded
                    to ZTE’s Singapore branch office. Further:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… On or about 31 July 2010, having approved the payment of
                        US$3.6 million to Questzone in accordance with the Invoice and the
                        fictitious contract between ZTE and Questzone, ZTE effected the said payment
                        of US$3.6 million through its Hong Kong subsidiary, ZTE (HK) Limited
                        via a telegraphic transfer to Questzone’s Standard Chartered Bank
                        Account (account number: [xxx]) in Singapore (“the Questzone
                        account”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Each of the summaries of facts for the remaining
                    five charges under the CDSA was completely identical to the corresponding
                    charge, and included no additional particulars.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 11 October 2012, each of the
                    petitioners brought an application under s 162(<em>b</em>) read with s 169(2) of the CPC 2010 seeking either a
                    discharge not amounting to an acquittal (“DNAQ”) or an order for
                    further particulars. Each application was predicated upon the
                    Prosecution’s purported failure to comply with the requirements of
                    s 162 of the CPC 2010 in its disclosed summary of facts. The further
                    particulars sought related to three key issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     the party whom the petitioners had
                        allegedly conspired to defraud;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     the reasons why the sub-contract between ZTE and
                        Questzone was allegedly fictitious; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_c"></a>(c)     details of the alleged conspiracy between the
                        petitioners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The applications were dismissed by the
                    District Court, albeit with an acknowledgement that valid issues had been raised
                    which should be dealt with by the trial judge. This led to the
                    petitioners’ present applications to the High Court for a revision of the
                    District Court’s order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     After hearing submissions from the respective
                    parties, I ordered further particulars in relation to issues (a) and (b) as
                    stated in [10] above, but not in relation to issue (c). I now offer the
                    reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The relevant legal provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The rules governing the CCDC procedure are set
                    out in s 162 of the CPC 2010, which provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Contents of Case for the
                            Prosecution</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>162</b>.    The Case for the Prosecution must
                            contain —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    the charge which
                                the prosecution intends to proceed with at the trial;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    
                <em>a summary of the facts in support of the
                                    charge</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    a list of the
                                names of the witnesses for the prosecution;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Illustration (<em>b</em>) to s 162 offers an example of the application of
                    s 162 to charges involving conspiracy. However, it will be seen that while
                    this illustration is not precisely on point as far as issues (a) and (b) as
                    stated in [10] above are concerned (see [32] below), it is clearly germane to
                    issue (c) as stated in [10] above. Illustration (<em>b</em>) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>)    
              <em>A</em> is charged
                            with conspiracy to cheat together with a known person and an unknown
                            person. The summary of facts should state —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(i)    when and where the conspiracy took place;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(ii)   who the known conspirators were and what they
                                did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     15 It should also be noted that the
                    requirement of a summary of facts for the Prosecution is only applicable for
                    cases heard in the Subordinate Courts. When a case is to be tried in the High
                    Court, the committal hearing procedure applies and no summary of facts needs to
                    be tendered after the committal of the accused for trial, although
                        s 188(4)(<em>l</em>) of the CPC 2010 requires all
                    written statements which will be used as evidence to be disclosed to the
                    Defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background to the CCDC regime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The CCDC regime was brought into being by the
                    CPC 2010, which ushered in a new era of pre-trial criminal discovery. At the
                    second reading of the Criminal Procedure Code Bill 2010 (Bill 11 of 2010),
                    which was eventually enacted as the CPC 2010, the Minister for Law,
                    Mr K Shanmugam (“the Minister”), offered the following
                    exposition on the objectives of the new disclosure procedure (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 487):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Disclosure is familiar to lawyers operating within the common law system.
                        In civil proceedings, the timely disclosure of information has <em>helped parties to prepare for trial and assess their cases more
                            fully</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Criminal cases can benefit from the same
                            approach</em>. However, discovery in the criminal context would
                        need to be tailored to deal with complexities of criminal practice, such as
                        the danger of witnesses being suborned.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To this end, Part IX of the Bill introduces a formalised framework
                        obliging the prosecution and the defence to exchange relevant information
                        about their respective cases before trial. This will introduce <em>greater transparency and consistency to the pre-trial
                            process</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The framework has a number of safeguards to try and prevent abuse. The
                        sequential nature of the process protects the interests of [the] prosecution
                        and [the] defence. The onus is on the prosecution to set out its case first,
                        with the accused’s statements that it is relying upon. The provision
                        of all statements after the defence case is filed cuts down on opportunities
                        to tailor evidence. At the same time, if either party refuses to file its
                        case, or files an incomplete case, or advances an argument at trial
                        inconsistent with its previously filed case, the Court may draw any
                        inference it deems fit. In addition, where the prosecution fails to comply
                        with its obligations, the Court may order a discharge not amounting to an
                        acquittal. This approach tries to ensure that <em>parties
                            take discovery seriously</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     I have quoted these comments of the Minister
                        <em>in extenso</em> because they offer the context
                    within which to interpret the requirement in s 162(<em>b</em>) of the CPC 2010 that the summary of facts in the Case for the
                    Prosecution should be “in support of the charge”. It is trite that
                    the court should interpret a provision of a written law in a manner which
                    promotes the purpose or object underlying that written law (see s 9A of the
                    Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) and <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 183 at
                    [39]–[49]). The Minister’s comments reveal unequivocally that the
                    CCDC regime was intended to precipitate a sea change in the criminal discovery
                    process, with the tide shifting towards greater transparency and parity between
                    the parties so as to help them prepare for trial. The requirement for a summary
                    of facts in the Case for the Prosecution is one element in this climactic
                    change. It is also noteworthy that the Case for the Prosecution is served before
                    the Case for the Defence, and, significantly, the CPC 2010 does not extend the
                    discretion to opt out of the CCDC process to the Prosecution. The Case for the
                    Prosecution therefore sets the tone both practically and figuratively for the
                    entire CCDC regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     As I see it, the express requirement that a
                    summary of facts be included in the Case for the Prosecution must have been
                        <em>for a purpose</em>. It is a basic premise of
                    statutory interpretation that Parliament does nothing in vain. This was applied
                    by the English Court of Appeal as a “presumption” in <em>Halki Shipping Corporation v Sopex Oils Ltd</em> [1998]
                    1 WLR 726 at 749 and as a “rule” in <em>Regina
                        v Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council</em>, Ex parte <em>Watson; Regina v Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council</em>,
                    Ex parte <em>Armstrong; Regina v Manchester City
                        Council</em>, Ex parte <em>Stennett; Regina v Harrow
                        London Borough Council</em>, Ex parte <em>Cobham</em> [2001] QB 370 at 385. The same proposition has also been
                    expressly applied by our High Court in <em>Wong Seng Kwan v
                        Public Prosecutor</em> [2012] 3 SLR 12 at [42] and [51] and
                        <em>Ramanathan Yogendran v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1995] 2 SLR(R) 471 (“<em>Ramanathan</em>”). In the latter case, Yong Pung How CJ
                    stated at [72] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he approach suggested by the Prosecution accords with the
                        accepted principles of statutory construction (see <em>Craies, Statute Law</em> (7th Ed, 1971)). A purposive
                        approach to construction will be adopted where the meaning of the provision
                        is not plain or is ambiguous. This approach embraces the maxim, <em>ut res magis valeat quam pereat</em> – words should
                        be construed so as to give a sensible meaning to them. The courts should
                        desist from treating words as surplusage or void. ...</p>

                    guidance:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Futile or pointless
                        result</em>  Parliament does nothing in vain, a principle
                        also expressed as <em>lex nil frustra facit</em> (the
                        law does nothing in vain). It is an old maxim of the law that <em>quod vanum et inutile est, lex non requirit</em> (the law
                        does not call for what is vain and useless). Or as it is put in another
                        form: <em>lex non praecipit inutilia</em> (the law does
                        not demand the doing of useless things). ‘The law never compels a
                        person to do that which is useless and unnecessary.’ Through the
                        inevitable limitations of language, it sometimes nevertheless happens that,
                        in the events that have occurred in the instant case, the literal meaning of
                        the enactment seems to demand the doing of something that would be futile or
                        pointless. Here the court will strive to find a more sensible
                        construction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The court would be remiss to treat the summary
                    of facts in the Case for the Prosecution in a manner which relegates it to
                    redundancy. The converse, however, also holds true – the summary of facts
                    ought not to be invested with a significance which oversteps the intentions of
                    Parliament in introducing the CCDC regime. A balance must be found between these
                    two extremes, bearing in mind that the object of the CCDC regime is to
                    facilitate the trial such that the accused will know the case which he has to
                    meet, and such that the Prosecution will not be caught off-guard by the defence
                    which the accused will raise. To this end, I would think that at the very least,
                    the summary of facts should not be crafted in such a way, or contain only such
                    barest of facts, as to leave the opposing party or parties vulnerable to being
                    taken by surprise at the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Consequences of non-compliance with the CCDC regime</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Section 169 of the CPC 2010 expressly
                    stipulates that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>169.</b>—(1) The court
                        may draw such inference as it thinks fit if —</p>

                                fails to serve the Case for the Prosecution on the accused or the
                                defence fails to serve the Case for the Defence after the Case for
                                the Prosecution has been served on him;</p>

                                part of the items specified in section 162 or 165(1),
                                respectively; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    the prosecution
                                or the defence puts forward a case at the trial which differs from
                                or is otherwise inconsistent with the Case for the Prosecution or
                                the Case for the Defence, respectively, that has been
                            filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    If the prosecution fails to serve the Case for the
                            Prosecution in respect of any charge which the prosecution intends to
                            proceed with at trial within the time permitted under section 161
                            or the Case for the Prosecution does not contain any or any part of the
                            items specified in section 162, a court may order a discharge not
                            amounting to an acquittal in relation to the charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It was argued by the petitioners that in
                    omitting to provide particulars on key issues, the Prosecution had effectively
                    failed to disclose “<em>part of</em> the [summary of
                    facts]” [emphasis added] for the purposes of ss 169(1)(<em>b</em>) and 169(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Prosecution’s response thereto
                    consisted of three interconnected arguments. First, it was contended that the
                    disclosed summary of facts did comply with the requirements of s 162 of the
                    CPC 2010. Second, even if there had been non-compliance with s 162, the
                    court did not have any jurisdiction to order further particulars. Third,
                    recourse for any breach of the Prosecution’s discovery obligations should
                    be left to the trial judge, who could draw the necessary adverse inferences in
                    accordance with s 169.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I will first address the second and third
                    arguments of the Prosecution as they are more closely related. Section 404
                    of the CPC 2010 empowers the High Court to revise orders made at any
                    CCDC:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>404.</b>—(1) The High Court may, on
                        its own motion or on the application of the Public Prosecutor or the accused
                        in any criminal case disclosure conference, call for and examine the record
                        of any criminal case disclosure conference held under Part IX or X
                        before a Magistrate, a District Judge, the Registrar of the Subordinate
                        Courts or the Registrar of the Supreme Court to satisfy itself as to the
                            <em>correctness</em>, legality or propriety of any
                        order recorded or passed at the criminal case disclosure conference, and as
                        to the regularity of the criminal case disclosure conference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I note that while the order which was the
                    subject of the present criminal revision applications was not made <em>at</em> or <em>during</em> a CCDC, it
                    was nevertheless made at a hearing of applications brought under
                        ss 162(<em>b</em>) read with 169(2) of the CPC
                    2010. Such applications should be regarded as a continuation of the CCDC. It
                    would run contrary to the spirit of s 404 to say that an order made upon
                    such applications would not fall within the scope of the High Court’s
                    revisionary powers as such applications are very much part and parcel of the
                    CCDC process. I should mention that although this specific point was not taken
                    by the Prosecution, I thought I should nevertheless allude to it. In this
                    regard, I would reiterate the legal adage that the court should look at
                    substance rather than form, a principle which has been applied across a wide
                    range of cases (see <em>The “Andres
                        Bonifacio”</em> [1993] 3 SLR(R) 71 at [42], <em>Panwah Steel Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Building &amp; Civil
                        Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd</em> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 571 at
                    [19], <em>Lock Han Chng Jonathan (Jonathan Luo Hancheng) v Goh
                        Jessiline</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 455 at [36] and <em>Ang Tin Yong v Ang Boon Chye and another</em> [2012] 1 SLR 447
                    at [15]) and which should be all the more important in the context of criminal
                    procedure, like the CCDC, to ensure a fair trial. I would also add that s 6
                    of the CPC 2010 provides for “such procedure as the justice of the case
                    may require” to be adopted where no special provision has been made as
                    regards any matter of criminal procedure – although I do not think that
                    any such innovation is necessary in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the present case, two sub-sections of
                    s 404 of the CPC 2010 are particularly relevant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    On examining a record under revision in this
                            Division [<em>ie</em>, Division 4 of
                            Part XX of the CPC 2010], the High Court may <em>affirm, vary or set aside</em> any of the orders made by the
                            Magistrate, District Judge, Registrar of the Subordinate Courts or
                            Registrar of the Supreme Court, as the case may be, who presided over
                            the criminal case disclosure conference.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Where a case is revised under this Division, the
                            High Court must certify its decision or order to the Magistrate,

                            Supreme Court, as the case may be, who recorded or passed the order at
                            the criminal case disclosure conference and that Magistrate, District
                            Judge, Registrar of the Subordinate Courts or the Registrar of the

                            order</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Read in conjunction, ss 404(3) and 404(5)
                    clearly demonstrate that the consequences of non-compliance as prescribed in
                    s 169 cannot be exhaustive. A narrow reading would unduly constrict the
                    revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court, which is widely framed under
                    s 404(3). The phrasing of s 404(5), which expressly binds the
                    presiding judicial officer to give effect to the High Court’s order, also
                    militates against limiting the High Court’s powers to just the remedies
                    available to the presiding judicial officer under s 169.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Second, the argument that any recourse for a
                    lack of particulars should be deferred to the trial judge also detracts from the
                    purpose of pre-trial criminal discovery. This is particularly so because the
                    ability of the trial judge to draw adverse inferences will be frustrated or
                    considerably hampered if the disclosed summary of facts is so bare that the
                    Defence cannot contend that the Prosecution has done what
                        s 169(1)(<em>c</em>) of the CPC 2010 proscribes,
                    namely, put forward at the trial a case which “differs from or is
                    otherwise inconsistent with” the Case for the Prosecution that was filed.
                    It would be difficult, in these circumstances, to draw any adverse inference
                    from an omission in the Case for the Prosecution. This will not be fair to the
                    Defence. Moreover, the difficulty of drawing an adverse inference will
                    effectively place the trial judge in the invidious position of having to choose
                    between either the drastic option of ordering a DNAQ so as to hold the
                    Prosecution to its discovery obligations, or making no order to penalise the
                    Prosecution for non-compliance with the same. Should these be the only
                    meaningful options available to the court, then curial supervision over the CCDC
                    process would be rendered anaemic and the stated objective of greater
                    transparency would be thwarted. In any event, it seems to me to be reasonable
                    for a court which intends to order a DNAQ to offer the Prosecution a final
                    opportunity to meet its discovery obligations. This would not be possible if
                    s 169 is taken as exhaustive of all the remedies which a court can order
                    for non-compliance with the CCDC regime.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     If, as the Minister said, parties are to
                    “take discovery seriously” (see [16] above), then the court must
                    be involved at the preliminary stages to ensure that the CCDC regime is
                    effective in helping parties to prepare for trial. Taking the provisions in
                    Parts IX and XX of the CPC 2010 in their totality, it can be seen that the
                    invocation of the High Court’s revisionary power in s 404 (which
                    falls under Part XX of the CPC 2010) serves to facilitate <em>compliance</em> with the criminal discovery process, whilst
                    s 169 (which falls under Part IX of the CPC 2010) provides for the
                    consequences which flow from parties’
                    <em>non-compliance</em> with the same. Effect must be given
                    to both ss 169 and 404, and they must be construed harmoniously. Such an
                    approach is exemplified by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Kwan Richard</em>
                    [1968–1970] SLR(R) 846, where the court was presented with three
                    ostensibly mismatched provisions relating to the jurisdiction of a
                    Magistrate’s Court to try an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 119, 1955 Rev Ed) (“the 1955 Penal Code”), which
                    offence was punishable with imprisonment of up to seven years as well as with
                    fine. In gist, s 9(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Criminal
                    Procedure Code (Cap 132, 1955 Rev Ed) (“the CPC 1955”)
                    limited a Magistrate’s Court’s criminal jurisdiction to offences for
                    which the maximum imprisonment term did not exceed three years and offences
                    which were punishable only with fine, whilst s 10(1) provided that
                    “[s]ubject to the other provisions of this Code”, the same court
                    could try offences by reference to the eighth column of Schedule A to the
                    CPC 1955, which column included the offence under s 420 of the 1955 Penal
                    Code. At the same time, s 11 of the CPC 1955 stipulated that the Public
                    Prosecutor’s written authorisation was required for a Magistrate’s
                    Court to try an offence which was triable only by a District Court under
                    s 10.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The accused argued that ss 9 and 10 of
                    the CPC 1955 were irreconcilable in relation to the offence under s 420 of
                    the 1955 Penal Code, and that the authorisation of the Public Prosecutor under
                    s 11 of the CPC 1955 was required before a Magistrate’s Court would
                    have the jurisdiction to try him for that offence. Upon the Prosecution’s
                    application, the question of whether a Magistrate’s Court had jurisdiction
                    to try an offence under s 420 of the 1955 Penal Code without the
                    authorisation of the Public Prosecutor under s 11 of the CPC 1955 was
                    reserved for the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision. The court held (at
                    [11]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is said that s 9(1)(<em>a</em>) and
                        s 10[(1)] in so far as they confer jurisdiction on a Magistrate’s
                        Court are irreconcilable. We do not agree and in our judgment they are
                        reconcilable if s 9(1)(<em>a</em>) is construed as
                        a provision which deals with the general jurisdiction of a
                        Magistrate’s Court in regard to all offences under any written law in
                        force for the time being and s 10[(1)] is construed as a provision
                        which deals with Penal Code offences only and specifically sets out the
                        court or courts which has or have jurisdiction in respect of each Penal Code
                        offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In adopting such an approach, the court sought
                    to apply all the relevant provisions in a complementary and harmonious fashion
                    guided by the purpose of the statute. A similar ethos is also discernible in
                    Yong Pung How CJ’s decision in <em>Ramanathan</em> at [72] (see [18] above) and the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision in <em>Quek Hock Lye v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2012] 2 SLR 1012 at [29]. In addition, helpful
                    guidance can also be found in <em>Bennion</em> at
                    p 559:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The <em>ut res magis</em> principle
                        requires inconsistencies within an Act to be reconciled. Blackstone
                        said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘One part of the statute must be so construed by another, that
                            the whole may, if possible, stand: <em>ut res magis
                                valeat quam pereat</em>.’</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The principle also means that, <em>if the obvious intention
                            of the enactment gives rise to difficulties in implementation, the court
                            must do its best to find ways of resolving these</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In my opinion, the omission of key particulars
                    would constitute a failure to provide “part of the [summary of
                    facts]” for the purposes of ss 169(1)(<em>b</em>) and 169(2) of the CPC 2010. The Prosecution cannot claim that
                    it has complied with s 162(<em>b</em>) so long as it
                    has merely nominally included a summary of facts, as s 162(<em>b</em>) expressly imposes a substantive requirement that the
                    summary of facts be “in support of the charge”. It is a trite
                    proposition that a charge must contain all the essential ingredients of the
                    alleged offence so as to give the accused person notice and a chance to defend
                    himself (see <em>Assathamby s/o Karupiah v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 1030 at [9]). This entails that
                    the charge must contain particulars relating to the time and place of the
                    alleged offence, as well as the person or thing against whom or in respect of
                    which the alleged offence was committed (see s 124 of the CPC 2010). If
                    necessary, the charge must also contain details as to how the alleged offence
                    was committed (see s 125 of the CPC 2010). The summary of facts tendered by
                    the Prosecution should therefore reinforce the particulars already contained in
                    the charge, and offer further notice and clarity of the case which the Defence
                    is to answer. It follows that in most cases, the summary of facts will have to
                    elaborate on rather than replicate the charge. In this regard, it appears that
                        Illustration (<em>b</em>) to s 162 of the CPC
                    2010 (see [14] above) is of limited help in the specific context of the present
                    s 477A PC charge against each of the petitioners.
                        Illustration (<em>b</em>) represents the minimum
                    content to be contained in a summary of facts where s 109 of the Penal Code
                    (“s 109 PC”) is engaged, and does not offer further guidance
                    as to what else is to be included. In the present case, details as to where and
                    when the alleged conspiracy occurred, who the known conspirators were and what
                    they did –
                    <em>viz</em>, the minimum details required by
                        Illustration (<em>b</em>) – were already
                    contained in the s 477A PC charge against each petitioner. It is
                        Illustration (<em>a</em>) to s 162 of the CPC
                    2010, instead, which is more useful in relation to the primary s 477A PC
                    charge, as distinct from the secondary liability imposed by s 109 PC.
                        Illustration (<em>a</em>) to s 162 of the CPC
                    2010 states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>a</em>)    
              <em>A</em> is charged with theft of a shirt from a shop. The
                            summary of facts should state the facts in support of the charge, for
                            example, that <em>A</em> was seen taking a shirt in
                            the shop and putting it into his bag, and that <em>A</em> left the shop without paying for the
                        shirt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     This clearly demonstrates that the summary of
                    facts must present a more complete picture of the primary offence in order to be
                    “in support of the charge”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The particulars sought by the petitioners</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Nature of the offence under s 477A PC</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In order to determine whether the summary of
                    facts tendered by the Prosecution in this case operated “in support
                    of” the s 477A PC charge faced by each of the petitioners, the
                    nature of the alleged offence is critical. It is an essential ingredient of the
                    s 477A PC offence that the accused possessed the “intent to
                    defraud”. The Explanation in s 477A PC stipulates that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Explanation</em>—. —It shall be
                        sufficient in any charge under this section to allege a general intent to

                        specifying any particular sum of money intended to be the subject of the
                        fraud or any particular day on which the offence was committed.</p>

                between ZTE and Questzone</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I note that in <em>Phang Wah
                        and others v Public Prosecutor</em> [2012] 1 SLR 646
                        (“<em>Phang Wah</em>”) at [61], Tay Yong
                    Kwang J observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [T]he explanatory note to s 477A makes it clear that it is
                        sufficient <em>to assert a general intent to
                            defraud</em> without naming any particular person intended to be
                        defrauded or specifying any particular sum of money intended to be the
                        subject of the fraud ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In <em>Phang Wah</em>,
                    the dispute centred on whether the accused knew how much he would gain by his
                    deception, and not on the identity of the party deceived. The considerations are
                    different in the latter case, and a more nuanced approach might be called for.
                    The explanatory statement in s 477A PC undoubtedly serves to cover cases
                    where the deception is directed indiscriminately at the general public. The
                    paradigm case would perhaps be the falsification of company accounts to create a
                    misleading picture of the company’s health to public investors. Counsel
                    for the petitioners also suggested the example of Internet scams which are
                    directed towards web users at large. The present case could not be said to be
                    even remotely similar to such situations. The petitioners were alleged to have
                    falsified an invoice which was issued to a company with whom they had prior
                    dealings. In the case of the 1st petitioner, that company was the company which
                    employed him. It was evident that the allegedly falsified invoice dated
                    15 July 2010 was not purely speculative. Indeed, the summary of facts did
                    not state that the petitioners had falsified that invoice with a general intent
                    to defraud (as would be the case in a public scam). However, it was also silent
                    as to the person or entity deceived.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The summary of facts was also equally silent
                    as to how and why the sub-contract between ZTE and Questzone was fictitious.
                    Presumably, the alleged falsity of the invoice dated 15 July 2010 was
                    predicated on the alleged “fictitiousness” of the sub-contract, so
                    that the two matters were interlinked. It was peculiar that according to the
                    charge and the summary of facts, a false invoice had been issued pursuant to a
                    fictitious sub-contract where the recipient of the invoice knew, and was known
                    by, the issuer. This suggested that the person defrauded was a third party to
                    the transaction. In the course of oral submissions before me, the Prosecution
                    stated that the defrauded party could be either ZTE or the Papua New Guinea
                    government. The Prosecution’s written submissions before me also revealed
                    allegations that Questzone had been set up as a shell company to perpetuate the
                    conspiracy. It was apparent that the Prosecution did have a factual gap which it
                    needed to plug in its summary of facts. At para 5 of the
                    Prosecution’s written submissions, it was stated that the
                    petitioners:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… came up with a scheme to set up a shell company, [Questzone],
                        which purported to invoice ZTE for various sub-contracted works ... In
                        reality, no sub-contracted works were carried out by Questzone and the
                        invoices submitted by Questzone were falsified documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">At para 41 of the same submissions, the Prosecution averred that
                    from a review of the petitioners’ statements:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t can be seen that [the petitioners] were all party to an
                        agreement to get money from ZTE via an invoice from a shell company,
                        Questzone; and that the invoice would falsely represent to ZTE that payment
                        was due under a contract between ZTE and Questzone when the alleged contract
                        was no more than a fiction. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These were factual propositions which supported the s 477A PC
                    charge by offering forensic details of the alleged deception, and they should
                    have been included in the Case for the Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Intent to defraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Section 477A PC is derived from the
                    equivalent provision in India’s Penal Code (Act No 45 of 1860).
                    Although s 477A PC has remained substantively unchanged since the enactment
                    of our Penal Code, the core concept of “intent to defraud” has not
                    received much analysis in our courts. The usual approach has been to adopt the
                    meaning ascribed to the phrase in other areas of the law. For example, in
                        <em>Goh Kah Heng (alias Shi Ming Yi) v Public Prosecutor and
                        another matter</em> [2010] 4 SLR 258 (“<em>Goh Kah Heng</em>”), Tay Yong Kwang J agreed at [42] with
                    the approach adopted in <em>Public Prosecutor v Chow Wai
                        Lam</em> [2006] SGDC 1 at [47]–[52]. The latter case related to
                    “intent to defraud” in the context of s 406(<em>c</em>) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed).
                    The parties have also cited <em>Law Society of Singapore v
                        Nor’ain bte Abu Bakar and others</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 753,
                    in which the Court of Three Judges stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    ... In <em>Seet Soon Guan v Public Prosecutor</em> [1955] MLJ
                            223 at 225, Buhagiar J, after examining the local and Indian cases
                            and also the Indian and Malay States’ contract legislation, held
                            (at 228) that a person would have acted fraudulently or with intent to
                            defraud under the Malaysian equivalent of s 25 of the Penal Code
                            if:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... he acts with the intention that some person be deceived and by
                            means of such deception that either an advantage should accrue to him or
                            injury, loss or detriment should befall some other person or
                            persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">45    The same meaning is given to the definition in the
                            Penal Code (Act No 45 of 1860) (India) by the Indian Supreme Court
                            in <em>S P Chengalvaraya Naidu v
                                Jagannath</em> AIR 1994 SC 853.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 25 of the Penal Code sets out the meaning of the term
                    “fraudulently”, and provides that “[a] person is said to do
                    a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to defraud, but not
                    otherwise”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the present case, the meaning of the phrase
                    “intent to defraud” must be interpreted within the specific
                    context of s 477A PC, and must also take cognisance of the effect of the
                    explanatory statement in that section. The difficulty with the exposition in the
                    cases cited above is that these cases adopt a general analysis that does not
                    contemplate the possibility of an amorphous intent to defraud, which scenario is
                    specifically catered for in s 477A PC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In contrast, the Indian courts have developed
                    a more detailed jurisprudence on the particular meaning to be ascribed to the
                    phrase “intent to defraud” in the context of their equivalent of
                    s 477A PC. In <em>S</em> <em>Harnam Singh v The State</em> AIR 1976 SC 2140
                        (“<em>Harnam Singh</em>”), the Indian
                    Supreme Court held that the words “intent to defraud” contained
                    two elements – deceit and injury:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    ... The Code does not contain any precise and
                            specific definition of the words “intent to defraud”.
                            However, it has been settled by a catena of authorities that
                            “intent to defraud” contains two elements viz., deceit and
                            injury. A person is said to deceive another when by practising
                            “suggestio falsi”
                            <em>o</em>r “suppressio veri”
                            <em>o</em>r both he intentionally induces another
                            to believe a thing to be true, which he knows to be false or does not
                            believe to be true, “Injury” has been defined in
                            Section 44 of the Code as denoting “any harm whatever
                            illegally caused to any person, in body, mind, reputation or
                            property.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19.    The burden of [the appellant’s
                            counsel’s] argument is that the prosecution had not established
                            these elements beyond reasonable doubt. It is maintained that there was
                            no ‘deceit’ because the appellant did not conceal the fact
                            that he was making the entries meant for the 10th January on the
                            11th January. In this connection, reference has been made to the
                            endorsements and the entries on the Forwarding Notes relating to these
                            goods, which were manifestly made on the 11th. It is further submitted
                            that there was <em>no intent to cause wrongful gain or
                                wrongful loss to any person either in particular or in
                                general</em>, and consequently the second element necessary to
                            constitute a fraudulent intention did not exist.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The cited passage makes it clear that the
                    Prosecution must prove an intention to mislead as well as an intention to injure
                    the interests of “any person either in particular or in general”
                    (see <em>Harnam Singh</em> at [19]). Section 477A PC
                    does not contemplate a stand-alone offence for the wilful creation of a false
                    document. As the learned authors of <em>Ratanlal &amp;
                        Dhirajlal’s The Indian Penal Code</em> (V R Manohar
                    gen ed) (LexisNexis, 33rd Ed, 2010) put it at p 987:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Though to come under the mischief of this section the entries have to
                        be made ‘wilfully’ i.e., intentionally or deliberately, yet from
                        the mere fact that the entries were made wilfully, it does not follow that
                        the entries were so made “with intent to defraud” within the
                        meaning of s. 477A [of the Indian Penal Code].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The learned authors also offer insight into
                    the legislative purpose of the Indian equivalent of s 477A PC at

<b>3. Object.</b>—This section was introduced
                        by Act III of 1895, section 4. It is intended to meet a glaring
                        defect in the law which was proved to exist in <em>Shama
                            Churn Sen’s</em> case, in which a man was charged with
                        defrauding a bank to the extent of three lakhs of rupees. He was acquitted
                        because it could not be shown that the three lakhs ha[d] been abstracted
                        upon any one particular occasion or in any particular sum. The present
                        section is intended to meet such cases and to make the falsification of
                        books punishable even though no particular sum of money or particular
                        occasion can be shown. It is, with some verbal alterations, the same in
                        substance, as section 1 of the Falsification of Accounts Act,
                        1875.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It would therefore appear that the practical
                    emphasis of s 477A PC was placed more on relieving the Prosecution from
                    having to prove a particular sum which had been misappropriated or a particular
                    occasion on which money had been misappropriated, and less on not having to name
                    the particular person intended to be defrauded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It follows from these considerations that
                    where a s 477A PC charge is involved, the Prosecution must present a
                    specific case as to the nature of the accused’s fraudulent intention,
                    including the person who was the object of the fraudulent intention, and cannot
                    hide behind the explanatory note in s 477A PC to avoid taking a position.
                    Equally, it is no answer to say that the petitioners in this case had intended
                    only to gain an advantage for themselves, as this begs the question of whether
                    such gain was obtained by a general deception or at the expense of a particular
                    person or entity. In the present case, it appeared from the s 477A PC
                    charge against each petitioner and the materials before the court that the
                    alleged deception was intended to cause a wrongful gain or a wrongful loss in
                    relation to a specific person or entity. Notably, as mentioned at [36] above,
                    the Prosecution did <em>not</em> take the position that the
                    petitioners had acted with a general intent to defraud. That was not what each
                    s 477A PC charge stated. The Prosecution’s refusal to specify the
                    target of the petitioners’ alleged deception rested upon a conviction that
                    it was, in any event, not <em>legally obliged</em> to do
                        so:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [Section] 477A must be interpreted in light of the Explanation,
                        which clearly states that a general intent to defraud suffices in the
                        formulation of the charge, without naming any particular person intended to
                        be defrauded. This being the case, it follows ineluctably that the Summary
                        of Facts in support of the charge need not indicate any particular person
                        intended to be defrauded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The Indian authorities demonstrate that this
                    conviction is mistaken. The wording of the explanatory statement in s 477A
                    PC indicates that a person could be guilty of a charge under that section even
                    though he does not have a specific individual or entity as the target of his
                    fraud; it would suffice if he has a general intention to defraud. The
                    explanatory statement should not be taken as providing a categorical general
                    exemption from having to specify the particular individual or entity intended to
                    be defrauded. In the present case, the Prosecution still had to specify whether
                    each of the petitioners had acted with a general intention to defraud <em>or</em> a particular intention directed at particular
                    parties. If it was the latter, then those parties (whether persons or entities)
                    had to be identified. However, and more importantly in the instant matter, it
                    was not the Prosecution’s case that each of the petitioners had acted with
                    a general intent to defraud. Indeed, there was no such assertion in each
                    s 477A PC charge of a general intention to defraud on the part of each of
                    the petitioners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In the light of the foregoing analysis, it was
                    clear to me that further particularisation of the party whom the petitioners had
                    allegedly conspired to defraud, as well as of the allegedly
                    “fictitious” sub-contract between Questzone and ZTE, had to be
                    provided. Without such particulars, the Prosecution’s summary of facts
                    could not be viewed as being “in support of” the specific
                    s 477A PC charge faced by each of the petitioners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As an aside, I would underscore the fact that
                    without such particulars, the petitioners’ position would be prejudiced as
                    they would be vulnerable to surprises at the trial. This had already been
                    rehearsed at the hearing before me, when it was unexpectedly revealed that the
                    Papua New Guinea government could have been one of the intended targets of the
                    alleged fraud (see [37] above). Had this transpired at the trial, it would run
                    counter to the object of the CCDC regime. Moreover, such an eventuality could
                    likely cause disruption to the trial, which is an outcome that the CCDC regime
                    was specifically created to prevent from happening. The evidence which an
                    accused person will adduce and/or the witnesses whom he will call will depend on
                    the case which he has to meet. For instance, if the Prosecution’s case was
                    that the victim of the fraud was the Papua New Guinea government, then the
                    evidence which each of the petitioners would adduce (including the witnesses
                    whom each of them would call) could be very different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     I would further add that prejudice to the
                    petitioners could surface even <em>before</em> the trial.
                    In accordance with s 163 of the CPC 2010, the petitioners will each have to
                    file a Case for the Defence after the further CCDC which is fixed not earlier
                    than seven days from the date on which the Case for the Prosecution is filed
                    (see s 161(4) of the CPC 2010). Section 165(1)(<em>a</em>) requires the petitioners to furnish “a summary of the
                    defence to the charge and the facts in support of the defence”. To comply
                    with their discovery obligations, the petitioners will have to <em>speculate</em> about what the Prosecution’s case would
                    be and craft a summary of their defence in line with this. In doing so, they may
                    have little option but to reveal where they expect their criminal liability to
                    lie, and thereby jeopardise their privilege against self-incrimination. The CCDC
                    regime, which is intended to create greater transparency and parity between the
                    Prosecution and the Defence, may therefore end up being applied in a way which
                    works <em>against</em> the petitioners’ interests.
                    Our courts must be vigilant to ensure that rules of criminal procedure intended
                    to introduce fairness into the criminal justice process do not end up being
                    misapplied in the sense of being administered in a way which actually works to
                    an accused’s detriment instead. Such vigilance against the misapplication
                    of criminal procedure is not new to our courts – a similar concern with
                    rules which were intended to benefit accused persons being used in a manner
                    which transformed them into a “procedural trap” was also expressed
                    by Yong Pung How CJ in <em>Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 3 SLR(R) 545 at [48]. In contrast, it was
                    not apparent what prejudice – either at or before the trial – would
                    be borne or suffered by the Prosecution if it had to furnish the additional
                    particulars set out at [10(a)] and [10(b)] above. There was no danger that
                    witnesses would be suborned (see the Minister’s comments at [16] above),
                    and the Prosecution did not allude to any peculiarities or sensitivities which
                    would be adversely affected by the further disclosure which I
                ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">
<em>Details of the alleged
                conspiracy</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The petitioners also sought further details of
                    the alleged conspiracy between them (see item (c) of [10] above). The
                    summary of facts replicated the s 477A PC charge in stating that the
                    conspiracy arose “in mid-2010, in Singapore ... to falsify a paper
                    belonging to [Questzone] wilfully and with intent to
                        defraud”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> On a <em>prima
                        facie</em> level, this fulfilled the key elements of an abetment by
                    conspiracy, as held in <em>Lee Yuen Hong v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2000] 1 SLR(R) 604 at [38]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On a charge of abetment by conspiracy, the Prosecution has to
                        establish the following elements:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    the person abetting must engage, with one or
                                more other persons in a conspiracy;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    the conspiracy must be for the doing of the
                                thing abetted; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    an act or illegal omission must take place in
                                pursuance of the conspiracy in order to the doing of that
                                thing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It is well-established that a conspiracy must
                    also be founded upon a “meeting of the minds” amongst the
                    conspirators. Such an agreement can be inferred from circumstantial evidence, as
                    held in <em>Goh Kah Heng</em> at [40]. The
                    Prosecution’s contention was that the circumstances which would add flesh
                    to the bones of the alleged conspiracy in this case were contained in the
                    petitioners’ statements as disclosed in the Case for the Prosecution. This
                    was part of a wider proposition that the summary of facts should be read in
                    conjunction with all the other items in the Case for the Prosecution. In other
                    words, the adequacy of the Prosecution’s disclosure had to be assessed
                    holistically. I saw some sense in this. On a purposive interpretation of
                    s 162 of the CPC 2010, a balance must be struck between guarding against
                    unwanted surprises at the trial and prematurely compelling parties to commit
                    themselves to matters of detail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the present case, the Case for the
                    Prosecution contained statements which made numerous allusions to meetings
                    between the petitioners in Singapore in mid-2010. In particular, the 1st
                    petitioner’s statement contained an account of a weekend discussion with
                    the 3rd petitioner in April 2010 as well as a country club meeting with both the
                    2nd and 3rd petitioners in May 2010.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The subject discussed during these
                    meetings was the payment of monies to the petitioners as commission for the
                    award of the community college project in Papua New Guinea to ZTE. Following
                    that, there were other occasions on which the petitioners talked about obtaining
                    money from the ITE trust and how such money should be distributed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Given the disclosure of these circumstances in
                    the Case for the Prosecution, the petitioners could not claim that they would be
                    taken by surprise at the trial. The information which they had at their disposal
                    was more than sufficient to aid in the preparation of their defence in relation
                    to the various elements of an abetment by conspiracy. Unlike the particulars
                    sought in relation to the other two points set out at [10] above, the further
                    information being asked for in terms of the details of the alleged conspiracy
                    between the petitioners clearly relates to matters of detail which are not
                    likely to have a substantive impact on the evidence which the petitioners would
                    have to adduce and/or the witnesses to be called. In this regard, a distinction
                    must be drawn between particulars which serve to clarify and give notice to the
                    accused of the essential ingredients of the offence stated in the charge, and
                    particulars which are not of such a nature. Although it must be acknowledged
                    that this may prove to be a challenging distinction to draw at times, it is only
                    the former category of particulars which should be included in a summary of
                    facts in accordance with s 162 of the CPC 2010. In a broad sense, the
                    particulars set out in each summary of facts in the present case met the
                    requirements prescribed in Illustration (<em>b</em>)
                    to s 162. Each summary of facts set out the time at which and the place
                    where the conspiracy took place as well as the illegal act which was committed
                    pursuant to that conspiracy, <em>viz</em>, the creation of
                    the allegedly falsified invoice dated 15 July 2010. That said, I also note
                    that the Prosecution did not disclose any particulars beyond the bare minimum
                    required by Illustration (<em>b</em>) to s 162.
                    While I had some reservations about the Prosecution’s lack of earnestness
                    in this regard, I did not think that this would cause undue prejudice to the
                    petitioners on a holistic assessment of what had been disclosed in the Case for
                    the Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In the premises, I granted the
                    petitioners’ applications for particulars on the first two points set out
                    at [10] above relating to, respectively, the identity of the party whom the
                    petitioners allegedly conspired to defraud and the reasons why the sub-contract
                    between ZTE and Questzone was alleged to be fictitious. I ordered these
                    particulars to be furnished within two weeks from 23 January 2013 (I should
                    add that I subsequently granted a stay of this order on 6 February 2013
                    pending the Prosecution’s reference to the Court of Appeal on questions of
                    law of public interest arising from the present applications). The request for
                    further details of the alleged conspiracy between the petitioners (<em>viz</em>, point (c) of [10] above) was
                refused.</p>
