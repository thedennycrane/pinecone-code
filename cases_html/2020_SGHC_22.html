Its managing director – and its chief witness in this trial – was one Soh Boon Wah (“Soh”).  The 1st defendant is another Singapore company set up to carry out business in (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) the solar energy industry, whose registered business activities include the manufacture of solar modules and the generation of electricity <span class="font-italic">via</span> solar power.  During the time periods relevant to the present dispute, the 1st defendant’s largest shareholders were a Singapore company named Schweizer Pte Ltd and a German company named Gebrueder Schmid GmbH (“Schmid”).  Schweizer Pte Ltd’s parent company is Schweizer Electronic AG, which is listed on the German stock exchange.  The 2nd defendant (Maren Schweizer, formerly Marc Schweizer) and the 3rd defendant Pang Yoke Lee (also known as “Alfred”) were both managing directors of the 1st defendant at the material time, with the 2nd defendant also holding the position of Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Schweizer Electronic AG.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Between 2013 and 2015, the plaintiff and the 1st defendant were involved in discussions about setting up a solar cell production line at a factory in the city of Jiangyin in Jiangsu Province in China (“the Jiangyin Factory”).  The extent of each party’s involvement in these efforts was a matter vigorously disputed by both sides in the course of these proceedings.  In gist, the plaintiff claimed in the present suit that the 3rd defendant had made various representations to Soh, in order to induce the plaintiff to enter into an oral agreement (“the Oral Contract”) with the 1st defendant in September 2013.  It was the plaintiff’s case that it had taken a number of actions following the Oral Contract in order to fulfil its obligations under the agreement.  It was also the plaintiff’s case that that it had agreed to vary the Oral Contract on 30 January 2014 by entering into an agreement to subscribe for shares in the 1st defendant; and that it had entered into this Share Subscription Agreement (“the SSA”) on the basis of further representations made to Soh by both the 2nd and 3rd defendants.  The plaintiff alleged that it had made various payments – but that the 1st defendant had subsequently refused to proceed with the arrangements agreed under the Oral Contract.  According to the plaintiff, it also discovered the falsity of the representations made to Soh by the 2nd and 3rd defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 According to the plaintiff’s narrative, therefore, the defendants had basically hoodwinked Soh into committing the plaintiff to the Oral Contract and the SSA, causing him to make numerous payments before Schweizer Electronic AG pulled the plug on the 1st defendant’s participation in the solar energy business and left the plaintiff high and dry.   The plaintiff’s claims in the present suit were based primarily on the defendants’ alleged liability for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation or on s 2 of the Misrepresentation Act.  Alternatively, the plaintiff claimed that the 1st defendant had committed “repudiatory breaches” of the Oral Contract by refusing to perform its obligations under the said contract, which repudiatory breaches the plaintiff said it had accepted.  As another alternative, the plaintiff claimed that the 1st defendant had been unjustly enriched due to “failure of consideration and/or basis” in respect of certain monies received by it under the Share Subscription Agreement.  The plaintiff sought the return of the monies paid to the 1st defendant under the Share Subscription Agreement and of monies paid to Schmid under a contract with the latter for the purchase of equipment.  It also sought damages related to the acquisition and maintenance of the Jiangyin Factory.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendants denied having made the representations pleaded by the plaintiff.  They also denied any oral contract having been entered into between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant in September 2013.  According to the defendants, Soh was the one who had expressed interest in investing in the solar energy business after finding out about the 1st defendant’s efforts to develop a solar cell production plant.  Prior to Soh coming on the scene, the 1st defendant had been working on developing a solar cell production line in Nantong, another city in Jiangsu Province.  To this end, the 1st defendant had entered into a contract with its wholly-owned subsidiary in Nantong – a company called Schweizer Energy Nantong Co Ltd (“PNT”) – in Nov 2012, to supply the latter with a production line for the production of solar cells.  The 1st defendant had also entered into a separate contract with Schmid to purchase the equipment needed for PNT’s production line.  Soh sought to convince the 1st defendant to start its solar cell production line in Jiangyin (where Soh was based), by offering to rent the 1st defendant a factory he claimed to own in Jiangyin and to provide US$18 million in financing for the purchase of equipment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Although the defendants did engage in discussions with Soh on potential partnership models, they did not ultimately enter into any contract for the rental of the Jiangyin Factory or for equipment purchase financing.  The only binding contract which resulted from these discussions was the SSA.  Soh was the one who decided of his own accord that the plaintiff should contract to subscribe for 40% of the shares in the 1st defendant at a total contract price of US$9 million in several tranches.  However, the plaintiff was constantly late in making the share subscription payments and ended up paying only a total of US$2 million.  There was subsequently a capital reduction of US$1.25 million of the plaintiff’s shares.  Soh was also the one who decided to enter into a contract with Schmid for the purchase of equipment for the development of a solar cell production line at the Jiangyin Factory.  Soh used a company named Darcet Jiangyin as the nominee in the Schmid contract even though Darcet Jiangyin had not been incorporated at the time he purported to sign the contract on its behalf.  In March 2014, the plaintiff paid US$1.5 million to Schmid under this contract, but no equipment was ever delivered because the payment fell far short of the 40% of the purchase price which was required before the contract would come into effect.  It was also around this time that the plaintiff experienced financial difficulties and borrowed a total of US$1.2 million from the 1st defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 According to the defendants’ narrative, therefore, Soh was the one who had been actively interested in getting his companies into the solar energy business and who had made big promises which the plaintiff was financially unable to fulfil.  The present suit was really his attempt to foist the blame for his own poor business decisions on the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 At the conclusion of the trial, I dismissed the plaintiff’s action as I found that it had failed to make out its claims on the basis of the evidence adduced.  As the plaintiff has appealed against my decision, I have set out below my reasons.   I will start by summarising the evidence led by each side.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the evidence led by the plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 As mentioned earlier, Soh was the main witness for the plaintiff.  Soh testified that he first met the 3rd defendant sometime in August 2013 for the purpose of marketing a de-ionised water treatment plant to the 1st defendant.  Soh claimed that at this first meeting, the 3rd defendant told him about the set-up and the business of the 1st defendant, including the fact that the 1st defendant had a wholly-owned subsidiary in Nantong – PNT – which was slated to take on the operation of the 1st defendant’s intended solar cell production line in Nantong.  According to Soh, the 3rd defendant also revealed that in light of the advanced technology which Schmid (one of the shareholders of the 1st defendant) had developed for the production of high-efficiency solar cells, the local Nantong government – or more precisely, the Nantong Economic and Technological Development Area Administrative Committee (“NETDA-AC”) – had given PNT incentives valued at US$13 million, in the form of a land lease and cash grants

</div>.  The 3rd defendant further informed Soh that PNT had requested to return the first piece of land which it had received via the land lease.  The 3rd defendant explained that this was because firstly, this piece of land was not in the Nantong free-trade zone; and secondly, also because changes in the Chinese Government’s policy on the solar cell industry had led to China Construction Bank (“CCB”) withdrawing the promised financing for PNT’s working capital, thereby leading to a lack of funds for the construction of a factory on the first piece of land.  Soh was told that pending the allocation by NETDA-AC of a second piece of land, the 1st defendant planned to rent a shell factory “temporarily” so as to commence solar cell production and testing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 According to Soh, the 3rd defendant also told him at their first meeting that “the return on investment (“ROI”) for the solar cell production line is very high at 20.3% and it would only take 1.5 years for the production line to be profitable”

At his second meeting with the 3rd defendant in August 2013, Soh suggested that his company could acquire a factory in Jiangyin which he thought would be suitable for solar cell production and “sub-lease parts” of this factory to the 1st defendant for it to “set up a solar cell production line”.  The property Soh had in mind was actually owned by a company known as Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology Company (“JCET”), which was his customer: JCET had offered it to him two or three years ago but he had thought it too big for his own business at that time

</div>.  Soh claimed that he signed the Schmid Contract because the 3rd defendant told him he needed to do so to demonstrate the plaintiff’s commitment to perform the obligations under the Oral Contract.  He also did not think he was taking any big risk in signing the Schmid Contract because the 3rd defendant told him that the contract would not come into effect until the downpayment amounting to 40% of the contract price had been paid (per clause 29.10), and also because he himself was aware that Darcet Jiangyin – despite being named as a contracting party – had not even been set up as at 18 December 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 30 January 2014, Soh had a meeting with the 2nd and the 3rd defendants during which the 2nd defendant allegedly expressed concern that the 1st defendant’s position was “not secure” under the Oral Contract.  Because the Oral Contract left the plaintiff in physical possession of the Jiangyin Factory and the equipment to be purchased from Schmid, the 2nd defendant suggested that they should vary the Oral Contract by having the plaintiff enter into a Share Subscription Agreement (“SSA”).  The plaintiff would subscribe for 40% of shares in the 1st defendant at the price of US$9 million, such that half of the promised US$18 million in equipment financing would be “routed through [the 1st defendant] in the form of share subscription monies” before being “returned to [the plaintiff] in the form of loans from [the 1st defendant]”.  The plaintiff would then use the loans to purchase the Schmid equipment.  According to Soh, the 2nd and 3rd defendants also suggested that the plaintiff pay interest on these loans at the 12 month SIBOR rate, while the 1st defendant would pay the plaintiff interest on the US$9 million share subscriptions at the 12 month SIBOR rate.  According to Soh, in other words, insofar as US$9 million of his US$18 million equipment financing was concerned, “the interest to be paid by [the 1st defendant] to [the plaintiff] would be offset by the interest payable by [the plaintiff] to [the 1st defendant]” for the loans.  As for the remaining US$9 million, the 1st defendant would continue to pay compound interest of 9% per annum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Soh said that he decided to sign the SSA because he regarded the proposed variations as being “advantageous” to the plaintiff in providing it with “some form of security through its shareholdings in [the 1st defendant]”

From March 2014 up to November 2014, Soh had numerous discussions with the 3rd defendant and Erik Greger (“Greger”), the then Sales and Marketing Director of the 1st defendant) about the projected profitability of a 35 MW production line versus that of production lines with larger capacities

At some point in September 2014, “it was acknowledged that a 35MW production line would not be financially viable or attractive enough as the profit level of 5% was too low and it would take 3 years to produce any returns”

While Schmid was ready to guarantee an efficiency rate of more than 20% for its equipment and also to commit to building a 100 MW line, it was not possible for Schmid to act as guarantor for the plaintiff’s bank loan.

In this connection, Soh asked the 2nd defendant for her “commitment in writing … to confirm the support from Schweizer to Darcet to make this project a success”.  As to the second concern, he stated that in light of the 1st defendant’s inability “to withhold the incentive agreement and also the land”, and the risks involved to the plaintiff, he proposed to “reduce the [plaintiff’s] share allotment in [the 1st defendant] to keep it below USD 4 Millions”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The 2nd defendant’s response on 16 February 2015

The 2nd defendant had allegedly also promised Soh that the plaintiff would not have to pay the interest incurred on the loans from the 1st defendant and that its obligations to make the remaining share subscription payments under the SSA were “terminated”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 On the same day (17 April 2015), Soh sent the 2nd defendant an email in which he claimed that the plaintiff had considered itself “as the role of financer” from the outset, and that it had been “doing the equipment purchasing contract, paying of deposits etc… on behalves of [the 1st defendant] and Schweizer”

</div>.  He went on to say that given “the current state of [the 1st defendant] losing the USD 13 million incentive from Chinese government and given that Schweizer is understandably showing no keen interest in keeping [the 1st defendant] going”, parties would “have to re-look at the current arrangement”.  He therefore proposed three options to the 2nd defendant while adding that a “formal written document” would be needed to record the option chosen.  The three options he presented to the 2nd defendant were as follows.  “Option 1” was to “stick to original plan” whereby the plaintiff would be “a financer for equipment purchase and factor rental”.  Under this option, the 1st defendant was to provide a total of US$5 million in working capital.  “Option 2” was for the plaintiff to “take over the role as investor”, with the 1st defendant providing support in the form of US$5 million in working capital.  “Option 3” was for the 1st defendant to “go ahead” with the project without the plaintiff’s participation; and for the 1st defendant and Schmid to return the plaintiff the aggregate amounts it had paid so far (the US$1.5 million paid to Schmid in March 2014 and the balance US$750,000 of the plaintiff’s shares in the 1st defendant following the capital reduction in April 2015).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 The 2nd defendant did not respond to Soh’s suggested “three options”.

He then put forward another two options.  Option (a) – which he described as the plaintiff’s “preferred option” – was for the 1st defendant to “continue” as “the original investor” in the production line while the plaintiff played the role of “vendor and financier”.  Option (b) was “to invest as a team” – which appeared to harken back to his earlier request that the 1st defendant commit to providing US$5 million.

Soh’s sense of grievance grew when he later discovered a series of agreements entered into between Schweizer Pte Ltd and Schmid in the period from 2015 to 2017 which – according to him – suggested that following Schweizer Pte Ltd’s and Schweizer Electronic AG’s decision to exit the exergy business, the 1st defendant had extricated itself from the production line contract with Schmid and managed to get back monies previously paid to Schmid under this contract.  At the same time that it was doing this, the 1st defendant had also allowed Schmid to withdraw as a shareholder through the capital reduction exercise

Soh claimed that he had found this out only in December 2018; and had he known that the Nantong incentives were “contingent” on these two conditions being fulfilled, he would “have certainly considered any collaboration with [the 1st defendant] more carefully” and would have “asked more questions” about its “ability to make such investments”

It was the 3rd defendant who led the discussions with the NETDA-AC that led to the Investment Agreement being signed on 20 October 2011 between the NETDA-AC and Schweizer Energy Pte Ltd (“SEPL”, a related company of the 1st defendant’s).  This Investment Agreement – and two other Supplementary Agreements – were novated from SEPL to the 1st defendant on 9 May 2012.  PNT was incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 1st defendant’s, to focus on the production of solar cells in Jiangyin while the 1st defendant was to focus on the marketing and trading of the solar cells

</div>.  The upshot was that although the EB decided against pulling out of China, a number of cost-saving measures were implemented.  Instead of the 100 MW solar cell line originally envisaged, they decided to develop a 35 MW line which could later be upgraded to a 100 MW line if and when government policy shifted again.  In addition, instead of proceeding with the construction of the factory, the 1st defendant rented an empty factory (“the shell factory”) with the intention of using it as the premises for developing the 35 MW line

However, the 3rd defendant’s evidence was that this first meeting was a casual one during which he had simply told Soh that Schmid had “advanced technology” for manufacturing solar cells, that Schmid was a “partner” of Schweizer’s, and that they intended to “establish a manufacturing plant” in Nantong

</div>.  It was Soh who – upon learning of the 1st defendant’s plans – became interested in being involved.  Soh suggested that instead of using the shell factory which needed to be equipped with the necessary facilities for solar cell production, “it would make more commercial sense for PNT to set up the production line” in his (Soh’s) factory in Jiangyin, Wuxi, because the Jiangyin factory already had the necessary facilities

Soh said he believed that the NETDA-AC would be open to such a proposal.  To make his proposal of the shift to his Jiangyin factory more attractive, he also suggested to the 3rd defendant that he could provide the 1st defendant with financial assistance of US$18 million.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Schweizer EB – when informed of Soh’s proposals – was sceptical about his financial ability, especially given his lack of experience in the solar cell industry.

</div>; and the only contract which the parties signed was the SSA of 30 January 2014, pursuant to which Soh agreed to inject an investment sum of US$9 million into the 1st defendant by taking up 40% of its shares.  As to Soh’s suggestion of a shift to the Jiangyin Factory, the EB and the defendants decided to “try out” this suggestion only in the sense of being willing at that stage to “investigate” the option – but no final decision was made by the EB for the 1st defendant to rent the Jiangyin Factory.  As for Soh’s suggestion that he could provide financing, the defendants understood from Soh that he would not transfer funds directly to the 1st defendant.  Instead, he or a company controlled by him intended to purchase directly from Schmid the equipment needed for solar cell production

Insofar as the injection of investment capital into the 1st defendant was concerned, the plaintiff was to have paid in a total of US$9 million over four tranches by end-July 2014 – but he was unable to meet the timelines for each of the payments, and by May 2014, he had paid only a total of US$2 million.  The plaintiff was also dilatory in making payment for the equipment from Schmid: as at mid-March 2014, it had paid US$1.5 million which was nowhere near the 40% downpayment needed to trigger the contract coming into effect. In the meantime, the defendants had made two loans totalling US$1.25 million to the plaintiff.  In Greger’s words, “the plaintiff’s failure to deliver on its promises had delayed the development of the 35 MW solar cell line and the further intended lines”.  By July 2014, the intended solar cell production line at the Jiangyin Factory had yet to be launched.  In the meantime, as the solar cell industry began to recover from the downturn that had started in 2011, bigger players emerged from the consolidation that had taken place during the downturn, ready to invest in large-scale projects.  This meant that the 35 MW line was “losing its competitiveness”

In cross-examination, the 2nd defendant testified that she did not respond to Soh’s various proposals because over the months of communications, she had formed the impression that Soh was regularly changing his proposals and “potentially he cannot fulfil the financial obligations he entered into [in] the share subscription agreement”

The first was misrepresentation.

In respect of the claim in misrepresentation, I had to determine whether the Representations were in fact made by the 3rd defendant in August 2013 and by the 2nd and 3rd defendants on 30 January 2014; if they were, whether they were false; and if they were false, whether the 2nd and 3rd defendants made them knowing knowingly or recklessly – or at least negligently.  The existence of the Oral Contract being disputed, I had to determine whether there was such a contract; and if so, whether the plaintiff was induced by the false Representations to enter into this contract.

Assuming I found there was such an Oral Contract, I had to determine whether it was varied so as to provide for half of the US$18 million to be routed to the 1st defendant as share subscription payments under the SSA before being channelled back to the plaintiff in the form of loans for the equipment purchase.  Assuming I found there was such a contractual variation, I then had to determine whether - out of the US$2 million paid by the plaintiff pursuant to the SSA - there was a total failure of consideration or basis in respect of the balance sum of US$750,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Given the nature of the plaintiff’s claims, I thought it apt to start with the issue of whether there was in fact an Oral Contract concluded on 5 September 2013.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">On the issue of whether an oral contract was concluded in September 2013</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Having examined the evidence adduced, I found that there was no Oral Contract as alleged by the plaintiff.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Soh was the only witness from the plaintiff who gave evidence of this purported contract.

I did not find it believable that the defendants would have moved so swiftly to conclude an agreement with Soh – and a purely oral one at that, especially given the set-up of the Schweizer group’s decision-making process in such matters.  According to the 2nd defendant (whose evidence on this point was not challenged), the decision to venture into the production of solar cells in Nantong took more than half a year from conceptualisation to implementation, with approval having to be obtained from the Schweizer Executive Board and Supervisory Board

I did not find it believable that a decision to shift their focus away from Nantong to Jiangyin – and to enter into a business venture with a party lacking any track record in the solar energy industry – would have been undertaken by the defendants in a matter of days or even weeks.

No explanation was provided by Soh as to what “operating the Jiangyin Factory” involved if it did not involve producing the solar cells and sending the finished products to customers.  Indeed, as will be seen, this subsequently became a contentious issue between the parties when their working relationship broke down, with the 1st defendant contending on the one hand that it was never intended to be the one operating the solar cell production line and Soh insisting on the other hand that it was.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 This is not to say that a concluded contract can never contain ambiguous terms.  In the present case, however, the vagueness of Soh’s description of key terms was another factor which – added to the mix – appeared to militate against the existence of the alleged Oral Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Thirdly, it should be noted that even the identity of the parties to the Oral Contract was a matter of some mystery.  In the statement of claim, the plaintiff had pleaded that it was the plaintiff itself – Darcet Pte Ltd, the Singapore-registered company – which had entered into the Oral Contract with the 1st defendant in September 2013

In short, on Soh’s own evidence, the plaintiff simply could not have been a party to any agreement with the 1st defendant as at September 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Fourth, not only was Soh’s evidence about the Oral Contract rife with inconsistencies and ambiguities, his assertion that such an agreement had been concluded in September 2013 ran contrary to the evidence of his own behaviour and that of other parties post September 2013.  Most pertinently, in virtually all email communications with the defendants and other Schweizer representatives post September 2013, Soh made no reference to the existence of the Oral Contract.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It will be recalled, for example, that in Soh’s version of events, the SSA varied the Buy and Leaseback Arrangement agreed in the Oral Contract: instead of the plaintiff providing US$18 million for the purchase of equipment from Schmid and then leasing this equipment to the 1st defendant at 9% yearly compound interest over 5 years, half of the US$18 million would be routed through the 1st defendant as share subscription payments before being funnelled to the plaintiff in the form of loans for equipment purchase.  On Soh’s telling, the SSA was simply a device designed to “give comfort to [the 1st defendant] on [the plaintiff’s] commitment towards the Jiangyin Project”

</div>: the routing of the monies in the form of share subscription payments to the 1st defendant did not change the fact that these were monies provided by the plaintiff <span class="font-italic">to finance the purchase of equipment from Schmid</span>, pursuant to the parties’ Oral Contract.  It was in this context that Soh claimed both the 2nd and 3rd defendants had assured him that payments under the SSA need not be strictly in accordance with the payment schedule and could be postponed pending the setting up of Darcet Jiangyin

Indeed, while he did state in this email that the “share agreement, especially the timing of subscription phases need to go in tandem with the progress of forming and registration of [Darcet Jiangyin]”, he expressly acknowledged that this was <span class="font-italic">a point which had not been brought up at the time the SSA was signed on 30 January 2014</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Given Soh’s evidence about the manner in which the SSA had varied the Oral Contract and the reason for such variation, any reticence on his part in bringing the Oral Contract up to the defendants made no sense.  In fact, as the business relationship between the parties started falling apart by end-2014, there was more reason than ever for him expressly to remind the defendants about the Oral Contract.  After all, according to him, by December 2014 he had discovered the falsity of their representations about the Nantong incentives – and it was his case that these representations were part of the set of Representations that had induced him to enter into the Oral Contract and to take various actions pursuant to that contract, including the acquisition of the Jiangyin Factory and the signing of the Schmid Contract.  Yet, oddly, when he emailed the 3rd defendant on 12 February 2015 to demand that Schweizer “make up the difference” to him of “the loss of USD 13 Million”

</div>, when Soh requested the latter to come up with an “alternative plan” to “resolve” matters between the parties, he described the arrangements between them in terms of “the share allotment agreement” (the SSA) and “our loan arrangement” (the loans from the 1st defendant to the plaintiff).  Again, no mention at all was made of the Oral Contract; and again, I found this omission telling.  One of the key concerns raised in this email was the 1st defendant’s inability to retain its Nantong incentive package.  As noted above, Soh claimed to have been induced in part by representations about the Nantong incentives to enter into the Oral Contract; and several of the reliefs he claimed in this suit related to costs allegedly incurred as a result of his carrying out the Oral Contract (for example, the costs of acquiring the Jiangyin Factory)

</div>.  In the circumstances, it would have been not just logical but actually critical for Soh to bring up the Oral Contract in his email of 13 February 2015.  He did not.  To my mind, this was anomalous behaviour which tended to militate against there having been an Oral Contract to begin with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The behaviour post September 2013 of other parties besides Soh was also inconsistent with the existence of an Oral Contract containing the terms pleaded by the plaintiff.  As recounted by Soh, for example, the terms of the Oral Contract as regards the party responsible for bearing the costs of producing the goods at the Jiangyin Factory were quite clear.  According to Soh, the Oral Contract provided for two bank accounts to be set up, one of which was to be controlled by the 1st defendant (“the PSG Bank Account”); for the 1st defendant to “advance working capital into the PSG Bank Account for the cost of production in the Jiangyin Factory; and for Darcet Jiangyin to invoice the 1st defendant for (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) the costs of production after producing and sending the finished goods to the 1st defendant’s customers

Thus for instance, in an email dated 26 May 2014 sent to Soh as well as the 3rd defendant, the 1st defendant’s financial controller Erich Wang stated that “the various operating costs after commencing business should be part of the costs of this project, and paid for using the Jiangyin company’s registered capital”

The possibility of setting up a solar cell production line within the same factory space clearly fitted in with his own plans, especially since (as he pointed out in his presentation slides) a clean room already existed on the premises

</div>.  In other words, this was not a case where he took steps to acquire the Jiangyin Factory only because of – and subsequent to – the alleged Oral Contract being concluded on 5 September 2013.  Indeed, considering that the formal JVA contractual documents with JCET and Jiangsu Glory were already finalised and signed by 18 October 2013, it seemed to me highly improbable that Soh would only have taken steps to procure the JVA after 5 September 2013.  Tellingly, in cross-examination, Soh admitted that he had initially approached JCET (which was his customer) “2 or 3 years” before he even met the 3rd defendant

In cross-examination, it was pointed out that clause 6 of the JVA with JCET and Jiangsu Glory obliged the plaintiff to purchase JCET’s shares if their joint venture was unable to generate profit in one year.  When asked how he expected to generate profit within one year from the amounts he had supposedly contracted to charge the 1st defendant for rental and equipment purchase financing, Soh’s answer disclosed that his real interest in entering into the JVA did not actually lie in the rights and obligations he had taken on in the alleged Oral Contract: in his own words

</div> –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Why must I make profit within the first year?... The purpose of this JV contract – JV arrangement – is… for the purpose of Darcet to acquire the factory and land without having to pay for huge tax of say, 30%... JCET, my partner, is a listed company in China.  They have to go through the proper procedure.  So with this [JVA] contract, that means… after 1 year, I will have the right to just take over, paying for the share price and take over their share and I have the factory – land and factory for myself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Based on Soh’s admission, in short, there was no expectation on his part - or for that matter, JCET’s - that their joint venture company should be able to turn a profit within the one-year period stated in clause 6 of the JVA: on the contrary, the real intention behind the JVA was to create a situation whereby Soh would be able to acquire the Jiangyin Factory and land without having to pay substantial taxes, by buying over JCET’s shares in the joint venture company once it failed to show a profit within a year.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 To reiterate, therefore, it was untrue to say that the plaintiff would not have acquired the Jiangyin Factory if not for the alleged Oral Contract.  On the evidence available, it appeared to me that Soh must already have formulated plans for acquiring the factory even before his meetings with the 3rd defendant: the idea of establishing a solar cell production line at the factory simply fitted in with those plans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 As for the Schmid Contract, I was similarly not persuaded that Soh signed this agreement in order to fulfil his obligations under the “Lease and Buy-back Arrangement” in the alleged Oral Contract.  It should be remembered that the joint venture under the JVA with JCET and Jiangsu Glory was created not only to manufacture and sell automation equipment and accessories (which was originally the business of Soh’s Darcet Group), but also to manufacture and sell “solar renewable new energy products”

As noted above, it would appear that Soh had plans to acquire the Jiangyin Factory even before his first meeting with the 3rd defendant in August 2013; that what he heard from the 3rd defendant about the Schweizer group’s solar energy project sparked his interest in the solar energy business; and that starting up a solar cell production line on the Jiangyin Factory premises fitted in with his plans at that stage for acquisition of the factory and the land.  On the evidence available, it appeared that Soh did make some proposals in September 2013 to lease factory space to the 1st defendant and to provide financing for the purchase of equipment for a solar cell production line.  However, there was no evidence that these proposals resulted in parties coming to terms and in the 1st defendant signing on to a lease for the Jiangyin Factory and/or to a Buy and Leaseback agreement for the purchase of equipment.  At the same time, it would also appear that while the defendants (and the Schweizer EB generally) were sceptical about Soh’s ability to come up with the full US$18m financing offered, they continued to engage him in various discussions about collaboration.  This was probably because they saw an opportunity to tap on his interest in the solar cell business and thereby to persuade him to invest in the 1st defendant.  Both the 2nd and 3rd defendants were quite frank about the fact that their interest in the earlier stages of interaction with Soh was in inviting him to take up shares in the 1st defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Following from the above, I rejected the plaintiff’s contention that the SSA was a variation of the alleged Oral Contract of 5 September 2013 and/or that the SSA was intended to route part of the US$18 million financing through the 1st defendant.  The plaintiff argued that the 3rd defendant’s “cash flow overview” of 18 February 2014

</div> proved its case about the true nature and purpose of the SSA.  I did not find that the document provided any such proof.  For example, the “cash flow overview” apparently called for a second payment to Schmid of US$5.45 million in March 2014.  According to the same “cash flow overview”, however, by end-February 2014 only US$2 million would have been paid by the plaintiff to the 1st defendant under the SSA.  At the same time, by end-February 2014, the 1st defendant was supposed to have lent the plaintiff US$1.58 million for its first downpayment to Schmid of US$1.58 million.  The “cash flow overview” then appeared to call for the plaintiff to take on a “bridging loan” of US$5.45 million in March 2014, in order to make the second downpayment to Schmid of US$5.45 million.  This was inconsistent with the plaintiff’s contention that US$9 million of the financing for the Schmid equipment would be routed through the 1st defendant in the form of “share subscription payments” before being funnelled back to the plaintiff as “loans” for the equipment purchase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 I was satisfied, in short, that the SSA was what it said it was – an agreement for the subscription by the plaintiff to shares in the 1st defendant.  After Soh agreed to become a shareholder in the 1st defendant, the parties continued to engage in discussions about how they could collaborate in the setting-up of a solar cell production line on the Jiangyin Factory premises.  As the 3rd defendant put it, once Soh became a shareholder of the 1st defendant, the defendants had reason to support his efforts to set up such a production line in Jiangyin – especially if it also gave them the opportunity to pilot the use of Schmid’s technology.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In this connection, I found Greger’s evidence instructive.  He struck me as being the most composed and reliable witness of the lot.  His testimony showed that for the better part of a year following the signing of the SSA, the parties discussed various potential models for partnership (“many, many models discussed and proposed back and forth”

</div>).  In a set of presentation slides prepared for a meeting on 11 September 2014 between Soh and representatives from the 1st defendant and Schmid, a slide entitled “Assumptions on asset financing” appeared to assume that the bulk of financing for the Jiangyin solar cell project would come from the plaintiff in the form of “paid-in equity” (US$9 million) and  “long-term loan” (another US$9 million)

Soh’s email to the 3rd defendant on 10 December 2014 stated, for example, that JCET was “supposed” to have provided such financial support by acting as guarantor for the plaintiff’s intended bank loan

As late as 26 November 2014, the minutes of a meeting between Darcet and Schweizer representatives recorded that parties were still discussing the “(n)eed to understand roles &amp; responsibilities of PSG [the 1st defendant] and Darcet Jiangyin respectively over the different project phases (e.g. Q1 ’15 – Q2 ’15 – Q3 ’15 -)” and the “need to review cost sharing and profit sharing structure”

Thus, although the plaintiff insisted that parties had agreed from the outset on the 1st defendant being responsible for operating the Jiangyin production line, there was no objective evidence of any such agreement.  On the contrary, as the evidence extracted in the preceding paragraphs showed, there was a “lack of clarity on the roles and responsibilities of PSG [the 1st defendant] and Darcet Jiangyin” even as at 26 November 2014

</div>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(E)ffectively we are still at square one after 1 year which…is fair enough to call a kind of difficulty or problem… I mean, this is ever starting or… what is it, right?  … Schmid also was kind of wondering...since the downpayments have never been made, how to deal with this contract or… this order.  And on top, we were facing a change of the market environment where, after a couple of years of severe downturn, the solar industry recovered and changing…the investing scenario of competition.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 It should be added that Greger’s evidence was that in any event, the 1st defendant never intended to operate the Jiangyin production line.  As far as the 1st defendant was concerned, the Jiangyin project was meant to provide proof of concept of the Schmid technology, for which it would provide marketing support as the “marketing arm” and “cover the complete downstream”.  The “mass production” of the solar cells was then envisaged to take place in Nantong, which was where PNT would run the operations.  I found Greger’s evidence to be persuasive because it accorded with the other evidence available.  In particular, as I alluded to previously, it was not disputed that the 1st defendant’s resources were concentrated in PNT in Nantong; and the financial subsidies from the NETDA-AC would be applicable only within Nantong.  It made no sense for the 1st defendant to agree to expend substantial resources launching and operating a production line in Jiangyin while also trying to set up another production line in Nantong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I would also add that in my view, one key reason for this lack of clarity nearly a year after the signing of the SSA was that after the initial enthusiasm and flurry of activity between September 2013 and January 2014 (during which the plaintiff signed the JVA with JCET and Jiangsu Glory as well as the Schmid Contract and the SSA), the plaintiff ran out of financial steam.  Whereas the initial idea had been to set up a 35 MW production line in Jiangyin, this was subsequently shown to be lacking in competitiveness, especially in light of the changing market conditions highlighted by Greger; and discussions then shifted to the option of having a 100 MW line.  Unfortunately for the plaintiff, a 100 MW line was obviously more expensive than a 35 MW line; and this clearly caused financial issues for the plaintiff.  It will be recalled, for example, that on 24 November 2014, after receiving Greger’s recommendations on the options for upgrading from a 35 MW line to a 100 MW line, Soh had emailed the 3rd defendant to ask if it was possible to ask Schmid for a payment option with “certain down payment and <span class="font-italic">some defer payment</span>”

</div>.  It will also be recalled that by May 2014, the plaintiff had paid only US$2 million of the share subscriptions, whereas the payment schedule under the SSA had envisaged US$4 million being paid by April 2014.  No further payments were made by the plaintiff after May 2014; and as seen earlier, by end-November 2014, Soh was being warned by Greger of the Schweizer EB’s fears that it would “be forced by the supervisory board to pull the plug” in light of the “continuous excuses for delay”

</div>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In this connection, I would make two further points.  Firstly, as noted earlier, I had rejected the plaintiff’s contention that there was an agreement at the outset for the 1st defendant to operate the Jiangyin production line.  It followed that I also rejected the plaintiff’s further contention that in August 2014, the 3rd defendant had proposed that the plaintiff take over the operation of the production line while the 1st defendant supported it with working capital of US$5 million.  Indeed, given the defendants’ concerns about the plaintiff’s financial position, it seemed improbable that the 3rd defendant would have made any promises that required his own company to give the plaintiff US$5 million in working capital for the Jiangyin Factory.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The second point is this.  Soh claimed that he was only told by the 2nd defendant on 16 September 2015 that Schweizer Pte Ltd had decided to withdraw from the energy business and would be terminating its production line contract with Schmid.  He claimed this news came as a surprise to him.  Clearly, the impression he sought to give was that the defendants had deliberately strung him along and kept him in the dark about their exit plans.  I did not think this could be true.  As noted above, Greger’s presentation on 28 July 2014 had already mooted the idea of the Schweizer group reducing its stake in the 1st defendant and bringing in a new investor instead.  While this did not materialise, Greger’s email to Soh on 28 November 2014 expressly warned that the Schweizer supervisory board had needed convincing about the progress of the Jiangyin project; that the EB was “very afraid” that the supervisory board had run out of patience” regarding “the Energy business” due to the continuous delays; and that if the “allotment agreement” (the SSA) was not “completed” by 15 December 2014, the EB feared that the supervisory board would “pull the plug”.  Within that same month, a set of slides emailed by Greger to Soh on 13 November 2014 had also indicated that one option being considered by the 1st defendant at that point was to rescind the equipment purchase contract it had entered into with Schmid for the Nantong project and to recover from Schmid the amounts paid under that contract

</div>.  On 24 December 2014, according to Soh, he was privy to a meeting between the 3rd defendant and NETDA-AC representatives at which the latter “turned down” the former’s request to “extend the timelines for the Nantong project”.  Soh was also well aware of the capital reductions in the plaintiff’s and Schmid’s shares in the 1st defendant in April 2015 and August 2015.  Taking all these facts together, I did not believe Soh / the plaintiff would have been taken by surprise on 16 September 2015 by the 2nd defendant’s revelations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">On the issue of the alleged Representations made by the defendants</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 In coming to the above findings of fact on the state of the dealings between the parties in August 2013 and thereafter, I also considered the plaintiff’s allegations about the Representations made by the defendants and the effect of these Representations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 It will be recalled that according to Soh’s version of events, it was the 3rd defendant who had volunteered all sorts of information about Schweizer’s solar energy project at their two meetings in August 2013; who had expressed interest in August 2013 in having the 1st defendant start a production line at the Jiangyin Factory; and who had made the Representations which induced Soh to enter into the Oral Contract on 5 September 2013

He agreed that he had given Soh information about the Nantong incentives and the 1st defendant’s investment into PNT, but asserted that he had done so later than August 2013, possibly around October to November 2013

</div>, when parties were discussing with Soh the possibility of his taking up shares in the 1st defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Having considered the evidence adduced, I did not find Soh’s version of events believable.  Conversely, I believed the 3rd defendant’s evidence as to when he came to provide Soh with information about the incentives and the capital injections into PNT – and why.  My reasons were as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I have set out earlier my finding that there was no Oral Contract concluded in September 2013.  On a more general level, I did not find it believable that the defendants would have been keen in August / September 2013 to contract for the lease of a factory in Jiangyin and / or for the provision of equipment purchase financing by Soh or his company.  At that point in time, they had already established a company in Nantong – PNT – and still had the benefit of agreements with the NETDA-AC which promised certain incentives.  There was no serious imperative for them to shift their focus to Jiangyin, especially since the incentives were indisputably not transferable to another project outside of Nantong.  I also believed the 3rd defendant’s evidence that Soh’s offer of US$18 million financing was met with scepticism by the defendants at that stage because apart from having no track record in the solar energy business, his company was a “relatively small” one, and the defendants were not certain if he did in fact have the US$18 million

</div>.  It seemed to me highly probable that rather than take the larger risk of signing on to a lease for the Jiangyin Factory and / or to the “Buy and Leaseback Arrangement” proposed by Soh, the defendants would have preferred to get Soh to pump money into the 1st defendant by becoming a shareholder.  Given that Soh and the 3rd defendant met only on a casual basis for the first time in August 2013, and that the SSA was signed on 30 January 2014, it also seemed to me more probable than not that the information about the Nantong incentives and the 1st defendant’s investment into PNT would have been disclosed to Soh closer to the date of the SSA rather than during their first casual conversations in August 2013.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 As for what was disclosed to Soh prior to the signing of the SSA, the 3rd defendant’s evidence was that he had told Soh about the total Renminbi amount of the Nantong incentives (about 95 million Renminbi) as well as the separate amount available in phase 1 and phase 2 of the Nantong project

As to the 1st defendant’s capital injections into PNT, he had told Soh that the minimum registered capital required in PNT was US$50 million, and that as at November 2013 the 1st defendant had invested US$8.9 million into PNT.  The 3rd defendant could not be sure if he had converted the Renminbi value of the Nantong incentives into US dollar values, but it was not seriously disputed than the figure of 95 million Renminbi would have approximated a figure of US$13 million at that time.  The 3rd defendant also could not remember if he had converted the US dollar value of the 1st defendant’s capital injection into the Sing dollar equivalent, but it was also not seriously disputed that the figure of US$8.9 million would have approximated a figure of about S$10 million at that time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 It appeared to me, therefore, that the information which the 3rd defendant admitted to giving Soh was not actually that different from the content of the alleged Representations pleaded by the plaintiff

As noted earlier, I found that this information was probably given around October – November 2013 and not in August 2013.  I should add that as I found that there was never any Oral Contract, even assuming the 3rd defendant had given Soh information about incentives and capital injections in August 2013, it would have been moot to ask whether these statements could have induced Soh to enter into an Oral Contract in September 2013.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">On the issues of whether the plaintiff was induced by the Representations to enter into the SSA and whether the Representations were false</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In light of the 3rd defendant’s testimony, I was prepared to accept that the statements he had made to Soh in October or November 2013 about the Nantong incentives and the 1st defendant’s investment into PNT were sufficient to amount to the Representations pleaded by the plaintiff.  However, on the basis of the evidence adduced, I did not find that the plaintiff was able to prove that these statements were false.

</div>.  I understood his testimony to mean that he had told Soh the payment to PNT of the incentives from the NETDA-AC would be done in stages corresponding to the 1st defendant’s injection of investment funds and resources.  He was not actually challenged in any meaningful way on this part of his testimony.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I also did not think it was true to say that that “PNT’s receipt and retention of the incentives worth approximately USD 13 million was in fact <span class="font-italic">contingent on</span> the 1st defendant making capital injections into PNT totalling USD 50 million by the end of 2014”.  The plaintiff argued that this was what the agreements between the 1st defendant and the NETDA-AC actually said – but it could not pinpoint a clause that specifically said so.  Certainly, clause 5(1) of the Investment Agreement did stipulate that the 1st defendant was to fulfil its obligation to contribute “strictly in accordance with the applicable PRC laws and regulations” to the capital of any foreign invested enterprises it set up in the NETDA

It was also true that clause 8 of the Supplementary Investment Agreement did state that the financial support given to the 1st defendant was “based on the fact that [it] plans to set up one or more Enterprise(s) in the NETDA to invest in the Project with the aggregate total investment estimated to be up to USD 245 million”

</div>.  However, clause 8 also expressly provided for the 1st defendant to give the NETDA-AC “3 to 6 months written notice” of any changes to its investment plan; and upon such notice being given, “the Parties shall enter into good faith discussions as to whether such amendments to the Investment Plan shall be accepted unconditionally”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 In other words, even if the 1st defendant did not invest a total of US$50 million in PNT by end-2014, it was not a given that “PNT would be required to return the incentives to the Chinese government”: it was open to the NETDA-AC to accept “unconditionally” any such changes to the Investment Plan.

Soh did not dispute that he was aware the bulk of the US$13 million incentives would only be paid out when the Nantong production line was launched: indeed, in the statement of claim, the plaintiff expressly pleaded that it had been told that apart from the US$3 million which had been used to purchase a piece of land, the remaining US$10 million would be received by PNT “<span class="font-italic">upon the production line being set up</span>”

At the time Soh signed the SSA in January 2014, he would also have been aware that the Nantong production line was not going to be set up anytime soon – since he was the one insisting that the 1st defendant turn its attention to Jiangyin at that point.  In the circumstances, it was not clear why the quantum of the Nantong incentives and the conditions (if any) for their receipt by PNT should have had such a material impact on the plaintiff’s decision to subscribe to shares in the 1st defendant.  Interestingly, Soh’s AEIC did not actually state that the 3rd defendant’s statements about the Nantong incentives were – at least in part - the cause of the plaintiff entering into the SSA

In gist, the plaintiff alleged that the contract for the 1st defendant to supply PNT with a Production Line for the Production of Solar Cells was not a genuine contract; and that the 1st defendant had in effect “round-tripped” the funds it injected into PNT by having the latter purport to make payments under this contract and then purporting to re-invest back into PNT the monies so transferred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 It will be recalled that in respect of the Nantong project, the arrangements for the equipment for the solar cell production line were such that PNT had contracted with the 1st defendant for the latter to supply it the necessary equipment, pursuant to the Contract for the Supply of a Production Line for the Production of Solar Cells; and in turn, the 1st defendant had contracted to purchase such equipment from Schmid.

The 1st defendant’s audited financial statements showed that in 2013, it had made advance payments to Schmid of 2,863,954 Euros in 2013 and of US$3 million in 2014 “for the supply of a production line used in the production of solar cells”

</div>.  I point this out because throughout the trial, the plaintiff’s case was that the defendants had concealed from it the evidence of their “round-tripping” activity by omitting to tell him about PNT’s remittances to the 1st defendant.  If, however, the defendants had indeed been carrying out a “round-tripping” scheme they did not want the plaintiff to know about, it seemed to me highly improbable that they should have concealed from Soh the information about PNT’s remittances to the 1st defendant before they got him to sign the SSA – only to hand him documentary evidence of such remittances a mere fortnight after signing the SSA.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Interestingly, after receiving the draft 2013 financial statements from the 1st defendant, Soh did not raise any concerns about the “advance payments” it had received from its subsidiary which nearly equalled its investment in the subsidiary for the same period.  This lack of concern was inconsistent with his assertion that the actual amount of capital injected by the 1st defendant into PNT formed a material factor in his decision to invest in the 1st defendant.  In other words, his behaviour was inconsistent with his assertion that he had been induced to enter into the SSA by the Capital Injection Representation.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Even more oddly, despite allegedly finding out on 24 December 2014 about the “loss” of the Nantong incentives, Soh did not voice any protestations to the Defendants – not even in early February 2015 when he was being sent brusque reminders by them to pay up under the SSA.  Instead, as noted in my summary of the parties’ evidence, on 2 February 2015 Soh had expressly assured the 3rd Defendant that he would be paying them US$3 million out “before end of next week”

In this connection, I observed that the email from DBS Bank which Soh forwarded to the 3rd Defendant on 2 February 2015 as purported proof of his having sufficient “fund…ready for use” was shorn of any real details: it merely referred to a “<span class="font-italic">transaction</span> of 3 million” being “<span class="font-italic">available as of Friday evening 30</span><span class="font-italic">th Jan</span>” and did not actually demonstrate that Soh or the Plaintiff possessed funds sufficient to meet a US$3 million payment at that point in time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 For the reasons set out above, I held that the plaintiff was unable to prove that the Capital Injection Representation was false, or that it had been induced by the representation to enter into the SSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 I make two other points on the plaintiff’s arguments concerning the Representations.

The plaintiff argued that the aggregate amount of the incentives and capital injections came to US$21,900,000: 40% of this amount would have yielded a figure of about US$8.7 million, which the plaintiff argued was close enough to the US$9 million figure agreed for the total share subscription price.  The 2nd defendant denied that she had valued the 1st defendant’s shares by reference to the aggregate amount of the incentives and capital injections

It seemed to me odd that in assessing how much <span class="font-italic">the 1</span><span class="font-italic">st defendant’s shares</span> were worth, the plaintiff should have been asked to take into account <span class="font-italic">only the specific amounts of its subsidiary’s Nantong incentives and the amount of capital invested in that subsidiary</span>.  In terms of the 1st defendant’s branding, on the other hand, even Soh acknowledged that he was aware of the track record of its parent company (Schweizer Electronic AG) and the superior technology of its other key shareholder (Schmid).  At the same time, although PNT had not been able to launch the Nantong production line following the loss of the CCB loan facilities, the 1st defendant had conducted “a lot of marketing activity” to develop a sales pipeline and marketing concepts

</div>.  In cross-examination, however, a rather different picture emerged.  As I observed earlier, the evidence available – including Soh’s own admissions in cross-examination – indicated that even before his first meeting with the 3rd defendant, Soh had conceived his own reasons for wanting to acquire the Jiangyin Factory; and moreover, that clause 6 of the JVA was apparently crafted so as to allow Soh to acquire the factory premises without paying substantial taxes, through a purchase of JCET’s shares in the joint venture company Darcet Jiangyin once the latter failed to show a profit within a year.  Strangely, despite the fact that the Jiangyin solar cell production line never took off, Soh admitted in cross-examination that Darcet Jiangyin actually managed to turn a profit within the first year

If anything, far from proving that the plaintiff had acquired the factory only in order to satisfy its obligations to the 1st defendant, the evidence suggested that the plaintiff’s real objective in acquiring the factory lay elsewhere, in advancing its own interests; and that it had been disappointed in its efforts to realise the expected benefits from the JVA with JCET.  I would not go so far as to speculate how this subsequent disappointment might have contributed to its decision to recoup some losses by suing the 1st defendant, but what I must stress is that the plaintiff struck me as being less than transparent about its dealings in Jiangyin, and Soh in particular struck me as being less than honest as a witness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">On the plaintiff’s belated attempt to adduce new evidence at trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Before concluding, I should mention that the plaintiff brought an application

</div> before me on the first day of trial seeking to introduce evidence of audio recordings Soh claimed to have made of conversations between him, the 2nd defendant, the 3rd defendant and “some other parties” between July 2014 and July 2015 (as well as transcripts of these alleged recordings).  These alleged recordings were not previously disclosed during the discovery process; and Soh’s affidavit in support of the application did not furnish any explanation as to why they were not disclosed earlier.  Given that the plaintiff alleged these were “contemporaneous” recordings of highly relevant discussions, I found it astonishing that no previous indication should have been given of their existence.  After all, by the time the Defence was filed in April 2017, the plaintiff would have been aware that the defendants were denying the existing of any Oral Contract and saying that the plaintiff was to blame for the Jiangyin project not going ahead.  In other words, the plaintiff knew well ahead of the trial the factual issues in contention; and if these alleged recordings had indeed been as relevant as the plaintiff argued, there was no reason for their having been kept out of discovery.  Allowing the plaintiff’s application would have gravely prejudiced the defendants, who would not have had time to examine the authenticity of the alleged recordings and the accuracy of the transcripts.  I also did not think it was feasible to vacate the trial, especially given the existence of foreign witnesses and the length of time which parties had already been given to prepare for trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 For these reasons, I dismissed the plaintiff’s application to admit the alleged recordings and the transcripts.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 As I indicated in the brief oral remarks I made in giving my decision, the 2nd and 3rd defendants were not the most impressive of witnesses.  However, on the whole, the most critical aspects of the defendants’ version of events was borne out by other, objective evidence.  Moreover, Soh himself struck me as a distinctly unreliable and untruthful witness; and key aspects of his testimony were either contradicted or not supported by other evidence.  At the end of the day, the plaintiff bore the burden of proving its claims; and on the evidence before me, I found that it was unable to do so.  I therefore dismissed the plaintiff’s action in S 253/2017 and ordered that they pay the defendants the costs of the proceedings (to be taxed if not agreed within 14 working days).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Mavis Chionh  <br/>Judicial Commissioner  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">See Tow Soo Ling and Hu Huimin (CNPLaw LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Lim Ming Yi, Yeo Shan Hui, and Jaryl Lim Zhi Wei (I.N.C.
