<strong>Judgment:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns="">1. There were two appeals before me from decisions of the assistant registrar below.

The first was an appeal by the defendant against the dismissal of his application to

strike out the plaintiff’s claim. The second was an appeal by the plaintiff against

the assistant registrar’s order granting unconditional leave to the defendant to

defend.The facts and issues were enmeshed and, consequently, the appeals were dealt with

conveniently, at the same time.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2. The plaintiff is a Canadian registered company. Germain Gauthier was

a shareholder and director of the plaintiff company. On 25 April 1995 the plaintiff loaned

a sum of C$350,000 to a Singapore company called Wiraco in which Germain Gauthier’s

son, Pierre, was a shareholder and director. The defendant’s wife was also a

shareholder and director of Wiraco. One month prior to the loan the defendant signed a

letter (dated 20 March 1995) addressed to Germain Gauthier stating that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In consideration of your agreement to extend a loan of C$350,000

  to WIRACO, I Hong Pian Tee (hereinafter known as "P.T.Hong") I/C No: 0274819/C

  of 48 Leedon Road, Singapore 1026, hereby irrevocably guarantee the due payment of the

  said sum of C$350,000 upon expiry of 24 months from the date of the loan.</p>
<p align="justify">Though I am surety only for WIRACO yet as between us, I shall be deemed

  to be the principal debtor for the monies extended by you, the payment of which is hereby

  guaranteed and accordingly, I confirm that my obligation shall not be affected or

  diminished in any way by any act or omission by WIRACO."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3. When the Wiraco did not make payment the plaintiff sued the

defendant in the Superior Court of Montreal in Canada to recover the debt. The defendant

challenged the jurisdiction of that court but his challenge was dismissed. There was no

appeal against that order by the defendant. After a three-day trial in which the defendant

appeared and contested the claim, the court found in favour of the plaintiff and granted

judgment in its favour. The defendant appealed, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4. The enforcement of foreign judgment statutes in Singapore are

inapplicable to the present case because the Canadian court was not a scheduled court

under our legislation concerning the enforcement of foreign judgments. The plaintiff was

therefore, obliged to commence a writ action against the defendant based on the Canadian

judgment for the purposes of enforcement. Having done so, it applied for a summary

judgment. Assistant registrar Vivian Wong, allowed the application and gave judgment

against the defendant. The appeal by the defendant went before a judge in chambers on 29

August 2000. There is no record of any argument before the court, but the orders of the

court were, however, extracted by the defendant and reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"1. The judgment of the learned assistant registrar Ms. Vivian

  Wong given on 14 August 2000 be set aside/reversed with no order as to costs.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Leave be granted to the Plaintiffs to amend their Statement of Claim

  and to file a fresh Order 14 application.</p>
<p align="justify">3. The Defendant undertakes not to object to the Plaintiffs’ fresh

  Order 14 application, save on merits.</p>
<p align="justify">4. By consent, there be no order as to costs on the amendments to the

  Statement of Claim."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">There is a minor oddity of no great significance but it ought to be

mentioned nonetheless. The first order of the judge was minuted as "The judgment of

the learned assistant registrar Ms. Vivian Wong given on 14 August 2000 be set aside with

no order as to costs." However, the extracted copy approved by both parties included

the word "reversed" as an alternative, and appearing next to the words "set

aside".</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5. Mr. Sivakumar, counsel for the plaintiff, stated that counsel for

the defendant began his submission by saying that a letter of guarantee dated 20 March

1995 was not pleaded and therefore the claim was inadequate. The judge then made the above

orders after suggesting to Mr. Sivakumar that the plaintiff amends its statement of claim

by setting out the underlying contract and not merely relying on having obtained the

Canadian judgment. The plaintiff subsequently did so, and consequently, filed a fresh

application for summary judgment. The hearing before the judge in chambers on 29 August

2000 is relevant because an issue arose as to whether the plaintiff is precluded from

relying on the Canadian judgment in its appeal before me. Counsel for the defendant, Mr.

Manjit Singh submitted that when a judge had already adjudicated and reversed an order for

summary judgment made by an assistant registrar no appeal is permissible under the Supreme

Court of Judicature Act. I shall revert to this submission shortly.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6. In the meantime, on 29 January 2001, the defendant applied before

assistant registrar Tan Boon Heng to strike out the amended claim on the ground that it

disclosed no cause of action. The defendant’s case was that the letter of guarantee

of 20 March 1995 was issued by the defendant to Germain Gauthier and not the plaintiff.

Mr. Sivakumar then successfully applied to adjourn the striking out hearing and obtained

leave to make further amendments the statement of claim. This time, the plaintiff amended

the claim to include the reference to a loan document dated 25 April 1995 which was not

referred to in this suit, but was the subject matter of the trial in Canada.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7. The application to strike out was reinstated for hearing after the

amendments were made. The striking out and order 14 applications were heard by the

assistant registrar Toh Han Li who dismissed the defendant’s application to strike

out. AR Toh who also dismissed the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment and

granted unconditional leave to the defendant to defend. The appeals before me concern the

abovesaid decisions of the assistant registrar Toh.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8. Mr. Manjit Singh submitted before me that the re-amended statement

of claim still discloses no cause of action because there was no privity of contract

between the plaintiff and the defendant. The loan document of 25 April 1995 was signed by

the plaintiff as the lender, WIRACO as the borrower, and the defendant described only as

"a private individual". For the reasons appearing below I do not consider this

argument as having any significance, but in any event, clause 3 of the agreement provided

as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"3. The Borrower hereby represents and warrants as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(c) if the Borrower is unable to fulfil all or part of its obligations

    towards the Lender, the obligations relating to this loan shall be fully guaranteed and

    assumed by [the defendant] … as evidenced in a deed of obligation signed by [the

    defendant] on March 20, 1995 with respect to the loan to be granted, a copy whereof is

    annexed hereto as Schedule ‘B’."</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">There was no dispute that the defendant was a signatory to the 25 April

1995 loan agreement.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9. I shall put aside for the time being the point that this was an

action on a foreign judgment and that the plaintiff was suing on the judgment itself. In

my view, even if the plaintiff was suing on the original cause of action the pleadings do

disclose a reasonable cause of action. On the material before me, I am of the view that

the pleadings should not be disturbed by the court at this stage. Both parties must be

entitled to test the issue of whether there was any liability by the defendant to the

plaintiff arising from the documents cited in the statement of claim. Therefore, whether

there was privity of contract is a substantive defence and if pleaded, is a matter for

trial. Thus, the defendant’s appeal against the assistant registrar’s dismissal

of the striking out application by the defendant fails and is therefore dismissed. My

decision in respect of this appeal will, however, be of no practical importance in view of

my decision in respect of the plaintiff’s appeal. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10. I now turn to Mr. Sivakumar’s appeal against the assistant

registrar’s order granting unconditional leave to the defendant to defend. If counsel

relied on the case as amended then it must follow, from my decision above (that there are

sufficiently pleaded issues for trial), that the plaintiff’s appeal must also be

dismissed. However, Mr. Sivakumar sought to advance the argument that the plaintiff is

entitled to rely solely on the Canadian judgment. Mr. Manjit challenged its right to do so

because he said that that argument was the only one available to the plaintiff in its

first application for summary judgment. On the strength of that argument, the assistant

registrar Wong granted judgment, but that judgment, Mr. Manjit pointed out, was "set

aside/reversed" by the judge in chambers.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11. Mr. Manjit objected to this appeal before me on the ground that

this issue was closed on 29 August 2000 when the judge "set aside/reversed" the

assistant registrar Wong’s summary judgment. Mr. Sivakumar’s point before me was

that the judge did not hear his submission on the issue and therefore I am free to

consider it afresh. Mr. Manjit conceded that at the hearing before the judge in chambers

Mr. Sivakumar did not present his submission, but he argued that nonetheless, technically,

there is an order reversing an order for summary judgment and, it must follow that

unconditional leave to defend must have been given implicitly even though the orders of

court did not explicitly say so. Counsel’s argument was that as a court of

co-ordinate jurisdiction, I cannot overrule the previous decision, and there being no

right of appeal against an order granting unconditional leave to defend, the

plaintiff’s appeal must necessarily be dismissed. Ordinarily, that must be correct;

but this case is unusual. First, the plaintiff’s counsel did not present his

arguments through no fault of his. Secondly, there was no specific order that there be

unconditional leave to defend. Such leave cannot be implied in this case not only on

account of the foregoing point, but also because the judge specifically granted leave to

the plaintiff to amend its pleadings (I note counsel’s point that he did not make an

application to amend) and file a fresh application for summary judgment to which it was

recorded that the defendant undertakes not to object. These two further orders must be

taken into consideration because, ordinarily, if a summary judgment is set aside, no

further orders would be necessary other than ancillary orders such as the granting of

conditional or unconditional leave to defend. In either case, there would be no necessity

to grant leave to amend the pleadings or to file a fresh summary judgment application. A

plaintiff who desires to amend his pleadings is always entitled to make the necessary

application to do so. In this case, the plaintiff did not think it necessary to make any

amendment and so it seems to me, therefore, unfair if it was to be denied the opportunity

of presenting its argument based on the Canadian judgment just because it was directed to

amend some other parts of its claim. The plaintiff was entitled at law to present its

argument twice – once before an assistant registrar and once before a judge in

chambers. It had only one shot thus far.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12. Mr. Manjit also submitted that the effect of the judge’s order

"setting aside/reversing" the assistant registrar’s order granting summary

judgment is that the defendant must have been given unconditional leave to defend since in

setting aside the order no conditions were imposed. That there can be no appeal against a

judge’s decision granting unconditional leave to defend is a statutory provision

under the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. I accept that there is no exception to that

provision; and I cannot even invoke any inherent powers of the court in aid. And yet,

there is every compelling reason why the plaintiff must be permitted to raise the argument

it did not raise before at this level, that is, before a judge in chambers (through no

fault of his). Without guidance from any notes of arguments or the reasons for the

decision, and there being no specific order granting unconditional leave to defend, I find

myself hearing the case afresh, unencumbered, and unhindered.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13. I now come to the gravamen of the plaintiff’s application for

summary judgment, and that is whether the plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the

strength of the Canadian judgment. Mr. Manjit argued that the plaintiff is not entitled to

judgment here unless the "underlying basis" of the foreign judgment is pleaded

and tried in the Singapore courts. He submitted that neither the Reciprocal Enforcement of

Commonwealth Judgments Act ("RECJA") Ch. 264 nor the Reciprocal Enforcement of

Foreign Judgments Act ("REFJA") Ch. 265 applied in this case so as to enable the

plaintiff to merely register its Canadian judgment. Mr. Sivakumar disagrees. Mr. Manjit

further submitted that when a foreign judgment is not registrable under either of the

above statutes they cannot rely on the benefit of the "conclusive effect"

provisions. It is, however, in my judgment, too vast a leap to say that it thus follows

that the plaintiff with a foreign judgment in hand must re-litigate all over again in

Singapore. The law in this regard is straightforward and I need only recite  1007 of

Halsbury’s Laws of England, vol. 8, 4<sup>th</sup> edition to emphasize the point:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"1007. Foreign judgment generally conclusive. Subject to certain

  exceptions, a judgment in personam of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction which is

  final and conclusive on their merits is conclusive in England between parties and privies

  as to any issue upon which it adjudicates. It is not impeachable or examinable on the

  merits, whether for error of fact or of law.</p>
<p align="justify">It has, however, been held that a foreign judgment will not be

  recognised if it shows on its fact a perverse and deliberate refusal to apply generally

  accepted doctrines of private international law. In the interest of international comity

  English courts will recognise the validity of the decisions of foreign arbitration

  tribunals whose competence is derived from international law or practice.</p>
<p align="justify">Although every presumption is to be made in favour of a foreign

  judgment, and the burden of proof lies on the party who seeks to impeach it, such a

  judgment may be impeached on the ground that it was obtained by fraud, or that its

  recognition or enforcement would be contrary to public policy, or that it was obtained in

  proceedings which were contrary to natural or substantial justice."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">In this case, the defendant not only challenged the jurisdiction of the

Canadian court (in Canada) but also the correctness of the Canadian trial judge’s

decision by filing an appeal that was duly heard and dismissed. The defendant was also

represented by counsel in the Canadian proceedings. There is therefore no ground for the

courts here to re-hear the case on its merits (which is what Mr. Manjit is saying we ought

to do). It is pointless, therefore, to plead the underlying cause of action in this suit

because that is only relevant for the purpose of determining the issues for trial, which,

in this case, is unwarranted as the only issue is whether the judgment in Canada was

properly obtained. I set out the exposition of law from Halsbury’s Laws of England

because it represents the position of the common law in respect of the rules of private

international law concerning the enforcement of foreign judgments. If litigants here

expect that a judgment of the Singapore courts on the merits will be respected in a

foreign jurisdiction that abides by the rules of private international law that I referred

to above (or similar rules) then the courts here ought to do likewise. The position that

Mr. Sivakumar takes which finds my approval is not a novel one. It is well defined and

based on time-honoured affirmation in cases such as <i>Ralli v Anguilla</i> [1915-1923] XV

SSLR 33 where the principle that a foreign judgment creates a new and independent

obligation distinct from that of the underlying or original cause of action is reiterated.

In this instance, the plaintiff is suing on a debt – a judgment debt.

Correspondingly, the defence will have to be based on the premise that there was no such

debt, as for instance, the judgment was in respect of some other defendant, or was falsely

obtained. To say that there is no debt because the foreign court would not have created

that debt had the merits been properly argued or that the court of this forum would have

decided otherwise is untenable because that is a defence on the merits of the original

cause of action. If the original cause of action has not merged with the judgment the

courts would allow the plaintiff to sue in the alternative but if it had, suing on the

judgment done is sufficient.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14. Mr. Manjit raised the point that the Canadian judgment was

improperly obtained because of the fraudulent conduct of the plaintiff in failing to

disclose to the Canadian court that the letter of 20 March 1995 was addressed to Germain

Gautier and not the plaintiff. However, as I had noted above, the text of that letter was

incorporated into the loan agreement and signed there by the defendant. The more important

point, however, is that this issue ought to have been raised at the Canadian trial. Mr.

Sivakumar submitted that it was, in fact, there raised, but even if it was not, a

Singapore court is not the proper place to raise it. I agree with him. It is inappropriate

for either party to have a second opportunity to re-litigate the Canadian action here.

Thus, for these reasons the authorities, including some of my own decisions such as <i>Commerzbank

Aktiengesellschaft v Lim Kee Ban Heng Pte Ltd</i>, unreported, cited by Mr. Manjit for the

proposition that no evidence is admissible to contradict the letter of guarantee, are not

relevant in this appeal before me.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s appeal is allowed with costs.

There will therefore be judgment for the plaintiff as claimed.</p>
