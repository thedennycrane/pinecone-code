<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal was against the Judge’s
                    decision in <em>Mansource Interior Pte Ltd v Citiwall Safety
                        Glass Pte Ltd</em> [2014] 3 SLR 264 (“the Judgment”).
                    The Appellant, Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd, asked that we set aside the
                    Judge’s decision below and uphold an Adjudication Determination which was
                    made by the Adjudicator in disregard of the Adjudication Response of the
                    Respondent, Mansource Interior Pte Ltd, because the Response was filed two
                    minutes out of time. We allowed the appeal, and these grounds are issued to
                    explain why we disagreed with the Judge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Subsequent to our decision allowing the appeal,
                    the Respondent requested for further arguments with the view to persuading us to
                    review our decision. We declined to do so. In these grounds, we will also
                    address the points which the Respondent had raised in its request for further
                    arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 21 December 2012, the Respondent awarded the
                    Appellant a subcontract (“the Subcontract”) for certain
                    construction works with a value of $1,252,750. Progress payments were to be made
                    by the Respondent according to a schedule of payment under the Subcontract (the
                    Judgment at [2]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 5 August 2013, the Appellant served on the
                    Respondent a Payment Claim under s 10(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev
                    Ed) (“SOPA”). This claim was for $322,536.65. On 21 August 2013,
                    the Respondent provided the Appellant with a Payment Response under s
                        11(1)(<em>a</em>) of the SOPA, and the response amount
                    provided was only $93,732.10. This was $228,804.55 (“the Disputed
                    Sum”) less than that claimed by the Appellant (the Judgment at
                    [3]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The adjudication</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Appellant decided to seek adjudication under
                    the SOPA in respect of the Disputed Sum. On 28 August 2013, the Appellant lodged
                    an Adjudication Application with the Singapore Mediation Centre
                    (“SMC”) under s 13(1) of the SOPA. The Adjudication Application
                    was served on the Respondent the following day, 29 August 2013, at 5.25pm
                    as per s 13(4)(<em>a</em>) of the SOPA (the Judgment
                    at [5]). The Respondent was then required to lodge its Adjudication Response
                    with the SMC within seven days after it received the Adjudication Application
                    from the SMC, which was by 5 September 2013 at 4.30pm according to the SMC
                    Adjudication Procedure Rules (1 December 2012) (“the SMC Rules”).
                    It lodged its Adjudication Response with the SMC on 5 September 2013 at 4.32pm,
                    two minutes after the official closing hours of the SMC. The late lodgement of
                    the Adjudication Response was the critical issue of the appeal, as r 2.2 of the
                    SMC Rules states that the “opening hours” of the SMC are from
                    9.00am to 4.30pm on weekdays and any document lodged after 4.30pm shall be
                    treated as being lodged the next working day (the Judgment at
                [5]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Adjudicator took the view that by virtue of
                    r 2.2 of the SMC Rules, the Respondent only filed its Adjudication Response on 6
                    September 2013. It was therefore out of time. As such, he rejected the
                    Adjudication Response pursuant to s 16(2)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the SOPA and only considered the Appellant’s written submissions attached
                    to its Adjudication Application. He allowed the Appellant’s claim for
                    nearly the whole Disputed Sum, and ordered the Respondent to pay $233,956.50 as
                    well as the Appellant’s costs of the Adjudication Determination (the
                    Judgment at [7]). The Respondent thus took out an application to set aside the
                    Adjudication Determination but failed before the Assistant Registrar
                    (“AR”). It then appealed to the Judge, who allowed the
                    Respondent’s appeal. The Appellant appealed against the Judge’s
                    decision to this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision Below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Judge allowed the Respondent’s appeal
                    for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Section 15(1) of the SOPA states that
                        a respondent to an adjudication claim “shall, within 7 days after
                        receipt of a copy of an adjudication application under s 13(4)(<em>a</em>), lodge with the authorised nominating body
                            [<em>ie</em>, the SMC] a response to the
                        adjudication application.” However, as there was no provision under
                        the SOPA to explain how time was computed, s 50(a) of the Interpretation Act
                        (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“Interpretation Act”) provides
                        guidance and it states that “a period of days from the happening of
                        an event or the doing of any act or thing shall be deemed to be exclusive of
                        the day on which the event happens or the act or thing is done”.
                        Since the Respondent received the Appellant’s adjudication application
                        at 5.25pm on 29 August 2013, s 50(<em>a</em>) of
                        the Interpretation Act meant that the seven days should only start running
                        from 30 August 2013 (the Judgment at [14]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Section 2 of the SOPA defined day as “any
                        day other than a public holiday within the meaning of the Holidays Act (Cap
                        126)”. In <em>Black’s Law Dictionary</em>
                        (Bryan A Garner ed) (West Group, 9th Ed, 2009) at p 453,
                        “day” is defined as any period of 24 hours beginning with one
                        midnight and ending with the next. Therefore a seven-day period starting
                        from 30 August 2013 ended on 5 September 2013 and the last day for the
                        lodgement of the Adjudication Response would be before midnight of 5 and 6
                        September 2013; as long as the Respondent lodged its Adjudication Response
                        on or before 11.59pm of 5 September 2013, it was lodged within time (the
                        Judgment at [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     The enactment of r 2.2 of the SMC Rules was <em>ultra
                            vires</em> the powers of the SMC under the SOPA. The SMC’s
                        main role was to administer the adjudication process and merely serve as a
                        conduit for the service of documents between the claimant, the respondent
                        and the adjudicator. The SMC Rules should only be facilitative and should
                        not affect the parties’ substantial rights. Therefore, it was wrong
                        for the SMC Rules to deem that the Respondent’s Adjudication Response
                        was lodged out of time on the following day (the Judgment at
                        [22]–[24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     Section 16(3)(<em>c</em>) of the SOPA required
                        that an adjudicator “comply with the principles of natural
                        justice” and if he failed to comply with those principles, the
                        Adjudication Determination could be set aside (the Judgment at [26]). The
                        Respondent had chosen to exercise its opportunity to be heard by lodging the
                        Adjudication Response within time but the Adjudicator had relied on r 2.2 of
                        the SMC Rules to reject its Adjudication Response. That was wrong and hence
                        the Adjudication Determination was set aside on the ground that a rule of
                        natural justice had been breached (the Judgment at
                [29]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Judge also dealt with the Respondent’s
                    two other submissions relating to fraud and the Adjudicator’s failure to
                    consider the material before him. For the purposes of this appeal, they were
                    irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Four issues were raised in the appeal and they
                    are being dealt with <em>seriatim</em> in the paragraphs
                    that follow. As a preliminary point, the Appellant pointed out that the Judge at
                    [16] of the Judgment had referred to the previous version of r 2.2 of the SMC
                    Rules in his decision. The current r 2.2 (which was in effect when the
                    adjudication was commenced) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All documents to be lodged with SMC shall be lodged during the opening
                        hours of <b>9am to 4.30pm from Monday to Friday (except
                            public holidays) and 9am to 12.00noon on the eves of Christmas, New Year
                            and Chinese New Year</b>. Documents which are submitted after
                        opening hours shall be treated as being lodged the next working day.
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1: Is r 2.2 of the SMC Rules <em>ultra
                    vires</em> s 15(1) of the SOPA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     First, the Appellant submitted that r 2.2 of
                    the SMC Rules is not <em>ultra vires</em> s 15(1) of the
                    SOPA. In its view, the SMC was appointed to administer the SOPA and the SMC
                    Rules supplemented the Act for administration matters. It submitted that the
                    Judge had paid undue attention to the technical definition of the word
                    “day” without regard to practical reality; the SOPA was silent on
                    procedure and left it to the SMC to set the procedural rules for the proper
                    administration of the SOPA. By rejecting the Adjudication Response lodged, the
                    Adjudicator was only abiding by s 16(2)(<em>b</em>) of the
                    SOPA. The Respondent had to bear the consequences of its actions for filing the
                    Adjudication Response late.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In response, the Respondent submitted that
                    while s 28(4)(<em>e</em>) of the SOPA empowers the SMC to
                    establish rules to facilitate SOPA adjudications, s 19(<em>c</em>) of the Interpretation Act states that no subsidiary
                    legislation made under an Act shall be inconsistent with the provisions of the
                    Act. Thus when the SMC makes a rule which is inconsistent with the SOPA, the
                    rule has to be read subject to the SOPA. In its view, r 2.2 of the SMC Rules is
                    inconsistent with s 15(1) of the SOPA as it changes the SOPA’s position on
                    deadlines for the lodgement of Adjudication Responses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     We agreed with the Appellant that r 2.2 is
                    perfectly consistent with s 15(1) of the SOPA. Section 15(1) of the SOPA
                    states that the respondent should file its Adjudication Response within seven
                    days after receipt of the Adjudication Application and the issue in this appeal
                    was whether the SMC had the power to make rules that restricted the lodgement of
                    documents on a particular day to 4.30pm, which was its official closing time.
                    Section 28(4)(<em>e</em>) of the SOPA reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) An authorised nominating body shall, in relation to its
                        authorisation under subsection (1) —</p>

                <em>facilitate the conduct of

                                    rules therefor not inconsistent with this Act or any other
                                    written law</em>, and provide general administrative
                                support therefor; and</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The SMC’s power under s 28 to make rules
                    must be read together with s 37 of the SOPA, which states:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Since the SOPA states explicitly that
                    documents may be lodged by leaving it during normal business hours at the
                        <em>usual place of business of the person</em>, a
                    harmonious reading of ss 15(1) and 37(1)(<em>b</em>) would
                    clearly indicate that there is nothing wrong in the SMC prescribing by its rules
                        (<em>ie</em> r 2.2 of the SMC Rules) what are its
                    business hours. Section 37(1)(<em>b</em>) does not envisage
                    that the SMC should remain open until 11.59pm, as the Judge seemed to have
                    thought, in order to enable a party who has business with the SMC to lodge the
                    relevant documents. Pursuant to s 37(1)(<em>b</em>) and s
                        28(4)(<em>e</em>), SMC has by r 2.2 prescribed a clear
                    and sensible arrangement as to how it would discharge its functions under the
                    SOPA. With respect, we think it is wrong to fault the SMC for fixing the closure
                    of its office hours for the business under SOPA earlier than 11.59pm. In our
                    opinion, r 2.2 is wholly consistent with s 37(1)(<em>b</em>) and is therefore not <em>ultra
                    vires</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr Edwin Lee, counsel for the Respondent,
                    tried to persuade us that s 37(1)(<em>b</em>) was not the
                    only provision that we should be concerned with, and that s 37(1)(<em>a</em>) states that the lodgement of a document could be
                    effected by delivering it to the person <em>personally</em>. In his view, s 37(1)(<em>a</em>) uses the word “person” which ordinarily refers
                    to both natural persons and corporations, and s 48A(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Interpretation Act shows that where the legislature
                    intended to refer only to natural persons, the word “individual”
                    would have been used instead. On that basis, he submitted that since the SMC is
                    a body corporate, s 387 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) applies
                    such that lodgement can be effected by leaving a document at or sending it by
                    registered post to SMC’s registered office. Thus, in his view, the
                    situation here would fall within s 37(1)(<em>a</em>) of the
                    SOPA and pass muster. He also buttressed his argument with s 37(3), which he
                    submitted makes s 37(1)(<em>a</em>) <em>additional to</em> other legal provisions on document service. We
                    were unable to accept this argument for three reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     First, we disagreed that a corporation will
                    fall within the scope of s 37(1)(<em>a</em>).
                    According to Oliver Jones, <em>Bennion on Statutory
                        Interpretation</em> (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2013) (“<em>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</em>”) at p 508,
                    it is a rule of statutory interpretation that where a statutory provision is
                    grammatically capable of one meaning only, and on an informed interpretation, no
                    real doubt as to what is meant has been raised by the interpretative criteria,
                    the legal meaning corresponds to the grammatical meaning of the provision, and
                    is to be applied accordingly. A term can also have different meanings under the
                    same Act and while the term “person” typically applies to both
                    natural persons and corporate bodies, it can mean otherwise where the context
                    expressly or impliedly requires so (<em>Bennion on Statutory
                        Interpretation</em> at p 531). <em>Craies on
                        Legislation</em> (Daniel Greenberg gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th
                    Ed, 2012) at para 20.1.20 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An obvious but important rule for approaching the construction of a piece
                        of legislation is to look at the provision concerned in the context of the
                        legislation as a whole. This is a rule of ancient origin, and one which owes
                        its authority to common sense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In our judgment, a reading of s 37 of the SOPA shows that s
                            37(1)(<em>a</em>) can only refer to natural
                        persons. This is because of the word “personally” which
                        follows the word “person”. That word unequivocally suggests
                        that the legislature had in mind an individual as only an individual can be
                        served personally. Mr Lee seemed to have overlooked that critical
                        word.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Secondly, we were unable to see how s 48A of
                    the Interpretation Act assists the Respondent’s case. For convenience, s
                    48A(1) is set out:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>48A.—(1</b>)    Where a written law
                            authorises or requires a document to be served on a person, whether the

                            “send” or any other expression is used, then, unless the
                            contrary intention appears, the document may be served
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    in the case of
                                an individual —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    by delivering it to the individual
                                    personally; or</p>

                                    pre-paid post to, the usual or last known address of the place
                                    of residence or business of the individual;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    in the case of
                                a partnership —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    by delivering it to the secretary or other
                                    like officer of the partnership; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   by leaving it at, or by sending it by
                                    pre-paid post to, the principal or last known place of business
                                    of the partnership in Singapore;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    in the case of
                                a body corporate —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    by delivering it to the secretary or other
                                    like officer of the body corporate; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   by leaving it at, or by sending it by
                                    pre-paid post to, the registered office or a principal office of
                                    the body corporate in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Section 48A(1) begins with a generic reference
                    to “person” before moving on to specify how service is to be
                    effected in relation to different types of entities that can fall within the
                    definition of a “person” in the legal sense. While we accept that
                    in this provision the word “person” encompasses a corporation, it
                    does not follow that that sense necessarily applies in a different statutory
                    provision – the context is critical as to how it should be interpreted. It
                    is pertinent to note that the provision has, in relation to a partnership or
                    body corporate, expressly provided that service may be effected by delivering
                    the document to “the secretary…” or leaving the document at
                    the “principal or last known place of business of the partnership”
                    or “the registered office …of the body corporate”. There is
                    no question of a partnership or body corporate being served
                    “personally”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Thirdly, for the sake of argument, even if the
                    Respondent’s interpretation of s 37(1)(<em>a</em>)
                    was adopted, <em>ie</em>, that it applies to a body
                    corporate, the Respondent must still lodge the Adjudication Response on the SMC
                    in accordance with the rules prescribed by the SMC. We have at [14] above
                    explained why r 2.2 prescribed by the SMC is not <em>ultra
                        vires</em> the SOPA. Therefore, the Respondent must observe what is
                    set out in that rule. Since the Respondent had lodged the document late, the
                    consequence as provided in the rule would follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Mr Lee also relied on <em>Thomas &amp; Betts (SE Asia) Pte Ltd v Ou Tin Joon and another</em>
                    [1998] 1 SLR(R) 380 (“<em>Thomas</em>”) and
                        <em>Augustine Zacharia Norman and another v Goh Siam
                        Yong</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 746 (“<em>Augustine</em>”) to contend that empowering provisions are to
                    be construed strictly where the empowered authorities enact rules inconsistent
                    with primary legislation. We did not agree with his use of those two
                    authorities. <em>Thomas</em> concerned the calculation of
                    the seven-day period during which further arguments could be applied for, and
                    whether O 3 r 2 of the version of the Rules of Court then in force or s 50 of
                    the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Old Interpretation
                    Act”) governed the issue of reckoning the point in time at which the
                    seven day period should be calculated from. It was held that since s
                        34(1)(<em>c</em>) of the Supreme Court of Judicature
                    Act (Cap 322, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Old SCJA”) was the primary
                    provision which specified the period within which further arguments could be
                    applied for, s 50 of the Old Interpretation Act applied to determine how the
                    seven day period ought to be reckoned and not O 3 r 2. In contrast, in the
                    present case, there was no issue as to how the timeline for lodgement of the
                    Adjudication Response was to be calculated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Augustine</em>,
                    the issue was whether O 55 r 1(5) of the Subordinate Court Rules 1986 (GN No S
                    59/1986) (“the Old Subordinate Court Rules”) was <em>ultra vires</em> the Old SCJA as it took away the
                    plaintiff’s right of appeal to the High Court. The Court of Appeal held
                    that the issue of the High Court’s jurisdiction was beyond the scope of
                    the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 1985 Rev Ed) and thus beyond the Old
                    Subordinate Court Rules (at [9]). The present case was different. There was no
                    issue of the SMC Rules reducing the number of days for which service of a
                    document ought to be effected. The only issue was whether the SMC had the
                    authority to circumscribe the hours during which lodgement of a document can be
                    made on a particular day. To that extent, it was different from the facts in
                        <em>Thomas</em> and <em>Augustine</em> and we were unpersuaded by the two cases raised by the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In summary, we agreed with the Appellant on
                    the first issue. This sufficed for us to allow the appeal. However, as the
                    Respondent had also raised several other arguments before us, we will now
                    briefly address them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2: Do practical difficulties relating to the lodgement of
                documents matter?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Secondly, Mr Lee gave us several examples of
                    difficulties in relation to lodging documents under the SMC Rules to show how r
                    2.2 is <em>ultra vires</em> the SOPA. We mention one: where
                    the Adjudication Application is served on a party on a Friday, and the following
                    Friday is a public holiday, the date on which the Adjudication Response must be
                    lodged falls on a Saturday. Since the SMC is closed on a Saturday, it would be
                    impossible for documents to be lodged. He submits that as a result of such
                    practical difficulties, r 2.2 is <em>ultra vires</em> the
                    SOPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In our judgment, the argument cannot stand.
                    Since the SMC has the power to make rules limiting the lodgement of documents to
                    its official opening hours, we also held that the Respondent could not contend
                    that r 2.2 is <em>ultra vires</em> because of practical
                    difficulties relating to the opening or closing hours of the SMC. The validity
                    of a rule does not hinge on practical difficulties, but on whether the SMC
                        <em>had</em> the power to make those rules. In our
                    view, it has the power to prescribe its opening hours. In any event, the problem
                    raised by Mr Lee and which we have highlighted in the last paragraph will be
                    there whatever may be the prescribed operating hours of SMC. It has all to do
                    with the SMC not being open for business on a Saturday. All that we wish to say
                    is that the problem does not seem to be insurmountable. Perhaps we should be
                    guided by the spirit behind s 50(c) of the Interpretation Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3: Does r 2.2 take away the Adjudicator’s power to decide
                the matter?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Thirdly, Mr Lee submitted that s 16(2) of the
                    SOPA requires an adjudicator to decide whether an Adjudication Response had been
                    lodged on time and r 2.2 (assuming it is not <em>ultra
                        vires</em>) curtails the exercise of the function conferred on the
                    adjudicator in that regard. He relied on the following passage from <em>Lines International Holding (S) Pte Ltd v Singapore Tourist
                        Promotion Board and another</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 52 (“<em>Lines International</em>”) at [99]–[100] in
                    support of his position:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">99    The plaintiffs are correct in their submission that
                            PSA as the authority entrusted with the control over berths and,
                            accordingly, the discretion as to how such berths are to be allocated,
                            has also the duty to exercise that discretion itself after considering
                            various relevant factors. It cannot abrogate this responsibility by
                            taking orders from other statutory boards unless it is under a legal
                            duty to do so. PSA did not contend that it was under any legal duty to
                            obey orders from either GSB or STPB in regard to the allocation or
                            denial of berths in the cruise centre. I must therefore agree with the
                            plaintiffs' submission that in so far as condition (iv) appears to be a
                            direction by PSA to itself to take orders from either GSB or STPB to
                            deny berths to cruise vessels it is a fetter on the proper exercise by
                            PSA of its discretion and is therefore invalid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">100    I do not agree, however, that condition (iv) in
                            itself invalidates all the guidelines as they are capable of being
                            implemented without reference at all to condition (iv). Whilst
                            theoretically PSA has agreed to take orders from GSB and STPB, whether
                            it in fact does so is another matter. If PSA's decision to deny
                                <em>Nautican</em> a berth was made on the basis
                            of condition (iv), ie that it had been ordered by STPB and GSB to do so,
                            then that decision would be invalid as PSA had not exercised its
                            discretion in coming to the decision. If, however, the decision was
                            PSA's alone, then condition (iv) would be irrelevant and would not
                            operate to invalidate it. This brings me to the next issue which relates
                            to the manner in which <em>Nautican</em> was denied
                            a berth.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In our judgment, the above passage was
                    irrelevant. <em>Lines International</em> dealt with the
                    issue of whether the Port of Singapore Authority (“PSA”), which
                    had the duty of promoting the use, improvement and development of the Singapore
                    port (at [80]), had fettered its own discretion when it refused to allow a ship
                    chartered by the plaintiff to berth. The issue arose as the plaintiff refused to
                    comply with guidelines laid down by an <em>ad hoc</em>
                    committee consisting of, <em>inter alia</em>, the Singapore
                    Tourist Promotion Board (“STPB”) and the Gambling Suppression
                    Branch. Judith Prakash J held that PSA had not failed to make its own
                    determination, as the decision to refuse to allow the ship to berth was a
                    decision made by PSA itself and it had merely asked the STPB for its
                    concurrence. STPB was not the deciding body (at [118]). Here, if r 2.2 is valid,
                    the Adjudicator will then have to consider it and make a decision based on his
                    understanding of the legal effect of the SMC Rules and deal with the situation
                    in accordance with r 2.2. Nowhere was there any suggestion that the Adjudicator
                    blindly followed r 2.2 in rejecting the Adjudication Response; instead it
                    appeared that the Adjudicator gave effect to r 2.2 only because he had
                    considered the legal effect of the SMC Rules and was of the view that it was a
                    valid rule enacted by the SMC pursuant to the SOPA and he was obliged under s
                        16(2)(<em>b</em>) of the SOPA to reject it. The
                    relevant paragraphs of the Adjudication Determination are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17.    The Respondent’s adjudication response had
                            been lodged on 5 September 2013 at 4.32 pm. However, the Instructions in
                            the Adjudication Response (Form AR-1) paragraph 4 clearly states in bold
                                <b>“Documents which are submitted after the
                                opening hours shall be treated as being lodged the next working
                                day”.</b> Hence, the adjudication response which was
                            submitted after 4.30 pm was considered lodged on the next working day,
                            i.e. 6 September 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18.    Since the adjudication response was lodged on 6
                            September 2013, after the due date of 5 September 2013, I reject the
                            adjudication response in accordance to Section 16 (2) (b) of the Act,
                            “an adjudicator shall reject any adjudication response that is
                            not lodged within the period referred to in Section 15 (1)”,
                            which had expired on 5 September 2013.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 4: Is the lodgement of the Adjudication Response two minutes
                late <em>de minimis</em>?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Finally, Mr Lee submitted that the lodgement
                    of the Adjudication Response two minutes late was <em>de
                        minimis</em>. He cited <em>Peake v Automotive Products
                        Ltd</em> [1977] 3 WLR 853 in support. Therefore, it is necessary to
                    briefly examine the facts in order to understand what was in issue in the case.
                    There, a factory had a rule where work stopped at 4.25pm, but female workers
                    were allowed to leave at 4.25pm while the male workers were only allowed to
                    leave at 4.30pm. This was in the interest of safety and good administration so
                    that women could avoid being caught in the rush for the gates at 4.30pm. Goff LJ
                    (as he then was) held (at 858) that besides not being discriminatory, the case
                    was one to which the <em>de minimis</em> rule
                    applied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Mr Lee sought to persuade us that as the
                    filing of the Adjudication Response was only late by two minutes, the <em>de minimis</em> rule should apply here as well. We did not
                    agree with Mr Lee’s position. The scheme of the SOPA is to provide for
                    speedy and temporary relief so as to minimise cash flow problems within the
                    construction industry, leaving the parties’ substantive rights to be
                    determined on another occasion. In <em>SEF Construction Pte Ltd v
                        Skoy Connected Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 733, Judith Prakash J held
                    (at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">41    In my judgment, bearing in mind the purpose of the
                            legislation, the court’s role when asked to set aside an
                            adjudication determination or a judgment arising from the same, cannot
                            be to look into the parties’ arguments before the adjudicator and
                            determine whether the adjudicator arrived at the correct decision. In
                            this connection, I emphasise the intention that the procedure be
                                <em>speedy and economical</em>. It would be
                            recalled that one of the adjudicator’s duties is to avoid
                            incurring unnecessary expense. <em>If the court were to
                                be allowed to look into questions of substance or quantum including
                                questions like whether a proper payment claim had been served by the
                                claimant, the procedure is likely to be expensive and prolonged. One
                                can very easily envisage a situation (in fact such situations have
                                already occurred) where the dissatisfied respondent first applies to
                                the court for the adjudication determination to be set aside on the
                                ground that, for example, the adjudication response should not have
                                been rejected, and then when that application is rejected by the
                                assistant registrar, appeals to the judge in chambers and finally
                                when the appeal is unsuccessful, appeals again to the Court of
                                Appeal.</em> Bearing in mind that the adjudication process
                            could have been a two-step process involving a review, that would mean
                            five steps in all before the dispute regarding the claimant’s
                            payment claim is finally disposed of. The more steps there are, the
                            longer the process will take and the more expensive it will be.
                                <em>Such an outcome would be contrary to the
                                intention of Parliament that the adjudication procedure should
                                afford speedy</em> interim <em>relief.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It is in this light that timelines under the
                    SOPA have to be strictly complied with. As held by the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v Osko Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2013] 3 SLR 380 (at [42]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Where the Act itself states that certain material is not to be
                        considered in certain circumstances, this must, as a matter of logic, have
                        the effect of qualifying some other provision that imposes a general
                        requirement that the principles of natural justice must be applied. In this
                        context, there is no reason to construe s 16(3)(c) as foreclosing an
                        adjudicator’s power (indeed, his obligation) to act exactly as the Act
                        contemplates in s 15(3). We should not strain the natural construction of
                        the Act to accommodate cases such as the present, where a respondent has
                        failed through his own lack of diligence to file a payment response.
                            <em>Everyone in the building and construction industry
                            must be aware, or at least taken to be aware, of the rigorous
                            application of the timelines in the Act, and if they ignore them, they
                            do so at their own peril.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     While the way we had applied r 2.2 might seem
                    harsh in light of the fact that the Respondent’s filing of the
                    Adjudication Response was merely two minutes late, we were of the view that
                    having regard to the principle of <em>temporary
                        finality</em> undergirding the SOPA, the strict application of the
                    rule did not seem that draconian. Proceedings under the SOPA are meant to
                    proceed at a good pace, and sums due under adjudication determinations are to be
                    honoured and paid promptly. That was the whole object of the scheme. There might
                    be a case for applying the <em>de minimis</em> rule if the
                    substantive rights of the parties had been impinged, but here clearly the
                    parties will have another chance to obtain redress by filing a substantive suit
                    on the merits or have the matter submitted to arbitration. Accordingly, we held
                    that there was no place for the <em>de minimis</em> rule to
                    apply in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     For the above reasons, we allowed the appeal.
                    The costs of the appeal including the costs of Summons No 1563 of 2014 (which
                    was the Respondent’s unsuccessful application to strike out the
                    Appellant’s appeal to this court) and the costs of the proceedings below
                    were fixed at $35,000 all in, inclusive of disbursements. The usual
                    consequential order for payment out of the security followed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Postscript: Should interest on the judgment sum be paid between 17
                February 2014 and 6 May 2015?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Post-appeal, the parties disputed whether
                    interest was to be paid on the judgment debt for the period between 17 February
                    2014 and 6 May 2015 (“the Disputed Interest”). The period between
                    17 February 2014 and 6 May 2015 will be referred to as the “Relevant
                    Period”, being the period during which the Judgment was not yet
                    overturned. We held that there was no reason for the Respondent to dispute the
                    payment of the Disputed Interest and our reasons follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     First, on the authority of <em>Nitrate Producers Steamship Co Ltd v Short Bros Ltd</em> [1922] All
                    ER 710, where a first instance judgment is reversed by the Court of Appeal and
                    subsequently restored by the House of Lords, the first instance court’s
                    judgment is restored and “remains standing as from the date when it was
                    given” (at 712). The present case was similar in that the Court of Appeal
                    restored the AR’s decision not to set aside the Adjudication
                    Determination. The AR’s decision therefore stood from the date upon which
                    it was given. Interest accrued from the date of the AR’s decision, if not
                    earlier, and there was no basis for the Respondent to dispute the payment of the
                    Disputed Interest during the Relevant Period. We would add that, in cases where
                    the trial court dismisses a plaintiff’s claim for damages but the
                    appellate court allows the plaintiff’s appeal and its claim for damages,
                    it is not unusual for the appellate court to order that interest run on the
                    judgment sum from the date of the writ. In those situations, the fact that the
                    trial court found in the defendant’s favour does not relieve it of the
                    obligation to pay interest even during the period when the trial court’s
                    judgment had not yet been overruled. Similarly, we cannot see how the mere fact
                    that the Judgment had not been overturned during the Relevant Period should
                    operate to relieve the Respondent of its obligation to pay the Disputed
                    Interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Secondly, the awarding of interest on judgment
                    sums is made pursuant to the court’s equitable jurisdiction (<em>Crédit Agricole Indosuez v Banque Nationale de Paris</em>
                    [2001] 1 SLR(R) 609 (“<em>Crédit</em>”) at
                    [7]) and seeks to do justice to the parties (<em>Singapore
                        Airlines Ltd and another v Fujitsu Microelectronics (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and
                        others</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 38 (“<em>SIA</em>”) at [23]). In <em>Crédit</em>
                    the court stated (at [7]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… It would be plain from the rationale given by Lord Cairns in
                            <em>Rodger</em> … that an order made in this
                        regard is really in pursuance of the court’s equitable jurisdiction.
                        In considering this question, the court should seek to do <em>justice to all the parties, not just the appellant or the
                            respondent</em>. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It is this overriding concern with doing
                    justice to the parties that the court is ultimately concerned about, and in
                    awarding interest on judgment sums, the technicalities of what basis interest is
                    awarded upon should not unduly distract judges from the ultimate goal of seeking
                    to do justice to the parties – the restitutionary basis upon which
                    interest was ordered to be paid on the judgment sums in <em>SIA</em> and <em>Crédit</em> is but one way
                    towards achieving this overarching aim of doing justice between the parties. In
                    this case, we noted that despite the Adjudication Determination and the
                    AR’s ruling in favour of the Appellant, the Respondent did not pay over
                    the judgment sum to the Appellant. Instead, the Respondent kept the sum, which
                    it should have paid over to the Appellant, in a “current account for
                    operational purposes, that ordinarily does not bear interest”. The fact
                    was that the Respondent failed to pay over the judgment sum to the Appellant
                    when the Appellant was rightfully entitled to it. Such conduct is inexcusable
                    and it suggested to us that doing justice to parties would entail an order that
                    the Respondent pay interest during the Disputed Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Thirdly, the Respondent’s reliance on
                    the cases of <em>Borthwick v The Elderslie Steamship Company
                        Limited (No 2)</em> [1905] KB 516 (“<em>Borthwick</em>”) and <em>SIA</em> were
                    misconceived. The Respondent submitted that <em>Borthwick</em> had held that interest was only payable on a judgment
                    sum when there was a contract or where the principal money had been wrongly
                    withheld (at 520). It also submitted that <em>SIA</em> held
                    the focus should be on restitution from the respondent rather than compensation
                    to the appellant in order to do justice to the parties. In that case, the
                    appellant had paid the respondent a sum of money pursuant to the first instance
                    judgment, and the respondent had placed this sum “in an interest bearing
                    account with a reputable financial institution”. When the appellate court
                    reversed and ordered that the money be returned to the appellant, it was held
                    that all that justice required was that the respondent should also return to the
                    appellant the interest the money had <em>in fact</em>
                    earned, and not interest at a presumably higher rate of 6% (at [18]–[23]).
                    In the present case, as noted in the preceding paragraph, the Respondent had
                    kept the judgment sum in an account that was not interest-bearing, and so the
                    Respondent’s argument premised on <em>SIA</em> was
                    that it did not have to pay any interest as none had in fact
                accrued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In our view, the Respondent’s reliance
                    on <em>SIA</em> and <em>Borthwick</em>
                    was of limited utility as those cases have to be understood on their facts.
                    Turning first to <em>SIA</em>, the material difference
                    between that case and the present was that in <em>SIA</em>,
                    the respondent did pay interest on the judgment sum to the appellant upon the
                    appellate court’s allowing of the appeal. Hence the respondent’s
                    liability to pay interest even during the period when the first instance
                    decision had not been overruled was not in dispute, and the only question was
                    what the interest rate should be. In the present case, by contrast, the
                    Respondent disputed its liability to pay interest at all during the Relevant
                    Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Turning to <em>Borthwick</em>, the difference between that case and the present was
                    that the relevant party in <em>Borthwick</em> had not
                    wrongfully withheld the judgment sum, but in this case the Respondent’s
                    withholding of that sum was undoubtedly wrongful. In <em>Borthwick</em>, the issue was whether the English Court of
                    Appeal’s judgment which reversed the lower court’s decision should
                    be antedated so as to allow the plaintiff’s claim for interest on the
                    judgment debt for the period during which the lower court’s judgment
                    stood. The English Court of Appeal declined to antedate their judgment as in
                    their view, the power to antedate ought to be exercised only on good grounds
                    being shown and the plaintiff had failed to show good grounds (at
                    519–520). In its letter, the Respondent relied on the holding in <em>Borthwick</em> to contend that backdated interest could only
                    be demanded by virtue of a contract or where the principal money was wrongfully
                    withheld (see [36] above). That comment was first mentioned in <em>Caledonian Railway v Carmichael</em> (1870) LR 2 HL Sc 56
                        (“<em>Caledonian Railway</em>”) at 66 by
                    Lord Westbury. To better understand that comment it is necessary to understand
                    the context in which it was made in <em>Caledonian
                        Railway.</em> There, there was a long delay before the creditor
                    ascertained or pursued his pecuniary claim through a jury, even though at all
                    times, the debtor was willing to fulfil the judgment debt. When the creditor
                    sought for interest on the judgment debt to be awarded for the period of the
                    delay, Lord Westbury held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The jury having found the value of the stone as on that day, all
                        the functions of the jury, and all the obligations of the statute, were
                        fulfilled. There was no room for any interest to be demanded. Interest can
                        be demanded only in virtue of a contract expressed or implied, or by virtue
                        of the principal sum of money having been wrongfully withheld, and not paid
                        on the day when it ought to have been paid. There was nothing of that kind
                        here, and there is no room for any jurisdiction of any Court to consider the
                        question of interest, that being, if it arise at all, a matter for the jury
                        alone, in determining the amount of compensation, or the amount of
                        purchase-money to be paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In relation to this statement of Lord
                    Westbury, Collins MR in <em>Borthwick</em> said (at
                    520–521):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The point that was decided in [<em>Caledonian
                            Railway</em>] does not arise in [<em>Borthwick</em>], but the principle of the decision helps us in
                        dealing with [<em>Borthwick</em>]. … the
                        principle to be gathered from [<em>Caledonian
                            Railway</em>] is that till the sum was ascertained there was no
                        exigency on the railway company to pay anything, and consequently no sum on
                        which they could be called on to pay interest. Lord Westbury pointed out
                        that interest could only be demanded by virtue of a contract, or where the
                        principal money had been wrongfully withheld. <em>Wrongful
                            withholding of money due would be a cardinal factor in determining
                            whether we ought to antedate the judgment of this Court, but where the
                            withholding merely arises in the ordinary process of ascertaining
                            liability it could not be properly called wrongful.</em> …
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In our view, the remarks of Lord Westbury must
                    not be taken out of context. Wrongful withholding of the Disputed Interest was
                    exactly what happened in the present case (see [35] above) and thus there was
                    justification for antedating the present judgment. We would also add that we
                    might have been inclined to rule otherwise if the Respondent had paid over the
                    judgment sum upon the Adjudication Determination made against it with the money
                    being returned to it pursuant to the Judgment which allowed its appeal –
                    in this hypothetical scenario, we might have considered that less interest
                    should be paid by the Respondent depending on the evidence before us as to the
                    benefit the Respondent would have to disgorge (<em>Crédit</em> at [9]). However, that was not the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Finally, we observed that the lengthy delay
                    giving rise to the Relevant Period was caused partly by the Respondent’s
                    own unsuccessful application (which was dismissed with costs) to strike out the
                    Appellant’s appeal to this court by way of Summons No 1534 of 2014. That
                    being the case, we did not think it would be just to hold that the Respondent
                    should not pay the Disputed Interest for the Relevant Period. We thus rejected
                    the Respondent’s request to avoid paying the Disputed Interest, and
                    ordered it to pay the same to the Appellant.</p>
