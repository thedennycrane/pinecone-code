<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The proceedings before me concerned the estate
                    of the late Mr Tan Bung Thee (“Mr Tan”), who died intestate on 27
                    February 2011. During his lifetime, Mr Tan had eleven children with three women:
                    (a) the 1st to 5th defendants are his children with Mdm Du Chao Wan (“Mdm
                    Du”); (b) the 6th to 10th defendants with Mdm Owyang Wan (“Mdm
                    Owyang”); and (c) a daughter with the plaintiff, Mdm Wong Swee Hor
                    (“Mdm Wong”). The two mothers of the defendants passed away in the
                    late 1980s. After Mr Tan’s death, the 1st to 9th defendants claimed that
                    Mdm Wong was never Mr Tan’s legitimate wife and that she and her daughter
                    were therefore not beneficiaries to Mr Tan’s estate under the Intestate
                    Succession Act (Cap 146, 1985 Rev Ed). Mdm Wong commenced this action and sought
                        <em>inter alia</em> a declaration that she is Mr
                    Tan’s lawful wife. In the course of this action, the 1st to 5th defendants
                    counterclaimed and sought a declaration that their mother was lawfully married
                    to Mr Tan and that they are the legitimate children of Mr Tan under the
                    Intestate Succession Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After considering the evidence and submissions,
                    I allowed Mdm Wong’s claim with costs. I also allowed the 1st to 5th
                    defendants’ counterclaim with costs. I set out my reasons
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Family Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The late Mr Tan started his business from humble
                    beginnings; he owned a stall selling pork at Silat Road in the
                        1950s.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan subsequently expanded
                    his business to the operation of petrol stations in Singapore. Mr Tan also had a
                    tin mining business in Malaysia. Due to his contributions to society, he was
                    once awarded the Public Service Star Award from the President.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The late Mr Tan’s mother was one Mdm Phua
                    Siew Mei (“Mdm Phua”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan had two elder brothers. Mr
                    Tan’s nephew is Tan Ah Leng,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> also known as “Fan She”
                    or “Fan Xu” (which means “sweet potato” in English)
                    to the family members.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The 1st to 5th defendants were born between 1942
                    and 1953. It was the 1st to 5th defendants’ case that Mdm Du lawfully
                    married Mr Tan in 1942 under Chinese customary rites. Mdm Du had two other
                    children from an earlier marriage, namely, Tan Ah Tong and Tan Ah Kee, deceased.
                    Mdm Du died in 1988.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The 6th to 10th defendants were born between
                    1949 and 1965. It was not disputed that Mr Tan lawfully married Mdm Owyang under
                    Chinese customary rites prior to 1961. Mdm Owyang died in 1987.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The marriage
                        certificate<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> between Mr Tan and Mdm Owyang
                    sets out the exact date of their marriage to be 10 August
                1947.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Mr Tan had one daughter, Tan Sock Fong
                    (“Sock Fong”), with Mdm Wong. Sock Fong was born on 6 April
                        1966.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It was
                    Mdm Wong’s case that she lawfully married Mr Tan in 1957 under Chinese
                    customary rites.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       For clarity, a graphical representation of Mr
                    Tan’s family (with particulars of the individuals such as sex, date of
                    birth and, where applicable, date of death) is set out below:</p>

                    Singapore with her parents in 1937. Her parents rented a room in a house in
                    Chinatown. She started working when she was 13 years of age after her father

                    Gregorian calendar. The wedding dinner was held at 481 Silat Road. There were
                    two tables of guests. After the marriage, Mdm Wong rented a room in the Redhill
                    Estate (“Redhill Flat”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and stayed there for around ten years.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     After the acquisition of Silat Road, Mr Tan
                    moved to Block 14 Spottiswoode Park Road #16-15 Singapore 088641 (“Dragon
                    Mansion”) in the early 1970s. Mr Tan lived at Dragon Mansion up to his
                    death on 27 February 2011. Dragon Mansion is an asset of Mr Tan’s
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Claim and counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Mdm Wong sought the following
                        orders/reliefs:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     A declaration that Mdm Wong is the
                        lawful wife of Mr Tan;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     A grant to her of Letters of Administration of Mr
                        Tan’s estate and for Mdm Wong to be named as the sole
                        administrator;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     A declaration that the 1st to 5th defendants have no right to apply for a
                        Grant of Letters of Administration;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     An inquiry of the assets of Mr Tan’s estate,
                        including all assets outside of Singapore;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>(e)     An order that the 1st defendant and any of the
                        defendants who has intermeddled with the estate to account to Mdm Wong for
                        the sums received by him or them that represent income or proceeds of the
                        assets belonging to Mr Tan; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_f"></a>(f)     An account of all sums received by the 1st defendant and
                        any of the defendants who had intermeddled with the estate representing
                        income or proceeds of the assets belonging to Mr Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In this action, Mdm Wong also asserted that
                    the late Mdm Du was not Mr Tan’s legitimate wife and that the 1st to 5th
                    defendants are therefore not his beneficiaries.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Hence,
                    just before the trial, the 1st to 5th defendants were given leave to include a
                    counterclaim, seeking a declaration that their mother, Mdm Du, was lawfully
                    married to Mr Tan<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span><sup></sup> and that they are the legitimate children of Mr Tan within the
                    meaning of the Intestate Succession Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the 5th day of trial, Mdm Wong agreed to
                    withdraw all the statements contained in paras 11 to 15 of her Statement of
                    Claim alleging that the 1st defendant had intermeddled with Mr Tan’s
                    estate and also the reliefs set out in [14(d)] to [14(f)] thereof.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> I need not say more on Mdm Wong’s
                    “intermeddling” claim except that her withdrawal of such
                    allegations does not necessarily preclude her from raising such allegations
                    again.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 10th defendant and Sock Fong</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Not all the Defendants shared the same
                    position. The 1st to 9th defendants filed a common defence asserting that Mdm
                    Wong is not lawfully married to Mr Tan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The 10th defendant did not
                    enter an appearance and/or file a Defence in this action. However, eventually
                    she attended trial as Mdm Wong’s witness and gave evidence on behalf of
                    Mdm Wong. In contrast from her siblings, the 10th defendant accepted that Mdm
                    Wong is a lawful wife of Mr Tan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Therefore, the only parties contesting Mdm
                    Wong’s claim in the trial before me were the the 1st to 9th defendants.
                    Unless otherwise stated hereinafter, when I refer to the
                    “Defendants” in this judgment, I refer only to those nine
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Although Sock Fong is not a party to this
                    action, she agreed through her solicitors that she will abide by the decision of
                    this court with regard to the 1st to 5th defendants’
                        counterclaim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>
                    She gave evidence about Mr Tan’s daily visits to see Mdm Wong in the
                    afternoon before Mr Tan became too weak to visit Mdm Wong. She also gave
                    evidence about what was done at Mr Tan’s wake.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Apart from Mdm Wong herself, Sock Fong and the
                    10th defendant (as stated in [17] above), the following witnesses gave evidence
                    for Mdm Wong:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     Foong Ah Lui (“Mdm
                        Foong”). At the material time, she was a close family friend of Mdm
                        Wong. She gave evidence that she attended the wedding dinner between Mr Tan
                        and Mdm Wong.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     Foo Fong Liang Edward. At the material time, he was a close friend of Sock
                        Fong. He attended Mr Tan’s wake on 1 March 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_c"></a>(c)     Sylvester Wong Hock Ping. At the
                        material time, he was an ex-colleague and close friend of Sock Fong. He
                        attended Mr Tan’s wake on all three days from 1 March to 3 March
                        2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_d"></a>(d)     Chong Lai
                        Fun Katherine. At the material time, she was Sock Fong’s childhood
                        friend and former neighbour at Silat Road. She gave evidence about seeing Mr

                        and Tan Chin Wee Godwin are sons of the 1st defendant. They gave evidence
                        that they drove Mr Tan to visit Mdm Wong and pick Mr Tan up thereafter
                        from her Tiong Bahru flat before Mr Tan became too weak to visit Mdm

                        Mr Tan’s obituary. His evidence was on how Mdm Wong’s name came

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Mr Tan was already married to Mdm Owyang
                    before the cut-off date of 15 September 1961. It was common ground that if
                    he did marry Mdm Wong, this was after he had married Mdm Owyang. Therefore, Mdm
                    Wong had to prove that she was lawfully married to Mr Tan <em>under the law, religion, custom or usage</em> prior to the cut-off
                    date otherwise her marriage to Mr Tan would be void. On the other hand, the 1st
                    to 5th defendants asserted that Mdm Du had married Mr Tan even before his
                    marriage to Mdm Owyang. They too had to prove Mdm Du’s marriage to Mr Tan.
                    Towards this end, we turn to the common law on Chinese customary marriages as it
                    stood before 15 September 1961.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Prior to 15 September 1961, the law and
                    Chinese custom allowed a man to marry more than one woman. A man could marry one
                    wife known as the “primary” or the “principal” wife
                    or “tsai” and, at the same time, have any number of other women as
                    concubines known as “secondary” wives or
                    “tsips”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The legal requirements for proving a Chinese
                    secondary marriage were enunciated in <em>Re Lee Gee Chong
                        deceased; Tay Geok Yap &amp; ors v Tan Lian Cheow</em> [1965] 1 MLJ
                    102 (“<em>Re Lee Gee Chong</em>”), an
                    authority delivered when Singapore was still part of the federation of Malaysia.
                    In that case, an appeal from the High Court of Singapore went before the Federal
                    Court of Malaysia. The respondent in the appeal had moved the High Court to
                    revoke the Letters of Administration granted to the principal wife of the
                    deceased and her son. The respondent had claimed to be a secondary wife of the
                    deceased. The High Court held at 105 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… what had to be proved to prove a Chinese secondary marriage was
                        this: it is only necessary to prove (1) a common intention to form a
                        permanent union as husband and secondary wife and (2) the formation of the
                        union by the man taking the woman as his secondary wife and the woman taking
                        the man as her husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The High Court also noted, at 103, that the
                    Privy Council had decided in <em>Cheong Thye Pin v Tan Ah
                        Loy</em> [1920] AC 369 that, although some sort of ceremony is usual
                    when a secondary wife is taken, a ceremony is not essential to constitute a
                    secondary wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Federal Court unanimously dismissed the
                    appeal on the ground that the trial judge had set out the law
                correctly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In <em>Ching Kwong Kuen v Soh
                        Siew Yoke</em> [1981–1982] SLR(R) 347, FA Chua J cited at [16]
                    with approval the dicta of Murray-Aynsley CJ in <em>In the Estate
                        of Yeow Kian Kee, deceased; Er Gek Cheng v Ho Ying Seng</em> [1949]
                    MLJ 171 at 173:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… What must be proved in order to discharge that burden? In most
                        cases there is some sort of a ceremony, and there is recognition of the
                        t’sip as a member of the husband’s family. But this is
                        evidentiary only. It is not essential to the acquisition of the status of
                        t’sip. A formal contract in writing would be conclusive. If the
                        parties were to live as such publicly so as to acquire the reputation of
                        being man and t’sip that would also be evidence that the status had
                        been acquired. On the other hand, I do not consider that mere cohabitation
                        for a considerable period would by itself be sufficient evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The allegations surrounding Mr Tan’s
                    respective relationships with Mdm Wong and Mdm Du were hotly disputed by the

                    Mdm Wong’s status. Thereafter, I will set out the respective allegations

                    to Singapore with her parents in 1937. They rented a room in one of the houses
                    in Chinatown.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Mdm Wong started working when she was 13 years

                    started working for Eng Aun Tong (which was owned by Haw Par Brothers
                    International Limited) as a factory packer. She was employed there for close to
                    21 years. She quit that job to care for Sock Fong in 1971, who was around five
                    years old then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Mdm Wong met Mr Tan in late 1949. After seeing
                    each other for two years, Mr Tan bought an attap house at 481 Silat Road.
                    Mr Tan, Mdm Wong and her mother started <em>living</em> together in the house sometime in 1951.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> I should
                    qualify that the word “living” in this context does not mean that

<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Wedding dinner on 11 January 1957 (lunar calendar)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Sometime in 1956, Mdm Phua had told Mr Tan to
                    give Mdm Wong status as a member of the family. Mr Tan had given Mdm Wong an
                        <em>ang bao</em> (red packet) containing $400 to pass
                    to her mother to prepare for the wedding. Mdm Wong’s mother spent a part
                    of this money to pay for traditional weddings cakes which she distributed to Mdm
                    Wong’s relatives and friends.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p>

                    old that year. She could recall that the wedding dinner took place on 11 January
                    1957 (on the lunar calendar) because her younger sister was born a day

                    Mdm Phua at 83 Silat Road. During the visit, she was instructed by Mdm Phua to
                    pray to Mr Tan’s family ancestors and several deities, including the

                    Road Flat or the Tiong Bahru Flat, as the case may be) and Mdm Wong would cook
                    lunch for Mr Tan. Mr Tan would usually leave at 4pm each day. Mr Tan continued
                    to spend time with Mdm Wong even after Sock Fong moved out of the Tiong Bahru
                    Flat in 1996.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Despite becoming too weak
                    to travel by himself in his later years, Mr Tan would be fetched to the Tiong
                    Bahru Flat by the 1st defendant’s sons, or the 7th defendant or the 8th
                    defendant, and continued his routine of spending time with Mdm Wong up to the

                    fell very ill sometime in 1958. Mdm Wong took a month’s leave from work to
                    help look after Mdm Phua. Mdm Wong did so out of filial piety as she regarded

                    the burial clothes on Mdm Phua’s body and combed Mdm Phua’s hair.
                    Mdm Wong helped to sew the traditional mourning clothes worn by the rest of the
                    family at Mdm Phua’s wake, which was held at Mdm Owyang’s house for
                    about one week. Mdm Wong wore the traditional mourning clothes at the wake and
                    participated in the funeral procession as Mdm Phua’s

                    Mr Tan’s birthday on the lunar calendar in 1975. As such, she asked

                    Cantonese customs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> Mr Tan attended the wake the next

                    defendant was sent to attend the funeral procession on behalf of Mr

                    Wong on Mr Tan’s instructions. The 6th, 8th and 9th defendants confirmed
                    that Mdm Wong was served tea during their respective weddings while she was

                    stance. She was not represented by any solicitor and was not initially expected
                    to give evidence for either side. Eventually she gave evidence for Mdm Wong. She
                    said that her mother, <em>ie</em>, Mdm Owyang had told her
                    that Mr Tan had three wives. She was very disappointed that after Mr Tan passed
                    away, none of her siblings agreed that Mdm Wong was one of Mr Tan’s wives
                    when they had regarded her as such during family gatherings when Mr Tan was

                    by the relevant government authorities that Mdm Phua’s grave would be
                    exhumed. Mr Tan decided to send the exhumed remains for cremation and he wanted
                    to find a suitable location to place Mdm Phua’s urn.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Mdm Wong and Mr Tan thereafter went around
                    looking for a suitable location. She decided to go to <em>Kwong

                    location and they were accompanied by two of Mr Tan’s relatives. Those
                    relatives were also looking for a suitable location to store the urns of their

                    the niches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The 7th defendant made payment, on behalf of
                    Mr Tan, for seven niches in total: (a) four for Mdm Phua, Mdm Owyang, Mr Tan and
                    Mdm Wong; and (b) three other niches meant for Mr Tan’s

                    and the Defendants (except the 5th defendant) were at Mr Tan’s

                    mourning clothes as she was told she could not do so under Chinese funeral
                    customs. None of Mr Tan’s eleven children were in traditional mourning
                    clothes. They were all dressed in white t-shirt and black pants. They
                    participated in the funeral rites at Mr Tan’s wake.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> As Mdm Wong knew
                    that she need not participate in the funeral rites under Chinese customs, she
                    spent most of her time during the wake folding joss paper into the shape of
                    “gold ingots” or chatting with the people who attended the wake.
                    She asked the guests if they wanted drinks and desserts. Mdm Wong had also burnt

                    will refer to this meeting as the “mid-April 2012 meeting” as the
                    parties were unable to agree on whether this meeting was held on 13 April 2012
                    or 15 April 2012. The exact date of this meeting was immaterial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     During the mid-April 2012 meeting, the 1st
                    defendant asked Mdm Wong to produce a copy of her marriage certificate with Mr
                    Tan. As Mdm Wong had gone through a Chinese customary marriage with Mr Tan, she
                    did not have any marriage certificate. The 1st defendant asserted that because
                    Mdm Wong was not able to produce such a certificate, she was not Mr Tan’s
                    lawful wife. He also asserted that as Sock Fong was born after 1961, she was not
                    Mr Tan’s legitimate daughter. The 1st defendant then told Mdm Wong and
                    Sock Fong that they were both not legally entitled to a share of Mr Tan’s
                    estate. The 1st defendant’s wife went on to say that if they were not
                    satisfied that this was the legal position, they should seek legal
                        advice.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Mdm Wong was shocked and heartbroken that the

                    Fong as Mr Tan’s legitimate daughter. In the circumstances, Mdm Wong
                    sought legal advice and her solicitors sent a letter dated 19 April 2012 to the

                    wife and Sock Fong were present, but not Mdm Wong. Sock Fong attended this
                    meeting on Mdm Wong’s behalf. At this meeting, the 1st defendant
                    represented to the other Defendants who were present that Mdm Wong and Sock Fong
                    were not legally entitled to a share of Mr Tan’s estate. The 1st defendant
                    however offered Mdm Wong and Sock Fong a share each from Mr Tan’s estate
                    out of goodwill. The 1st defendant also represented to the Defendants and Sock
                    Fong that fiscal penalties would be imposed by the purchasers of the <em>en bloc</em> sale of Dragon Mansion if there was any further
                    delay to completion of the <em>en bloc</em> sale. The 1st
                    defendant also stated that he would apply to be appointed as an administrator of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     By a letter dated 30 April 2012, the 1st
                    defendant’s solicitors replied to Mdm Wong’s solicitors stating that
                    they were instructed that Mdm Wong was not married to Mr Tan under any Chinese
                    customary rites and that no ceremony was performed. They further stated that Mdm
                    Wong could not be deemed to be Mr Tan’s legitimate spouse under the
                    Women’s Charter. The 1st defendant’s solicitors also provided, on a
                    without prejudice basis, copies of the correspondence between their firm, M/s
                    Hin Tat Augustine &amp; Partners, and the solicitors for the sale committee for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     There was further correspondence between De
                    Souza Lim &amp; Goh LLP and Mdm Wong’s solicitors including letters to Mdm
                    Wong’s solicitors dated 4 May 2012 and 10 May 2012 where it became clear
                    that there would be no penalty imposed on Mr Tan’s estate as the sale
                    committee had decided to apply to the Strata Titles Board for a member of the
                    collective sales committee to sign the requisite transfer documents on behalf of
                    Mr Tan’s estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     It is not necessary to set out the evidence of
                    other witnesses for Mdm Wong for reasons which will become apparent
                    later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It was Mdm Wong’s case that she was
                    married to Mr Tan in 1957 as his secondary wife. Mr Tan’s conduct was
                    consistent with the intention of Mdm Wong and Mr Tan to form a permanent union
                    as husband and wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>
                    Mdm Wong asserted that under the applicable law, Mdm Wong is recognised as a
                    secondary wife and is entitled to a share of Mr Tan’s estate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     It was Mdm Wong’s case that Mdm Owyang
                    was the principal wife as Mdm Owyang married Mr Tan in August 1947 (before Mdm
                    Wong’s marriage to Mr Tan) and the marriage rites of Mdm Owyang performed
                    satisfied the requirements of a marriage of a principal wife. Mdm Wong cited a
                    passage from <em>Principles of Family Law in Singapore</em>
                    (Butterworths Asia, 1997) at p 88 by Prof Leong Wai Kum to show that the rites
                    of marriage to the principal wife under traditional Chinese custom were
                        elaborate.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Mdm Wong relied on Mdm Owyang’s marriage
                    certificate which showed that Mdm Owyang’s marriage satisfied most of such
                        requirements.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> The marriage certificate states the
                    date of the marriage to be 10 August 1947.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As Mdm Wong was already married to Mr Tan
                    prior to the cut-off date of 15 September 1961, Mdm Wong asserted that her
                    marriage to Mr Tan was deemed registered and preserved under s 181 of the
                    Women’s Charter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     As Mr Tan’s secondary wife, and thus
                    lawful wife, Mdm Wong claimed that she was entitled to one-half of Mr
                    Tan’s estate as the surviving spouse. Her daughter, Sock Fong, would also
                    accordingly be entitled to a share of the other half of Mr Tan’s
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     As the only surviving spouse of Mr Tan, Mdm
                    Wong said she had the right to apply for Grant of Letters of Administration of
                    Mr Tan’s estate under s 18 of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap
                    251, Rev Ed 1985).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendants’ case on the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As may be gleaned from the graphical
                    representation at [8] above, by 1957, the year of Mdm Wong’s alleged
                    marriage to Mr Tan, the 1st to 5th defendants had already been born with the
                    oldest being the 2nd defendant, 15 years old at that time, and the youngest
                    being the 5th defendant, who was four years old then. The 6th, 9th and 8th
                    defendants had also been born but their ages at that time ranged from one to
                    eight years. The 7th and 10th defendants were not born then. Obviously, for
                    those Defendants who were infants or not born at the material time, they had no
                    personal knowledge of any of the material disputed events and offered no
                    admissible evidence on those events. Be that as it may, the Defendants’
                    position was that they were not aware or told about Mr Tan’s marriage to
                    Mdm Wong. However, the Defendants’ conduct <em>vis-à-vis</em> Mdm Wong would be relevant, and indeed significant, as
                    I will elaborate later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The common defence advanced by the Defendants
                    was a denial that Mr Tan was ever lawfully married to Mdm Wong. I set out below
                    the Defendants’ position on the various key aspects of Mdm Wong’s
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The alleged wedding dinner, tea ceremony and ancestral
                prayers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In essence, the Defendants denied the events
                    leading up to Mdm Wong’s wedding dinner and what transpired at the wedding
                    as alleged by Mdm Wong above. The Defendants also denied that the tea ceremony
                    and the ancestral prayers as alleged by Mdm Wong at [40] to [42] above ever
                    occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The Defendants highlighted several gaps and
                    inconsistencies in Mdm Wong’s evidence. As regards the evidence of Mdm
                    Foong, the Defendants urged caution in accepting her evidence as she was not
                    credible and she was biased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Defendants said that even if there was a
                    dinner on 11 January 1957, it would have been likely that it was a Chinese New
                    Year dinner because according to Mdm Foong’s evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_a"></a>(a)     only Mdm Wong’s mother’s
                        family and friends were invited to this dinner; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mr Tan and Mdm Wong were wearing new
                        clothes which were more in line with a Chinese New Year
                    dinner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Mr Tan’s nephew, Tan Ah Leng, gave
                    evidence on behalf of the Defendants that he was, at the material time, living
                    along the same row of houses as Mdm Wong and her mother. According to him, they
                    were only a few doors away and he deposed that there was no wedding dinner or
                    celebration held at 481 Silat Road in 1957.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> The Defendants further
                    asserted that Mr Tan was a prominent person in a closely knitted community or
                        <em>kampong</em> and had Mr Tan married Mdm Wong in
                    1957, everyone would have known about it.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     As stated at [41] above, Mdm Wong said that,
                    during the visit at 83 Silat Road, she was instructed by Mdm Phua to pray to Mr
                    Tan’s family ancestors and several deities, including the tablet for Mr
                    Tan’s late father and late eldest brother. The 3rd defendant disputed this
                    as according to her, there were no ancestors or deities kept at 83 Silat Road.
                    She claimed that Mr Tan’s only ancestor tablet was for Mdm Phua after she
                    passed away.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_74" id="Ftn_74_1"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The alleged secret affair</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     It was the Defendants’ case that Mr Tan
                    was having an affair with Mdm Wong and wanted to keep this affair a
                        secret.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_75" id="Ftn_75_1"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     In the 1st defendant’s affidavit of
                    evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), he stated that the late Mdm Du
                    resented Mdm Wong. Whenever Mdm Wong walked past their house, Mdm Wong would
                    dash across the road so as to avoid Mdm Du<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_76" id="Ftn_76_1"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The Defendants asserted that there was no
                    evidence that Mr Tan supported or provided maintenance to Mdm Wong from 1957 to
                    1971. The Defendants disputed the fact that Mr Tan had “lived”
                    with Mdm Wong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_77" id="Ftn_77_1"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Mdm Wong was engaged by Mr Tan as a maid to
                    take care of Mdm Phua in the late 1950s till Mdm Phua passed away. In the 3rd
                    defendant’s AEIC, she stated that she was asked by Mr Tan to pay Mdm Wong
                    a sum of $35 every month.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_78" id="Ftn_78_1"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> The Defendants stated that this was
                    consistent with Mdm Wong’s own evidence that she continued to do part time
                    work every night.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_79" id="Ftn_79_1"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     The fact that Mdm Wong and Mr Tan rented a
                    room at the Redhill Flat suggested that there was no intention on their part to
                    have a permanent home to start a family.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Mdm Wong purchased the Tiong Bahru Flat
                    without any contribution by Mr Tan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_80" id="Ftn_80_1"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     In the 1st defendant’s AEIC, he stated
                    that after Mdm Phua passed away, Mdm Wong was tasked to take him, the 5th and
                    9th defendants for tuition in the evenings and they would meet at Mdm
                    Wong’s home at Silat Road. Mr Tan would come at 9pm after tuition to bring
                    them home but when tuition ended early, the 1st defendant would go look for Mr
                    Tan and he would find Mr Tan with Mdm Wong at the Redhill Flat. Mr Tan started
                    this arrangement so that they could have an affair at the Redhill Flat in
                    secret. Mdm Phua passed away in October 1962 and the affair started in around
                    1963 or 1964 which would explain why Sock Fong was born in 1966.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_81" id="Ftn_81_1"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Although the 6th, 8th and 9th defendants
                    agreed that they had served tea to Mdm Wong during a tea ceremony to mark their
                    respective weddings and that she was seated next to Mr Tan, Mdm Du and Mdm
                    Owyang in a row, these three defendants aligned themselves with the rest of the
                    Defendants who disputed that Mdm Wong was Mr Tan’s wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Indeed, even though the 8th defendant also
                    admitted in cross-examination that he had regarded Mdm Wong as Mr Tan’s
                        wife,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_82" id="Ftn_82_1"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> he
                    continued to align himself with the formal position of the other
                    Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The funerals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants stated, in
                    their AEICs, that Mdm Wong did not take part in any of the funeral rites during
                    Mdm Phua’s funeral in the early 1960s.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_83" id="Ftn_83_1"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     As for the wake of Mdm Wong’s mother,
                    Mdm Wong asserted that she asked Mr Tan not to attend her mother’s wake on
                    the first day as it was against Cantonese customs (see [50] above). Mdm Wong
                    also asserted that Mr Tan attended the wake the next afternoon on 7 November
                    1975 (of the lunar calendar) and sent the 9th defendant to attend the funeral
                    procession on his behalf on 8 November 1975 because he had to attend to his pork
                    business on 8 November 1975. The Defendants disputed this and the 9th defendant
                    stated, in his AEIC, that Mr Tan did not even attend Mdm Wong’s
                    mother’s funeral which he should have done were he married to Mdm
                        Wong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_84" id="Ftn_84_1"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Photograph of Mdm Phua’s tombstone</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Although the Defendants accepted the
                    authenticity of the photograph of Mdm Phua’s tombstone, they disputed
                    strenuously two points about the tombstone. First, the 1st and 3rd defendants
                    disputed that the Chinese characters, which Mdm Wong said were characters of her
                    name, were found on the tombstone. Secondly, these two defendants alleged that
                    in any event those Chinese characters were not the characters of Mdm
                    Wong’s name.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The niche application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In his AEIC, the 7th defendant said that Mr
                    Tan called him one day to go down to <em>Kwong Wei Siew Peck San
                        Theng</em> to pay for a niche to store his urn. Mr Tan told him that
                    everything had been arranged and that he merely had to make a trip down there,
                    show his identity card and make payment. Mr Tan handed the 7th defendant the
                    cash and reminded him to collect the receipt on his behalf.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_85" id="Ftn_85_1"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> The 7th defendant
                    clarified during cross-examination that he collected the money from Mr Tan at
                    Mdm Wong’s Tiong Bahru Flat.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_86" id="Ftn_86_1"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The 7th defendant said that he knew that Mdm
                    Wong was the one who made the arrangements as Mdm Wong is Cantonese and
                        <em>Kwong Wei Siew Peck San Theng</em> is a Cantonese
                    columbarium. The 7th defendant said that Mr Tan would never have arranged for
                    his urn to be placed in a Cantonese columbarium as he was Hokkien and
                    furthermore, Mr Tan was very superstitious and adverse to death related matters.
                    The 7th defendant recalled that while he was at the columbarium, he heard one of
                    the staff telephone Mdm Wong to check on the particulars to be inserted on the
                    application form. He signed the application form, paid and took the receipt and
                    left. The 7th defendant said in his AEIC that he was not bothered about what was
                    written on the application form. He elaborated in cross-examination that he did
                    not notice what was written on the application form. When he returned to Mdm
                    Wong’s Tiong Bahru Flat, he handed the receipt and a copy of the
                    application form to Mr Tan. The 7th defendant suspected that Mr Tan had handed
                    the receipt and the form over to Mdm Wong.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_87" id="Ftn_87_1"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Income Tax Notices of Assessment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    The Defendants submitted that in the Income
                    Tax Notice of Assessment for 1988 and for 1989, Mr Tan had been granted personal
                    relief from tax of $1,000 for a wife. After Mdm Du passed away in 1988,
                    subsequent Income Tax Notices of Assessment for Mr Tan for the Years of
                    Assessment for 1993 and for 1998 showed that he was not granted such a relief.
                    This change suggested that Mr Tan had claimed tax relief for a wife in respect
                    of Mdm Du only when Mdm Du was alive and that he did not claim for such a relief
                    for Mdm Wong as his wife as she was still alive for the Years of Assessment for
                    1993 and for 1998. Therefore, Mr Tan did not accept Mdm Wong as his
                wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    Furthermore, in a Form IR8A being a Return
                    of Employee’s Remuneration for Mdm Wong for the year ending
                    31 December 1971, there was a box stating “If the employee is a
                    married woman, state the husband’s full name …”. An entry of
                    “NA” was inserted in the box. This return of Mdm Wong’s
                    income was apparently issued by Mdm Wong’s employer Haw Par Brothers
                    International Ltd. Therefore, the Defendants submitted that this document was
                    also evidence that Mdm Wong was not married at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    I will deal with the argument about the Form
                    1R8A for Mdm Wong very quickly. The Defendants’ submission thereon was
                    based on a selective consideration of the form in question. While it was true
                    that “NA” had been inserted in that box, there was also another
                    box in the form with the heading “Marital Status”. The word
                    “Married” was inserted under that heading. It was rather naughty
                    of the Defendants to refer to information in one box which was favourable to
                    them and to disregard information in another box in the same form which was
                    favourable to Mdm Wong. Bearing in mind the inconsistent entries and the fact
                    that no one from Haw Par Brothers International Ltd came to give evidence and
                    the fact that Mdm Wong was not asked any question about the reason for the
                    inconsistent entries, I was of the view that no weight should be given to the
                    entries in this form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    I will elaborate later in respect of the
                    Income Tax Notices of Assessment for Mr Tan which the Defendants relied
                    on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Mr Tan’s obituary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    It was the Defendants’ case that Mdm
                    Wong was the one who provided her name as a wife of the late Mr Tan for purposes
                    of Mr Tan’s obituary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    According to Tan Ah Tong, on the first day
                    of Mr Tan’s wake, the undertaker arranged for a representative from a
                    Chinese newspaper to attend to them for the purposes of placing an obituary in
                    the newspaper. When the representative came, Tan Ah Tong was asked by the 1st
                    defendant to help write down the names of the relatives and next-of-kin for the
                    obituary because he was familiar with the Chinese characters of the names in the
                    family. Tan Ah Tong stated that, as he was writing out the names, Mdm Wong asked
                    the newspaper representative to write down her name as one of Mr Tan’s
                    wives and she also requested for Sock Fong’s name to be included as one of
                    Mr Tan’s children. Tan Ah Tong stated that he did not know that Mdm Wong
                    was a wife of Mr Tan but he knew that Mr Tan had had a relationship with Mdm
                    Wong and had a child with her. He did not wish to create a scene by questioning
                    her out of respect for the late Mr Tan. He reasoned that he had also included
                    his own name as one of Mr Tan’s sons even though he was not related by
                    blood because he had always considered Mr Tan as his father.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_88" id="Ftn_88_1"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Meetings in April 2012</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    After Mr Tan’s first death
                    anniversary, the 1st defendant sought legal advice and learnt that Mdm Wong had
                    to be legally married as a wife under the Women’s Charter to be entitled
                    to any part of the estate. In his AEIC, the 1st defendant stated that, during
                    the mid-April 2012 meeting, he met Mdm Wong and Sock Fong and asked Mdm Wong
                    whether she had any proof that she was legally married to Mr Tan. According to
                    the 1st defendant, Mdm Wong informed him that she did not have any certificate
                    of marriage and when he asked her whether she had undergone any Chinese
                    customary marriage ceremony like the tea ceremony or wedding dinner, Mdm Wong
                    told him that she had not. The 1st defendant then told them that they were not
                    entitled to a share of the estate unless the beneficiaries consented. The 1st
                    defendant also said that he would try to persuade the other beneficiaries to
                    agree to give them an equal share and according to the 1st defendant, they both
                        agreed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_89" id="Ftn_89_1"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I should pause here to state that Mdm Wong
                    strenuously disputed the 1st defendant’s version and maintained her
                    position as stated in [66] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    According to the 1st defendant, he
                    subsequently called for a family meeting on 22 April 2012 at 27 Blair Road so
                    that he could ask the other beneficiaries whether they were agreeable to give
                    Mdm Wong, Sock Fong and Tan Ah Tong each an equal share of the estate. The 1st
                    defendant also wanted to update the other Defendants on the <em>en bloc</em> sale and the grant of letters of administration. The 1st
                    defendant said that he informed everyone at the meeting that Mdm Wong must be
                    legally married to Mr Tan for her to be entitled to a share of Mr Tan’s
                    estate. He also informed all parties present that when he met Mdm Wong earlier,
                    she could not produce any certificate or proof of the marriage and that she had
                        <em>admitted</em> that she had not undergone any
                    Chinese customary marriage ceremony with Mr Tan.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_90" id="Ftn_90_1"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Other minor disputes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The Defendants also disputed some minor
                    aspects of Mdm Wong’s case which I need not elaborate on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Defendants’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The Defendants’ case may be summarised
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mr Tan had engaged Mdm Wong in the
                        1950s as a maid to take care of Mdm Phua. Mr Tan started having an
                        extramarital affair with Mdm Wong at the Redhill Flat and Sock Fong is an
                        illegitimate child born from that relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mr Tan never lawfully married Mdm Wong under
                        Chinese customary rites or at all. If he did, the marriage was after the
                        cut-off date and was invalid. Therefore, both Mdm Wong and Sock Fong are not
                        entitled to a share in Mr Tan’s estate or entitled to apply for a
                        Grant of Letters of Administration to administer Mr Tan’s
                        estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Du’s status issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    As it was the 1st to 5th defendants’
                    burden to prove that Mdm Du was lawfully married to Mr Tan, I set out first
                    their version of the facts before dealing with Mdm Wong’s
                version.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 1st to 5th defendants’ case on the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    The 1st to 5th defendants contended that the
                    late Mr Tan and Mdm Du had undergone a Chinese customary marriage in 1942 and
                    were therefore validly and legally married under s 181(1) of the Women’s
                    Charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Tan Ah Tong testified that he was around
                    seven or eight years when his mother, Mdm Du, married Mr Tan in 1942 during the
                    Japanese Occupation. He could not however recall the exact date or month. Tan Ah
                    Tong recalled that he and his sister were present at the wedding and he
                    witnessed the customary marriage tea ceremony held at 219-1 Silat Road, where
                    Mdm Du served tea to Mdm Phua and that both Mr Tan and Mdm Du served tea to Mdm
                    Du’s three brothers. This was followed by a wedding dinner in the evening.
                    Tan Ah Tong distinctly remembered the occasion because it was then that the late
                    Mr Tan had declared that he accepted his sister and him as his own children.
                    After the marriage, they lived as a family at 219-1 Silat Road.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_91" id="Ftn_91_1"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Following this marriage, the 1st to 5th
                    defendants were born in 1949, 1942, 1944, 1947 and 1953 respectively. According
                    to the 1st to 5th defendants, Mr Tan and Mdm Du lived together as husband and
                    wife at 219-1 Silat Road along with the 1st to 5th defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The 1st to 5th defendants also relied on the
                    following documents:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mdm Du’s Certificate of

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_c"></a>(c)     A letter dated 9 October 1992 purportedly from
                        Mr Tan to the Property Tax Branch, Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore
                            (“IRAS”);<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_94" id="Ftn_94_1"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span></p>

                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_115-p2_e"></a>(e)     A letter dated
                        16 May 2012 from Mdm Wong’s solicitors to the 1st defendant’s
                        solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The 1st to 5th defendants’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Accordingly, the 1st to 5th defendants
                    alleged that they are Mr Tan’s legitimate children. It was also their case
                    that Mdm Wong knew all along that Mdm Du was one of Mr Tan’s lawful wives.
                    However, Mdm Wong decided to deny that the late Mdm Du was lawfully married to
                    Mr Tan out of spite<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_96" id="Ftn_96_1"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span>
                    because the 1st to 5th defendants did not accept that she was also lawfully
                    married to Mr Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mdm Wong’s case on the facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    I should mention that as Mdm Wong only met
                    Mr Tan in late 1949<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_97" id="Ftn_97_1"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span>, she had no personal knowledge of the
                    alleged wedding ceremony between Mdm Du and Mr Tan. Nevertheless, Mdm Wong
                    denied that there was ever a tea ceremony or wedding dinner between Mr Tan and
                    Mdm Du. Not surprisingly, Mdm Wong sought to show that Tan Ah Tong was not a
                    credible witness and highlighted several gaps and inconsistencies in his
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    In her AEIC, Mdm Wong deposed that Mdm Phua
                    had told Mdm Wong that she never regarded Mdm Du as her daughter-in-law and did
                    not approve of Mdm Du’s relationship with Mr Tan. According to Mdm Wong,
                    Mdm Phua said that she did not want to share someone else’s
                    daughter-in-law (as Mdm Du was previously married to another man). Mdm Wong
                    claimed that Mdm Du and Mr Tan simply decided to live together during the Second
                    World War. Mdm Wong further deposed that Mdm Phua did not allow the 1st to 5th
                    defendants to address Mr Tan as “father” and could only address
                    him as “uncle”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_98" id="Ftn_98_1"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Observations of the material witnesses and their evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    I state my observations on the material
                    witnesses and their evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Wong </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I found Mdm Wong an unreliable witness.
                    First, Mdm Wong did herself no favours during cross-examination when she
                    demonstrated that she was unfamiliar with her own case and eventually had to
                    withdraw her intermeddling claim against the 1st defendant. Her answers were
                    often confused and incoherent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_99" id="Ftn_99_1"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    As stated earlier, the Defendants
                    highlighted certain gaps and inconsistencies in Mdm Wong’s evidence. For
                    example, in respect of the alleged tea ceremony, the Defendants questioned why
                    Mdm Wong did not mention in her AEIC or at trial whether there were any
                    witnesses at this wedding tea ceremony. The Defendants also said that there was
                    no evidence that Mdm Wong had served tea to Mdm Owyang whom Mdm Wong asserted
                    she knew at the time to be Mr Tan’s first wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    In respect of the wedding dinner on 11
                    January 1957, Mdm Wong confirmed that the dinner was only attended by her
                    relatives and friends.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_100" id="Ftn_100_1"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span> Mdm Wong thereafter gave
                    evidence that Mdm Phua was invited to attend the wedding dinner but declined to
                        attend.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_101" id="Ftn_101_1"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span> When asked why she did not
                    mention this in her AEIC, Mdm Wong changed her position and gave yet another
                    confusing answer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_102" id="Ftn_102_1"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mdm Wong, this part of your evidence where you said

                    was true in that Mdm Phua had suggested a formal wedding to give Mdm Wong status
                    as a member of the family, Mdm Phua and her family members would have attended
                    the wedding dinner and would have held a wedding tea ceremony at 83 Silat Road
                    where Mdm Phua was residing with Mdm Owyang.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    I need not set out other examples of
                    contradictions in Mdm Wong’s evidence. Furthermore, much of her oral
                    evidence about the time she spent with Mr Tan or vice versa was equivocal. It
                    could mean that she was his wife or his mistress as contended by the
                    Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    I considered allowing Mdm Wong a certain
                    degree of latitude regarding her contradictions given her age which was around
                    83 years old at the time of the trial. However, I could not ignore her
                    unreliable responses in her evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Foong</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    Mdm Wong relied on Mdm Foong’s
                    evidence to corroborate her evidence of the alleged wedding dinner and tea
                    ceremony. The Defendants urged me not to accept Mdm Foong’s evidence for
                    the following reasons:<sup></sup><span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_103" id="Ftn_103_1"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mdm Foong had admitted during
                        cross-examination that she had never attended any wedding dinner before 10
                        February 1957 or any time thereafter.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_104" id="Ftn_104_1"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span> Given
                        that she was 12 years old at that time and in the absence of having attended
                        any previous wedding dinners, it was highly unlikely that Mdm Foong would be
                        able to appreciate whether the dinner on 10 February 1957 was a wedding
                        dinner. Indeed, at one point in time during cross-examination, Mdm Foong
                        said that the dinner she had attended was to celebrate the Lunar New
                        Year.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mdm
                        Foong claimed that she overheard Mdm Wong’s mother telling Mdm
                        Foong’s mother to attend the wedding dinner one month before 11
                        January 1957.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_105" id="Ftn_105_1"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span> Mdm Foong testified that she
                        overheard Mdm Wong telling Mdm Foong’s mother that Mdm Wong had served
                        tea to Mdm Phua as part of Chinese customary rites. Mdm Foong also gave
                        evidence that she overheard that Mdm Wong prayed to Mr Tan’s ancestors
                        and deities at Mdm Phua’s home.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_106" id="Ftn_106_1"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> The Defendants
                        contended that it was far-fetched that she could remember such conversations
                        that took place more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_126-p2_c"></a>(c)     Mdm Foong was clearly a close family friend of
                        Mdm Wong and her evidence was not objective and could not be safely relied
                        upon.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    While Mdm Foong said that she could remember
                    the occasion of Mdm Wong’s wedding dinner because it was just one day
                    before the birthday of her own sister Foong Ah Ying, I had doubts as to whether
                    she had truly placed importance on the occasion of the alleged dinner given her
                    young age at the time and the lapse of time. Furthermore, if she had truly
                    placed importance on that occasion, she would not have contradicted herself by
                    saying it was a dinner to celebrate the Lunar New Year in
                    cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Accordingly, I found it unsafe to give
                    weight to Mdm Foong’s evidence about the alleged wedding
                dinner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 10th defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    The 10th defendant’s evidence carried
                    much weight. It was not in her interest to give evidence in favour of Mdm Wong
                    as she would get a smaller share of Mr Tan’s estate if Mdm Wong is a
                    lawful wife of Mr Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 1st and 3rd defendants </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    The main witnesses for the Defendants,
                    namely, the 1st and 3rd defendants, were highly unsatisfactory witnesses
                    especially in respect of certain inscriptions on Mdm Phua’s
                    tombstone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    At the first tranche of the trial which
                    commenced on 24 September 2013, the photograph of Mdm Phua’s
                    tombstone was referred to during the cross-examination of Mdm Wong. At that
                    time, the Defendants challenged the authenticity of the photograph.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_107" id="Ftn_107_1"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span> On the fourth day of trial (27 September
                    2013), the Defendants changed their minds and confirmed through their counsel
                    that they accepted the authenticity of the photograph. However, during the
                    second tranche of the trial in November 2013, the 1st and 3rd defendants took
                    the position that certain Chinese characters on the tombstone which Mdm Wong
                    said were of her name were not inscribed on the tombstone at all, contrary to
                    what was shown in the photograph.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    For instance, the 1st defendant
                        said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_108" id="Ftn_108_1"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    When the 1st and 3rd defendants were
                    alleging that the Chinese characters which Mdm Wong was relying on did not in
                    fact appear on the tombstone although these characters appear in the photograph
                    of the tombstone, they were in effect saying that the photograph had been
                    doctored. This was contrary to their earlier acceptance of the authenticity of
                    the photograph. I was of the view that it was not open to them to allege that
                    the Chinese characters in question were non-existent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Indeed, counsel for the Defendants did not
                    question Mdm Wong about the photograph. His reason was a technical one, that is,
                    that although Mdm Wong had exhibited the photograph in her supplementary AEIC,
                    that AEIC did not specifically assert that the Chinese characters in question
                    were characters of Mdm Wong’s name. Technically, the Defendants’
                    counsel was correct about the absence of such a specific assertion. I add that
                    this was probably due to an inadvertent omission by Mdm Wong’s solicitors
                    because the very purpose of exhibiting the photograph was obvious. That is why
                    initially the Defendants were challenging its authenticity only to accept the
                    authenticity on the fourth day of trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In my view, the real reason why counsel for
                    the Defendants did not ask Mdm Wong any question about the photograph was that
                    more damage was likely to be done to the Defendants’ case if Mdm Wong was
                    asked about the photograph.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In any event, the Defendants’ counsel
                    did not challenge Mdm Wong about the authenticity of the photograph and, indeed,
                    he could not as the Defendants had by then accepted its
                authenticity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    Furthermore, when the 8th defendant’s
                    attention was drawn to the photograph, he did not assert that the Chinese
                    characters in question were non-existent. Indeed, he accepted that they were
                    characters of Mdm Wong’s name. As stated above, he himself regarded Mdm
                    Wong as Mr Tan’s wife even though he continued to align himself with the
                    position of the rest of the Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    I add that the suggestion that Mdm Wong had
                    doctored or would use a doctored photograph was shocking. While she was not a
                    satisfactory witness, there was nothing to suggest that she would commit fraud.
                    Those defendants who suggested that the photograph had been doctored were
                    themselves giving false evidence. In my view, the Chinese characters did appear
                    on the tombstone and they did appear right from the time the tombstone was first
                    erected. I will say more later about the time the tombstone was first
                    erected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    However, the 1st and 3rd defendants also
                    asserted that of the three Chinese characters which were supposed to be of Mdm
                    Wong’s name, the third one did not reflect Mdm Wong’s name. I need
                    not go into details about their explanation on the meaning of the third
                    character for the reasons stated below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    The inscriptions on Mdm Phua’s
                    tombstone identified various persons as her daughters-in-law. The Chinese
                    character for daughter-in-law was inscribed on the tombstone and four names were
                    inscribed under that character. There was no dispute about the Chinese
                    characters for three of the persons. These characters referred to Mdm Owyang,
                    Mdm Du and the wife of another son of Mdm Phua. The contentious point was
                    whether the characters of a fourth name were characters of Mdm Wong’s
                    name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Although the 1st and 3rd defendants
                    suggested that the third character of the Chinese characters in question did not
                    refer to Mdm Wong, there was also some discrepancy in the Chinese characters of
                    the name of their own mother, Mdm Du on the tombstone. The Chinese characters of
                    Mdm Du’s name on the tombstone were not the same as those of her name as
                    stated in an obituary for Mr Tan many years later when he passed away. This
                    illustrated to me that different Chinese characters may have been used in the
                    past to identify Mdm Wong and Mdm Du.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    Furthermore, it will be re-called that the
                    8th defendant did not assert that the Chinese characters in question were not of
                    Mdm Wong’s name when his attention was drawn to the photograph during
                    cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Importantly, if the Chinese characters in
                    question did not refer to Mdm Wong, who then did they refer to? Who was the
                    fourth daughter-in-law of Mdm Phua, if it was not Mdm Wong? Neither the 1st nor
                    the 3rd defendant identified any other person. All they did was to deny that the
                    Chinese characters in question were of Mdm Wong’s name.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 7th defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    As mentioned earlier, the 7th defendant gave
                    evidence that after he paid for the niches, he returned to Mdm Wong’s
                    Tiong Bahru Flat and handed the receipt and a copy of the application form to Mr
                    Tan. However, it was the 1st defendant’s evidence that the 7th defendant
                    gave him a photocopy of the niche application form after Mr Tan’s death so
                    that they could store Mr Tan’s urn at <em>Kwong Wei Siew
                        Peck San Theng</em>. Yet, the 7th defendant testified that he did not
                    retain any copy of the niche application form and the last he had seen the form
                    was when he handed the form and the receipt to Mr Tan in 1995.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_110" id="Ftn_110_1"><sup>[note: 110]</sup></a></span> The 1st and 7th defendant had contradicted one
                    another.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    As regards the 7th defendant’s
                    evidence that Mr Tan would never have arranged for his urn to be placed in a
                    Cantonese columbarium as he was Hokkien, the 7th defendant was suggesting that
                    Mdm Wong had manoeuvred the situation as by then both Mdm Owyang and Mdm Du had
                    passed away. The suggestion was that she had unduly influenced Mr Tan to place
                    not only his urn but those of Mdm Phua, Mdm Owyang and Mdm Wong at this
                    Cantonese columbarium. However, eventually the 7th defendant retreated from this
                    suggestion. There was no evidence that Mr Tan had ever succumbed to any undue
                    influence from any of his wives. In any event, according to the 1st defendant,
                    Mr Tan’s urn of ashes was in fact eventually placed by the family in
                        <em>Kwong Wei Siew Peck San Theng</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_111" id="Ftn_111_1"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span> In my view, this was done because the
                    Defendants knew that that was his genuine wish.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tan Ah Tong and Tan Ah Leng </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    Tan Ah Tong’s evidence was important
                    to the Defendants’ case in two aspects: first, to explain why Mdm Wong was
                    listed as one of Mr Tan’s wives in Mr Tan’s obituary; and secondly,
                    he claimed to have witnessed Mdm Du’s Chinese customary marriage with Mr
                    Tan in 1942.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    In his AEIC, Tan Ah Tong said that he was
                    asked by the 1st defendant to help write down the names of the relatives and
                    next-of-kin for the obituary because he was familiar with the Chinese characters
                    of the names in the family. Tan Ah Tong stated that, as he was writing out the
                    names, Mdm Wong asked the newspaper representative to write down her name as one
                    of Mr Tan’s wives and she also requested Sock Fong’s name to be
                    included as one of Mr Tan’s children.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_112" id="Ftn_112_1"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span></p>

                    elaborated that there was nothing wrong in allowing Mdm Wong to be named as a

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    As regards Mdm Du’s Chinese customary
                    marriage with Mr Tan, Tan Ah Tong stated during cross-examination that the
                    Chinese customary marriage between Mdm Du and Mr Tan in 1942 happened before the
                    2nd defendant was born (in May 1942). Yet, he could not tell that Mdm Du was
                    heavily pregnant at the time of the alleged marriage. His answers to that line
                    of questions were confused and incoherent.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_114" id="Ftn_114_1"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span>
                    More importantly, Tan Ah Tong was born in 1934.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_115" id="Ftn_115_1"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> He was at the time of the
                    alleged wedding, merely eight years old. It was doubtful that he could remember
                    a wedding dinner between Mdm Du and Mr Tan and that it was in 1942 unless he had
                    some special reason for remembering the occasion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    As for Tan Ah Leng, he gave evidence that he
                    was, at the material time, living along the same row of houses and only a few
                    doors away from 481 Silat Road. He deposed that there was no wedding dinner or
                    celebration (between Mdm Wong and Mr Tan) held at 481 Silat Road in
                        1957.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_116" id="Ftn_116_1"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span> However, during
                    cross-examination, he stated that he moved to a location near 481 Silat Road
                    when he was 21 or 22 years old. As Tan Ah Leng was born in 1943, the year he
                    moved would be 1964 or 1965. Therefore, he would not have been staying near 481
                    Silat Road in 1957 and he would not have personal knowledge whether there was a
                    wedding dinner at those premises in 1957.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 8th defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    As for the 8th defendant, I have mentioned
                    that he had admitted that he regarded Mdm Wong as Mr Tan’s wife even
                    though his formal position was aligned with that of the rest of the
                    Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    After being posed questions on the
                    photograph of Mdm Phua’s tombstone, the 8th defendant accepted that Mdm
                    Wong’s name was inscribed as a daughter-in-law of Mdm Phua. Similarly,
                    when he was asked questions about the niche application form, the 8th defendant
                    agreed that Mr Tan had bought the niche for Mdm Wong and that as Mr Tan had
                    accepted Mdm Wong as his wife, the 8th defendant would also accept her as Mr
                    Tan’s wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_117" id="Ftn_117_1"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    I found the 8th defendant to be a reluctant
                    witness who was torn between his loyalties to the rest of the Defendants and his
                    affection for Mdm Wong who had helped to take care of his children. However,
                    when the documentary evidence was placed before him, he was truthful in his
                    answers.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on the material witnesses and their evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    Given that all the key events of this case
                    occurred more than 50 years ago and given the historical animosity (in
                    particular, between Mdm Du and Mdm Wong) which became evident at trial, it is
                    not surprising that the witnesses for the two camps gave widely diverging
                    accounts of these events as well as on the point whether Mdm Wong had been
                    accepted as Mr Tan’s wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    However, the evidence of the following
                    tilted in favour of Mdm Wong’s case on her status issue:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_a"></a>(a)     The 10th defendant who said that
                        Mdm Wong had been accepted as Mr Tan’s wife even though it was against
                        her financial interest to say so.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_b"></a>(b)     The 8th defendant who agreed that Mr Tan had accepted
                        Mdm Wong as his wife even though the 8th defendant’s formal position
                        was aligned with that of the other Defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_156-p2_c"></a>(c)     The 6th, 8th and 9th defendants who agreed that
                        they had served tea to Mdm Wong to mark their respective weddings and Mdm
                        Wong was seated next to Mr Tan and Mdm Du and Mdm Owyang in a row when this
                        was done . This suggested that Mdm Wong had a formal and respected status at
                        the same level as Mdm Du and Mdm Owyang. It was undisputed that Mdm Owyang
                        was a wife of Mr Tan and, as I shall elaborate later, Mdm Du was also his
                        wife. I add that the Defendants’ argument (see [86] above) that Mr Tan
                        was trying to keep his affair with Mdm Wong a secret was contrary to the
                        facts. He was open about his relationship with Mdm
                Wong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    In any event, there was other evidence some
                    of which had high probative value while others did not. Fortunately, for Mdm
                    Wong, the evidence which had high probative value supported her
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is Mdm Wong the lawful wife of Mr Tan?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Income Tax Notice of Assessment Forms</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    As mentioned above, the Defendants relied on
                    certain Income Tax Notices of Assessment for Mr Tan in which wife relief was
                    granted for some years but not for other years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    The Defendants submitted that as the
                    abovementioned Notices were records made by a public officer in discharge of
                    official duty and pursuant to s 37 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97)
                    (“EA”), these forms were therefore admissible on Mdm Wong’s
                    status issue. They further contended that these are public documents under s
                        76(<em>a</em>)(iii) of the EA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_118" id="Ftn_118_1"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    The Defendants might well be right to assert
                    that the Notices are public records or documents. However, such evidence was, in
                    my view, one or two steps removed from the issue before me. Income Tax Notices
                    of Assessment are issued to a tax payer from the relevant regulatory authority
                        <em>after</em> the tax payer has filed his Income Tax
                    return. The obvious questions which arose here were what Mr Tan was claiming
                    for. First, it was established during cross-examination that Mr Tan was
                    illiterate in the English language. His Income Tax return would have in all
                    likelihood been submitted in English as that was the working language. There was
                    no evidence as to who he instructed to prepare his returns or the instructions
                    he gave. There was no evidence as to why he was not given wife relief in later
                    years even though Mdm Wong was still alive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    I was of the view that the Notices were not
                    evidence against Mdm Wong’s contention that she was one of his
                    wives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The niche application form</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    I turn next to the niche application
                        form<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_119" id="Ftn_119_1"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span>. The parties’ respective accounts
                    have been set out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    It was unclear whether the 7th defendant
                    read the details on the application form which described Mdm Wong as mother of
                    the applicant, <em>ie</em>, the 7th defendant. He said that
                    he did not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    It was also unclear whether Mr Tan could
                    read Chinese and would have understood the Chinese contents. I will say more
                    about this later. Even if he could, it was unclear whether he read the details
                    on the application form when the 7th defendant handed the application form to
                    him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    However, the 1st defendant said he had
                    received a photocopy of the application form from the 7th defendant. It was
                    likely that the 1st defendant would have read the details on the form since he
                    had asked for a copy of it. He would have noticed that Mdm Wong was described as
                    mother of the applicant who was the 7th defendant. Yet, there was no evidence
                    that he had queried the description of Mdm Wong as mother of the 7th defendant.
                    This suggested that the 1st defendant knew that Mdm Wong had been accepted as
                    the wife of Mr Tan and hence he did not query why she was described as the 7th
                    defendant’s mother.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    Furthermore, there was the fact that Mr Tan
                    had instructed that four niches be acquired in the same columbarium for Mdm
                    Phua, Mdm Owyang, Mdm Wong and himself. In my view, it was unlikely that he
                    would have included Mdm Wong if he regarded her only as a mistress and not his
                    wife. The fact of Mdm Wong’s inclusion supported her contention that she
                    was his wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Obituary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    Another documentary piece of evidence was Mr
                    Tan’s obituary<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_120" id="Ftn_120_1"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> which listed Mdm Wong’s name as one of the
                    three wives of the late Mr Tan (along with both Mdm Du and Mdm Owyang). Mdm Wong
                    said that she had provided the Chinese characters of her name to the 7th
                    defendant at his request for insertion in the obituary. The 7th defendant denied
                    this. Tan Ah Tong said Mdm Wong herself provided her Chinese characters to the
                    newspaper representative. Notwithstanding the different versions, it was clear
                    that Tan Ah Tong did not object to the inclusion of Mdm Wong’s name in the
                    obituary as one of Mr Tan’s wives. I did not accept his reason that he did
                    not object because there was nothing wrong to allow it to be said that Mr Tan
                    had more wives. That was an illogical explanation which he gave out of
                    desperation. In my view, he did not object because he knew that Mdm Wong had
                    been accepted as one of Mr Tan’s wives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Furthermore, it was noteworthy that Tan Ah
                    Tong confirmed during cross-examination that after the obituary was published,
                    none of the Defendants objected to Mdm Wong being referred to as Mr Tan’s
                    wife in the obituary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_121" id="Ftn_121_1"><sup>[note: 121]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    Indeed, none of the Defendants suggested
                    that he or she was unaware of the contents of the obituary or that he or she had
                    queried or protested about the inclusion of Mdm Wong’s name as one of Mr
                    Tan’s wives. In my view, the reason was obvious. They all knew that Mr Tan
                    had accepted Mdm Wong as his wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Photograph of the tombstone</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    I have mentioned above that I accepted the
                    authenticity of the photograph of the tombstone of Mdm Phua and that Mdm Wong
                    was named on the tombstone as one of four daughters-in-law on the tombstone.
                    However, the question arose whether the inscriptions on the tombstone were
                    admissible in evidence to establish directly Mdm Wong’s relationship with
                    Mr Tan. Mdm Wong relied on s 32(1)(<em>e</em>) and
                        (<em>f</em>) of the EA to submit that the inscriptions
                    were admissible in evidence. I set out below s 32(1)(<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>):</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    I should mention that the previous s 32
                    was renumbered as s 32(1) in 2012. Some new sub-provisions were included
                    but s 32(1)(<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>) themselves are not new. However, the opening paragraph of the
                    previous s 32 was deleted and is no longer a requirement in order for
                        s 32(1)(<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>) to apply. I need not say any more about that requirement
                    since it is no longer applicable for s 32(1)(<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    I will deal with s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) first. The key question was whether tombstone
                    evidence is admissible under this provision only if it is used to prove a
                    relationship between persons who are both deceased or it is admissible to prove
                    a relationship between persons where only one of them is deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    Mdm Wong relied on English cases to submit
                    that the inscriptions on the tombstone were admissible under
                        s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) and s 32(1)(<em>e</em>) as well. However, those cases appeared to apply the common
                    law rules of evidence. Section 2(2) of the EA states that, “All rules of
                    evidence not contained in any written law, so far as such rules are inconsistent
                    with any of the provisions of this Act, are repealed”. Mdm Wong did not
                    elaborate as to how those English cases would apply in the light of
                    s 2(2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    Mdm Wong also relied on the Indian case of
                        <em>Hakam Singh (Dead) v Kehar Singh (Dead)</em>
                    Regular Second Appeal No 730 of 1981 (30 May 2009) (“<em>Hakam Singh</em>”) decided by the High Court of Punjab and
                    Haryana. In that case, the court said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… oral or unsigned statements cannot be summarily discarded and
                        may, in a given situation, be considered relevant, provided however, that
                        they fulfill the ingredients of “relevancy” set out under
                        Chapter-II of the Indian Evidence Act and in view of the facts of the
                        present case the ingredients of Sections 32(5), (6) and 50 of the evidence
                        Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    I did not think that the above passage
                    offered much assistance to Mdm Wong. It was not sufficient for Mdm Wong to
                    suggest that a statement may be admissible in certain circumstances even if the
                    maker of the statement is unknown. Mdm Wong still had to satisfy the
                    requirements of the relevant provision in the EA. The facts in <em>Hakam Singh</em> were quite different from those before me.
                    There was nothing in that case that suggested that inscriptions on a tombstone
                    could be admitted under s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) to
                    establish the relationship between Mr Tan and Mdm Wong when Mdm Wong was still
                    alive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    Mdm Wong also relied on the local case of
                        <em>Seow Beng Hay v Seow Soon Quee &amp; anor</em>
                    [1933] 1 MLJ 111 (“<em>Seow Beng Hay</em>”).
                    In that case, the plaintiff was trying to prove that he was the great-grandson
                    of Seow Im Swee on the basis that he was the grandson of Seow Swee Peng who was
                    the son of Seow Im Swee. The plaintiff relied on the tombstone of Seow Swee Peng
                    to establish that he was the grandson of this deceased person. The trial judge
                    was of the view that he was entitled to rely on the tombstone. The Court of
                    Appeal agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    The Court of Appeal referred to s 32(6)
                    of Ordinance No 53 (Evidence) which is the equivalent of s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) EA. The Court of Appeal observed at 112 that as Seow
                    Soon Teck, the plaintiff’s father, was dead, that provision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… would seem to govern the case and to allow the evidence to be
                        given. Even if it were not proved who erected the stone, the evidence would
                        still be admissible, for publicity, as it is said, supplies the defect of
                        proof who erected. (<em>Monkton v. Attorney
                            General</em> (1831) 39 English Reports, 350 at 357, and <em>Davis v. Lowndes</em> (1783), 134 English Reports 978 at
                        page 1002).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    I was of the view that perhaps the Court of
                    Appeal ought not to have relied on English cases for a similar reason as stated
                    above. There was in the Evidence Ordinance an equivalent of s 2(2) of the
                    EA which repealed all rules of evidence not contained in any written law.
                    Secondly the Court of Appeal appeared to assume that so long as one of the
                    persons (whose relationship was in question) had passed away that was sufficient
                    to trigger the provision in question. Apparently, there was no argument that the
                    provision would apply only if both persons had passed away. On the facts in that
                    case, it may be that in any event, it was not necessary for the plaintiff there
                    to use that provision to establish his relationship with his grandfather but to
                    use it to establish the relationship between his grandfather and his father,
                    both of whom were deceased, and then to establish his own relationship with his
                    father from other evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    Therefore, I was of the view that <em>Seow Beng Hay</em> did not assist Mdm Wong to rely on
                        s 32(1)(<em>f</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    Mdm Wong also relied on <em>Wong Kai Woon alias Wong Kai Boon and another v Wong Kong Hom alias Ng Kong
                        Hom and others</em> [2000] SGHC 176 (“<em>Wong
                        Kai Woon</em>”). She submitted that Chan Seng Onn JC (as he
                    then was) had relied on various evidence, including the inscription on a
                    tombstone which was admitted under s 32(<em>f</em>) of
                    the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), to conclude that a claimant was a lawful
                    grandson of a testator Wong Yoon Fee and thus entitled to a share of the
                    testator’s estate. Section 32(<em>f</em>) is the
                    predecessor of s 32(1)(<em>f</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    In <em>Wong Kai
                        Boon</em>, the testator had several sons. Chan JC had concluded in an
                    earlier decision that all the lawful natural sons of the testator’s ten
                    sons and an adopted son would acquire an interest in the residency estate of the
                    testator. One of the biological sons of the testator was Wong Khin Yong
                    (“Khin Yong”). He had married a wife in Singapore. A question
                    arose as to whether he married another woman, Liao, in China with whom he had a
                    son Huang Kaiyuan (“Kaiyuan”). Both Kaiyuan and Liao had died.
                    Claims were filed on behalf of the estate of Kaiyuan and Liao by Huang Luexian
                    (“Luexian”) who claimed to be an adopted grandson of Khin Yong.
                    Luexian relied on inscriptions of a tombstone of the testator in
                China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    At [141], Chan JC said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Both Kaiyuan and Luexian’s names were inscribed on the tombstone as
                        the testator’s grandson and great-grandson respectively. Again, these
                        inscriptions are admissible under S 32 (f) of the Evidence Act as
                        evidence to prove a family relationship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    It will be remembered that the testator and
                    Kaiyuan had both already passed away by the time of the trial. Therefore the
                    fact that Chan JC relied on s 32(<em>f</em>) did not
                    assist Mdm Wong who was still living at the time of the trial before me.
                    However, Luexian was still alive at the time of the trial before Chan JC. It
                    seemed to me that, like the Court of Appeal in <em>Seow Beng
                        Hay</em>, Chan JC had assumed that s 32(<em>f</em>) was applicable for Luexian too so long as the testator had
                    passed away. Again, apparently, there was no argument that the provision would
                    apply only if both the testator and Luexian had passed away. Luexian should
                    still have to establish that he was an adopted grandson of Liao and of Khin
                    Yong. Indeed, Chan JC did not declare Luexian’s alleged adoption to be
                    valid under the laws of China as it was not an issue before him. Therefore his
                    remarks in [141] of his judgment about Luexian being the testator’s
                    great-grandson from the inscription on the testator’s tombstone was at
                    best <em>obiter dictum</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    Therefore, I was of the view that <em>Wong Kai Boon</em> also did not assist Mdm Wong on the
                    application of s 32(1)(<em>f</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    A passage from the leading text of <em>Sir John Woodroffe &amp; Syed Amir Ali’s Law of
                        Evidence</em> vol 2 (V Kesava Rao ed) (LexisNexis Butterworths Wadhwa
                    Nagpur, 18th Ed, 2009) (“<em>Woodroffe &amp; Amir
                        Ali</em>”) at pp 2087–2088 on the equivalent provision in
                    the Indian Evidence Act is instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The statement declared relevant by cl 5 is a statement relating
                        to the existence of any relationship between persons living or dead, as to
                        whose relationship the person making the statement had special means of
                        knowledge such as the statement of deceased relatives, servants and
                        dependents of the family. <em>The statement mentioned in cl 6

                            deceased persons only. The last clause does not embrace the case of a
                            statement of relationship between a deceased person and a living
                            person</em>. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    The Defendants relied on similar passages

                    gen ed) (Butterworths Asia, 1997 Issue) and Jeffrey Pinsler, <em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em> (LexisNexis, 4th Ed,
                        2013).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_122" id="Ftn_122_1"><sup>[note: 122]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    The Defendants also cited Tan Lee Meng
                    J’s decision in <em>Lim Weipin and another v Lim Boh Chuan
                        and others</em> [2010] 3 SLR 423 (“<em>Lim
                        Weipin</em>”). In that case, the plaintiff relied on the
                    inscriptions on the deceased’s mother’s tombstone to prove that the
                    plaintiff was the deceased’s adopted son. It is pertinent to set out the
                    relevant paragraphs of that decision:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">54    As for LHC’s mother’s tombstone
                            (“the tombstone”) in China, LW claims that the fact that
                            his name appears on the tombstone shows that he is related to LHC. What
                            is engraved on a tombstone depends on the instructions given to the
                            engraver by the person who ordered its erection. LW stated in his AEIC
                            at para 29 that he was “solely in charge” of the erection
                            of the tombstone. If this is so, there is nothing to stop him from
                            instructing the engraver to add his name onto the tombstone. As such,
                            the fact that his name is found on the tombstone cannot, without more,
                            prove that he is LHC’s adopted son.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">55    In the plaintiff’s closing submissions,
                            reliance was placed on s 32(<em>f</em>) of the EA
                            for the admission of the inscriptions on the tombstone as evidence. The
                            reliance on s 32(<em>f</em>) of the EA is misplaced
                            for the simple reason that it concerns statements regarding the
                            “relationship by blood marriage or adoption <em>between persons deceased</em>”. As LW is claiming that
                            he is related to the late LHC, s 32(<em>f</em>) of
                            the EA is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The above passage did imply that the provision was available
                        only when both persons were deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_188"></a>188    In my view, the literal reading of
                        s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) suggests that it applies to
                    establish a relationship when the relationship is of persons who are both
                    deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_189"></a>189    However, it did not appear logical to me to
                    restrict the application of s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) to
                    such a situation. While one may argue that as Mdm Wong is alive she should be in
                    the position to give the best evidence about her relationship with Mr Tan, it
                    does not follow that a person who is alive will necessarily give the best
                    evidence. For example, through old age and the lapse of time, a plaintiff may
                    not be able to recollect the evidence. Secondly, what if the plaintiff were so
                    ill that she was not able to give evidence? It seems incongruous that if she
                    were very ill and not able to give evidence, she would still not be able to rely
                    on s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) because she is still alive but
                    if she had passed away, her estate could rely on s 32(1)(<em>f</em>). On another example, it also seems incongruous that if she
                    had passed away before she gave evidence, her estate could arguably rely on
                        s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) but not if she passed away
                    after the trial ended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_190"></a>190    The above brief discussion suggests that
                        s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) ought not to be so restricted.
                    The evidence should be admissible leaving the court to decide what weight to
                    give it. If it is not admissible in the first place, then the evidence is taken
                    out of the court’s hands and the court has no discretion whether to give
                    any weight to it. Ironically, the tombstone evidence might be the best evidence
                    which would have been put out of the reach of the court if it were
                    inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_191"></a>191    Nevertheless, it did appear to me that the
                    reference to “deceased persons” was not an accident of drafting
                    and that the provision is restricted in the manner discussed. Section
                        32(1)(<em>f</em>) is an exception to the hearsay rule
                    and the concern appears to have been to restrict rather than to expand the
                    exception.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_192"></a>192    That does not mean that a living person can
                    never avail himself of s 32(1)(<em>f</em>). A living
                    person may use the provision to establish a relationship between, say, his
                    grandfather and his father, if both are deceased, and then use other evidence to
                    establish his own relationship with his father to show that he is in fact the
                    grandson of the grandfather.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_193"></a>193    Accordingly, the inscriptions on Mdm
                    Phua’s tombstone were not admissible under s 32(1)(<em>f</em>). However, as the restrictive scope may result in injustice,
                    this provision, which was not amended in the recent 2012 amendments, should be
                    reviewed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_194"></a>194    I will now deal with s 32(1)(<em>e</em>). Under that provision, the person making the
                    statement must have had special means of knowledge on the relationship in
                    question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_195"></a>195    In <em>Hakam
                    Singh</em>, the court was of the view that the Indian equivalent of
                        s 32(1)(<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>), as well as s 52 of the EA which I will come to later,
                    were all applicable. However, as I stated above, the facts in that case were
                    quite different from those before me. In that case, one of the parties wanted to
                    rely on an unsigned document, Exhibit D-14, which contained a pedigree table to
                    establish a certain relationship. That document was appended with a signed list
                    of documents, Exhibit D-10, which was filed in an earlier suit by identifiable
                    persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_196"></a>196    In the case before me, the identity of the
                    engraver of the tombstone was unknown. Neither was the identity of the person
                    who gave instructions to the engraver known. Mdm Wong relied on s 32(2) of
                    the EA which states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (<em>a</em>),
                            (<em>c</em>), (<em>d</em>),
                            (<em>e</em>), (<em>f</em>),
                            (<em>g</em>), (<em>h</em>),
                            (<em>i</em>) or (<em>j</em>)
                        of subsection (1), where a person makes an oral statement to or in the
                        hearing of another person who, at the request of the maker of the statement,
                        puts it (or the substance of it) into writing at the time or reasonably soon
                        afterwards, thereby producing a corresponding statement in a document, the
                        statement in the document shall be treated for the purposes of those
                        paragraphs as the statement of the maker of the oral statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_197"></a>197    In my view, s 32(2) did not assist Mdm
                    Wong because, as stated above, the identity of the person who gave the
                    instructions to the engraver was not known. Mdm Wong was trying to establish
                    that the person who gave the instructions to the engraver would have been a
                    person who had special means of knowledge within the meaning of
                        s 32(1)(<em>e</em>). However, the problem for Mdm
                    Wong was that Mdm Wong was assuming or wanted the court to assume that such a
                    person was a relative of Mdm Phua or Mdm Phua’s family who was close
                    enough to qualify as a person who had special means of knowledge. I could not
                    assume that. The person who had given instructions to the engraver could have
                    been a friend of a friend of the family and it was not known how that person
                    came to acquire the information he was giving to the engraver. Furthermore, if
                    such an assumption could be made readily then, s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) would be unnecessary in so far as the reference to a
                    statement on a tombstone is concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_198"></a>198    Therefore, in my view,
                        s 32(1)(<em>e</em>) of the EA did not assist Mdm
                    Wong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_199"></a>199    I come now to a third provision, <em>ie</em>, s 52 of the EA, which Mdm Wong omitted to rely
                    on initially. Section 52 states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Opinion on relationship when
                            relevant</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>52.</b>—(1) When the court has to form an
                        opinion as to the relationship of one person to another, the opinion
                        expressed by conduct as to the existence of such relationship of any person
                        who as a member of the family or otherwise has special means of knowledge on
                        the subject is a relevant fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Such opinion shall not be sufficient to prove a marriage in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that they were usually received and treated by their friends as

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(<em>b</em>) The question is whether <em>A</em> was a legitimate son of <em>B</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fact that <em>A</em> was always treated as such

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_200"></a>200    There was a minor amendment to s 52(2) of
                    the EA made in 2008. As part of the related and consequential amendments to the
                    Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), the reference to s 498 of the Penal Code was
                    deleted. For present purposes, the amendment in 2008 is
                immaterial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_201"></a>201    Section 52(1) of the EA is similar to
                    s 50 of the Indian Evidence Act (Act No 1 of 1872).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_202"></a>202    The requirements of s 50 of the Indian
                    Evidence Act are set out in <em>Woodroffe &amp; Amir
                        Ali</em> at p 2774:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The essential requirements of s 50 are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) there must be a case where the court has to form an opinion as to
                            the relationship of one person to another;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) in such a case, the opinion expressed by conduct is a relevant
                            fact; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) the person whose opinion expressed by conduct is relevant must be
                            a member of the family or otherwise he must have special means of
                            knowledge of the particular subject of relationship[. W]here none of the
                            witnesses examined is a member of the family nor has any special means
                            of knowledge on the particular subject of relationship, the testimony of
                            such witnesses does not fall within the ambit of s 50, and the court
                            cannot form an opinion as to the relationship on the testimony of such
                            witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the opinion of relationship is expressed by conduct, the belief or
                        conviction must manifest itself in conduct or outward behaviour, which
                        indicates existence of belief or opinion. Where the opinion is based on
                        hearsay and not on any belief or conviction, it is not admissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_203"></a>203    The learned authors also noted at p
                    2771:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Section 50 does not obviously control s 32(5), which operates in its own
                        field. Thus, if a piece of evidence is admissible under s 32(5), the same
                        need not be rendered admissible by s 50 also.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_204"></a>204    In other words, in the Singapore context, s
                        32(1)(<em>e</em>) and s 52 of the EA are mutually
                    exclusive and are independent of each other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_205"></a>205    I should mention that evidence of the
                    conduct of relatives was referred to in <em>Hakam
                        Singh</em>, <em>Seow Beng Hay</em> and <em>Wong Kai Woon</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_206"></a>206    As mentioned above, the obituary of Mr Tan
                    was already evidence that Mdm Wong was regarded as Mr Tan’s wife. The
                    inscriptions on the tombstone were more important evidence, if admissible,
                    because they were close to the cut-off date in the Women’s Charter. As
                    stated above, the inscriptions were not admissible in evidence directly under
                        s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) or (<em>e</em>) to establish Mdm Wong’s relationship with Mr Tan.
                    However, the conduct of Mr Tan and Mr Tan’s family in response to the
                    inscriptions on the tombstone could be admissible on the question of her
                    relationship with Mr Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_207"></a>207    There was evidence that Mr Tan and members
                    of his family went to pay their respects to Mdm Phua by visiting her grave from
                    time to time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_208"></a>208    Unfortunately for Mdm Wong, her counsel did
                    not focus on the question whether Mr Tan could read the Chinese inscriptions on
                    the tombstone. Hence, the evidence as to whether Mr Tan could read the Chinese
                    inscriptions was unclear. For example, the Defendants said that Mr Tan was
                    illiterate but did not elaborate as to what this meant. Mdm Wong herself did not
                    say explicitly that Mr Tan could read the Chinese inscriptions on the tombstone.
                    In the light of this omission, her counsel drew my attention to a photograph in
                    which Mr Tan was shown reading a newspaper in the Chinese language. However,
                    para 39 of Mdm Wong’s AEIC said that when Sock Fong was still schooling,
                    Sock Fong would read the Chinese newspapers to Mr Tan after she came back home.
                    This could mean that she did so because Mr Tan could not read Chinese. Indeed,
                    Sock Fong said in cross-examination that when she came back from school, she
                    read the Chinese newspapers to Mr Tan because he wanted to know about the
                    happenings and “he doesn’t write or read”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_123" id="Ftn_123_1"><sup>[note: 123]</sup></a></span>
                    This contradicted counsel’s argument that Mr Tan could read Chinese.
                    Perhaps he could not read Chinese in his earlier years and subsequently he
                    learned to do so. However, as mentioned above, the evidence was not clear and
                    the burden was on Mdm Wong to establish that he could read Chinese at some point
                    of time and that he could read the Chinese inscriptions on the tombstone before
                    the grave was exhumed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_209"></a>209    Fortunately for Mdm Wong, there was evidence
                    that some of the Defendants could read the inscriptions on the tombstone when
                    they went to pay their respects to Mdm Phua.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_210"></a>210    The main witness for the Defendants was the
                    1st defendant. He confirmed that he had gone to Mdm Phua’s grave to pay
                    his respects to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_124" id="Ftn_124_1"><sup>[note: 124]</sup></a></span> So did the 3rd defendant.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_125" id="Ftn_125_1"><sup>[note: 125]</sup></a></span> It was clear
                    from their evidence that both of them could read Chinese and the inscriptions on
                    the tombstone. It will be re-called that they had said, firstly, that the
                    Chinese characters in question did not appear on the tombstone and, secondly,
                    that those characters were not of Mdm Wong’s name. I concluded that those
                    characters did appear on the tombstone and they were of Mdm Wong’s
                    name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_211"></a>211    It was clear to me that the 1st and 3rd
                    defendants had read the Chinese characters in question and knew that Mdm Wong
                    was described on the tombstone as one of the four daughters-in-law of Mdm Phua.
                    They must have known that Mdm Wong was described as a daughter-in-law because
                    she had been accepted as the wife of Mr Tan. If indeed they believed that Mdm
                    Wong had not been accepted as Mr Tan’s wife, they would surely have told
                    their own mother about the discrepancy. There is no evidence that they ever did
                    or that they or anyone else ever queried the inscriptions on the
                    tombstone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_212"></a>212    As for the 8th defendant, he too said that
                    he had been to Mdm Phua’s grave to pay his respects to her.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_126" id="Ftn_126_1"><sup>[note: 126]</sup></a></span> However, as
                    stated above, he did not take the same tack as the 1st and 3rd defendants. He
                    did not deny that the Chinese characters in question appeared on the tombstone.
                    Neither did he suggest that they were not of Mdm Wong’s name. On the
                    contrary, he accepted their existence on the tombstone and that she had been
                    described as Mdm Phua’s daughter-in-law. He accepted that Mr Tan had
                    regarded Mdm Wong as his wife.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_127" id="Ftn_127_1"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_213"></a>213    It was clear to me that at least some
                    children of Mdm Du knew of the inscriptions on the tombstone and that they did
                    not protest or query about Mdm Wong being described as Mdm Phua’s
                    daughter-in-law. Even if it could be said that these children were afraid to ask
                    Mr Tan why Mdm Wong was described as Mdm Phua’s daughter-in-law, they
                    would surely have asked or informed their own mother about the inscriptions when
                    she was alive if she was unaware about them and if they genuinely believed that
                    Mdm Wong was not married to Mr Tan. There was no evidence that they had done so
                    or about Mdm Du’s reaction on the inscriptions. In my view the absence of
                    such evidence was because they had accepted that Mdm Wong was Mr Tan’s
                    wife. The conduct of these children expressed an opinion that Mr Tan and Mdm
                    Wong were husband and wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_214"></a>214    Most of the Defendants’ submissions on
                    s 52 of the EA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_128" id="Ftn_128_1"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span>
                    focused on the conduct of Mr Tan or the parties on other aspects which were
                    disputed or equivocal rather than the conduct of the parties <em>vis-à-vis</em> Mdm Phua’s tombstone or Mr Tan’s obituary.
                    For example, the Defendants asserted that Mr Tan did not provide any maintenance
                    to Mdm Wong prior to 1971.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_215"></a>215    I was of the view that the parties’
                    conduct in respect of Mdm Phua’s tombstone and Mr Tan’s obituary
                    carried more weight for reasons which I have stated above and which I elaborate
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_216"></a>216    Mr Tan’s obituary spoke for itself.
                    Mdm Wong was described as a wife of Mr Tan. If the Defendants did not question
                    or object to such a description without a satisfactory explanation, then their
                    silence spoke volumes. Likewise in respect of the inscriptions on Mdm
                    Phua’s tombstone, once I concluded that the Chinese characters in question
                    did exist and were of Mdm Wong’s name and that at least some of the
                    Defendants were aware of the same, the Defendants’ silence would suggest
                    their belief that their father accepted Mdm Wong as his wife. Indeed the
                    inscriptions on the tombstone were even more important than the obituary because
                    of the close proximity between the time the tombstone was erected and the
                    cut-off date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_217"></a>217    Mdm Phua died on 23 October 1962 of the
                    lunar calendar year. The 1st defendant said that the tombstone was built in
                    1963. While it was possible that Mdm Wong had been accepted as Mr Tan’s
                    wife after the cut-off date (of 15 September 1961) but before Mdm
                    Phua’s death, no one suggested that this was indeed the case on the facts.
                    I was of the view that given the close timing, it was more likely that Mdm Wong
                    had been accepted as Mr Tan’s wife before the cut-off date. She was
                    accepted as such because the family knew that he had intended to and did take
                    her as his wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion on Mdm Wong’s status issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_218"></a>218    After considering all the evidence in
                    totality, I found, on a balance of probabilities, that Mdm Wong is Mr
                    Tan’s lawful wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was Mdm Du the lawful wife of Mr Tan?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Wong’s concessions during cross-examination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_219"></a>219    Mdm Wong made several telling concessions
                    during cross-examination in respect of Mdm Du’s status
                issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_220"></a>220    As regards the Defendants’ contention
                    that Mr Tan was known to everyone to be the husband of the late Mdm Du, Mdm Wong
                    agreed with this contention during cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_129" id="Ftn_129_1"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_221"></a>221    I should also mention that the 6th to 9th
                    defendants and the 10th defendant had never denied that Mdm Du was one of Mr
                    Tan’s wives.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_222"></a>222    Mdm Wong also accepted that Mdm Du was known
                    to all of Mr Tan’s friends and associates as Mr Tan’s wife when she
                    was referred to the condolences and obituaries published in the newspapers when
                    Mdm Du passed away in 1988.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_130" id="Ftn_130_1"><sup>[note: 130]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_223"></a>223    In my view, another compelling piece of
                    evidence in favour of the 1st to 5th defendant’s case in respect of Mdm
                    Du’s status issue was contained in a letter dated 16 May 2012 from Mdm
                    Wong’s solicitors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_131" id="Ftn_131_1"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> The relevant paragraphs of
                    the said letter are reproduced as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2. Our clients disagree with your contention in paragraph 2 of the said
                        letter, where your client alleged that [Mdm Wong] was not married to [Mr
                        Tan] under any Chinese customary rites. …
                        <em>Amongst other rites, we are instructed that both [Mr Tan]
                            and [Mdm Wong] had served tea to [Mdm Phua]. More importantly, [Mdm
                            Phua] recognized [Mdm Wong] as one of the three wives of [Mr
                            Tan]</em>. In the circumstances, [Mdm Wong] is one of the lawful
                        wives of [Mr Tan].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3. <em>We are instructed that [Mdm Du] had gone through the
                            same Chinese customary rites with [Mr Tan]</em>. If your client
                        insists that [Mdm Wong] was not married to [Mr Tan] under any Chinese
                        customary rites, [Mdm Du’s] marriage to [Mr Tan] would similarly not
                        be recognised under the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353, 2009 Rev Ed). [The
                        1st to 5th defendants] would then not be recognised as legitimate children
                        of [Mr Tan], and would have no interest in [Mr Tan’s] estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_224"></a>224    The letter was clearly an acknowledgement by
                    Mdm Wong through her solicitors that Mdm Du was Mr Tan’s wife.
                    Furthermore, on the first day of trial, counsel for the Defendants asked Mdm
                    Wong during cross-examination who the other two wives of Mr Tan were. Mdm Wong
                        said:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_132" id="Ftn_132_1"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_227"></a>227    Apart from the documents already mentioned
                    above, the 1st to 5th defendants also relied on the following documents:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mdm Du’s Certificate of
                        Registration of Death;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_135" id="Ftn_135_1"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_b"></a>(b)     The letter dated 9 October 1992 purportedly from Mr Tan
                        to the Property Tax Branch, IRAS;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_136" id="Ftn_136_1"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_227-p2_c"></a>(c)     The same Income Tax Notice of
                        Assessment statements issued by IRAS to the late Mr Tan, referred to in
                        [100] above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_228"></a>228    The 1st to 5th defendants said that Mdm
                    Du’s Certificate of Registration of Death indicates her marital status as
                    “married”. They contended that the letter dated 9 October 1992
                    showed that Mdm Du was Mr Tan’s first wife and Mdm Owyang as his
                    second wife. They also relied on the Income Tax Notice of Assessment statements
                    mentioned above to show that Mdm Du was Mr Tan’s wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_229"></a>229    The above three sets of documents would
                    appear to be of low evidential value. For instance, Mdm Du’s Certificate
                    of Registration of Death did state that she was married but the information was
                    provided by the 1st defendant who did not have personal knowledge of her status.
                    As for the Income Tax Notice of Assessment statements, I have already given my
                    reasons in [160] above. The same reasons may well apply to the letter dated
                    9 October 1992 which was signed by Mr Tan to claim a concessionary rate of
                    property tax for 27 Blair Road on the basis that it was occupied by Mdm Du, his
                    first wife, and some of her children and grandchildren. The 1st defendant
                    admitted during cross-examination that he did not have any evidence that Mr Tan
                    understood that letter as he was illiterate in English.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_137" id="Ftn_137_1"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, although that letter
                    referred to Mdm Du as Mr Tan’s first wife, she had already passed away on
                    29 June 1988, more than four years before the date of that letter. The
                    accuracy of that letter was therefore questionable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_230"></a>230    In any event, the other evidence I have
                    referred to above was more than enough to establish that Mdm Du was married to
                    Mr Tan and that this was before the cut-off date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_231"></a>231    Finally, the tombstone evidence comes into
                    play again. It was not disputed that under the subject of daughters-in-law,
                    Chinese characters of Mdm Du’s name were also inscribed on Mdm
                    Phua’s tombstone. Unlike Mdm Wong, Mdm Du had already passed away by the
                    time of the trial. Therefore, s 32(1)(<em>f</em>) of
                    the EA would apply to admit the inscriptions on the tombstone as direct evidence
                    of the relationship between Mr Tan and Mdm Wong, both of whom were deceased
                    persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_232"></a>232    In addition, s 52 of the EA would apply
                    also in that there was no evidence of any query or objection to the description
                    of Mdm Du as Mdm Phua’s daughter-in-law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_233"></a>233    I would point out that the 1st to 5th
                    defendants did not rely on the tombstone inscriptions to establish Mdm
                    Du’s relationship with Mr Tan. That was unsurprising because they did not
                    want Mdm Wong to rely on the tombstone inscriptions in the first place.
                    Nevertheless, for the reasons stated above, I was of the view that I should take
                    into account such evidence in respect of their counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_234"></a>234    In the circumstances, I found, on a balance
                    of probabilities, that Mdm Du was Mr Tan’s lawful wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_235"></a>235    In conclusion, I allowed Mdm Wong’s
                    claim and declared that Mdm Wong is the lawful wife of Mr Tan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_236"></a>236    I also allowed the 1st to 5th
                    defendants’ counterclaim and declared that their mother, Mdm Du, was the
                    lawful wife of Mr Tan. I also declared that the 1st to 5th defendants are the
                    legitimate children of Mr Tan under the Intestate Succession Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_237"></a>237    Prayers (ii) and (iii) of Mdm Wong’s
                    claim (referred to at [14(b)] and [14(c)] above) were in respect of the grant of
                    letters of administration. Specifically, she wanted to be granted letters of
                    administration for the estate of Mr Tan and to be named as the sole
                    administrator. She also wanted a declaration that the 1st to 5th defendants have
                    no right to apply for a grant of letters of administration for Mr Tan’s
                    estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_238"></a>238    It was obvious to me that even though Mdm
                    Wong was declared to be the lawful wife of Mr Tan, she was not an appropriate
                    person to be appointed administrator because of her age and her capabilities. I
                    suggested to counsel for each side to be realistic about who should be the
                    administrator(s) and left it to them to try and resolve this amicably first.
                    Accordingly, I also did not think I should yet address the question whether the
                    1st to 5th defendants should be precluded from applying for a grant of letter of
                    administration for Mr Tan’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_239"></a>239    I granted Mdm Wong costs of her claim and
                    the 1st to 5th defendants their costs of their counterclaim. The former amount
                    was much more than the latter amount because most of the factual dispute was in
                    respect of Mdm Wong’s status issue.</p>
