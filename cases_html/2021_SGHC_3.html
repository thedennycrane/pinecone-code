They also found out that OEL had entered into a loan agreement which was secured by, among other things, a first legal mortgage over OEL’s leasehold property at 8 Aljunied Avenue 3, Singapore 389933 (the “Property”). Thus, the plaintiffs instructed WJ to request the defendants to execute a share pledge in respect of the OEL Shares in favour of the plaintiffs. This request was rejected. The plaintiffs further began to harbour doubts over the 1st defendant’s qualifications and capabilities. The plaintiffs eventually proceeded to issue letters of demand including two on 15 July 2020 and 4 August 2020 seeking, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the return of the OEL Shares.

</div> The plaintiffs would pay a further $1,656,110.72 to the 1st and 2nd defendants for use as cashflow for the benefit of the plaintiffs and/or OEL, subject to the plaintiffs’ instructions and consent. As part of the plan, WJ, together with the 1st and 2nd defendants, would be appointed to OEL’s key management positions and the plaintiffs themselves would be employed by OEL and/or its subsidiaries to assist with the development of the businesses of OEL and/or its subsidiaries. WJ had communicated the plan to the plaintiffs in late November 2019 and informed them that this was the 1st and 2nd defendants’ proposal. The plaintiffs agreed to the proposal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The defendants maintained that they had no knowledge of any alleged communications between the plaintiffs and WJ. They contended instead that WJ had coordinated and structured all arrangements with the plaintiffs. The 1st defendant had agreed in October 2019 for WJ to procure investors (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the plaintiffs) who were looking to invest for residency in Singapore to invest $7.7 million with her or her companies through “Investment Contracts”. In turn, through her companies or otherwise, WJ would lend the $7.7 million to EI (the “Loan Agreement”). The loan would be repaid after four years and WJ would be paid a commission or return on investment of $1 million. The OEL Shares were procured as investments by the defendants and WJ in their own personal capacities.

As for the purported Loan Agreement between WJ and/or her companies and EI, it would not be logical for WJ to extend such a sizeable loan in the absence of any written loan agreements, personal guarantees or evidence of such a loan. In relation to the alleged loan agreements between EI and the 1st to 3rd defendants, the loan agreements exhibited by the defendants did not indicate that they were for the purpose of purchasing the OEL Shares. As the defendants had used the $7.7 million from the plaintiffs to purchase the OEL Shares, there was also a serious issue to be tried in respect of whether a presumed resulting trust had arisen over the OEL Shares.

Even if they were under the mistaken impression that the sum of $7.7 million had been advanced as a loan to EI when the OEL Shares were procured, letters of demand were sent to the defendants demanding that they either return the OEL Shares or provide an undertaking not to dispose or dissipate the shares.

</div> The defendants argued that the plaintiffs had entered into “Investment Contracts” with WJ to procure employment passes with a view to obtaining permanent residency in Singapore, and had also submitted false educational certificates to the authorities. As the conduct of the plaintiffs and WJ was in contravention of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“EFMA”), the principle of stultification would operate to preclude the plaintiffs’ claims in trust or unjust enrichment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In response, the plaintiffs submitted that the defendants’ allegations that the “Investment Contracts” between the plaintiffs and WJ and/or her companies were tainted with illegality and/or were void were spurious.

Further, the defendants were not parties to the “Investment Contracts” and therefore had no standing to raise this defence. In any event, the court should not be resolving such conflicts of fact at this interlocutory stage.

Several invoices also stated that monies were being received on behalf of the plaintiffs to be transferred to EI, and several payment vouchers stated that monies had been transferred on the plaintiffs’ behalf.

</div>
</div>
</div> There were at least two other messages where reference was made to an “intermediary”, and in those messages, the “intermediary” appeared to be an entity that assisted with fund transfers (see [32(a)] and [32(b)] above). To compound the difficulty in relying on the message, it could arguably also have been wrongly translated. The context of the message which referred to taking “their money” could suggest that the “intermediaries” were the investors themselves who were the source of the funds, and not the conduit through which these funds flowed to EI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Further, if there were “Investment Contracts” between WJ and/or her companies and the plaintiffs that were entirely separate from the Loan Agreement as the defendants claimed, it would be illogical for WJ to seek to introduce the “intermediaries” or the investors to the 1st or 2nd defendants, or to provide them with a guarantee that involved the 1st or 2nd defendants. WJ’s statement that she would have “no obligations or responsibilities” in the future was also inconsistent with the plaintiffs having invested with WJ separately pursuant to “Investment Contracts”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I noted that there were anomalies and inconsistencies in both parties’ pleaded cases and the affidavit evidence. The fact that there was no written agreement setting out any of the purported investment arrangements that the plaintiffs had arranged through WJ with OEL was undoubtedly questionable. There were other matters which both the plaintiffs and defendants had not fully explained. For example, it was unclear why WJ appeared not to have told the plaintiffs that their funds were to be used for the immediate purpose of the defendants’ purchase of the OEL shares from Mr Hing. I elaborate on this observation further at [84] and [85] below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Existence of the purported Loan Agreement </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The defendants argued that there was evidence of the Loan Agreement between WJ and/or her companies and EI and that the monies were transferred from the former to EI. In support of their case, the defendants first referred to messages or transcripts of “WeChat” voice recordings where WJ made reference to returning the “investors” their monies after four years. According to the defendants, “investors” in the aforementioned messages referred to the plaintiffs, and the reference to four years was made because EI was due to return the loan amount to WJ and/or her companies after four years.

The agreement stated that HS International was an agent “in a position to refer potential clients/ customers” to EI.

Regardless of the 1st defendant’s attempts to distance himself from the contents of the agreement, I noted that the agreement was signed by him with the knowledge that it was backdated. It was accepted by both WJ and the 1st defendant that the document was created to provide an explanation to OCBC for the transfer of large sums of money and it was not clear why the contents in the agreement would have been fabricated. That said, it was also not entirely clear precisely what the parties meant when they explained that the letter was crafted only to “pacify” the bank.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Based on the documents adduced and the contemporaneous messages sent, there was some evidence that WJ had collaborated with the 1st and 2nd defendants and had not merely provided a loan to EI. Moreover, as the plaintiffs contended, WJ stood to gain nothing by disclaiming the existence of the purported loan agreement. On the totality of the evidence available at the present stage of the proceedings, I was satisfied that there was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence to show that $7.7 million was paid from the plaintiffs to EI. Disputed issues of fact such as whether the plaintiffs transferred monies to WJ and/or her companies pursuant to purported “Investment Contracts” and whether the monies were transferred to EI from WJ and/or her companies pursuant to the purported Loan Agreement were issues that should be determined at trial. At present, sufficient evidence had been adduced to attribute the transfer of $7.7 million to EI to the plaintiffs. Notwithstanding that the plaintiffs’ evidence may have revealed various gaps and deficiencies, the defendants were not forthcoming as to the true extent of their knowledge and involvement as well.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the defendants were aware of the source of the monies </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It was not disputed that the funds paid to EI were in turn used, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, to finance the defendants’ purchase of OEL shares from the then-controlling shareholder Mr Hing.

Notwithstanding that, it was uncontroversial that the plaintiffs’ role was primarily to inject funds into EI to enable the acquisition of Mr Hing’s shares. The defendants were therefore well aware of the source of the funds and what they were intended for. I was conscious that it was highly unusual that no written documentation existed setting out the plaintiffs’ alleged investment arrangement. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs’ claim that there was an investment seemed rather more plausible than an unsecured “interest-free loan” scenario (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, a loan from WJ to EI for the $7.7 million), also without any documentation whatsoever, as postulated by the defendants. On the available evidence, it would also not seem plausible that the plaintiffs would have agreed to entrust such substantial funds with WJ without any expectation of return on their investment, but only repayment of the money in four years’ time. At any rate, the defendants had neither offered any cogent reasons nor raised any concerns as to why the plaintiffs might have been prepared to extend an undocumented and unsecured interest-free loan of $7.7 million through WJ. The defendants were evidently happy to be on the receiving end of funds. On a related note, the plaintiffs had highlighted the 1st and 2nd defendants’ high monthly remuneration of $49,220 and $15,600 respectively. Their combined annual basic salary would be $777,840, while OEL was experiencing poor cashflow and had recorded revenue of only $180,000 for the financial year ending December 2019.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendants’ submissions on illegality </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Notwithstanding the defendants’ allegations pertaining to contravention of the EFMA, WJ and the plaintiffs had stopped short of directly addressing the issue of the Employment Pass (“EP”) applications for the plaintiffs and the provenance of the various distance learning college degrees.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The defendants had exhibited documents which they argued were the “Investment Contracts” entered into between the plaintiffs and WJ and/or her companies, through which the plaintiffs were investing for the purpose of obtaining residency in Singapore.

Given the emphasis on illegality in the defendants’ submissions, I queried whether the defendants had lodged any formal complaint with the authorities pertaining to the alleged contravention of the EFMA. I was informed that they had drafted a complaint but had yet to lodge it, ostensibly because they wished to conduct further investigations and checks. I found the defendants’ posture difficult to reconcile with their strenuous claims of illegality in the present case. A plausible explanation for their restraint might lie in the defendants’ consciousness that they could be found to be complicit or at least to have acquiesced; the defendants could not distance themselves completely from these matters since there was some objective evidence of their knowledge or involvement. The defendants were aware that in-principle approvals (“IPAs”) were obtained for the plaintiffs’ EP applications to work at OEL or AJJ Health Care Management Pte Ltd (“AJJ”), a subsidiary of OEL.

</div> Nevertheless, it could be discerned from the messages that there appeared to have been some involvement on the part of the 1st and 2nd defendants in the process of the EP applications. At the least, they knew that the applications were ongoing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The case law relied upon by the parties, <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>and <span class="font-italic">Baker</span>, sets out the present state of the law. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>considered but did not come to a definitive conclusion on whether the principle of stultification would apply to an independent cause of action in trust premised on the plaintiff’s property or title in situations where the underlying contract had been prohibited (<span class="font-italic">Ochroid Trading </span>at [161] and [168]; <span class="font-italic">Baker </span>at [274]). It would not be appropriate to determine at this interlocutory stage whether the underlying “Investment Contracts” (if they existed) were void and unenforceable by virtue of being prohibited by the EFMA or otherwise tainted with illegality, and whether allowing a claim in unjust enrichment or in trust would undermine the fundamental policy that rendered those contracts unenforceable. For present purposes, it was arguable that the submissions on illegality raised by the defendants were not too remote but sufficiently proximate to the plaintiffs’ allegations that there was an investment in OEL. But these were among the various issues of fact that were contested. They were not capable of being resolved at this stage in the proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Summary</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In my view, the plaintiffs’ pleaded causes of action premised on a presumed resulting trust or remedial constructive trust, or unjust enrichment in the alternative, were not plainly frivolous or vexatious. The defendants could not be said to be holding on to the shares on trust “for free” for the plaintiffs, since it was only on account of the plaintiffs’ injection of funds that the OEL share acquisition and the eventual appointments of the 1st defendant, 2nd defendant and WJ to OEL could materialise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 To sum up, the evidence appeared to disclose an investment plan which the defendants were aware of, and indeed had benefited from. No doubt there remained unanswered questions and facts in contention, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>over what the plaintiffs and defendants truly knew or intended, or what WJ had in fact communicated to them. But the disputed factual issues should be left to the trial judge to determine. I was persuaded that the plaintiffs had shown that there were serious questions to be tried in relation to their pleaded case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Adequacy of damages and balance of convenience </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Turning next to whether damages would be an adequate remedy, the plaintiffs submitted that damages would not be an adequate remedy as the plaintiffs had wanted to obtain a controlling stake in OEL. It would be impossible to quantify the monetary loss arising from the plaintiffs’ loss of the controlling stake in OEL, and the dilution of their shareholding would be irreversible.

First, the defendants had been unwilling to provide a letter of undertaking that they would not sell and/or dispose the OEL shares.

</div> Although the plaintiffs had stated that they were prepared to give an undertaking as to damages, such an undertaking was of little value as the plaintiffs were foreigners. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The 1st to 5th defendants have not denied, and indeed they <span class="font-italic">cannot </span>deny, that the OEL Shares were not purchased with their own money. I agreed with the plaintiffs that it is uncertain whether the defendants would have sufficient financial means to pay for damages. The evidence suggested that the plaintiffs’ payments were meant as investments through the acquisition of OEL shares (as structured by WJ) and not necessarily because they had wanted all along to secure a controlling stake in OEL. However, the plaintiffs had pleaded that the OEL shares were being held by the defendants on trust for them. If the injunction was not granted and the defendants were at liberty to dispose of the shares, it would render this cause of action nugatory and cause irreversible damage to the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For the same reason, the defendants’ shareholding should not be diluted by share placements or reduced by sale to third parties pending the resolution of the plaintiffs’ claim. The defendants could be adequately compensated in damages and the plaintiffs were ready to give an undertaking as to damages. Other than the fact that the plaintiffs were resident outside of jurisdiction, the defendants had not pointed to any cogent reason why the plaintiffs would not be in a financial position to compensate them if required. On the other hand, as the plaintiffs rightly pointed out, the 1st and 2nd defendants are Chinese citizens who could conceivably leave Singapore any time after liquidating the OEL Shares and dissipating their assets to defeat any potential judgment against them. In any event, if I have erred in my determination that the plaintiffs would not be adequately compensated by damages, the balance of convenience weighed in favour of granting the plaintiffs an interim injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I accepted the plaintiffs’ submission that there was evidence of a real risk of dissipation of the shares unless the injunction was granted to preserve the status quo ante. Two share placements had taken place in February and August 2020, and another further placement had been proposed in OEL’s October announcement. The OEL Shares had already been subjected to dilution and possible reduction in value; there was thus evidence of dissipation through fragmentation or dispersal of the shares through share placements. The sale price of the shares in the August placement was significantly lower than what was paid to Mr Hing for the OEL Shares, and there was evidence that the 1st and 2nd defendants were able to substantially influence the passing of resolutions (including for the issuance of shares) despite there being other shareholders in OEL. Share placements were also not the only fundraising options available to OEL as I further explain at [97] and [98] below. Moreover, the 1st to 5th defendants had refused to provide any undertaking not to sell and/or dispose of the OEL Shares, or even to confirm whether any of the shares had been sold, despite the objective evidence which the plaintiffs adduced of high trading volumes in the shares in OEL in July and August 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The evidence thus far indicated that the status quo ante should be preserved to prevent the defendants from further diluting the value of the OEL shares and/or from reneging on their implied undertaking to return the monies to the plaintiffs. There was a real risk of both events occurring. This was evident from the defendants’ steadfast denial of the plaintiffs’ involvement as financiers or, in a loose sense, “investors” in the acquisition of the OEL shares from Mr Hing, facilitating the takeover of Mr Hing’s majority stake in OEL.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 There was <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> evidence pointing strongly to the defendants being enabled to acquire the OEL shares only as a result of the plaintiffs’ injection of funds. The defendants claimed in the face of this evidence not to be aware of how the plaintiffs were involved, on the main premise that they did not know one another. They pointed instead to the funds ostensibly flowing from WJ or her companies. Viewing the totality of the evidence in perspective, the defendants’ denial appeared highly suspect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Accordingly, I granted an injunction to restrain the disposal of the OEL shares held by the defendants and reduction or dilution of the share value pending the trial of this action or further order, as sought by the plaintiffs. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Request for further arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Further arguments were subsequently requested by the defendants.

I allowed the request for further arguments only for the sixth and seventh arguments, relating to the scope of the injunction. I did not have the benefit of hearing full arguments on these areas from the parties during the hearing on 11 November 2020. As for the remaining heads and the additional argument in the letter dated 17 November, I saw no reason to accede to the request. Except for the third argument, substantially the same points had already been canvassed at the hearing before me on 11 November 2020.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The third argument was a responsive argument to a comment made in my oral remarks that WJ appeared not to have told the plaintiffs about the intended purchase of the OEL Shares <span class="font-italic">from Mr Hing</span> from the outset. I made this comment because the plaintiffs’ pleaded case omitted any specific reference to purchasing the shares <span class="font-italic">from Mr Hing</span>. I did note that in paragraph 31 of the 1st plaintiff’s first affidavit, he stated that he was informed about the purchase <span class="font-italic">from Mr Hing</span> by WJ, and WJ had affirmed this in her affidavit. However, this fact was not pleaded from the beginning and it would appear that there was presently no contemporaneous independent evidence to support the 1st plaintiff’s claim. This tied in to my observation (see [75] above) that it was not necessarily clear that the plaintiffs had intended to obtain a controlling stake in OEL by purchasing Mr Hing’s shares in OEL. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In putting forth their further arguments under the third argument, the defendants had missed out the reference to Mr Hing which I had made in my oral remarks, and hence misunderstood the context of my comment. The arguments the defendants sought to address did not affect how I would have decided in any case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In relation to the sixth argument, order 1(a) provided that the defendants would not sell or otherwise dispose of any shares in OEL held in their names pending trial or further order. The defendants submitted that the order should be limited only to the 197,545,000 ordinary shares in OEL purchased from Mr Hing, as the plaintiffs’ claim in resulting trust was limited only to those shares.

This would be prejudicial to the rights and/or interests of OEL and its near to 4,000 shareholders.

Since it was the defendants’ position that the 1st and 2nd defendants did not control OEL’s Board of Directors, the interim injunction would not impact the running of OEL’s day-to-day operations. It was also not logical that the only way OEL could raise funds was through share placements.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The defendants in turn argued that the disposal of the Property was the last fund-raising avenue for OEL and that all of OEL’s business decisions would be seen as linked to the 1st and/or 2nd defendants. The plaintiffs had also purportedly made baseless allegations to a “reputable local bank” that OEL had breached certain rules in obtaining a facility loan, causing the bank’s in-principle approval of the loan to be scuttled. As such, OEL was also unable to raise funds through secured loans, which led to it having no choice but to undertake the August placement at a discount to raise urgently needed funds for working capital and to fund its expansion into new business areas.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision on the sixth and seventh arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 It would appear to be incontrovertible that the defendants would not have been in any position to acquire the shares from Mr Hing without the plaintiffs’ funds of $7.7 million. From the available evidence, the defendants could not credibly deny knowledge of the plaintiffs’ involvement as “investors” for the purpose of acquiring the OEL shares. The subsequent private share placements in February and August 2020 which resulted in further allotment of shares and the defendants’ aggregate shareholding exceeding the OEL shares purchased from Mr Hing could not be viewed in isolation from their December 2019 acquisition. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 However, the plaintiffs’ primary objective was to obtain a declaration that the 1st to 5th defendants hold the OEL shares on trust for them, and an order that the OEL Shares be transferred to the plaintiffs or their nominees. On their own pleaded case, the plaintiffs essentially sought, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, either a transfer or return of the OEL Shares which were acquired or a return of their funds (the bulk of which were used for the purchase of the shares) in the alternative. The plaintiffs did not contend that the defendants were trustees in relation to the <span class="font-italic">funds</span> used for the purchase of the shares, but only in relation to the <span class="font-italic">shares</span>, the value of which may fluctuate according to market conditions. <span class="font-italic">Prima facie</span>, it was thus logical that the only shares which should be covered by the injunction were the OEL Shares which the plaintiffs claimed to be the subject of a potential resulting trust or remedial constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 It was also logical that the risk of the OEL shares being devalued would be higher if the OEL Shares were progressively diluted through share placements or issues. The plaintiffs pointed to indications that the share value had in fact already started to decline as OEL underwent two rounds of private placements in six months which increased the aggregate shareholdings. It was noteworthy however that in the February 2020 round of placements, the plaintiffs raised no objections to the share placements as the present dispute had not surfaced then. The plaintiffs would therefore reasonably have expected that private share placements and allotments which might result in consequential dilution of their shareholding and which were likely to affect share value could take place. Equally, the plaintiffs ought reasonably to have foreseen that additional shares could be acquired by the defendants from the open market. It did not follow from the plaintiffs’ submissions based on account of trust properties and tracing that <span class="font-italic">all</span> the shares presently held by the defendants had to be covered by the injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 The defendants argued that the plaintiffs had conflated their causes of action in trust with their prayer for accounts and tracing but even if this were objectionable, it overlooked the plaintiffs’ alternative pleaded case of unjust enrichment. If the plaintiffs succeed ultimately under this alternative cause of action, it would be open to them to seek a tracing order pertaining to the funds which the defendants had allegedly been unjustly enriched with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It was not clear whether the defendants currently hold any shares that have been acquired from the open market or from off market transactions with third parties. Equally it was not clear whether they had any intention or capacity to acquire additional shares by such means. It would appear that any additional shares they now hold over and above the OEL shares had arisen mainly if not entirely from the February and August 2020 share placements. It was not patently obvious at this point that these additional shares must fall outside the scope of any tracing order or account of trust properties. Nevertheless, I was of the view that limiting the scope of order 1(a) of the injunction to the OEL shares was more consistent with the plaintiffs’ pleaded case and the circumstances at hand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The seventh argument regarding order 1(b) had in fact been addressed at the hearing on 11 November 2020. The defendants’ submissions at para 135 and the 1st defendant’s 1st affidavit at paras 148 to 154 made the point that the defendants would not be able to raise funds if an injunction were to be granted, and that their business expansion plans would be impacted. However even if “any shares in OEL” were amended to “197,545,000 shares”, on the defendants’ own case, “any issuance of shares to parties other than the defendants will result in a dilution of the defendants’ shareholding interests in OEL”. If the defendants were allowed to freely complete further share placements, thereby diluting the value of the shares and/or the plaintiffs’ purported shareholding in OEL, the effect of the injunction would be very much watered down.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In my assessment, the seventh argument was not sustainable since the defendants’ core argument was that the injunction would affect OEL’s ability to raise further funds. As the plaintiffs submitted, share placements or issues were not the only fundraising options. OEL had already gone ahead to sell the Property which was valued at approximately $8.3m. OEL appeared to have made plans to diversify and aggressively expand its business, but this would rely on securing additional funding. Given the present litigation and the questions and doubts already raised, it may arguably be prejudicial as well to OEL’s shareholders for these expansion plans to proceed wholly unchecked.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 OEL’s alleged difficulty in obtaining secured loans reflected its own financial capacity and business fundamentals. I noted with some irony that the defendants had deemed it necessary to highlight in their further arguments

</div> their belief that a “reputable local bank” was somehow misled by the Ps’ allegedly “baseless, unsubstantiated and erroneous allegations” into withdrawing its in-principle approval for a loan of $4m to OEL.

The plaintiffs objected to this further affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 This further affidavit was technically inadmissible as it was filed without leave of court. As such, I disregarded its contents. Even if I did have to consider its contents, I would have attached minimal weight to them. In particular, the SHA was not signed by Wong and it was therefore unclear if the SHA was properly executed and had taken effect to begin with. Further, the SHA states that the shareholders “desire[d] to enter into [the SHA] and that the execution and delivery of [the SHA was] a condition to the Closing under the Sales and Purchase Agreement to be entered into”. However, as stated earlier, the SPA entered into for the acquisition of the OEL Shares was between the defendants, WJ and Mr Hing. It was therefore also unclear how Wong, Hu and Cai had come into the picture.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The adduction of the SHA did not change the present state of the evidence. While Clause 2 of the SHA states that “[n]o holder of Shares shall grant any proxy or become party to any voting trust or other agreement that is inconsistent with, conflicts with or violates any provision of this Agreement”, which appears to be inconsistent with the OEL Shares being held on trust for the plaintiffs, there is no evidence that the plaintiffs had known of the existence of this SHA even if it had been properly executed. I had found earlier that there were gaps in both parties’ cases but that there was sufficient evidence put forth by the plaintiffs such that their claims were not frivolous or vexatious.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 For the reasons I have set out above, the injunction as sought by the plaintiffs was granted with a limitation as to its scope to 197,545,000 of the ordinary shares in OEL which were purchased from Mr Hing on or around 16 December 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The plaintiffs’ submission on costs included the costs for Summons 4793 of 2020, for which costs was reserved.
