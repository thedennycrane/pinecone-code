Thereafter, the court considers the aggravating and mitigating factors specific to the offender to calibrate a sentence that is appropriate for that<span class="font-italic"> </span>offender (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [39]). This two-step sentencing framework has since been followed in other criminal cases (see, <span class="font-italic">eg, Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 4 SLR 580 (“<span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">GBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 3 SLR 1048).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 However, the framework proposed herein seeks to refine the methodology which was developed in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The points system to determine the appropriate sentencing band</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, the Court of Appeal considered several offence-specific factors which go towards the aggravation of the offence. In the context of rape, which was the offence before the court in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, such offence-specific factors included the abuse of position and breach of trust, premeditation, and the use of violence<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [44]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 After considering the aggravating offence-specific factors in the case, the sentencing judge would be able to determine the appropriate band which the accused’s offence fell within. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Cases which presented no offence-specific factors or where the factors were only present to a very limited extent were classed as Band 1 cases, which were punishable with ten to 13 years’ imprisonment, with six strokes of the cane. Cases with two or more aggravating factors fell under Band 2, and were punishable with 13 to 17 years’ imprisonment, with 12 strokes of the cane. Finally, extremely serious cases of rape, which, “by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors”, were classed as Band 3 cases, for which the appropriate punishment was 17 to 20 years’ imprisonment, with 18 strokes of the cane (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [47]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In <span class="font-italic">Kunasekaran</span> at [47], I observed that the “two-step sentencing bands” approach has much to commend it, and that it is a reliable methodology which improves clarity, transparency, coherence and consistency in sentencing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Nonetheless, a problem which arises from the two-step sentencing band approach is that there is an overt focus on the <span class="font-italic">number </span>of aggravating factors. Hence, in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>once there were two or more aggravating factors, the case inevitably tipped out of Band 1 into Band 2. I understand that it is possible to adjust beyond the sentencing range prescribed for the band when considering the appropriate sentence at the second stage of the framework (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>offender-specific factors stage) (see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [62]). However, this does not curb the problem identified, which relates to the excessive or inadequate weight which may be given to <span class="font-italic">offence-specific </span>factors (the first stage). Given the inevitable focus on the sheer <span class="font-italic">number </span>of offence-specific factors present, the current two-step sentencing band approach implicitly assumes that each offence-specific factor carries the same weightage. This disregards the possibility that each of these offence-specific factors may carry different aggravating weights in influencing the sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 To more accurately evaluate the appropriate amount of weight to be ascribed to each offence-specific factor, I therefore propose a points system, whereby each offence-specific factor is given a range of points, allowing the sentencing judge to determine the appropriate number of points to be ascribed based on the intensity of the aggravating factor. Once the total number of points from the offence-specific factors are tallied, the indicative starting sentence, based on the sentencing band, can be determined. The sentencing band which the accused’s offence falls under will therefore be determined not primarily by the number of offence-specific factors present, but by the combined <span class="font-italic">intensity </span>of all the offence-specific factors present, as reflected by the aggregated number of points. This takes into account not only the <span class="font-italic">number</span> of offence-specific factors present but also the <span class="font-italic">different weightage</span> that each of these offence-specific factors may have. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I now present the sentencing framework for the offence of unlawful stalking under s 7 of POHA to better demonstrate my point.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The first step: determining the band of the offence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Offence-specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In determining the appropriate band of the offence, the court should first have regard to the offence-specific factors that relate to <span class="font-italic">both</span> the degree of harm caused by the offender and the degree of his culpability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 A review of cases in relation to unlawful stalking offences (s 7(1) POHA) discloses the following, non-exhaustive, list of offence-specific factors which <span class="font-italic">independently </span>reflect the increased culpability of the accused or the heightened level of harm suffered by the victim, thereby aggravating the offence:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Duration and frequency of stalking</span>: Cases of unlawful stalking are necessarily disruptive and harmful to the lives of the victims, who live subject to the offender’s watchful eye.

In certain cases, the intrusion may amount to merely loitering around the victim’s premises. Here, lesser adjustment is required by the victim to avoid the accused person.

The latter class of cases would amount to a high degree of intrusion into the victim’s life (see ss 7(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)–(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) POHA).

The public nature of such acts would exacerbate the degree of harm and embarrassment suffered by the victim, and would clearly increase the offender’s culpability. Such cases are particularly egregious, especially if the harassment crosses into the online domain, whereby the leak of such sensitive information or images could have a “viral and permanent” impact (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(13 March 2014), vol 91 (Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Law). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">In fact, the offender’s culpability is also heightened as such cases often involve an abuse of a position of trust, as accused persons with access to such highly sensitive information or images of the victim would often have shared a relationship with the victim: see <span class="font-italic">PP v Adrian Goh, PP v Tan Boon Wah and Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Lai Zhi Heng </span>(SC-912644-2015, Magistrate’s Arrest Case No 909122 of 2015 and others) (<span class="font-italic">“PP v Lai Zhi Heng</span>”) (discussed in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yao Min v PP </span>at [19] and [82]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) <span class="font-italic">Use of threats against the victim</span>: When the offender uses threats against the victim, the degree of harassment, alarm, fear or distress caused to the victim would be heightened, thereby increasing the harm caused to the victim: see <span class="font-italic">PP v Nelson Tan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>and s 7(5)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) POHA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) <span class="font-italic">Harm to victim beyond those ordinarily caused in (a), (b), (d) and (e) (“extraordinary harm”)</span>:  The harm suffered by the victim of unlawful stalking varies from victim to victim. In most cases, the harm suffered by the victim will be factored into the sentence by factors (a), (b), (d) and (e), which incorporate the harm ordinarily suffered by the victim. For example, a victim who is frequently stalked over a long duration is likely to suffer loss of his “freedom to do any act which he is legally entitled to do” (s 7(5)(<span class="font-italic">f</span>) POHA). Such ordinary harm is already accounted for in factor (a) above, which ascribes points based on the duration and frequency of stalking. To prevent double counting against the accused, no additional points ought therefore to be attributed for such ordinary harm suffered.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">In certain cases, however, the victim may suffer harm beyond what is normally caused by factors (a), (b), (d) and (e). For example, while a victim who suffers the public dissemination of his or her sensitive information or images (see factor (d) above) may ordinarily be expected to suffer emotional trauma and damage to his or her reputation, where the victim suffers from permanent emotional or psychological scars or loses his job as a result of the accused’s acts, such would amount to extraordinary harm. If found to be present by the objective circumstances or an unrefuted victim impact statement, such extraordinary harm would be an aggravating factor <span class="font-italic">independent </span>from the other factors considered above, for which points may be attributed without double counting against the accused. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) <span class="font-italic">Involving third parties</span>: When the offender also involves persons other than the victim, such as the victim’s next-of-kin or the victim’s partner (the “third parties”), the inconvenience and distress would extend beyond the victim himself, as the third parties affected may also have to employ self-help measures to avoid the offender: see <span class="font-italic">Tan Yao Min v PP </span>at [91]. Where no separate charges are preferred for such inconvenience caused to the third parties, this should be considered as an aggravating factor. If separate charges are preferred, this factor should not be considered aggravating to prevent double counting against the accused: see <span class="font-italic">PP v Nelson Tan</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Points are to be ascribed to each of the offence-specific factors based on the degree of aggravation of the offence occasioned by the presence of that factor. Where the offence in relation to the particular factor is more serious, more points are to be given to that factor.  No points are awarded if the factor is absent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Furthermore, I propose ascribing a maximum of between three to five points to each of the offence-specific factors identified based on their relative weightages. Accordingly, the maximum number of points allocated to each factor may differ. For example, the factor of public dissemination of sensitive information or images may result in irreversible harm to the victim’s reputation. To reflect its potential greater weightage as a factor (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> when compared to other factors such as the use of threats against the victim, which are often temporal in nature), the maximum number of points allocated to the factor of public dissemination of sensitive information would be higher so as to allow more points to be eventually ascribed to it during the points assessment process by the judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 At the outset, it is emphasised that the framework as proposed applies to cases where the accused has claimed trial, rather than pleaded guilty to the offence.

This is not problematic, as the indicative starting sentence is but a reflection of the appropriate sentence after the consideration of the offence-specific factors only (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the first stage). At the next stage, the indicative starting sentence may be calibrated downwards to account for offender-specific mitigating factors, such as a timely plea of guilt. After accounting for both the offence-specific and offender-specific factors, a recommended final sentence would be obtained. This recommended final sentence may fall below 12 months’ imprisonment. If the recommended final sentence continues to exceed 12 months’ imprisonment after considering the offender-specific factors (<span class="font-italic">ie, </span>the second stage), the actual sentence to be imposed must in any case not exceed the maximum imprisonment term of 12 months’ imprisonment, although the court may couple that maximum imprisonment term with a fine not exceeding $5,000 (see s 7(6) POHA). This means that the mandatory statutory cap on the actual sentence <span class="font-italic">must</span><span class="font-italic"> be applied</span> even though the culpability and recommended final sentence assessed under the sentencing framework may be higher than the maximum prescribed by law.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The points-based framework serves simply to guide judges in exercising their discretion in arriving at the appropriate indicative starting sentence, having regard to the offence-specific factors of each case. It does not take away the discretion vested in sentencing judges, who must ultimately conduct an “exercise in evaluative ethical judgment” (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [48]) in determining the appropriate number of points (if any) to attribute to each of the offence-specific factors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Such a methodology, which does not depart in substance and in principle from the two-step sentencing band approach developed in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>, has at least two advantages over the present number-of-aggravating-factors focused approach:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it allows for calibration <span class="font-italic">between</span> the offence-specific factors. Certain factors cause far more harm, or reflect the heightened culpability, of the accused. For example, in the context of unlawful stalking, the public dissemination of sensitive information or images may cause irreversible harm to the reputation of the victim, and therefore requires more points to be ascribed to it within the given range to better reflect the greater intensity of the offender’s wrongdoing. Hence, the maximum number of points that can be given for this factor is higher when compared to the maximum number of points that can be given for a factor assessed to be of lower weightage.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, it allows for calibration <span class="font-italic">within</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>each of the offence-specific factors. As is patent from the table at [34] above, the severity within each offence-specific factor may vary from case-to-case. For example, where the stalking occurs over a longer period and with greater frequency, more points within the given range ought to be allocated to this offence-specific factor. The natural corollary is that an accused with a greater <span class="font-italic">number</span> of aggravating factors (each of a low weightage) may not necessarily fall on a higher band than an accused with a lesser <span class="font-italic">number</span> of aggravating factors (but each of which may be of a high weightage); the appropriate sentencing band depends cumulatively therefore on the degree of severity of each of the aggravating factors present having regard also to their individual relative weightages, as reflected in the aggregate number of points scored in each particular case. In other words, the total number of points scored reflects the cumulative effect of all the aggravating factors present, <span class="font-italic">including</span> their relative degree of importance or significance in terms of both the harm caused and the culpability of the offender.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The second step: offender-specific factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 At the second step, the court should have regard to the offender-specific factors (whether mitigating or aggravating). The court has the discretion as to the appropriate amount of weight to place on such factors, and an adjustment <span class="font-italic">beyond </span>the sentencing range prescribed in each sentencing band may be called for in the appropriate case. For example, in cases on the borderline of each sentencing band, the mitigating or aggravating factors may tip the case to the lower or higher sentencing band.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Some offender-specific aggravating factors include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, especially when the offences taken into consideration are of a similar nature: see <span class="font-italic">PP v UI </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 at [38].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The presence of relevant antecedents, especially if the offences were committed against the same victim, such that the harm suffered by the victim is compounded. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) <span class="font-italic">Enhanced penalty provision: relevance of subsequent similar offences</span>: It is noted that a person who has been convicted under s 7 POHA is liable for enhanced penalty for any subsequent offence. If the subsequent offence is prosecuted under the enhanced penalty provision in s 8 POHA, the accused shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both (s 8(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) POHA). The fine and imprisonment terms for the enhanced offence is therefore twice that of the initial offence, which carries a maximum fine of $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding one year or both (s 7(6) POHA). In such cases, the accused would already be punished by way of the enhanced penalty charge under s 8 POHA, and no additional aggravating weight should therefore be given to the prior antecedents of the accused in coming to an appropriate sentence for the s 8 POHA charge. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">If, however, the Prosecution exercises its discretion and elects to prosecute a subsequent offender with a prior conviction under s 7 POHA (even though s 8 POHA could be used), the relevant antecedents could then be considered as an aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The offender committed the present set of offence(s) while on court bail for other offence(s).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Some offender-specific mitigating factors include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Pleas of guilt: In unexceptional plea of guilt cases, a timely plea would be “indicative of genuine remorse” (<span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v NF </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 at [57]). It also has mitigating value as it “spares the victim the ordeal of having to testify, thereby saving the victim the horror of having to re-live the incident” and “saves the resources of the State which would otherwise have been expended if there were a trial” (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [66]). In such unexceptional cases, considering that the maximum imprisonment term for unlawful stalking offences under s 7 POHA is a relatively short period of 12 months’ imprisonment, an approximate 25% discount from the indicative starting sentence as determined after the first-stage (offence-specific factors) would be appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">The amount of discount for a plea of guilt may be scaled upwards or downwards if other factors are present. For example, if the accused had earlier elected to claim trial and only pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial, the discount ought to be far lesser, as resources would already have been expended in preparing for a trial. This accused is also likely to be less remorseful than one who pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The youth or advanced age of the offender: <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [65].</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) For youths, rehabilitation is a key sentencing consideration, for which a lower or alternate rehabilitative sentence like probation or reformative training may be considered. However, in egregious cases of unlawful stalking (<span class="font-italic">eg, </span>Band 4 and 5 cases), “a condign punishment” would be required “in order to satisfy the needs for deterrence and retribution” (see <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [65(b)], citing <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449).</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) For older offenders, “the imposition of substantial custodial terms deprives the elderly of a larger fraction of their expectation of life. This – a concern for the overall proportionality of punishment … is the real reason for affording leniency on account of advanced age” (<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>at [65(c)]). Nonetheless, given that the maximum imprisonment term for the offence of unlawful stalking is only 12 months’ imprisonment, the custodial term is unlikely to be so substantial such that this factor features weightily. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The offender-specific factors stated above are non-exhaustive. Ultimately, each sentence must be calibrated to best fit the accused’s circumstances. In this regard, the classic principles of sentencing, namely retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation are helpful in determining the appropriate amount that an accused’s sentence ought to be enhanced or reduced at the second stage of the framework.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application of the sentencing framework</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Applying the framework to past cases of unlawful stalking will provide a better illustration of the usefulness of the refined two-stage sentencing framework. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Methodology</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As per the framework, the offence-specific factors present in each case will first be analysed, with the appropriate number of points attributed depending on the facts disclosed.

A final sentence derived by applying the framework would then be disclosed (the recommended final sentence). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Later in this judgment, the recommended final sentences disclosed from each case will be back-tested and compared against the actual sentences imposed in the individual cases. This back-testing will demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the framework in ensuring clarity and consistency in sentencing which is commensurate with the culpability and the harm in each case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysed cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">PP v Lim Seow Kiat [2018] SGMC 44</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of facts</span>: The 68-year-old male offender harassed the victim between 15 January 2018 and 30 January 2018.

When the victim attempted to avoid the offender, the offender printed flyers with harassing messages, her nude photographs, and her personal information, and posted them publicly near her home. He also placed them in the letter boxes at her very block of flat. The offender’s abuse of the victim further extended to forcing her to write “I promise note [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to rebel again” a total of 200 times. </div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold">When she tried to ignore him, he then uploaded her nude photographs onto the Facebook group for her interest group at school with the false message that she was offering prostitution services.

accused persons with lesser points (less serious offending), and stricter to accused persons with higher points (more serious offending).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1)  The sentencing trend of three to six months’ imprisonment </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 However, the reason for the significant differences between the recommended final sentence and the actual sentence at the lower end and higher end of the framework is because the sentence for cases of unlawful stalking appear to have congregated around three to six months’ imprisonment (the “sentencing trend”) (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yao Min v PP </span>at [81]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Hence, in determining the appropriate sentence for each case, judges refer to the sentencing trend of three to six months’ imprisonment as the starting point. Thereafter, appropriate adjustments upwards or downwards are made if the case at hand is distinguishable from the cases which make up the sentencing trend (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lim Seow Kiat </span>[2018] SGMC 44 (“<span class="font-italic">PP v Lim Seow Kiat</span>”) at [27]–[29]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 For example, in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yao Min v PP, </span>the judge considered seven decisions where the offenders were sentenced to three to six months’ imprisonment for unlawful stalking. After considering the cases, the judge noted the following aggravating factors in the case before him: (a) the victim was a minor and was thus a vulnerable victim, (b) the offender had committed similar offences against the same victim in 2010 and 2015, and (c) the offender’s stalking affected third parties, as the offender had added the victim’s friend on Facebook, and spoke to the victim’s father’s colleague at his workplace (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yao Min v PP </span>at [90]). While the judge noted that, unlike the offender in <span class="font-italic">PP v Lai Zhi Heng</span>, the offender did not disseminate the victim’s nude photographs, he found that in totality, eight months’ imprisonment was not manifestly excessive (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yao Min v PP </span>at [91]–[92]).<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 This approach was also adopted by the District Judge. First, he noted the sentencing trend of three to six months’ imprisonment (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lim Teck Kim </span>[2018] SGMC 77 (“GD”) at [10]). Thereafter, he reviewed the seven cases considered in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yao Min v PP</span>, and found the facts of the present case “similar to the case” of <span class="font-italic">PP v Nelson Tan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(one of the seven cases considered in <span class="font-italic">Tan Yao Min v PP</span>)<span class="font-italic">, </span>where the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment (GD at [18]). In the circumstances, he also sentenced the appellant to three months’ imprisonment (GD<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [20]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2)  Proof of congregation of sentences </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As a result of the reliance on the sentencing trend as the starting point in determining the appropriate sentence, cases are often straightjacketed into a narrow sentencing width. This congregation of sentences can be seen when the actual imprisonment terms in the cases analysed were given notional discounts or uplifts depending on the <span class="font-italic">offender-specific </span>factors<span class="font-italic"> </span>present. This was so as to arrive at a notional first-stage sentence, which reflects the combined severity of the <span class="font-italic">offence-specific </span>factors only, without any regard being given to the factors in favour or against the particular offender (<span class="font-italic">ie, offender-specific </span>factors). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As the severity of the offence should increase with every increase in the number of points, a positive (upward) gradient would be expected for the notional first-stage sentences of the cases, whereby the <span class="font-italic">offender-specific </span>factors are disregarded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The notional sentences for each case analysed were derived as such:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Case (Points)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Notional first-stage sentence (months)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Offender-specific factors: </span></div><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Notional discount/uplift to reverse the effect of offender-specific factor(s) </span></div><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">(months)</span></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Actual sentence (months)</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-italic">PP v Ng Han Wei</span> (7 points)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">5.66</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Two relevant antecedents: + 1</div><div class="Table-Text text-left">Pleaded guilty (25% discount):  - 1.66</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-italic">PP v Adrian Goh</span> (12 points)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">8</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Pleaded guilty (25% discount): - 2</div><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-italic">PP v Tan Boon Wah</span> (13 points)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">8</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Pleaded guilty (25% discount): - 2</div><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-italic">Tan Yao Min v PP</span> (14 points)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">8.66</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Two relevant antecedents against the same victim: + 2 </div><div class="Table-Text text-left">Pleaded guilty (25% discount): - 2.66 </div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">8</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-italic">PP v Nelson Tan</span> (15 points)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">4.5</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Pleaded guilty (25% discount): - 1.5</div><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">3</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Table-Text text-left"><span class="font-italic">PP v Lai Zhi Heng</span> (22 points)</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">7.05</div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">Pleaded guilty (15% discount due to lessened remorse): - 1.05 </div><div class="Table-Text text-left"></div></td><td><div class="Table-Text text-left">6</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Plotted on a graph, the notional first-stage sentences for the cases produced a best-fit line with a very mildly positive gradient:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The very mildly positive gradient (showing a total increment in the imprisonment term of only about one month from five points to 25 points) suggests that the sentences in the cases analysed are being decided primarily by reference to the present sentencing trend of three to six months’ imprisonment, with insufficient regard to offence-specific factors and their respective intensity. As a result, the nominal first-stage sentences are bunched together at around seven months’ imprisonment (as can be seen on the best-fit line), even though the points, which reflect the intensity of the offence-specific factors and therefore serve as the proxy for the severity of each individual offence, do vary widely from seven to 22 points.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3)  Problem of congregation of sentences</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 This congregation of the sentences for the analysed cases between three to six months’ imprisonment is plainly unsatisfactory for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 First, it is likely that the full sentencing range, which permits up to 12 months’ imprisonment, will not be properly utilised (see <span class="font-italic">Tay Wee Kiat and </span><span class="font-italic">another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 4 SLR 1315 at [76] and <span class="font-italic">Soh Qiu Xia Katty v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 3 SLR 568 at [28(b)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Secondly, the dispersion of the nominal first-stage sentences of the cases (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, based purely on the <span class="font-italic">offence-specific</span> factors and with the effects of all <span class="font-italic">offender</span><span class="font-italic">-specific</span> factors removed) as plotted on the graph (at [65] above) also demonstrates a lack of logical consistency in sentencing. Some cases scoring lower points have higher nominal first-stage sentences than some of those cases scoring higher points, when the opposite should logically have been the case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Thirdly and most importantly, it can lead to dissimilar cases being treated alike. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For example, while both <span class="font-italic">PP v Adrian Goh </span>and <span class="font-italic">PP v Lai Zhi Heng </span>involved the public dissemination of the victims’ nude photographs, the duration and frequency of harassment as well as the degree of intrusion in the two cases were diametrically opposite. The offender in <span class="font-italic">PP v Adrian Goh </span>harassed the victim for a short four-day period, and his harassment was limited to electronic and non-physical means. In contrast, the offender in <span class="font-italic">PP v Lai Zhi Heng </span>harassed the victim incessantly for one and a half years, harassing her around her school and house. He also issued threats to the victim, causing her to suffer such extraordinary harm that she had to switch schools to avoid the offender. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Considering the intensity of each offence-specific factor, it would be clear that the offence in <span class="font-italic">PP v Lai Zhi Heng</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(scoring 22 points for the <span class="font-italic">offence-specific</span> factors)<span class="font-italic"> </span>was of a far graver nature than that in <span class="font-italic">PP v Adrian Goh</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(scoring only 12 points for the <span class="font-italic">offence-specific</span> factors). Yet, without a framework to guide the sentencing judge, such superficially similar cases may result in an inevitable congregation of sentences; indeed, both offenders in <span class="font-italic">PP v Adrian Goh </span>and <span class="font-italic">PP v Lai Zhi Heng </span>received the same sentence of six months’ imprisonment. It must be noted that the incongruity cannot be explained by any possible differences between the two cases in terms of the <span class="font-italic">offender-specific</span> factors because there was nothing much in fact to differentiate between them: both offenders had no relevant antecedents and both had pleaded guilty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The two-step sentencing framework therefore seeks to ensure that appropriate weight will be given to the <span class="font-italic">offence-specific</span> factors in each case. While two cases may appear at first blush to be largely similar, a closer analysis may reveal the differing seriousness of the offences in each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Applying the sentencing framework, “outliers” like <span class="font-italic">PP v Lai Zhi Heng</span> will therefore be minimised, and the sentencing judge would be assisted in arriving at a sentence with more clarity and coherence. Insofar as the offence-specific factors were derived from the analysis of the cases, the sentencing framework does not depart from the precedents, but rather seeks to refine them and detail the sentencing considerations that each court should take into account for cases of unlawful stalking. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application of the sentencing framework to the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Applying the framework to the facts of the present case, the offence-specific factors disclose an aggregate of six points:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) <span class="font-italic">Short duration, moderate frequency of stalking (two points)</span>: The appellant stalked the victim for a short duration of about three weeks (from 23 February 2018 to 13 March 2018). The frequency of stalking was moderate, as the appellant’s stalking did not amount to a daily intrusion into the victim’s life, given that there were gaps between the periods he sent the messages (the messages were sent on 23 February 2018, and 4 and 6 March 2018 only) and harassed the victim in person (on 23 February 2018, and 4, 6, 8, 12 and 13 March 2018 only).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Degree of intrusion was high (three points)</span>: The degree of intrusion by the appellant was high. On 23 February 2018, after having coerced the victim to allow him to spend the night at her place by inflicting injuries on himself and blaming the victim for such injuries, the appellant refused to leave the victim’s residence, and threatened to hurt himself if she made him leave the house. He could only be removed after the police arrived and arrested him for attempted suicide as he had threatened to kill himself rather than end the relationship with the victim (“the 23 February incident”).

</div> While his acts of harassment after 23 February 2018 amounted to merely sending messages or loitering around the victim’s vicinity, viewed in light of the 23 February incident, which would have made the victim fearful of the appellant’s presence, they do not detract from the high degree of intrusion by the appellant into the victim’s life.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">Threats to self and not to the victim, unlike most other cases (one point)</span>: Finally, the appellant had issued threats to hurt himself. To this effect, he hit himself on the face, and threatened to kill himself rather than end the relationship with the victim. This made the victim feel afraid, such that she had to call the police for assistance.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 With the aggregate of six points from the offence-specific factors, the appellant’s conduct falls within the lowest end of Band 2, and just crosses the custodial threshold. The indicative starting sentence is therefore 0.8 months’ imprisonment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The District Judge had opined that the custodial threshold was crossed because, unlike the offender in <span class="font-italic">PP v Lim Seow Kiat</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>where a $5,000 fine was awarded, the appellant had issued threats to the victim (GD at [19]). This is not the case. The custodial threshold is crossed because of the aggregate of more than five points in this case. Indeed, the points-based sentencing framework herein emphasises the importance of considering the intensity of each offence-specific factor; not all threats are equally aggravating. As the threats to the victim in this case never extended to hurting the victim or jeopardising her safety or wellbeing, they were of the less egregious variety, for which one point would suffice. Hence, had the aggregate number of points been between one to five points only, the custodial threshold would not have been crossed notwithstanding the appellant’s threats.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In relation to the offender-specific factors, the appellant had pleaded guilty, for which mitigating weight was to be afforded. While the appellant was traced, his antecedents were dated (with the latest conviction being in 2004) and unrelated, with most of them being for drug offences. I therefore do not regard his antecedents as a significant aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As this is a borderline case that just crosses into Band 2, and in the light of his plea of guilt, I am prepared to discount the appellant’s sentence and place him on the highest end of Band 1. In the circumstances, I find that the maximum fine of $5,000 (in default two weeks’ imprisonment) would suffice for this case.  I therefore allow the appellant’s appeal against sentence to that effect.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The sentencing framework as proposed is intended only as a guide for judges to arrive at the sentence that best fits the case before them. By focussing on one factor at a time, the sentencing framework enables the judge to better assess the seriousness of the offence for the purpose of sentencing, without being overwhelmed by the task of having to consider a whole host of offence-specific factors, each carrying different weight, at the same time. The process of considering the degree of aggravation of each offence-specific factor also ensures consistency and clarity in sentencing, as judges must specify their reasons for ascribing a particular weight to each factor. The risks of double-counting against an offender is also thereby mitigated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Having said that, it must be borne in mind that the sentencing framework is not a rigid formula by which judges may surrender the need to apply their judicial discretion. They have to carefully evaluate and weigh a myriad of considerations to determine the most just and appropriate outcome in the case before them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Ultimately, sentencing is a fluid exercise with very concrete consequences for the accused at hand. Careful consideration of where justice may lie in each case is of primary importance. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Here, Lord Woolf CJ’s reminder in <span class="font-italic">R v Millberry </span>[2003] 1 WLR 546 at 556 (cited by Chao Hick Tin JA, “The Art of Sentencing – An Appellate Court’s Perspective”, speech at Sentencing Conference 2014: Trends, Tools &amp; Technology (9 October 2014) at para 13) is deserving of restatement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[G]uidelines … can produce sentences which are inappropriately high or inappropriately low if sentencers adopt a mechanistic approach to the guidelines.
