The claimant argues that he is the sole beneficiary entitled to 20% of the Testator’s estate (“the Estate”), pursuant to his last will and testament dated 9 June 1992 (“the Will”). The Will bequeathed 20% of the Estate to a subset of the Testator’s grandsons, namely those sired by his sons but not his daughters. The Testator’s codicil dated 20 October 1992 (“the Codicil”) then imposed two further limitations, one of which was the qualification that the grandson be in the custody, care and control of his father. The second defendant contends first that the category of patrilineal grandsons was further limited to those born after the Testator’s death (thus excluding the claimant, who was born during the Testator’s lifetime) and second that the claimant was not in his father’s custody, care and control and is thus disqualified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 I find that the claimant is not a qualifying beneficiary under the Will. While I hold that the claimant is a “surviving grandson” of the Testator falling within the intended class of beneficiaries under Clause 5 of the Will, I find that the claimant does not satisfy the condition in Clause 1(i) of the Codicil that he must have been in the custody, care and control of his father.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Consequently, the claimant is not entitled to 20% of the Estate under the Will read with the Codicil. I now provide my reasons for these conclusions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The claimant is Julian Frederick Yu Lim (“Julian”), a grandson of the Testator.

On a proper construction, the Grandson Gift Clause embraces pre-existing grandsons surviving at the time of the Testator’s death, such as Julian, <span class="font-italic">as well as </span>future grandsons born within 21 years after the Testator’s death. I now provide my reasons for finding in favour of this interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I start with Lord Romer’s famous description in <span class="font-italic">Perrin</span><span class="font-italic"> and others v Morgan and others</span> [1943] AC 399 at 420 (“<span class="font-italic">Perrin</span>”) of the task undertaken by the court in construing a will: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… I take it to be a cardinal rule of construction that a will should be so construed as to give effect to the intention of the testator, such intention being gathered from the language of the will read in the light of the circumstances in which the will was made. To understand the language employed the court is entitled, to use a familiar expression, to sit in the testator’s armchair. When seated there, however, the court is not entitled to make a fresh will for the testator merely because it strongly suspects that the testator did not mean what he has plainly said …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Foo Jee Seng and others v Foo </span><span class="font-italic">Jhee Tuang and another</span> [2012] 4 SLR 339 at [17], the testator’s intention “must predominantly be derived from the wording of the will itself, although the circumstances prevailing at the time the will was executed may be taken into account”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The armchair principle, or a survey of the prevailing circumstances known to the Testator, is an intrinsic part of the exercise of interpretation. The identity and circumstances of the person making a statement are inherent to our understanding of what they are saying <span class="font-italic">by that statement</span>. However, the armchair principle does not mandate a factual inquiry into what the testator’s real intention might have been, separate from the words used, nor does it in any way permit the substitution of a speculated intention for the expressed intention. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 With this principle in mind, I turn to the Grandson Gift Clause (see at [12] above). Looking at it as a matter of abstract logic, there are four logically possible constructions of that provision: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, “surviving grandsons born of my sons … within twenty-one (21) years of my death” means grandsons born within the 21 years <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Testator’s death, and still surviving at the end of that period. This is the interpretation favoured by Thomas.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, that wording could also mean grandsons surviving the Testator at the time of his death and born within the 21 years <span class="font-italic">before</span> his death. This is the interpretation favoured by Julian.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, that wording could mean grandsons born within 21 years <span class="font-italic">both before and after</span> the Testator’s death and surviving at the close of that 42-year period.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Lastly, the phrase “surviving grandsons” could mean grandsons surviving the Testator at the time of his death, with the words “born … within twenty-one (21) years of my death” providing an outer limit or a final deadline within which any future grandsons may be born to qualify as a beneficiary under this class. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 These readings are all logically possible. Grandsons form a single class, which is itself a subset of the broader class of grandchildren. The text plainly excludes granddaughters. It also plainly excludes sons of the Testator’s daughters. Adopting the armchair principle, in considering whether and how the class is to be further narrowed, the court has regard to the then prevailing circumstances known to the Testator. What was visible to the Testator from his armchair may strengthen or weaken the plausibility of any of these interpretations. In particular, the first and second interpretations each poses different difficulties or concerns, namely why the Testator would want to exclude existing grandsons (under the first interpretation) or future grandsons (under the second interpretation). Consider the textual exclusion of grandsons by the Testator’s daughters: this gels with the objective facts about the Testator’s own concerns about grandsons inheriting from his Estate despite their having been brought up within the separate household of their mother,

</div> But it is hard to discern a logical reason for wanting to benefit only existing grandsons or only future grandsons in the absence of some compelling circumstance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Julian’s counsel argues that the Grandson Gift Clause is clear on its face and that the second interpretation is unambiguously the correct one. Hence, there is no scope for reliance upon extrinsic evidence. I do not agree. There are several textual points from other parts of the Will that militate against the second interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, I accept that the word “within”, in its ordinary meaning, when applied to a period of time, means something that is enclosed in the bounds or confines of the prescribed time period. Accordingly, in respect of the Grandson Gift Clause, this could mean a period of 21 years before the Testator’s death, a period of 21 years after his death, or both such periods. However, in other clauses of the Will, the word “within” is only ever employed to mean ‘after’. Clause 8 states that “[m]y estate shall be distributed within 18 years of my death”, which must obviously mean ‘18 years after my death’ and not before.

</div>
</div> Again, this can only sensibly mean ‘within one year after my death’ and not before.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The use of the word “within” in Clauses 6 and 8 to mean ‘after’ cannot be disregarded. The “court should compare and contrast identical words used in different parts of the will so as to elucidate the most complete meaning or intention that should be ascribed to the words used”: <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and others</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“<span class="font-italic">Nellie Goh</span>”) at [61].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Second, the lines preceding the Grandson Gift Clause in Clause 5 of the Will lend further support for the view that “within twenty-one (21) years” was intended to mean 21 years ‘after’ the Testator’s death and not before. Clause 5 provides for a portion of the Estate to be dedicated to providing monthly maintenance to the Testator’s wife during her lifetime and to maintaining the Testator’s grave “for a period of twenty-five years after my death”; then, “[u]pon the expiry of the said twenty-five years”, the moneys may be distributed amongst certain named beneficiaries.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As these are the lines <span class="font-italic">immediately</span> preceding the Grandson Gift Clause in Clause 5, they provide contextual support for the view that all the time periods stipulated in Clause 5 were contemplated to run from the date of the Testator’s death onwards. These are part of “the overall architecture of the will, meaning the structural placement of certain words and phrases.

Clause 8 requires the Estate to be distributed within 18 years of his death (see at [32] above). In my view, this argument does not take Julian’s case very far. As mentioned, Clause 5 provides for a portion of the Estate to be applied to the monthly maintenance of the Testator’s wife during her lifetime and the maintenance of his grave for a minimum period of 25 years after his death. For this reason alone, the 18-year deadline in Clause 8 would not operate to override all contrary timelines prescribed in the Will’s specific bequests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Coming back to the armchair principle, I find that there were five important circumstances prevailing at the time of the making of the Will in June 1992, namely that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Testator learnt of his grandson Julian in or about February 1992 from Peng On, a discovery that made him happy such that he wanted to meet Julian.

</div>
</div> I caution myself that the armchair principle does not permit admission of the Testator’s intention in this way, and I exclude Mr Nair’s evidence on this point from my consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The prevailing circumstances at [59]–[60] above offer no support to any construction excluding either grandsons born before the Testator’s death or grandsons born after his death. To the contrary, putting myself in the Testator’s armchair, I find that the fact that the Testator had come to know that Peng On had a son supports the inclusion of existing grandsons. At the same time, the age gap between the Testator and Thomas of more than fifty years supports the inclusion of grandsons born after the Testator’s death, given that Thomas was in his early twenties and not yet married, while the Testator was in his mid-seventies. This is because it was likely to have been within the Testator’s contemplation that Thomas might father sons <span class="font-italic">after </span>his own death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 For all these reasons, I find that the testamentary intention expressed in the Grandson Gift Clause was for the class of beneficiaries to include existing grandsons born before the Testator’s death (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “surviving grandsons”) and future grandsons born within 21 years <span class="font-italic">after</span> the Testator’s death.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 I reject Julian’s argument that this is a textually untenable reading of the Grandson Gift Clause. I disagree with his submission that this interpretation is only viable if the clause had included the following words in bold and brackets: “[t]he balance 20% of my estate I bequeath to all my surviving grandsons born of my sons (the male hereditary line) <span class="font-weight-bold">[and/or]</span> within twenty-one (21) years of my death”. That would be an overly semantic reading of the clause. Wills should be construed purposively and not literally and pedantically (see <span class="font-italic">Chan</span><span class="font-italic"> Yun Cheong (trustee of the will of the testator) v Chan Chi Cheong (trustee of the will of the testator) </span>[2021] 2 SLR 67 at [57]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Moreover, applying the ordinary meaning of the word “within” (see at [53] above), the reference to “within twenty-one (21) years” could just as easily be intended to impose a hard outer limit or the latest date by which any eligible grandsons may be born. That would have the effect of including any grandsons born before the latest possible date (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 21 years after the Testator’s death) as eligible members of the class. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I also reject Thomas’s argument that the words “surviving grandsons” can be read to mean ‘surviving at the end of the 21-year period <span class="font-italic">after</span> the death of the Testator’. The natural meaning of the word “surviving” in the context of this clause is in relation to the Testator, meaning surviving <span class="font-italic">him</span>. This happened upon his death. This interpretation also coheres with the ambulatory nature of a will, which should be construed to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before a testator’s death, unless a contrary intention appears in the will (see s 19, Wills Act 1838 (2020 Rev Ed)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 On my reading of the Grandson Gift Clause, the fourth interpretation (see at [50(d)] above) is the most plausible one. The clause covers (a) grandsons born <span class="font-italic">before</span> the Testator’s death who survive the Testator (whether born before or after the making of the Will)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and (b) grandsons born <span class="font-italic">after</span> his death but within 21 years thereafter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I should add that the introduction of the Custody Care and Control Requirement makes the most sense against the background that Peng On’s son <span class="font-italic">could</span> qualify as a beneficiary under the Will and could stand to inherit from the Estate <span class="font-italic">even if</span> he was no longer in Peng On’s custody, care and control – hence the fears expressed by the Testator about this to Mr Nair and his desire to add that limitation into the Codicil.

</div> This militates against Thomas’s interpretation that the clause was <span class="font-italic">only</span> intended to apply to grandsons born within 21 years after the Testator’s death.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The two terms “custody” and “care and control” are straightforward ones. “Custody” refers to the parental right and responsibility to decide longer-term and more significant matters affecting the child’s welfare and upbringing, while “care and control” refers to the parental right and responsibility to make shorter-term day-to-day decisions for the child (see <span class="font-italic">CX v CY (minor: custody and access)</span> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 690 at [31]–[33]). For this reason, the parent with “care and control” is also generally the parent that the child primarily lives with and who is the child’s primary caregiver (see <span class="font-italic">AQL v AQM </span>[2012] 1 SLR 840 at [6]–[8] and <span class="font-italic">TAU v TAT</span> [2018] 5 SLR 1089 at [11]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Julian argues that “custody” and “care and control” are legal constructs referring to legal rights and powers. Therefore, a parent can only be said to lose custody or care and control once a legal act – such as a court order – formally deprives them of such rights.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I accept that “custody” and “care and control” are legal constructs in relation to parental arrangements for their children (see <span class="font-italic">VJM v VJL and another appeal</span> [2021] 5 SLR 1233 at [18] and <span class="font-italic">VET v VEU</span> [2020] 4 SLR 1120 at [50]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 However, I do not accept Julian’s view that a parent cannot be said to have lost “custody” or “care and control” over their child in the absence of a formal legal determination. A parent can give up “custody” or “care and control” by agreement with the other parent. These matters are often dealt with in formal separation deeds, but there is no reason why they may not equally be dealt with by an oral agreement between parents or even impliedly by their conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 It is helpful to recall the Testator’s concern as reflected in Mr Nair’s evidence.

</div> Indeed, this concern is consistent with the Testator’s apparent preference for succession by the male line, evinced in the Grandson Gift Clause, which was drafted in terms of the “male hereditary line” (see at [51] above). This belief system is of a piece with thinking that a grandson who is not brought up by one’s son is effectively lost to one’s patrilineal family. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 For these reasons, I do not accept Julian’s submission that for the purpose of the Custody Care and Control Requirement, Peng On had custody and care and control over him unless and until a formal legal determination was made otherwise. If Peng On had agreed with Julian’s mother that he would no longer have custody or care and control over Julian, that would mean that Julian does not satisfy that requirement. Such an agreement could have been made expressly or it could be implied from the conduct of the parents in terms of their arrangements for the child.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The date on which the Custody Care and Control Requirement must be satisfied is 21 years after the Testator’s death</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The next question is the date on which Julian must have satisfied the Custody Care and Control Requirement. As I have held that the Grandson Gift Clause must be construed to include in the class of eligible beneficiaries all pre-existing grandsons surviving the Testator and all grandsons born within 21 years of his death, it follows that any property interests and shares of the beneficiaries can only be ascertained at the date when the full class of beneficiaries may be determined – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 21 years after the Testator’s death, which is 21 October 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Julian argues instead that the date to adjudge whether he was in Peng On’s custody, care and control is the date of the Testator’s death. This would be correct if he was also correct that only grandsons born prior to the Testator’s death were included. However, he is not correct on that latter point. As the class includes grandsons born within 21 years after the Testator’s death, that class could not have closed upon the Testator’s death.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Nor do I consider that the date of adjudgment can be fixed at the date of the Testator’s death for pre-existing “surviving grandsons” but fixed at the end of the 21-year period for future grandsons born in that time period. This would mean that a pre-existing grandson who was in the custody and care and control of the Testator’s son at the time of the Testator’s death, but subsequently removed from that son’s custody and care and control, would remain eligible to inherit under the Grandson Gift Clause. Such a result would frustrate the testamentary intention behind the Custody Care and Control Requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 For completeness, I also reject Thomas’s submission that the Custody Care and Control Requirement is a continuing one which must be satisfied by the beneficiary as and when distribution of the Estate takes place, even <span class="font-italic">beyond</span> the 21-year period after the Testator’s death. That would not make sense. Property rights cannot be left perpetually in suspended animation or in limbo. There must be a definite date when a proprietary entitlement vests. Logically, that date must be when the complete class of qualifying beneficiaries can be drawn-up to ascertain the aliquot share of each beneficiary in the subject-matter of the Grandson Gift Clause (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 20% of the Estate). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Thomas’s view that the Custody Care and Control Requirement continues to run beyond the 21-year period after the Testator’s death would mean that, even at that date, a purported beneficiary’s entitlement (and, by extension, the relative share of every other beneficiary) would remain indeterminable and contingent upon potential future events (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the possible loss of custody or care and control). Moreover, if this were the case, then the date for adjudging whether the Custody Care and Control Requirement was satisfied would be left to the efficiency or otherwise of the executors. It would be a floating date. That cannot be the case. There must be a definite date when a proprietary right is ascertained and then vests. It is on that date that the validity of each purported beneficiary’s proprietary entitlement stands to be determined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Thus, Julian bears the burden of proving that he satisfied the Custody Care and Control Requirement as of 21 October 2013, being 21 years after the death of the Testator.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The evidence shows that Julian does not satisfy the Custody Care and Control Requirement</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Julian did not satisfy the Custody Care and Control Requirement 21 years after the Testator’s death</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Before 21 October 2013, Peng On had lost both custody and care and control over Julian. It is clear on the face of the divorce decree <span class="font-italic">nisi</span> rendered by the District Court in the Hong Kong Matrimonial Proceedings that custody of Julian was awarded to Julian’s mother on 22 October 1999 with reasonable access accorded to Peng On.

</div> At that time, Julian was between 17 and 18 years old. Thus, during Julian’s minority, Peng On ceased to have both custody and care and control over him. At the least, from 22 October 1999 onwards, his parental right (and responsibility) was limited to reasonable access. The decree of the Hong Kong District Court is relevant and indeed conclusive concerning the legal character of sole custody of Julian being granted to Julian’s mother as of the date of the decree: see s 43(2), EA 1893.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Julian argues that the Custody Care and Control Requirement does not apply to him as of 21 October 2013 because by then he had attained his majority. Thus, on that date, he as an adult could not have been in either parent’s custody or care and control. I do not agree that this is the right approach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 It simply cannot be reconciled with the text of the Custody Care and Control Requirement, which restricts the class of grandsons who qualify under the Grandson Gift Clause to “only those grandsons who are in the custody, care and control of my sons and does not include those grandsons who are no longer in the custody, care and control of my sons”.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The purpose behind the Custody Care and Control Requirement is to exclude grandsons who <span class="font-italic">do not</span> <span class="font-italic">remain</span> in the custody, care and control of the Testator’s sons when that parental relationship is relevant, namely during the child’s minority. That much is clear from the express negative phrasing that the class “does not include” grandsons who are “no longer in” such custody, care and control. To put that requirement another way, it requires positively that adult male-line grandsons, to be eligible to inherit, must have <span class="font-italic">remained</span> in the custody and care and control of the Testator’s sons during their minority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I do not read the Custody Care and Control Requirement as providing, for example, that a grandson who was raised under his mother’s sole custody and care and control for his entire minority is ineligible to inherit if the 21-year period ended while he was still a minor but is eligible to inherit if the 21-year period ended after he attained majority. That would not be a sensible reading of the Custody Care and Control Requirement and would not accord with the Testator’s intention as expressed in the Will and Codicil – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that a grandson who was not raised by his son is lost to his patrilineal household (see at [81] above) and his “male hereditary line” (see at [51] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Accordingly, I find that, in respect of an adult beneficiary such as Julian, the Custody Care and Control Requirement means that, during his minority, he must have been in the custody, care and control of the Testator’s son. As of 21 October 2013, this condition was not met, as Julian had been removed from Peng On’s custody, care and control no later than when the divorce decree <span class="font-italic">nisi</span> was rendered on 22 October 1999.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Hence, I find that Julian is not a qualifying beneficiary under the Will as he does not satisfy the Custody Care and Control Requirement in the Codicil. For completeness, I proceed to consider in the alternative whether Julian would qualify if the date of determination is not 21 years after the Testator’s death (21 October 2013), but instead the date of the Testator’s death (21 October 1992).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">In the alternative, Julian did not satisfy the Custody Care and Control Requirement at the time of the Testator’s death</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The out-of-court statements of Julian’s mother are inadmissible as evidence as no notice was provided of Thomas’s intention to rely on s 32(1) of the EA 1893</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Thomas seeks to rely on the out-of-court statements of Julian’s mother made in the course of the Hong Kong Matrimonial Proceedings for the truth of the matters set out therein (see [42] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The EA 1893 established an inclusionary regime.

</div>
</div> This was not done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Thomas’s counsel made a belated application for an extension of time to comply with O 15 r 16(7) of ROC 2021 by 29 January 2024. This was when the letter (copying Julian’s counsel) in Exhibit D3 was sent to the Supreme Court Registry, effectively amounting to a ‘s 32 notice’. As noted at [29] above, this oral application was made on the last day of trial in the middle of the Parties’ closing submissions after the Parties had closed their cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In exercising my discretion to grant an extension of time under O 3 r 4 of ROC 2021, I must consider the Ideals in O 3 r 1(2) and seek to achieve the Ideals in all my orders and directions (see O 3 r 1(3), ROC 2021). Given the serious prejudice that would be occasioned to Julian in the preparation of his case if this extension of time were granted at such a late stage of the proceedings, I deny the application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The purpose of requiring a party to provide notice of their intention to invoke s 32(1) of the EA 1893 is to give their party-opponent early warning of their intent to rely on hearsay evidence. The party-opponent will then have more time to consider their position properly and to make arguments on whether the s 32(1) exception is satisfied or not. This prevents a ‘trial by ambush’ scenario where the party-opponent is caught by surprise on a material evidentiary issue on the day of the trial itself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Here, by failing to give a ‘s 32 notice’ to Julian, Julian was deprived of the opportunity to consider how to rebut the truth of the hearsay facts alleged by Julian’s mother in her divorce petition filed in the Hong Kong Matrimonial Proceedings. Steps could have been taken, including contacting Julian’s mother during the case preparation stage to ask for her position on the truth of those out-of-court statements and admit her evidence if need be. None of these steps was possible since the ‘s 32 notice’ was not given on time. By the time the extension of time was sought, it was too late for Julian to take such steps.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 I do not agree with Thomas that this grave prejudice to Julian’s right to be heard and to make his case with fair warning of Thomas’s case is cured or mitigated by the fact that the divorce petition was included within Thomas’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief and had been provided to Thomas by Julian on 1 August 2023 pursuant to a disclosure order (see the order in HC/ORC 3292/2023 dated 19 July 2023).

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 There is a legal distinction between relying on the divorce petition to prove the <span class="font-italic">fact</span> that the Hong Kong Matrimonial Proceedings occurred, versus relying on Julian’s mother’s statements in the petition for the truth of the matters therein. This is a distinction that is central to the inclusionary scheme of the EA 1893. It is the difference between a fact which is <span class="font-italic">in itself</span> relevant – and hence, admissible under s 5 – as opposed to statements of relevant facts which are irrelevant and inadmissible thereunder (save for the exceptions in s 32) (see <span class="font-italic">Lee Chez Kee</span> at [67]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Julian was deprived of fair notice of Thomas’s intent to rely on Julian’s mother’s out-of-court statements for the truth of the matters therein. Julian had already closed his case by the time the ‘s 32 notice’ was served on him on 29 January 2024 and the extension of time was sought on 1 February 2024. The prejudice to his right to be heard and to make his case was incurable by that stage of the proceedings, at least not without disproportionate and prejudicial delay to the resolution of this matter. Hence, I deny Thomas’s extension of time application, to accord “fair access to justice” to Julian (O 3 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), ROC 2021) and advance “fair and practical results suited to the needs of the parties” (O 3 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>), ROC 2021).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The result is that Thomas has not fulfilled O 15 r 16(7) of ROC 2021. It is for this court to determine the consequences of any non–compliance with ROC 2021 (see O 3 r 2(4), ROC 2021). The guiding consideration is the extent to which non-compliance with the notice requirement caused prejudice to the opposing party, such that it would be unfair for the non-compliance to be waived (<span class="font-italic">Gimpex</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd and others and another appeal </span>[2015] 2 SLR 686 at [137]–[139]). In my view, it is not appropriate to cure the non-compliance by an exercise of the court’s discretion. To do so would be unfair to Julian, as the failure to provide the requisite notice prejudiced his ability to prepare his case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Thus, I do not allow Thomas to invoke the statutory exception under s 32(1) of the EA 1893 for non-compliance with the notice requirement in O 15 r 16(7). It follows that Julian’s mother’s out-of-court statements are inadmissible under s 5 of the EA 1893. I disregard them entirely in arriving at my findings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Julian has not discharged his burden of proof of showing, on the balance of probabilities, that he was in Peng On’s custody and care and control at the time of the Testator’s death</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Nonetheless, I find that Julian has not discharged his burden of proof of showing on the balance of probabilities that he satisfied the Custody Care and Control Requirement at the time of the Testator’s death (see s 103(1), EA 1893), which was 21 October 1992.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 It is clear that the Custody Care and Control Requirement is <span class="font-italic">conjunctive</span> – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Julian must show that Peng On had <span class="font-italic">both</span> custody <span class="font-italic">and</span> care and control at the appropriate date. The phrasing of the requirement supports this interpretation: it frames the need for the Testator’s son to have “custody, care and control” as one composite element. Julian’s counsel accepted this in his closing submissions.

</div> Hence, when the Testator passed away on 21 October 1992, Julian was residing with his mother in Japan, while Peng On was residing in Singapore away from both Julian and his mother. This was not a fleeting or transitory arrangement, such as a short-term overseas vacation. From January 1992 to December 1993, for nearly two years, Julian lived <span class="font-italic">solely</span> with his mother and not Peng On. It was not a situation where both parents, while separated from each other, lived in the same premises with the child or even nearby. Nor was it a situation where Julian shuttled regularly between his mother’s home and Peng On’s home. Neither Julian nor Peng On provided material on which I could find that Peng On was asserting or exercising any form of care and control over Julian as of 21 October 1992.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Thus, Julian’s care arrangements from January 1992 to December 1993 were such that one parent lived with and had sole care and control over him, while the parent without care and control lived overseas. That Julian kept in touch with Peng On through periodic phone calls does not change this fact.

</div> I do not accept Peng On’s evidence that his leaving Japan and ceasing to reside with Julian and his mother in Japan in January 1992 had nothing to do with the state of his relationship with Julian’s mother. I have found that he told his father that he was separated, a finding supported by a neutral witness, Mr Nair, who gave clear evidence of the Testator’s instructions that he had heard in 1992 that Peng On was “separated” from his wife and was concerned about Peng On not having custody, care and control over his son.

</div> As Mdm Kwok had given evidence that Peng On told the Testator at the February 1992 Lunch that he and his wife were “separated”, I asked Mdm Kwok if she could recall the exact words Peng On used at the time. She gave evidence that Peng On spoke to the Testator in Cantonese and used the words ‘<span class="font-italic">fan hoi </span><span class="font-italic">zoh</span>’, “which means ‘parted their ways’”.

</div> I consider Mdm Kwok’s evidence to lend further corroboration to my inference that Peng On did not cease to live with Julian and his mother in 1992 for work-related reasons but rather his moving to Singapore represented a parting of ways. Her evidence on this point was supported by the testimony of her daughter, Grace, that Peng On told the Testator he and his wife were “separated” in Cantonese.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 An additional point which undermines Peng On’s testimony that he was merely living in a different country for work related reasons is the fact that Peng On and Julian’s mother at no time resumed living together after January 1992 (when he left Japan for Singapore). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 I am also not able to accept Peng On’s testimony on points where there is no supporting evidence. This is because he had previously made a sweeping assertion on the question of custody, care and control at the time of the summary judgment application which turned out to be untrue. I infer that he was ready to brush the truth under the carpet in the expectation that no one would look beneath it.  Peng On averred in his statutory declaration dated 30 November 2022 (in support of Julian’s summary judgment application in HC/SUM 147/2023) that he was “surprised” by Thomas’s allegations that Julian did not satisfy the Custody Care and Control Requirement “because although Julian’s mother … and I divorced in 1999, Julian, our son, was and remained in, throughout his first 21 years, my custody, care and control”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This was simply not true, as the later disclosure of the divorce decree <span class="font-italic">nisi</span> dated 22 October 1999 proved. I am not able to accept that Peng On did not know the true position concerning custody when he made the statutory declaration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Accordingly, I find that on the date of the Testator’s death (21 October 1992), Peng On did not have care and control over Julian, who was in the sole care and control of his mother. Hence, Julian does not satisfy the Custody Care and Control Requirement <span class="font-italic">even if</span> the applicable date is the date of the death of the Testator and not – as I have found earlier – 21 years thereafter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 As for whether Peng On had custody of Julian together with Julian’s mother at that date, there was really no evidence at all of this fact other than Peng On’s assertion that he had merely come to Singapore for work and was only at that time physically separated from his wife, so that there had been, as of that time, no agreement or order to displace his default joint custody as a parent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Overall, I find Peng On’s evidence to be unsatisfactory. In addition to my earlier reasons for finding Peng On not to be a credible witness (see at [119] above), other aspects of his evidence left much to be desired. During cross-examination, he made broad statements and exhibited pre-emptive exasperation with the cross-examiner that suggested he was either unable or unwilling to descend into proper details that would substantiate his bare assertions of his continuous custody, care and control over Julian. He kept repeating this stock phrase even in response to cross-examination questions concerning entirely different points.

</div> In the absence of objective evidence of his participation in major decisions for Julian at that time, I am not able to find that he continued to have custody of Julian after he left the matrimonial home in January 1992. I have found that Peng On told his father at the February 1992 Lunch that he was separated from his wife and was not living in a different country for work reasons only (see at [63] and [116]–[117] above), contrary to what he has claimed in his evidence.
