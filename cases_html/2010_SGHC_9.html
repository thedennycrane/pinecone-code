        Choo Han Teck J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is a partnership in the
                    business of operating karaoke pubs. It operates a small pub in a shop-house
                    at 31 Lorong 15 Geylang, Singapore 388617 under the name/sign
                    “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span> Myths KTV DISCO PUB”. In English,
                “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>” is read as “Shen Hua”.
                    The plaintiff is also the registered proprietor of the trade mark
                    “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span> KTV and DISCO PUB”, registered on
                    19 March 2007. The plaintiff’s trade mark was registered with the
                    simplified Chinese character for “Hua”, but the actual name/sign
                    used by the plaintiff in practice employs the traditional character. The
                    defendant is a sole proprietorship also in the business of, operating
                        <em>inter alia</em>, karaoke lounges – one of
                    which is a large, upscale karaoke night club at 150 Orchard Road, #09-01/02
                    Orchard Plaza, Singapore 238841 under the name/sign of “Mirage <span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span> Palace Exclusive Niteclub”. I shall refer to
                    the two lounges in question as “pubs” for the sake of convenience
                    and consistency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Sometime in late 2005, the plaintiff decided to
                    venture into the karaoke entertainment business in Singapore, and on
                    6 December 2005 it registered a partnership under the name “Myths
                    KTV &amp; Disco Pub”. In early 2006, the defendant’s Mr Ronald
                    Quek Teng Guan (“Mr Quek”) also decided to start a karaoke
                    pub in Singapore. After sourcing for an appropriate location, the defendant
                    began fitting out its premises at Orchard Plaza in early October 2006, using the
                    name “Mirage <span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span> Palace Exclusive Niteclub” and
                    variations of the same. The sole proprietorship under the name “Mirage
                    Deluxe KTV &amp; Nightclub” was registered on 22 November
                    2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In late January 2007, the two parties became
                    aware of each other’s existence and business presence. The plaintiff
                    asked the defendant to cease using its registered trade mark through a
                    middleman. Sceptical of the plaintiff’s request, Mr Quek conducted a
                    search for any trade mark using the name “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>”. When nothing came up, Mr Quek applied to register the trade mark
                    “Mirage <span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>  Palace Exclusive Niteclub” on 7
                    February 2007. The application, however, was eventually abandoned because
                    there were issues with the defendant’s use of the word
                    “Mirage” – it was too similar to a separate trade mark owned
                    by MGM Mirage. Subsequently, the plaintiff successfully applied to register its
                    trade mark “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span> KTV and DISCO PUB” on
                    19 March 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In 2009, pursuant to a letter of demand sent by
                    the plaintiff on 30 January 2009, the parties entered into discussions
                    vis-à-vis the defendant’s use of the words
                    “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>” in its business name. It was
                    hoped that a compromise could be reached concerning mutual use. Unfortunately,
                    these discussions eventually fell through. In a letter dated
                    16 February 2009, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff denying any
                    infringement of the plaintiff’s trade mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff’s claim against the
                    defendant is founded on two separate heads of action. One relates to the
                    defendant’s alleged infringement of the plaintiff’s trade mark,
                    while the other concerns the defendant’s alleged passing off its
                    business as the plaintiff’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiff is relying on s 27 of the
                    Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to argue
                    that the defendant infringed its trade mark by using the words
                    “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>” in its business sign. Its
                    alternative claims run into double digits, but it appears to me that the
                    plaintiff’s primary cause of action for infringement of trade mark falls
                    to be governed by ss 27(1)–(2) of the Act. These provide as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Acts amounting to infringement of registered trade
                            mark</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>27</b>. —(1) A person infringes a
                        registered trade mark if, without the consent of the proprietor of the trade
                        mark, he uses in the course of trade a sign which is identical with the
                        trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those
                        for which it is registered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) A person infringes a registered trade mark if, without
                        the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark, he uses in the course of
                        trade a sign where because —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) the sign is identical with the trade mark and is used in relation
                            to goods or services similar to those for which the trade mark is
                            registered; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the sign is similar to the trade mark and is used in relation to
                            goods or services identical with or similar to those for which the trade
                            mark is registered,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       I do not think s 27(1) and s 27(2)(a)
                    are applicable. The disputed signs are far from identical. The plaintiff’s
                    registered trade mark countenances merely the handwritten words
                    “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span> KTV and DISCO PUB”. The
                    defendant’s business logo, used on its premises and name card,
                    comprises a complex motif of English words, traditional Chinese characters and
                    stylized border graphics. Even taking the plaintiff’s non-registered signs
                    and marks into consideration, (including the extremely functional
                    business sign above the entrance to the plaintiff’s pub and its name
                    card) the defendant’s sign still falls far short of being identical with
                    the plaintiff’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiff’s best case, therefore,
                    would have to be under s 27(2)(b): namely, that the defendant is alleged to
                    have used in the course of trade the sign “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>”
                    — a sign which is <em>similar</em> to the registered
                    trade mark in question and used in relation to goods or services <em>similar</em> to those for which the trade mark is registered,
                    resulting in a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. In the High
                    Court decision of <em>The Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop In Department
                        Store Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 4 SLR 816 (“<em>The Polo Case</em>”), Lai Kew Chai J made some
                    useful observations on the similarity of mark, at [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The decided cases suggest that there are <em>three aspects
                            to similarity: visual, aural or phonetic, and conceptual</em>. In
                        terms of visual similarity, it is clear that the mark and the sign share one
                        common denominator: the word “POLO”. <em>In
                            cases where there is a common denominator, it is important to look at
                            the differences between the mark and the sign in order to decide whether
                            the challenged sign has been able to distinguish itself sufficiently and
                            substantially</em>: <em>The European Limited v The
                            Economist Newspapers Limited</em> [1996] FSR 431 at 436; see also
                            <em>Kerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade
                            Names</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2001) at
                        paras 16-63 to 16-67. In <em>Samsonite Corp v Montres
                            Rolex SA</em> [1995] AIPR 244 (“<em>Samsonite Corp</em>”) at 270, it was held that just
                        because the registered mark was wholly included in the challenged sign, it
                        did not mean that it would necessarily cause confusion between the two. In
                            <em>Polo Textile Industries Pty Ltd v Domestic Textile
                            Corporation Pty Ltd</em> (1993) 26 IPR 246 (“<em>Polo Textiles</em>”) at 250, Burchett J
                        emphasised that decisions, which held that the taking of a word mark and
                        adding to it an additional word constituted infringement, should not be
                        applied mechanically such that no added word could ever save such a taking
                        from infringement. <em>In other words, sometimes, looking at
                            the challenged sign as a whole, the distinctiveness of the
                            registered word mark is dissolved by the addition of the word.
                            Accordingly, the similarity between the mark and the sign is
                            significantly diminished and may be insufficient to cause a likelihood
                            of confusion</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In my view, the visual and conceptual
                    differences between the plaintiff’s registered mark and the
                    defendant’s sign are obvious and plentiful. The plaintiff’s mark
                    uses the simplified Chinese characters “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>”
                    the defendant’s sign uses the traditional characters
                    “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>”. The plaintiff’s mark includes
                    not just the relevant Chinese characters but also the entire phrase
                    “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>” KTV and DISCO PUB”; the
                    defendant’s sign comprises the entire phrase “Mirage <span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>  Palace Exclusive Niteclub.” The
                    plaintiff’s mark is a handwritten notation without any characteristic or
                    distinguishing graphical representation; the defendant’s sign, on the
                    other hand, involves the consistent use of stylized lettering, borders and
                    graphics in an “intricate arabesque rhombus design.” From a
                    cursory inspection of the two signs – and even a “mark for
                    sign” comparison with the unregistered “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span> Myths KTV DISCO PUB” business sign used on the premises of the
                    plaintiff’s pub (see <em>Compass Publishing BV v
                        Compass Logistics Ltd</em> [2004] EWHC 520, where it was held
                    that the proper comparison is with a notional and fair use of the registered
                    mark in question) – it is clear that the defendant’s use is not
                    visually or conceptually similar to the plaintiff’s trade
                mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     A greater matter of concern, however, is the
                        <em>aural</em> similarity between the two signs. As
                    businesses catering to the Mandarin-speaking demographic in Singapore, it would
                    not be surprising if the respective clientele of the two karaoke pubs were to
                    refer to either or both of the institutions with merely the phonetic sound
                    “Shen Hua”. In <em>Morcream Products Ltd v
                        Heatherfresh (Foods) Ltd</em> [1972] RPC 799 (“<em>Heatherfresh</em>”), the allegedly infringing mark was
                    too close to “Everfresh”, but on telephone only; an injunction was
                    therefore granted specifically against business on telephone. More recently
                    in <em>Northern Foods Grocery Group Ltd’s Community Trade
                        Mark Application; sub nom. FOX’S Trade Mark</em> [2002]
                    ETMR 48, two marks different in appearance were nonetheless held
                    sufficiently similar to the ear for one to block the registration of the other.
                    The decision was largely based on the fact that German speakers would <em>pronounce</em> the two marks – FOX’S and FUCHS
                    – very similarly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     We therefore have a case of <em>prima facie</em> aural similarity, given the exact same pronunciation
                    of “Shen Hua” in both the plaintiff’s and the
                    defendant’s usages. However, as has been noted, the plaintiff’s mark
                    specifically consists of the entire phrase “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span> KTV and
                    DISCO PUB”. This should be borne in mind when we consider the likelihood
                    of confusion on the part of the public. With respect to the goods and services
                    provided by the plaintiff and the defendant, it is clear that the basic services
                    provided by both businesses are similar. The defendant attempted to distinguish
                    the two by arguing that “both businesses are not in fact similar by
                    reason of the difference in locality, scale, clientele and price points”.
                    It draws the analogy that “an open-air restaurant serving Chinese cooked
                    food at the foot of a HDB block will not be considered similar in
                    business to a fine dining restaurant serving exquisite Chinese food in a
                    five-star hotel”. I appreciate this reasoning, but it seems to me that
                    this factor is more properly an issue regarding confusion on the part of the
                    public. The two karaoke pubs here might cater to different categories of clients
                    but both carry on the basic business of karaoke lounges – just as an
                    open-air restaurant is similar to a fine dining restaurant in that they both
                    provide a dining experience. Businessmen should not be required to draw fine
                    distinctions between sub-business types within the broader realm of
                    “normal” business types. They should not have to force
                    themselves and the public into the melee of justifying, say, a shoe retail for
                    the proletariat, computer servicing for women, or an airline for the
                    budget-conscious, despite the ostensible similarities of each of these with a
                    higher end establishment in the same line. To my mind, these fine distinctions
                    can be very arbitrary and are, in any case, impractical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     I turn now to the issue of confusion on the
                    part of the public. “Shen Hua”, as we know, is a common aural
                    denominator in both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s usages. Yet
                    the phonetic phrase “Shen Hua” in itself has little effect. Once
                    at the pub in question, a prospective client will have no misgivings as to
                    whether he was at the right pub or not. This is an important difference with the
                    situation in <em>Heatherfresh</em>, where the
                    business in question was actually solicited and conducted over telephone.
                    Any likelihood of confusion here is therefore easily dissipated the minute
                    customers turn up at either the plaintiff’s Geylang outlet or the
                    defendant’s Orchard premises. Customers patronizing the Geylang outlet
                    (when he wanted to go to the Orchard premises) or the Orchard premises (when he
                    wanted to go to the Geylang outlet), would be doing so with full knowledge of
                    the existence of the obvious alternative. This is clear given how different the
                    Orchard and Geylang establishments are in terms of façade and
                    presentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In this regard, <em>The Polo
                        Case</em> is instructive once more:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    Furthermore, it appears to me that the
                            plaintiff’s claim that there will be confusion is purely
                            speculative. The evidence tendered by the plaintiff admitted that its
                            products are sold in a selective manner in five boutiques managed and
                            operated by its sole distributor and in five other
                            “corners” located within segregated areas of various
                            department stores. The location of these retail spaces are in the very
                            nerve of the country’s shopping district: Takashimaya, Raffles
                            City Shopping Centre and Suntec City Mall. This is in stark contrast to
                            the defendant, which operates out of five stores located in far
                            less glamorous places outside the central shopping strip. <em>The target market of the plaintiff is the upper
                                middle-class and possibly upwards, and the prices of its goods
                                reflect its sophisticated image. On the other hand, the defendant
                                targets mostly lower-income earners</em>. When asked whether
                            it was realistic to suggest that a T-shirt costing $7.90 or $12.90 could
                            ever be a product of the plaintiff, Ms Nah answered in the
                            negative. Ms Nah also admitted that the plaintiff packages its
                            goods in an attractive paper bag.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38    … Taking all these circumstances into
                            account, it is far-fetched to suggest that confusion could ever arise
                            even in the simplest of minds and that, at best, the likelihood of
                            confusion is a mere possibility and not a real one.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The excerpt above is directly on point. The
                    defendant’s karaoke establishment singles out big spenders as its
                    prospective clientele; the plaintiff’s pub targets lower- to middle-income
                    earners. The defendant’s establishment is situated along Orchard Road,
                    “in the very nerve of the country’s shopping district”; the
                    plaintiff’s pub is located in a much less glamorous area in Geylang.
                    The prices of alcohol, and indeed the primary type of alcohol consumed at the
                    defendant’s establishment are very different from those imbibed at the
                    plaintiff’s pub. More broadly, the defendant’s establishment is more
                    sophisticated and operates on a larger, more glamorous scale than the
                    plaintiff’s pub. The plaintiff’s pub does not even have a drinks
                    list.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff produced Mr Teng Khoon Hai
                    (“Mr Teng”), a regular customer, to attest to the fact that
                    he had been confused by the two signs:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When I <em>saw</em> the Plaintiff’s KTV, I was
                        under the impression that the Plaintiff’s KTV and the
                        Defendant’s KTV was owned by the same entity due to the use of the
                        word “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>” by the Plaintiff’s KTV and
                        “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>” by the Defendant’s KTV. They
                        mean the same in Mandarin. It is also common to use Mandarin in KTVs and
                        most of the crowd in the Plaintiff’s KTV and the Defendant’s KTV
                        are from the Chinese community.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Ostensibly, this would be evidence of the relevant confusion required
                    under the Act – confusion as to the origin of the product or service. In
                    this connection, however, there were three crucial points. First, apart from
                    Mr Teng, there was no other survey of customers carried out to
                    assess the degree of confusion amongst members of the relevant public.
                    Second, Mr Teng’s evidence goes towards visual similarity, which, in
                    my view, was not relevant on the facts of this case. Third, Mr Teng was
                    confused because he thought that the plaintiff’s pub and the
                    defendant’s establishment were owned by the same entity. It is
                    significant, however, that following his first visit to the defendant’s
                    establishment in August 2007, Mr Teng never know of the existence of the
                    plaintiff’s pub until he visited it more than a year later in
                    October/November 2008. For a customer as regular as Mr Teng, this indicates
                    the minimal similarity which the plaintiff’s usage had with that of the
                    defendant’s. Accordingly, the risk of confusion on the part of the public
                    between the two was unlikely to have been significant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Given all of the above considerations, it is
                    my view that the likelihood of confusion between the disputed signs –
                    based solely of the phonetic coincidence of “Shen Hua” – is
                    negligible. In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful that the
                    plaintiff’s mark specifically consists of the entire phrase
                    “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span> KTV and DISCO PUB” and not just the
                    aural pronunciation of “Shen Hua”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In <em>Pan-West (Pte) Ltd v
                        Grand Bigwin Pte</em> Ltd [2003] 4 SLR 755, the
                    “oft-cited trinity of requirements for a passing off action” was
                    held to comprise of goodwill, misrepresentation and damage. To succeed in its
                    action for passing off here, therefore, the plaintiff must establish <em>all</em> of the following elements:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">That the plaintiff has acquired <em>goodwill</em> in the goods or services provided by
                            it;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">That the defendant has made a <em>misrepresentation</em> to the public leading or likely to
                            lead the public to believe that goods or services provided by the
                            defendant are those of the plaintiff’s; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">That there has been <em>damage</em> or likelihood of damage to the plaintiff’s
                            goodwill as a result of the misrepresentation.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">I will examine each criterion in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     “Goodwill” has been and is often
                    described as “the attractive force which brings in custom”: see
                        <em>IRC v Muller &amp; Co’s Margarine Ltd</em>
                    [1901] AC. 217 at 224. Andrew Phang J added to this definition in
                        <em>Nation Fittings (M) Sdn Bhd v Oystertec Plc</em>
                    [2006] 1 SLR 712 (“<em>Nation
                        Fittings</em>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">158    Reviewing the evidence as a whole, I begin with
                            the proposition that mere sales <em>without
                                more</em> are not necessarily coincident with goodwill. That
                            is both logically as well as conceptually coherent. The plaintiff is on
                            more solid ground when it points to the distinctiveness of its own
                                <em>ribbed</em> pipe
                        fittings…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Something <em>more</em> is therefore
                    required, above and beyond normal operating sales, to denote “the
                    attractive force which brings in custom.” “Custom” alone is
                    insufficient. The plaintiff’s profit and loss records for the years
                    2007 and 2008, as such, do little to establish the necessary goodwill required
                    for a passing off action. Despite the plaintiff’s assertion that it had
                    acquired substantial goodwill in the Chinese characters
                    “<span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span>” through usage and trading since 2005,
                    it was unable to produce its sales records for the years 2005 and
                2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In <em>Nation
                        Fittings</em>, the plaintiff’s ribbed pipe fittings —
                    supposedly harbouring “distinctiveness” as noted by Andrew
                    Phang J above, — were held to be too functional and generic to amount
                    to the “something more” required for the generation of the
                    relevant goodwill. Similarly, here, there has been no evidence of
                    “something more” in the business of the plaintiff to
                    exemplify the required goodwill. No advertisements were produced in court,
                    despite claims of publicity by the plaintiff, nor were there any witnesses
                    attesting to the goodwill or reputation of the plaintiff’s pub. Indeed,
                    the plaintiff’s own witness appeared to have been unaware of the
                    plaintiff’s pub until he actually visited it in 2008, more than a year
                    after his visit to the defendant’s establishment and more than three years
                    since the alleged accumulation of goodwill in the plaintiff’s pub began:
                    see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above. Accordingly, I find that the
                    plaintiff has failed to establish the existence of goodwill for an action for
                    passing off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For the purposes of a passing off action,
                    whether the misrepresentation in question was intended or inadvertent is
                    unimportant — what matters is whether or not the public was misled by the
                    misrepresentation. However, there is a caveat to this ostensibly permissive
                    test. As Graham J observed in the English High Court decision of <em>Benchairs Limited v Chair Centre Limited</em> [1974]
                    RPC 429 at 435:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Anyone is entitled, subject to some monopoly or statutory right preventing
                        him, to copy and sell any article on the market, and false representation
                        and <em>passing off only arise when a defendant does
                            something further which suggests that the article which he is selling is
                            that of the plaintiff</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">This was cited with approval by Andrew Phang J in <em>Nation Fittings</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Further, in <em>Tong Guan Food
                        Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1991] SLR 133, Yong Pung How CJ set out the following in addressing
                    the issue of the relevant “public” in a passing off action, at
                    141:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law is settled and there is a series of cases for the following
                        propositions from the last century to the present. The test to be applied
                        has been stated in <em>Newsweek Inc</em> v <em>British Broadcasting Corporation</em> [1979] RPC 441 at
                        p 447 which is <em>whether ordinary sensible members of
                            the public would be confused</em>. It is not sufficient that the
                        only confusion would be to a very small unobservant section of society or as
                        Foster J put it recently, if the only person who would be misled would
                        be a moron in a hurry. It is sufficient that a substantial proportion of
                        persons who are probably purchasers of the goods of the kind in question
                        would in fact be confused. Whether or not there is misrepresentation is
                        always a question of fact to be determined by the court in the light of
                        evidence of surrounding circumstances. <em>The impression is
                            entirely a matter for the judgment of the court and not that of the
                            witnesses</em>. All that can be done is to ascertain in every case
                        as it occurs whether there is such a resemblance as to deceive a purchaser
                        using ordinary caution.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Applying the various considerations above to
                    the present facts, I find that the defendant had not “do[ne] something
                    further which suggest[ed] that the [service] which he [was offering] [was] that
                    of the plaintiff” (<em>per</em> Graham J
                    above). Indeed, as a matter of logic from the viewpoint of an “ordinary,
                    sensible member of the public”, this would not have been the case. The
                    defendant, with an obviously much classier establishment and a more lucrative
                    business along Orchard Road, was not likely to represent itself as an
                    affiliate of the plaintiff’s pub, which, from the evidence, was an
                    obviously lower grade operation located in one of Singapore’s designated
                    red-light areas.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I also find that while Mr Teng attested
                    to being confused as to the ownership of the two establishments, this was the
                    sole supporting opinion; there was little else to support his testimony. On the
                    whole, I am not at all impressed by Mr Teng’s evidence. In <em>Jumbo Seafood Pte Ltd and Another v Hong Kong Jumbo Seafood
                        Restaurant Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 1 SLR 860, a case cited by
                    the plaintiff, a survey amongst members of the public was conducted to adduce
                    evidence of confusion on the part of the public. The survey showed that 40% of
                    those surveyed were confused in that they thought the defendant’s
                    restaurant was associated with the plaintiffs’. Accordingly,
                    misrepresentation there was held to have been made out. There was no such survey
                    in evidence here. I am of the view that on the present facts there is no risk of
                    an “ordinary sensible member of the public” being confused in the
                    same way as Mr Teng was by the defendant’s
                    “misrepresentation”. It is unlikely that the defendant, with
                    15,000 square feet of classy décor and a business attracting wealthier
                    individuals, would have any desire to represent that it has any connection to
                    the plaintiff’s relatively unsophisticated establishment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The final element of the three-fold criteria
                    for founding an action in passing off is damage, either sustained or
                    prospective. In the event of prospective damage, the plaintiff has to show that
                    this damage is a matter of <em>probability</em>, and not
                    mere possibility. This aspect is easily disposed of. There is no evidence before
                    me of any actual damage suffered by the plaintiff or of any probable damage
                    likely to be suffered. In fact, the plaintiff’s profits have increased
                    from approximately $120,000 in 2007 to $220,000 in 2008 — despite the
                    defendant having been in business during those two years. It is of course
                    open to the plaintiff to run the argument that its earnings could have been much
                    higher had the defendant not passed off its business as the
                    plaintiff’s, but there is a dearth of evidence for such a
                    contention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As a matter of principle, it is true that a
                    defendant cannot avoid a finding of passing off by the mere fact that its goods
                    or services are of as good or better quality than the plaintiff’s. In the
                    English High Court decision of <em>Irvine v Talksport
                        Ltd</em> [2002] 2 All ER 414 (“<em>Talksport</em>”), Laddie J observed at [34] that</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the purpose of a passing off action is to vindicate the
                        claimant's exclusive right to goodwill and to protect it against damage.
                        When a defendant sells his inferior goods in substitution for the
                        claimant's, there is no difficulty in a court finding that there is passing
                        off. The substitution damages the goodwill and therefore the value of it to
                        the claimant. The passing off action is brought to protect the claimant's
                        property. But goodwill will be protected even if there is no immediate
                        damage in the above sense. For example, it has long been recognised that a
                        defendant can not avoid a finding of passing off by showing that his goods
                        or services are of as good or better quality than the claimant's. In such a
                        case, <em>although the defendant may not damage the goodwill
                            as such, what he does is damage the value of the goodwill to the
                            claimant because, instead of benefiting from exclusive rights to his
                            property, the latter now finds that someone else is squatting on it. It
                            is for the owner of goodwill to maintain, raise or lower the quality of
                            his reputation or to decide who, if anyone, can use it alongside
                            him</em>. The ability to do that is compromised if another can use
                        the reputation or goodwill without his permission and as he likes. Thus
                        Fortnum &amp; Mason is no more entitled to use the name F W Woolworth than F
                        W Woolworth is entitled to use the name Fortnum &amp; Mason.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, Laddie J’s exhortations do not apply here. The
                    plaintiff, unlike Mr Eddie Irvine, has not shown that it harbours the
                    appropriate goodwill required for a passing off action. It has also not produced
                    any credible evidence of any genuine misrepresentation. Finally, no actual or
                    probable damage to the plaintiff was made out by the plaintiff on the facts. In
                    short, none of the three threshold requirements for a passing off action have
                    been met, and to that extent any discussion of “who, if anyone, can use
                    [the plaintiff’s mark] alongside him” must necessarily be
                    premature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Far from “squatting” on the
                    “property” of the plaintiff, the defendant appears to have carved
                    out a brand name of its own under the “Mirage <span><img align="center" src="data:image/png;base64," style="height:14pt;width:36pt;"/></span> Palace Exclusive Niteclub” sign, attracting well-shod individuals with
                    its own brand of sophisticated nightlife entertainment. Significantly, the
                    plaintiff’s own Enquiry Report, commissioned by its solicitors to survey
                    the defendant’s pub, states that “the KTV located at Orchard Plaza
                    appears more popular”. I do not think that the defendant can fairly be
                    said to have transgressed into the plaintiff’s area of business. Indeed,
                    if anything the similarity in signs is more likely to result in the dilution and
                    tarnishment of the defendant’s “property”, given the
                    location of the plaintiff’s pub. It is a far cry from the opportunistic
                    poaching that was at the core of the litigation in <em>Talksport</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In view of all the above considerations, the
                    plaintiff’s claim is hereby dismissed. I will hear arguments on costs at a
                    later date.</p>
