</div> Sometime in the middle of 2019, the Plaintiffs discovered from searching the records of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) that the shareholding of Invest Ho had changed. On discovering the changes in shareholding, the Plaintiffs issued a letter of demand to the Defendants, requesting that they rectify the shareholding position so as to uphold an alleged agreement between the Ho Brothers. The Defendants did not accede to the Plaintiffs’ request. Following failed attempts to resolve the matter, the Plaintiffs commenced the present suit.

Discussions were held between the Plaintiffs, the Defendants, Patrick Ho and Steven Ho. HAS did not participate in these discussions as he was not on good terms with HSF and HSK at the time. According to the Plaintiffs, they and the Defendants agreed to enter into a “50/50 joint venture with Patrick and Steven” Ho, and to use Invest Ho as the joint venture company instead of incorporating a new company.

</div> From the ACRA business profile, the Plaintiff discovered that their 930,000 shares (310,000 shares per each Plaintiff) had been transferred to HSF without their knowledge, consent or authorization. This left HSF as the largest shareholder in Invest Ho with 1,240,000 shares, while HSK held 950,000 shares and Peng Zuo continued to hold 310,000 shares. When questioned, HSF admitted that he had changed the ACRA records, but failed to give the Plaintiffs any reasonable or cogent explanation as to why he had brought about this wrongful transfer of the Plaintiffs’ shares.

The defendants to the bank’s claim were parties who had the benefit of the shipbuilding contract with the shipbuilder. One of the preliminary issues which the court had to consider was whether the bank’s claim was limited to Hull 1118, as the bank argued that its pleadings were sufficient to claim an interest in both Hull 1118 and Hull 1117. In rejecting the bank’s argument, the court held (at [42]) that the defendants would be prejudiced if the bank’s claim were to be extended to Hull 1117, as the defendants had quite reasonably taken the bank’s pleadings at face value, and those pleadings had asserted a claim only in respect of Hull 1118 whereas Hull 1117 was referred to in merely as background. The court further noted (at [43]) that the end of trial was too late an occasion for the bank to resile from its pleaded position: allowing the bank to do so at that stage would have deprived the defendants of all opportunity to rebut the bank’s case on Hull 1117 and would have caused them real prejudice.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the present case, having reviewed the Defendants’ pleadings and also their affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), while the Defendants did allude very briefly in their pleaded Defence to challenging the Plaintiffs’ characterisation of the loan facilities obtained for Invest Ho’s benefit

In the circumstances, it is plain that the Plaintiffs will sustain grave and irreparable prejudice if the Defendants are allowed to put forward at the end of trial new allegations and purported new evidence in respect of the 7 Jalan Chorak property and the OCBC overdraft said to have been obtained from providing the property as collateral.

This can be derived from what was said or done by the settlor, and there must be clear evidence of an intention to create a trust (<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span> at [52]). <span class="font-italic">Per </span>the CA in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>no particular form of expression is necessary for such an intention to be evinced. In determining if there is certainty of intention, the focus of the courts is “on whether it was possible and appropriate to infer an intention to create a trust by looking at evidence not only of the alleged settlor’s words and conduct, but also of the surrounding circumstances and the interpretation of any agreements that might have been entered into” (<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale </span>at [58]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In <span class="font-italic">TWG Tea</span>, for example, one of the issues before the court was whether the ex-CEO of the plaintiff TWG Tea (one “Manoj”) held the domain name <span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">www.twgtea.com</span> on express trust for TWG Tea. The court found (at [41]-[53]) that there was certainty of intention to create a trust. In so finding, the court had regard to evidence of a meeting between Manoj and other officers of TWG Tea, where it was agreed to set up a separate entity for the tea business named TWG Tea – and where Manoj informed the other officers that the domain name “TWG Tea” was registered, even though he had registered the domain name in his personal capacity previously. In the court’s view, the evidence showed that Manoj “had regarded the Domain Name would and did belong to TWG Tea, consistent with the parties’ intentions and agreement to treat it as such” (at [43]). This was because Manoj had emailed the other officers to state that he had “renewed <span class="font-italic">our</span> domain <span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">www.twgtea.com</span> for 3 years”; he had registered other domain names that benefitted TWG Tea and informed the other officers that those other domains were “registered for <span class="font-italic">us</span>”; he had signed a declaration letter stating that the domain <span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">www.twgtea.com</span> was the property of TWG Tea and that he would transfer the ownership of the domain name to TWG Tea; and TWG Tea had invested significant time and resources in building the website at the domain “TWG Tea”, and anchored all their online business activities there.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In contrast, in <span class="font-italic">Lau Yaw Ben v Lau Ween </span><span class="font-italic">Hion and another </span>[2022] SGHC 130, the court found (at [25]) that there was no express trust created in the plaintiff’s favour over the disputed property, as the plaintiff had failed to adduce any evidence in writing to support a declaration of such a trust – and could only rely on his averments in his own affidavit to support the claim of an express trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As for certainty of subject matter, this requires that the trust must define with sufficient certainty the assets which are to be held on trust and the kind of interest that the beneficiaries are to take in them. For the definition to be sufficiently certain, it must enable the trustees or the court to execute the trust according to the settlor’s intention (<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span> at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The third certainty, certainty in the definition of the objects of the trust, requires that the intended beneficiaries be identifiable, so that it is possible to ascertain the people who have the standing to enforce the trustee’s duties under the trust (<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale </span>at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-justify font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether an express trust was created over the disputed shares pursuant to the 1995 Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In the present case, the Plaintiffs posit first of all that it was pursuant to the 1995 Agreement that an express trust was created over the disputed shares in their favour (and Peng Zuo’s). I do not think this is correct. It is clear from the Plaintiffs’ own pleadings that the 1995 Agreement did not involve Peng Zuo or his late father HAS. The Plaintiffs’ pleaded position in relation to the 1995 Agreement was that the Defendants would hold the shares on trust for the <span class="font-italic">Plaintiffs</span>: <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the 1995 Agreement excluded HAS and did not contemplate him – or his son Peng Zuo – having any share of Invest Ho.

</div> Critically, however, the 2012 Company Resolution fails to make any mention at all of payment having to be made by the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo for their shares.

This appeared to me to be a disingenuous attempt to explain away the absence of any reference to payment in the 2012 Company Resolution signed by all six individuals. Had there truly been a sale of shares by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo, it is entirely unbelievable that a $4,166,666.67 sale price should have gone completely unmentioned – especially when, on the Defendants’ own telling, this significant amount was to have been paid “within 6 months of the day that the shares were transferred”.

The signed share transfer forms which were adduced in evidence showed that 310,000 shares were to be transferred to HST, HSW, Edwin and Peng Zuo each.

</div> These share transfer forms, which were dated 1 March 2017 described HSF as the transferor in each case, while the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo were described as the transferees: <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, HSF was not described as the seller, nor were the Plaintiffs and Peng Zuo described as the purchasers, of the shares.

</div> I find no merit in this argument. In my view, there was no reason for the Plaintiffs to engage HSF vis-à-vis his WhatsApp messages and his 11 August 2018 letter because these communications were clearly the outpouring of a great deal of anger and resentment by HSF against the Plaintiffs – a tirade, in short. I do not think the Plaintiffs’ decision not to respond to such communications could or should be taken as an indication of their agreement with his accusations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 As for the new allegations and evidence which the Defendants tried to introduce <span class="font-italic">via </span>their closing submissions, I have made clear my views and findings on this matter (see [50]-[60] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In my view, the Plaintiffs’ contributions to Invest Ho constitute evidence tending to support their claim of equal beneficial ownership of Invest Ho. In the absence of a shared understanding as to this equal beneficial ownership, there would have been no reason for the Plaintiffs to take on risks and potential liabilities which only benefited Invest Ho.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In the interests of completeness, I should make it clear that in considering the Plaintiffs’ contributions to Invest Ho, I did not ultimately take into account HSW’s assertion that 82 Boundary Road had always been his personal property and that his act of putting this property up as security for a loan from LSH Capital to Invest Ho represented his personal contribution to Invest Ho

</div>. In my view, the documentary evidence available tended to support the Defendants’ contention that HSW had from the outset held 82 Boundary Road on trust for them and that the trust was revoked only in order to comply with LSH Capital’s requirements vis-à-vis the security to be put up for the loan. From the records available, it would appear that although 82 Boundary Road was transferred from the two Defendants to HSW pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement,

</div> there was no documentary evidence of HSW actually paying the stipulated sale price of $750,000. On the same day that the sale and purchase agreement was executed (27 November 2002), HSW also signed a declaration of trust declaring that he held 82 Boundary Road on trust for the Defendants, and that in the event of a sale, he was to return to the Defendants the net profits from such sale. This document was witnessed by a solicitor.

</div> Additionally, while the parties subsequently executed statutory declarations on 24 July 2018 declaring that HSW no longer held the property on trust for the Defendants, it is suggestive that these statutory declarations came about shortly after LSH Capital’s offer of the term loan facility to Invest Ho.

</div>
</div> To my mind, the timing of these statutory declarations tends to support the Defendants’ narrative, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>that they had retained beneficial ownership of 82 Boundary Road even after the sale and purchase agreement of 27 November 2002, and had only executed the statutory declarations of 24 July 2018 in order to facilitate the use of the property as security for the LSH Capital loan.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 I should stress that given the evidence available of other contributions by the Plaintiffs to Invest Ho (see [92]-[98] above), the views I express in the preceding paragraph have no material effect on my finding that the Plaintiffs did collectively contribute to Invest Ho. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Certainty of intention to create a trust: Summary of findings</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In light of my findings at [72]-[100] above in relation to the 2012 Agreement, the 2017 share transfers and the Plaintiffs’ contributions to Invest Ho, I find that the Plaintiffs have established the element of certainty of intention required for proving an express trust.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">An express trust in favour of the Plaintiffs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In respect of the Plaintiffs’ claim of an express trust, therefore, my findings are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Pursuant to the 2012 Agreement, the Plaintiffs and the Defendants had agreed that the Invest Ho shares were to be divided equally amongst the five of them and Peng Zuo. The Defendants, as the registered shareholders, were to hold the others’ shares on trust for them;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The 2017 share transfers were carried out in order to honour and to implement the 2012 Agreement. They were not carried out pursuant to an agreement for the sale of the shares by HSF; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Plaintiffs made various contributions to Invest Ho over the years. This supported their claim of equal beneficial ownership of Invest Ho, as they would not have made these contributions if they had no beneficial interest at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I add that although the word “trust” was not used by the Plaintiffs and Defendants in a legal sense in the relevant documentation, this is not fatal to the Plaintiffs’ claim of an express trust. After all, the CA has held in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span> (at [52]) that no particular form of expression is necessary to establish an express trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 As the three certainties of an express trust have been met in the present case, I find that an express trust exists in favour of the Plaintiffs, such that the Defendants hold on trust for each Plaintiff 416,666.67 shares in Invest Ho.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 4: Whether there was a common intention constructive trust in the Plaintiffs’ favour, whereby each Plaintiff would be entitled to 416,666.67 shares in Invest Ho </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Given my findings on the Plaintiffs’ claim of an express trust, it is not necessary for me to make any findings on their alternative claim that a common intention constructive trust arises over the disputed shares. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In conclusion, for the reasons given above, I allow the Plaintiffs’ claim as follows. First, to recap, I find that an express trust did arise pursuant to the 2012 Agreement, whereby it was agreed that the three Plaintiffs, the two Defendants and Peng Zuo would each own an equal number of shares in Invest Ho; further, that the Defendants – as the registered shareholders – would hold the others’ shares on trust for them. I therefore grant the Plaintiffs’ prayer for a declaration that each Plaintiff is the beneficial owner of 416,666.67 shares in Invest Ho.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 In respect of the Plaintiffs’ prayer that the Defendants transfer to them these shares, it is not practicable for me to order that the Defendants transfer to each Plaintiff <span class="font-italic">416,666</span><span class="font-italic">.67</span> Invest Ho shares. At the same time, rounding up this figure to 416,667 shares each is not possible, simply because there will not be enough shares to go around (there being a total of 2,500,000 issued shares in Invest Ho).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In the circumstances, I am of the view that the practical thing to do is to order that the Defendants procure a capital reduction for the purpose of cancelling four (4) Invest Ho shares. This will result in there being 2,499,996 Invest Ho shares, of which a 1/6 share works out to exactly 416,666 shares. No capital will be returned to the shareholders, which means that the value of the four cancelled shares is absorbed equally into the 416,666 shares that make up each equal 1/6 share that the Plaintiffs and the Defendants (as well as Peng Zuo) are each beneficially entitled to.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I add that this exercise of rounding-down should not in my view prejudice any of the parties because the value of the four shares to be cancelled should be <span class="font-italic">de minimis</span>. On the basis of the previously reported NAV of Invest Ho ($32,487 – see [83] above), one share would be worth $0.013. Even if a higher value were arguably to be attributed to the Invest Ho shares, given that each party’s 1/6 share of Invest Ho is being rounded down by only 0.667 shares, I remain of the view that there is no prejudice to the parties.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I also make the following directions in respect of the transfer of shares by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Following the cancellation of four shares of Invest Ho, the Defendants are jointly to transfer to each of the Plaintiffs 416,666 Invest Ho shares;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Defendants may decide as between themselves the number of Invest Ho shares which each Defendant is to transfer to each Plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The costs and expenses of the transfer (including any stamp duty) shall be jointly borne by the Defendants;  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The Defendants are to complete the process of cancelling four Invest Ho shares and transferring 416,666 Invest Ho shares to each Plaintiff within four (4) weeks from today;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In the event that the Defendants fail to do so within the stipulated four weeks from today, having regard to the provisions of O 45 rule 8 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 332, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), and s 14 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322) (“<span class="font-weight-bold">SCJA</span>”), the Registrar and/or any Assistant Registrar of the Supreme Court of Singapore shall be empowered to execute all necessary documents on the Defendants’ behalf; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Pending the completion of the transfer of Invest Ho shares to the Plaintiffs, the Defendants are not to encumber or dispose of the Invest Ho shares registered in their names;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Pending the completion of the transfer of Invest Ho shares to the Plaintiffs, the Defendants are not to issue any new Invest Ho shares;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) The Plaintiffs and the Defendants have liberty to apply to court in respect of the working out of the transfer of the Invest Ho shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 In respect of Peng Zuo, he currently has 310,000 Invest Ho shares registered in his name. Given that he is not a party to this suit, I make no orders in relation to his shareholding position. It remains open to him to seek legal advice on his next steps (if any). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 As the Plaintiffs have succeeded in making out their case for an equal 1/6 share each of the Invest Ho shares, costs should follow the event; and I therefore award the Plaintiffs the costs of the proceedings, to be paid by the Defendants.
