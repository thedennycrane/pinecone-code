tried jointly in the High Court with a third co-accused person, Zulkarnain bin Kemat (“Zulkarnain”). Rizwan faced one charge of abetting by instigating Zulkarnain to be in possession of not less than 301.6g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) and s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”). Saminathan faced one charge of trafficking in not less than 301.6g of diamorphine by delivering the drugs to Zulkarnain, an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The charge against Rizwan reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, MOHAMMAD RIZWAN BIN AKBAR HUSAIN, on the 20th day of November 2013, in Singapore, did abet one Zulkarnain bin Kemat (bearing NRIC no: …) to traffic in a controlled drug listed in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, by instigating the said Zulkarnain Bin Kemat to be in possession for the purpose of trafficking thirty-five (35) bundles of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain a total of not less than 301.6 grammes of diamorphine, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, when you instructed him to collect and transport the said drug, which he did on the 20th day of November 2013 at or about 10:00 pm at Quality Road, Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) and section 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and punishable under section 33(1) of the said Act, and further, upon your conviction under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) and section 12 of the said Act, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the said Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The charge against Saminathan reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That you, SAMINATHAN SELVARAJU, on the 20th day of November 2013, at or about 10:00 pm, at Quality Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug listed in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, by delivering thirty-five (35) bundles of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain a total of not less than 301.6 grammes of diamorphine to one Zulkarnain bin Kemat (bearing NRIC no: …) without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and punishable under section 33(1) of the said Act, and further, upon your conviction under section 5(1)(a) of the said Act, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the said Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Zulkarnain was charged with trafficking in that he had in his possession for the purpose of trafficking the said 35 bundles of drugs delivered to him by Saminathan. The High Court judge (“the Judge”) convicted Zulkarnain, Rizwan and Saminathan on their respective charges. The Judge found Zulkarnain to be a courier within the meaning of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. As the Public Prosecutor had issued a certificate of substantive assistance to Zulkarnain, the Judge exercised her discretion and decided not to impose the death penalty. Instead, she sentenced Zulkarnain to life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest. As Zulkarnain was more than 50 years old at the time of sentencing, he was exempted from the minimum 15 strokes of the cane. He did not appeal against the Judge’s decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The Judge found that Rizwan was not a courier but held that Saminathan was a courier. However, as neither of them was issued a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA by the Public Prosecutor, the Judge imposed the mandatory death sentence on both Rizwan and Saminathan: see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Zulkarnain bin </span><span class="font-italic">Kemat and others </span>[2018] SGHC 161 (“the GD”). Both Rizwan and Saminathan appealed against their conviction. Their cases are unusual in that they were not arrested at the scene of the drug transaction but only subsequently. Rizwan was arrested about eight days later while Saminathan was arrested about four months later.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In the period leading up to the present appeals, Rizwan and Saminathan filed two separate criminal motions, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, Criminal Motion No 11 of 2019 (“CM 11/2019”) and Criminal Motion No 4 of 2019 (“CM 4/2019”). CM 11/2019 was an application by Rizwan for leave to adduce alibi evidence in the form of testimony from Mohammed Farhan bin Baharudin (“Farhan”). CM 4/2019 was an application by Saminathan for leave to adduce three categories of evidence. These were (a) alibi evidence in the form of testimony from his mother, Mdm Mahalatchmay a/l N Chella Permal (“Mdm Mahalatchmay”) and sister, Selvakumari a/l Selvaraju (“Ms Selvakumari”); (b) statements made by him to the police during investigations and other documents which were not tendered as evidence at the trial; and (c) communications between his counsel at the appeal and an expert witness engaged for Saminathan’s defence during the trial. We heard both applications on 22 November 2019 and dismissed them. We indicated then we would give our reasons after we had heard the substantive appeals. We do so towards the end of this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The arrests</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On the night of 20 November 2013, at or about 8.15pm, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) placed Zulkarnain under surveillance and tailed him from his residence at Spooner Road until he eventually reached Chin Bee Drive at about 9.13pm. At this time, Zulkarnain was driving a black Honda car.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 At about 9.55pm, Zulkarnain was observed positioning his car close to the junction of Chin Bee Drive and Quality Road. A black Mitsubishi Lancer car bearing registration number SGC4606C (“the Black Mitsubishi”) was parked in front of Zulkarnain’s car. The driver was observed to be plump and to be wearing a cap. The Black Mitsubishi was registered in Rizwan’s name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Subsequently, both these cars moved from Chin Bee Drive into Quality Road. The cars drove past a stationary trailer with Malaysian registration number WER 2508 (“the Trailer”) which was parked along Quality Road in the direction of Chin Bee Drive. The Trailer had its hazard lights turned on. The Black Mitsubishi stopped further down along Quality Road in the direction of International Road. Meanwhile, Zulkarnain’s car made a U-turn and parked in front of the Trailer. The driver of the Trailer, a male Indian, alighted and placed some items in Zulkarnain’s car through the left rear passenger side. He then returned to the Trailer. After this, all three vehicles left Quality Road and each was separately tailed by CNB officers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Zulkarnain’s car was followed to Tagore Industrial Avenue where it was stopped by CNB officers who arrested him. A search conducted in Zulkarnain’s car found two red plastic bags on the floor mat of the rear of the car. The first (marked “A1”) contained 15 black-taped bundles (marked “A1A” collectively and “A1A1” to “A1A15” individually), while the second (marked “B1”) contained 20 black-taped bundles (marked “B1A” collectively and “B1A1” to “B1A20” individually). These 35 bundles formed the subject of the above mentioned charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 CNB officers tailed the Black Mitsubishi to Tampines Avenue 7. At about 10.40pm, the Black Mitsubishi made a sudden U-turn and sped away. The CNB officers lost sight of the car.

In the alternative, the Prosecution submitted that knowledge of the nature of the drugs could be proved by applying s 18(4) of the MDA such that Rizwan would be deemed to be in joint possession of the diamorphine with Zulkarnain. This would then trigger the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA, with the result that Rizwan would be presumed to have known that the drugs were diamorphine.

Zulkarnain’s testimony at the trial was essentially the same as that in his statements (see [17]–[20] above). Zulkarnain also testified that he was sure that he was communicating with Rizwan as he could see Rizwan’s body from the back of the car while parked behind the Black Mitsubishi and he was also able to recognise Rizwan’s voice when they talked using the walkie-talkie.

That, in fact, under the circumstances and I am lacking in the position to render a conclusion” due to the poor images of the specimen disembarkation card provided to him and also because he learnt from defence counsel that Saminathan was irritated, unhappy and angry and it would therefore be difficult for him to consider the handwriting samples as natural.

The Judge found Zulkarnain’s evidence on Rizwan’s role in the drug transaction to be cogent, coherent and consistent. Zulkarnain was consistent and clear in his identification of Rizwan as his “Boss” from the time of his arrest (GD at [65]–[67]). Zulkarnain’s evidence was that he had previous dealings with “Boss” where he had met “Boss” in person or had communicated over the phone and walkie-talkie with “Boss”. He would therefore have known what “Boss” looked and sounded like (GD at [70]). The Judge also noted that Zulkarnain’s account of his past transactions with “Boss” was consistent throughout the statements up to trial (GD at [68]). Further, the text message sent at 9.24pm on the night of 20 November 2013 indicated that “Boss” would arrive shortly and Rizwan’s Black Mitsubishi did arrive at the scene shortly after that message, in accordance with the sequence of events observed by the CNB officers (GD at [69(b)]–[69(d)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Judge rejected Rizwan’s defence as being unbelievable. It made no sense that Rizwan would follow “Uncle’s” instructions so faithfully when he had met “Uncle” only in September 2013, merely two months before the transaction. Moreover, Rizwan knew hardly anything about “Uncle”. When Rizwan found out that his car was involved in a CNB operation, the logical thing for him to have done was to inform the authorities about this, not go into hiding and then leave Singapore by illegal means (GD at [72]). Rizwan’s account that he was told to leave his house at 9.20pm on 20 November 2013 because something had happened to his car also did not make sense because the drug transaction and the subsequent impoundment of his Black Mitsubishi only occurred after 10pm that night (GD at [73]). The Judge also found that Rizwan had been inconsistent in accounting for his movements on 20 November 2013 and the days after that. The account he gave in his statement recorded on 30 November 2013 was that he could not remember what had happened on those days. In particular, he stated that he could not recall what he did on 20 November 2013 because he had taken some medication (cough syrup and Panadol for his cough and flu) obtained from a clinic earlier that day. However, at the trial, he was able to give detailed evidence about the events that night leading to him fleeing Singapore (GD at [74]). The Judge did not accept Rizwan’s explanation that he was still in shock after his arrest when he gave his statements. Further, Rizwan’s conduct in fleeing Singapore surreptitiously also pointed towards his guilt (GD at [75]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Rizwan also failed in his alibi defence because he did not mention in his statement recorded on 30 November 2013 that he was at Boat Quay on the night of 20 November 2013. Instead, he had stated that he could not remember what took place on 20 and 21 November 2013. Further, his alibi witness, Khairul, could not recall the exact date and time when he met Rizwan at Boat Quay (GD at [76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The Judge also examined the possibility that Zulkarnain framed Rizwan for the purposes of obtaining a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor. She noted that this was a belated allegation which arose only in the course of Rizwan’s testimony in court and which was then pursued in the closing submissions. The Judge dismissed this allegation because there was no reason why Zulkarnain would frame Rizwan instead of naming the real “Boss”. She also noted that Zulkarnain had identified Rizwan from the very day after the drug transaction when he was shown a number of photographs (GD at [77]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The Judge held that Rizwan had the required <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> for the offence. Rizwan knew that Zulkarnain would be taking possession of the 35 bundles and had intended that Zulkarnain would deliver those bundles to him at a different location thereafter (GD at [80]). The elaborate system devised to carry out the transaction and Rizwan’s careful actions designed to ensure the successful receipt of the 35 bundles by Zulkarnain showed that Rizwan knew the value of the substantial quantity of drugs (GD at [81]–[82]). Given the substantial role that Rizwan played in the drug deals, his appreciation of the value of the drugs and of the highly illegal nature of the drug transaction, the irresistible inference was that Rizwan knew that the 35 bundles contained diamorphine. In any event, the Judge also found that Rizwan was deemed, pursuant to s 18(4) of the MDA, to be in joint possession of the drugs together with Zulkarnain as Zulkarnain was in possession of the 35 bundles with Rizwan’s “knowledge and consent”. Consequently, the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA would apply and Rizwan was presumed to know the nature of the drug. Rizwan was unable to rebut this presumption (GD at [84]–[87]). As for whether Rizwan intended to traffic in the drugs, the Judge observed that the quantity of the drugs (301.6g of diamorphine) was far in excess of the quantity which would trigger the presumption of trafficking in s 17 of the MDA. She therefore agreed with the Prosecution that the irresistible inference was that Rizwan intended to traffic in the drugs. Given the nature of Rizwan’s defence, there was no evidence to rebut this. Specifically, Rizwan did not say that the drugs were for his own consumption (GD at [89]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 On the issue of sentence, the Judge held that Rizwan’s role went beyond that of a courier. He got Zulkarnain to carry out the drug transaction and he also coordinated it. In any case, the Public Prosecutor did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance to Rizwan. The Judge therefore passed the mandatory death sentence on him (GD at [117]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Saminathan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Judge convicted Saminathan on his charge of trafficking by delivering the drugs to Zulkarnain. The Judge noted that there was no direct identification by any witness that Saminathan was the person who delivered the drugs to Zulkarnain as the Trailer was not stopped in time and it left Singapore (GD at [92]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Nevertheless, the Judge was satisfied that it was Saminathan who delivered the drugs to Zulkarnain. The Judge relied on six pieces of evidence for this finding:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, ICA’s travel records showed that the Trailer entered Singapore at 6.40pm, and left Singapore at 10.18pm on 20 November 2013 and that there was only one person in the Trailer during those times (GD at [95]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the disembarkation card which was submitted for the Trailer’s entry at 6.40pm also showed that it was Saminathan who entered Singapore at 6.40pm, as the card was completed and signed by Saminathan (GD at [96]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, two CNB officers at the scene, Woman Station Inspector Rahizah Rahim (“W/SI Rahizah”), and Senior Staff Sergeant Mak Weng Chuen (“SSSgt Mak”), observed that the driver of the Trailer who loaded things into Zulkarnain’s car was a male Indian. After the drug transaction was completed, the Trailer was tailed all the way by CNB officers to the Tuas Checkpoint where it then left for Malaysia. Therefore, the same person who delivered the drugs to Zulkarnain also drove the Trailer (GD at [97]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, SSgt Goh, who processed the Trailer’s exit at 10.18pm gave evidence that he followed the established verification protocol in matching the distinguishing facial features of the person present before him with the passport presented to him. Saminathan’s passport showed the distinguishing features of his ears and his moustache. The driver passed the visual inspection. Thus, by virtue of the fact that the Trailer was allowed to exit Singapore without incident, it must have been the case that Saminathan was the driver at the time (GD at [98]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, Murugan’s evidence was that Saminathan had exclusive use of the trailer and that Saminathan had gone missing with the Trailer’s keys after the morning delivery to Singapore. Saminathan did not deny that he had used the Trailer to make a delivery in Singapore between 8.24am and 10.32am on 20 November 2013. The Trailer was therefore available for him to re-enter Singapore in the evening for the drugs transaction (GD at [99]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) Sixth, Saminathan’s DNA was found on two of the 35 bundles of drugs. These bundles were taped up with black tape which overlapped. Saminathan’s DNA was found on the parts of the tape that were not directly exposed to external touch when the bundle was fully bundled. This linked Saminathan inextricably to the drugs. The Judge did not accept Saminathan’s argument that his DNA had been transferred by someone else, perhaps from the trailer’s steering wheel or the black tape that Saminathan kept in the Trailer. The Judge found this explanation unbelievable (GD at [100]–[101]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Judge then turned to consider Saminathan’s defence. She noted that Saminathan in his statement given on 31 March 2014 did not deny his presence in Singapore on the night in question. Although Saminathan was not certain as to what he was doing and he offered three possibilities in his statement, what was critical was that he did not dispute being in Singapore at that time. It was only at the trial that Saminathan raised the belated defence that he was not in Singapore at all and that there had been an impersonator (GD at [102]). Since he had held the belief that he had been impersonated during the time of investigations, he should have stated so at the earliest opportunity. The situation was aggravated by his failure to mention that he was not in Singapore that night even in his Case for the Defence filed on 13 November 2015 (GD at [103]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The Judge also found it “impossible” to accept that Saminathan would have left such an important document as his passport in the Trailer, particularly since he claimed that Murugan had a spare key and that he was not the only person with access to the Trailer (GD at [104]). Saminathan also accepted that he did not turn up for work for a few days after 20 November 2013 and would not be in control of the Trailer. In such a case, it was difficult to understand why he did not remove his passport from the Trailer. The Judge also found it “hard to imagine in the first place” why Saminathan would pre-fill and pre-sign a stack of disembarkation cards and carelessly leave them in the Trailer (GD at [104]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The Judge also rejected Saminathan’s claim that he did not write the words “SHIPYArD Rd”. The Prosecution’s expert, Dr Cheng, found at least six similarities between the handwriting used for those words and Saminathan’s handwriting specimens and concluded that the possibility that Saminathan had written the words could not be ruled out (GD at [105]). Saminathan’s expert witness, Mr Pang, was unable to come to a conclusion on this issue. Saminathan’s claim that he did not write “SHIPYArD RD” was a mere attempt to disassociate himself from the disembarkation card, which the Judge found was filled in by him (GD at [105]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Further, the Judge found it difficult to believe that the impersonator would have chosen to enter Singapore using Saminathan’s passport. This would have involved the added risk of being detected by ICA for using a false passport and in turn, heightened the risk of being caught with the drugs (GD at [106]). The Judge also considered that it was unlikely that an impersonator could have known Saminathan’s plans and movements so well as to take the key from the office of MKG and to drive the Trailer to Singapore shortly after Saminathan returned from his delivery that morning. The impersonator must also have known that Saminathan would leave his passport and some pre-filled disembarkation cards in the Trailer. Taking all these together, the alleged impersonator appeared to know Saminathan well. However, Saminathan claimed that he did not know who would have framed him for this very serious crime (GD at [107]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Finally, Saminathan’s defence depended on a confluence of a number of coincidences which taken together rendered the defence quite incredible. This included the fact that the impersonator must have had a reasonable resemblance to Saminathan’s appearance in order to be confident to pass ICA’s checks, the fact that the impersonator had handwriting similar to Saminathan’s or was able to copy his handwriting well and thus write the words “SHIPYArD RD” in the way Saminathan would and the fact that the impersonator must have used the black tape left behind in the Trailer or transferred Saminathan’s DNA from the Trailer to the bundles (GD at [108]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As Saminathan was in possession of the 35 bundles of drugs, he was presumed by s 18(1) of the MDA to have been in possession of the drugs and therefore presumed by s 18(2) of the MDA to have known the nature of the drugs. As Saminathan adduced no evidence to rebut the presumption of knowledge, the charge against him was made out (GD at [110]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 On the issue of sentence, although Saminathan’s role was that of a courier, he was not issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the Public Prosecutor. Accordingly, the Judge passed the mandatory death sentence on Saminathan (GD at [118]–[119]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases at the appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rizwan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In his appeal, Rizwan argued that the Judge erred in finding that Zulkarnain’s evidence was corroborated by other evidence. Applying the standard laid down in <span class="font-italic">R v Baskerville </span>[1916] 2 KB 658 (“<span class="font-italic">Baskerville</span>”), which requires corroborative evidence to be independent and to implicate the accused person in a material particular, none of the evidence relied on by the Judge could be considered corroborative evidence.

The instigation alleged in the charge was that Rizwan “instructed [Zulkarnain] to collect and transport the said drug” (see [2] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 We begin by considering briefly the law relating to abetment. In <span class="font-italic">Chan Heng Kong and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] SGCA 18 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Heng Kong</span>”), this Court observed at [33] that the word “abet” in s 12 of the MDA should bear the same meaning as it does in s 107 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).  Where abetment by instigation is concerned, as in the present case, there must be active suggestion, support, stimulation or encouragement of the primary offence (<span class="font-italic">Chan Heng Kong </span>at [34]). This requires the Prosecution to prove that the abettor intended that the person whom the abettor instigates carry out the conduct abetted (see <span class="font-italic">Ali bin Mohamad </span><span class="font-italic">Bahashwan v Public Prosecutor and other appeals </span>[2018] 1 SLR 610 at [34]) (“<span class="font-italic">Bahashwan</span>”). Where the conduct abetted is the trafficking of drugs to the abettor, the Prosecution must also demonstrate that the abettor himself intended to traffic in the offending drugs (<span class="font-italic">Bahashwan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [75]–[78], overruling<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Chan Heng Kong</span> on this point).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Applying this approach to the present case, the charge against Rizwan would be made out if it was proved that Rizwan intended Zulkarnain, whom he instigated, to carry out the conduct abetted, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to be in the possession of the 35 bundles of drugs for the purposes of trafficking and that Rizwan himself intended to traffic in those drugs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Identification evidence of Zulkarnain</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The approach to corroborative evidence in Singapore was considered by this Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton</span>”), where we held that the <span class="font-italic">Baskerville</span> test does not apply in its strict form. In determining whether evidence is corroborative, the trial judge has the flexibility to treat relevant evidence as corroborative; the overarching inquiry is the substance and relevance of the evidence and whether it supports or confirms the other evidence that is sought to be corroborated (<span class="font-italic">Mohammed </span><span class="font-italic">Liton </span>at [43]). It follows from this that the Judge was entitled to take into account all relevant evidence before the court without first asking whether any particular piece of evidence individually satisfied the <span class="font-italic">Baskerville </span>test. We therefore reject Rizwan’s argument that he was convicted solely on the evidence of Zulkarnain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Section 258(5) of the CPC has its genesis in the now-repealed s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”), which was one of the provisions in the EA which provided for exceptions to the hearsay rule. It makes it a prerequisite that a statement sought to be admitted against a co-accused in a joint trial for the same offence constitute a “confession”. It did not appear to us that Zulkarnain’s statements were used as confessions by the Prosecution in its case against Rizwan. Indeed, this was unnecessary given that Zulkarnain elected to testify at the trial and was liable to cross-examination. In any event, Zulkarnain’s statements were certainly not the only evidence on which the Prosecution’s case against Rizwan stood.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Turning now to the evidence, we agree with the Judge that Zulkarnain’s testimony identifying Rizwan as “Boss” was “cogent, coherent and consistent” (GD at [65]). Zulkarnain was clear from the commencement of investigations that Rizwan was “Boss”. He identified Rizwan from a set of nine photographs shown to him just one day after he was arrested (see [20] above). At this time, Rizwan was still at large as he was not arrested in Malaysia until 28 November 2013. Zulkarnain maintained his identification of Rizwan as “Boss” at the trial. Zulkarnain explained that he was sure that Rizwan was the person who instructed him to carry out the drug transaction on the night of 20 November 2013 because he heard Rizwan’s voice over the walkie-talkie

Shortly thereafter, the Black Mitsubishi was observed arriving at Chin Bee Drive and parking in front of Zulkarnain’s car at about 9.55pm.

The apparent thrust of Mr Chia’s submission appeared to be that a conviction could not be sustained without this evidence. With respect, we do not agree. While finding the walkie-talkie and the handphones in Rizwan’s possession would undoubtedly have strengthened the Prosecution’s case further, the ultimate inquiry is still whether the Prosecution has proved the charge against Rizwan beyond a reasonable doubt on the evidence that it was able to muster.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 We would also note that the possibility of Zulkarnain having identified Rizwan falsely as “Boss” in order to obtain a certificate of substantive assistance was not raised during Zulkarnain’s cross-examination at the trial but came about only during Rizwan’s testimony.

</div> Despite this, Rizwan testified that he was willing to lend his Black Mitsubishi to “Uncle” upon the latter’s request. Moreover, upon finding out that something had happened to his car, Rizwan’s reaction was to comply with “Uncle’s” instructions to leave home and then country over the next few days, rather than take the logical and obvious step of informing the authorities that he was not involved at all in the drug transaction or in whatever had happened that night. At the time of the incident, Rizwan was already 32 years old and could not have been so naïve or foolish. Further, taking the sort of medications that he claimed to have taken that night could not have made him so susceptible to complying with illogical instructions to leave home immediately especially since he said in court that when he left his home, “it did not occur to me what problem it was”.

</div> Given that the drug transaction only took place nearly an hour later at about 10pm that night, it was not possible that “Uncle” informed Rizwan at 9pm about something having happened to his car.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Third, Rizwan was unable to provide any explanation for the vastly differing accounts that he put forward in relation to his whereabouts on 20 November 2013. In his long statement recorded on 30 November 2013, Rizwan claimed that he could not recall what he had done on the night of 20 November 2013 as he was on medication (see [21] above). He also mentioned having spent 21 November 2013 with his friend Farhan. This was in stark contrast to his testimony during the trial where Rizwan was able to recall with details how he had spent the night of 20 November 2013 at Boat Quay with Farhan, Khairul and “Yan Kenet” until 3 to 4am the following day.

</div> Beyond that, he was able to give a detailed description of “Uncle’s” instructions over the ensuing period up until he was arrested in Malaysia. Additionally, Rizwan could not produce any witness to back up his account, as Khairul conceded that he could not be certain he had met Rizwan on the night of 20 November 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Finally, Rizwan’s action in fleeing to Malaysia in the boot of a car provided strong evidence pointing to his guilt. It did not make any sense that Rizwan would leave Singapore illegally in such a clandestine fashion if he had nothing to do with the drug transaction. There was no ICA record of Rizwan having left Singapore. The absence of such record showed that he left illegally. While Rizwan’s passport was presented and stamped upon his entry into Malaysia, this did not mean that he left Singapore legally. Instead, all it showed was that at the time the car reached the Malaysian immigration checkpoint, Ridzwan was out of the boot and inside the car. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In our view, the totality of the evidence showed that Rizwan’s defence was nothing more than a hopeless attempt to dissociate himself from the drug transaction on 20 November 2013. There was nothing to show that the Judge erred in finding that Rizwan was the person who instigated Zulkarnain to collect and to transport the 35 bundles of diamorphine on 20 November 2013.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Rizwan had knowledge that the drugs were diamorphine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 We now consider whether Rizwan had the necessary <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea </span>for the charge against him. For this, it must be shown that Rizwan knew that the drugs were diamorphine and that he intended to traffic in the drugs (see [61]–[62] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The Judge found that Rizwan knew that the drugs were diamorphine. This was inferred from the fact that Rizwan intended for Zulkarnain to take possession of the 35 bundles of diamorphine and had devised an elaborate plan to carry out the transaction. The details of the drug transaction displayed careful planning. Rizwan equipped Zulkarnain with multiple electronic communication devices, the purpose of which was to avoid detection. He coordinated and directed Zulkarnain’s movements while maintaining constant communication with him throughout the transaction by way of walkie-talkies instead of by mobile phones. The mobile phones had to be switched off before the cars moved to meet the Trailer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Rizwan chose to flee from the scene the moment the drug transaction went awry. As can be recalled, Rizwan also did not return home in the days following the drug transaction and eventually fled illegally to Malaysia in the boot of a car on 25 November 2013. All these showed clearly that Rizwan knew the high value of the drugs and correspondingly, what the nature of the drugs was.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As an alternative ground, the Judge also found that Rizwan was in joint possession of the drugs with Zulkarnain under s 18(4) of the MDA as Zulkarnain had possession of the drugs with the knowledge and consent of Rizwan. This meant that the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs under s 18(2) of the MDA also applied against Rizwan and he was unable to rebut the presumption (see [44] above). During the hearing of the appeals, Mr Chia indicated that he would not be submitting on whether ss 18(2) and 18(4) of the MDA could be applied simultaneously. In any case, the position taken by the Judge on this issue accords with the recent decision of a five-judge Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Mohammad</span> <span class="font-italic">Azli</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Mohammad Salleh v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters </span>[2020] SGCA 39 delivered on 23 April 2020.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Rizwan intended to traffic in the drugs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Judge found that Rizwan intended to traffic in the drugs. The total quantity of drugs weighed more than 25 pounds and contained 301.6 g of diamorphine. The diamorphine content was more than 20 times the quantity of 15g that would attract the death penalty. The irresistible inference from the sheer amount of the diamorphine involved in the transaction was that Rizwan intended to traffic in them. There was also no suggestion that the drugs were for Rizwan’s personal consumption and it would probably have been quite unbelievable in the circumstances here if the suggestion had been made that a consumer would stockpile 25 pounds of drugs for personal consumption. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The Judge (GD at [89], see also [44] above) appeared to have relied also on the presumption in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the MDA in coming to her conclusion that Rizwan intended to traffic in the drugs. That presumption states that any person who is proved to have had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose. In so far as the Judge relied on the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs in s 18(2) of the MDA (see [44] and [79] above) together with the presumption of trafficking in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), this Court has ruled in <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1119 (at [39] to [47]) (“<span class="font-italic">Zainal</span>”) that these two presumptions could not run together and (at [49] to [51]) that s 17 could be invoked only if both the fact of physical possession of the drugs and the fact of knowledge of what was possessed had been proved. The decision in <span class="font-italic">Zainal</span> was delivered on 3 October 2018, after the Judge gave her GD on 16 July 2018. Nevertheless, as we have explained at [80] above, the sheer amount of drugs involved in this transaction could lead only to the conclusion that they were intended for trafficking. There was therefore no need to invoke the presumption in s 17(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) in any case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 We agree with the Judge’s findings and affirm her conclusion that Rizwan was guilty of the charge of abetting Zulkarnain by instigating him to be in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The Judge also held correctly that Rizwan was not a mere courier given the scope of his involvement in the drug transaction. He also did not receive a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor. He could not satisfy both requirements in s 33B(2) of the MDA and was therefore not eligible for the alternative sentencing regime in s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>).

We first consider the arguments raised by Saminathan in relation to specific categories of evidence before moving on to consider whether the conviction can be sustained on the totality of the evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Evidence of W/SI Rahizah and SSSgt Mak</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The focus of Saminathan’s arguments against the testimony of W/SI Rahizah and SSSgt Mak was that both of them could not be certain that the driver of the Trailer was a male Indian.

</div> The Judge thus erred in relying on their testimony that the driver of the Trailer was a male Indian. However, it was not disputed that the driver of the Trailer which delivered the drugs to Zulkarnain was the same person who was processed by SSgt Goh at Tuas Checkpoint when the Trailer left Singapore on the night of 20 November 2013. This was because the Trailer was tailed continuously by the CNB officers after the handing over of the drug bundles. The possibility of SSgt Goh having been mistaken about the ethnicity of the person who presented Saminathan’s passport for clearance was not raised during cross-examination. Instead, Saminathan’s  defence counsel focussed on whether certain facial features of Saminathan would have attracted greater scrutiny from SSgt Goh.

</div> Looking at the testimony of SSgt Goh, he did not appear to have gone so far as to identify Saminathan affirmatively as the person who drove the Trailer at the Tuas Checkpoint at 10.18pm on 20 November 2013 and presented Saminathan’s passport in order to exit Singapore. Instead, SSgt Goh testified only as to the verification protocol which he would have applied on the day in question:

The Judge was aware of this and it did not appear from the GD that she regarded SSgt Goh as having identified Saminathan positively as the person who was processed on 20 November 2013. Indeed, such a positive identification some three years after the event would be highly suspect since 20 November 2013 was an otherwise uneventful night for SSgt Goh and he had probably processed quite a number of trailers and lorries leaving Singapore that night.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Handwriting evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Saminathan argued that the Judge was not justified in finding that he was the writer of the words “SHIPYArD Rd” on the disembarkation card on the basis of the conclusion reached by Dr Cheng.

</div> Saminathan’s counsel, Mr Rakesh Vasu, argued that Dr Cheng’s evidence was equivocal. While she had identified six similarities between the words “SHIPYArD Rd” on the disembarkation card and the samples provided by Saminathan, there were also differences. On the other hand, the conclusion reached by Saminathan’s expert witness, Mr Pang, was that he could not render a conclusion given the limitations stated by him (see [38] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The Judge found it “inexplicable” that the alleged impersonator would write the words “SHIPYArD Rd” as the destination address in Singapore when the drug transaction took place in Quality Road. Saminathan had stated that he had gone to Shipyard Crescent on a previous occasion. Additionally, Quality Road, the location of the transaction, was adjacent to Chin Bee Drive, the location where Saminathan had delivered goods to in the morning of 20 November 2013 (GD at [105]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 With respect, we do not think that the Judge dismissed Saminathan’s claim that he did not write the words “SHIPYArD Rd” on the disembarkation card purely on the basis of Dr Cheng’s testimony. The Judge considered various factors before she decided to reject Saminathan’s defence, including his denial about being the author of the words in question (see GD at [105] to [109]). We would only comment that we disagree with the Judge only to the extent that we do not think that writing the word “road” as “RD” was very remarkable as that is a common abbreviation of that word (see GD at [108](b)). In any case, the Prosecution’s evidence on handwriting was peripheral in that it only showed that it was possible, rather than probable, that Saminathan wrote the words in issue. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Murugan’s statement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Saminathan submitted that the Judge ought not to have accepted the evidence in Murugan’s statement that Saminathan did not return the keys to the Trailer after the first trip to Singapore in the morning of 20 November 2013.

</div> The Judge accepted Murugan’s statement and considered that Saminathan would have the Trailer available to re-enter Singapore for the drug transaction that night. The Judge also appeared to have relied on the fact that Saminathan admitted in one of his statements that he used the Trailer to make deliveries for MKG and that he did not deny that he had used the Trailer to enter Singapore at 8.24am on 20 November 2013 to make a delivery at Chin Bee Drive and then exited Singapore at 10.32am (GD at [99]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The admission of Murugan’s statement was initially objected to by Saminathan as Murugan apparently could not be located. Prior to the ancillary hearing to determine the admissibility of the statement under 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>) of the EA and after a short adjournment for the parties to confer, Saminathan’s counsel informed the Judge that he was no longer challenging the admissibility of the statement and would submit subsequently on the weight to be accorded to it.

The statement was then admitted by consent of all three accused persons under s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">k</span>) of the EA as P274.

The disputes were on two points: first, Saminathan said he did not park the Trailer near his home as he would always park the Trailer at MKG’s office and return the keys after he was done with the day’s work; second, he did not keep the Trailer’s keys with him when he returned to his hometown after the delivery in the morning of 20 November 2013.

</div> This raised the possibility that if the impersonator drove the Trailer on 20 November 2013, he could have transferred Saminathan’s DNA from the Trailer onto the drug bundles. In our view, however, such a possibility should not be considered in isolation as a theoretical possibility.

The Prosecution’s case against Saminathan hinged on Saminathan being the driver of the Trailer on the night of 20 November 2013. It was undisputed that the driver of the Trailer delivered the drugs to Zulkarnain and that the Trailer was tailed all the way from Quality Road to the Tuas Checkpoint where it left Singapore at about 10.18pm for Malaysia.

The records showed that Saminathan drove the Trailer into and out of Singapore on numerous occasions between 20 November 2013 and 15 February 2014. Saminathan left the employ of MKG after he was told by Murugan to look for another job sometime in the middle of February 2014. On 20 November 2013, Saminathan’s passport was used by the driver of the Trailer to exit Singapore at the Tuas Checkpoint after the drug transaction took place. SSgt Goh’s testimony as to the verification procedure he would have adopted showed at the very least that the person who presented Saminathan’s passport bore a resemblance to the photograph in the passport and that nothing happened during the exit process that could have caused concern for SSgt Goh. If it were otherwise, SSgt Goh would have referred that person for further verification checks to confirm his identity. Saminathan had general access to the Trailer in the course of his employment in MKG. Leaving aside Murugan’s statement, Saminathan’s evidence in his statements and at the trial was that he used the Trailer regularly to enter Singapore, save for one or two occasions where he drove a different vehicle.

Saminathan’s DNA was found on one bundle of drugs from each of the red plastic bags seized from the floor of Zulkarnain’s car (see [27(d)] above):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the exterior of the fully wrapped bundle B1A6 and the interior of the same bundle on the non-adhesive sides of the black tape after it was unwrapped; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the interior of bundle A1A9 on the non-adhesive sides of the black tape after it was unwrapped.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The fact that Saminathan’s DNA was found on the interior of the bundles on the non-adhesive sides of the black tape when the bundles were unwrapped was strong evidence that Saminathan had handled the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Saminathan’s defence was that he was not the driver of the Trailer on the night of the drug transaction. As mentioned above at [34]–[37], he claimed that some unknown person must have taken the Trailer from MKG’s office and then drove it into Singapore to carry out the drug transaction. That person was able to use Saminathan’s passport and pre-filled disembarkation cards which he had left on the Trailer’s dashboard. As for how his DNA came to be found on the two drug bundles, this was possibly due to secondary transference because he kept a number of rolls of black tape in the Trailer for the purpose of fixing wiring in the vehicle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In our view, Saminathan’s defence was premised on a fortuitous confluence of several highly unlikely coincidences:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The impersonator was aware of Saminathan’s practice of leaving his passport on the dashboard of the Trailer and had planned to use it to enter Singapore to deliver drugs in order to conceal his own identity.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Alternatively, that person saw Saminathan’s passport in the Trailer by chance and decided to use it for entry into Singapore for the delivery of 35 bundles of drugs. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The evidence of SSgt Goh was that a visual inspection would be conducted to confirm the identity of the person presenting a passport for the purpose of exiting Singapore. Anyone presenting a passport at international borders would be aware of this anyway. By coincidence, the impersonator’s face must therefore have borne a reasonable resemblance to Saminathan’s photo in the passport because it would otherwise make little sense for him to use Saminathan’s passport. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Alternatively, the impersonator did not look like Saminathan but decided to take the risk of using the passport in the hope that the ICA would not notice the discrepancy.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The impersonator found the rolls of black tape kept by Saminathan in the Trailer and decided to use the black tape to wrap some of the bundles of drugs. The black tape had Saminathan’s DNA on it or the impersonator somehow transferred Saminathan’s DNA from parts of the Trailer onto the black tape. That led to Saminathan’s DNA being found on the drug bundles B1A6 and A1A9.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 From the above, it can be seen that the possible actions of the alleged impersonator were patently illogical and highly improbable. Entering Singapore on Saminathan’s passport in order to deliver such a huge quantity of drugs would add to the already highly dangerous drug transaction the unnecessary risks of being stopped by the ICA at the checkpoint, both when going into and when leaving Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In any case, it was highly unlikely that Saminathan would have left his passport on the dashboard of the Trailer after he returned to Malaysia from his morning trip to Singapore on 20 November 2013. Saminathan’s evidence was that he would leave the Trailer at MKG’s office and return the Trailer’s keys to Murugan whenever he had completed his deliveries. If the Trailer was not under his control or not for his exclusive use, it would make little sense for him to leave such an important document on the dashboard of the Trailer. More importantly, as was noted by the Judge, Saminathan testified that he could have returned to his hometown after completing his delivery on the morning of 20 November 2013 and that he remained there until 27 November 2013.

</div> If he was going to be away from work for such an extended period of time, it would be even more unlikely that he left his passport in the Trailer on 20 November 2013.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Saminathan also did not mention in any of his statements the possibility of an impersonator having used his passport to carry out the drug transaction. This was despite Saminathan claiming that, in the course of investigations, he was aware of the possibility that somebody might have impersonated him by using his passport. This further diminished his credibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The impersonator would also have to be an unusual drug trafficker who wrapped drug bundles only after entering the Trailer in Johor Bahru or somewhere during the journey to the meeting point along Quality Road in Singapore on 20 November 2013. There were 35 bundles altogether in that transaction. He would have to know, again quite fortuitously, that there would be black tape available in the Trailer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In summary, we agree with the Judge’s conclusion that Saminathan’s defence was implausible and could not raise a reasonable doubt. The Judge was correct in holding that the Prosecution had proved that Saminathan was the driver of the Trailer who delivered the drugs to Zulkarnain on the night of 20 November 2013. As Saminathan was in possession of the 35 bundles of drugs, he was presumed to have known the nature of the drugs pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA. Given the nature of his defence, there was no evidence to rebut the presumption of knowledge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 We therefore agree that the charge against Saminathan was proved beyond reasonable doubt and we affirm the Judge’s decision to convict him. Although the Judge found Saminathan to be a courier within the meaning of s 33B(2) of the MDA, he did not receive a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor. He was therefore not eligible for the alternative sentencing regime provided in s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and the Judge had to impose the mandatory death penalty.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Criminal Motions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 We now deal with the applications in CM 4/2019 and CM 11/2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 CM 4/2019 was brought by Saminathan to adduce three categories of evidence:

Farhan and his girlfriend, Kristin, then spent 21 November 2013 together with Rizwan in a hotel before Rizwan left sometime in the evening with someone named “Man”. The next day, on 22 November 2013, Farhan was arrested after leaving the hotel together with Kristin, “Man” and another person, “Sugiman”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Farhan was unavailable for the trial as he had absconded after having been arrested and then placed on bail for some unrelated offences. The scope of the application expanded considerably prior to the first hearing on 22 November 2019, with Rizwan seeking to admit evidence of up to five other persons to corroborate Farhan’s account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 The law on adducing fresh evidence under s 392(1) of the CPC was set out by this Court in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mohd </span><span class="font-italic">Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan</span> [2018] 1 SLR 544 (“<span class="font-italic">Ariffan</span>”). The three conditions articulated in <span class="font-italic">Ladd v Marshall </span>[1954] 1 WLR 1489<span class="font-italic"> </span>– non-availability at trial, relevance and reliability – apply. The condition of non-availability is relaxed where accused persons are the ones seeking to adduce further evidence. In such situations, the key considerations are the relevance and reliability of the evidence sought to be adduced (<span class="font-italic">Ariffan</span> at [48]–[49]). When assessing the reliability of new evidence sought to be adduced, the inquiry is whether such evidence is “presumably to be believed, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible” (<span class="font-italic">Iskandar bin </span><span class="font-italic">Rahmat v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2017] 1 SLR 505 at [73]). The proportionality of admitting the fresh evidence must also be considered. This involves striking a balance between the significance of the new evidence and the need for swift conduct of litigation alongside any prejudice that might arise from additional proceedings (<span class="font-italic">Ariffan</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [72]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 At the first hearing of these appeals, we were not satisfied that leave should be granted in respect of any of the three categories of evidence in Saminathan’s CM 4/2019. Apart from not satisfying the requirement of non-availability, we were not satisfied that the evidence of Mdm Mahalatchmay and Ms Selvakumari was reliable. Both ladies stated that they recalled that Saminathan was with them on the night in question because of various incidents during that time. They alleged that they had informed Saminathan’s former defence counsel about the <span class="font-italic">alibi</span> evidence but, quite inexplicably, both former defence counsel failed to raise it at the trial. The family members were not called as defence witnesses during the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 However, no evidence was put forward to substantiate these allegations against Mr Kumar and Mr Lukshumayeh. In their affidavits filed in response, Mr Kumar and Mr Lukshumayeh denied strenuously the allegations made against them. We accepted their evidence. Mr Kumar and Mr Lukshumayeh had paid personally for the expenses incurred in engaging Mr Pang as Saminathan’s handwriting expert when some issue arose about payment for his services. It made no sense that they would go to such lengths to assist Saminathan’s defence that he was not the driver of the Trailer on the night of the drug transaction and yet would ignore completely the <span class="font-italic">alibi</span> evidence that would have exonerated Saminathan if it was accepted by the court.

</div>
</div>
</div> We did not see any reason to think that there was gross incompetence or indifference on the part of both former defence counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Further, Saminathan claimed in his application that his mother and his sister did not inform him before the trial that he was actually back in his hometown on the night of the drug transaction in Singapore. This was despite their many visits to the prison while he was in remand awaiting trial. He claimed that they mentioned the <span class="font-italic">alibi</span> evidence to him only after his conviction and he exclaimed in surprise, “Why say this only now?”. They then allegedly told him that they had already informed his former defence counsel about it before the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 We found Saminathan’s claim quite unbelievable. If his family members knew that he was not in Singapore on the night in question, surely they would have raised the issue with him as soon as they recalled that fact instead of waiting until after the Judge had given her decision. It was also absurd that they did not discuss the issue with Saminathan at all during their many visits to the prison but claimed that they had informed the former defence counsel about it without even mentioning to him that they had done this. A simple defence that the accused person was not at the scene of crime was something that any ordinary person would appreciate and raise as soon as possible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 As for the remaining two categories of evidence (see [109(b)]–[109(c)] above), we were not satisfied that they met the requirement of relevance. The documentary evidence did not traverse any ground that was not covered at the trial. Saminathan failed to show that they would have had an important influence on the result of the appeals. We reached the same conclusion in respect of the communications between Saminathan’s counsel and Mr Pang. It appeared to us that the communications were tendered to insinuate that Mr Pang’s retraction of the conclusion reached in his second report was motivated by the non-payment of his fees (see [38] above). We did not see anything on the face of the evidence to suggest any such motive on the part of Mr Pang. In fact, the transcripts of the trial made it clear that Mr Pang’s retraction was based on his view that there was insufficient material for him to conclude that the words “SHIPYArD RD” were not written by Mr Saminathan.

</div>
</div> In any event, we did not think that the handwriting evidence from the Prosecution and Mr Pang would have any impact on the appeal. As shown above, it does not feature in our deliberations on the correctness or otherwise of the Judge’s decision to convict Saminathan. Saminathan’s application to admit further evidence was therefore dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 We also dismissed Rizwan’s application in CM 11/2019. Even if we accepted that the evidence sought to be admitted (particularly that of Farhan) was not available during the trial, it did not satisfy the requirement of reliability. Prior to the hearing on 22 November 2019, we directed the Prosecution to produce any statements given by the persons mentioned at [110] above or any records which made mention of Rizwan. Farhan’s account in his statements was completely at odds from that which he sought to put before us for the appeal. In his statements, Farhan mentioned that he only met Rizwan for lunch on 21 November 2013 rather than on the night of 20 November 2013.

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Tay Yong Kwang JA):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> Court of Appeal affirmed Mohammad Rizwan’s conviction and sentence for abetting by instigating another person to be in possession of not less than 301.6g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking and Saminathan Selvaraju’s conviction and sentence for trafficking in not less than 301.6g of diamorphine by delivering the drugs.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Introduction</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Mohammad Rizwan bin Akbar Husain (“Rizwan”) and Saminathan Selvaraju (“Saminathan) were jointly tried before a High Court Judge (“the Judge”). Rizwan faced a charge for abetting by instigating Zulkarnain bin Kemat (“Zulkarnain”) </span>to be in possession of not less than 301.6g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. Saminathan faced a charge of trafficking in not less than 301.6g of diamorphine by delivering the drugs to Zulkarnain. Both Rizwan and Saminathan were found guilty and convicted on their respective charges.</p>
<p><span>2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The Judge found that Saminathan was a courier within the meaning of s 33B(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). However, as the Public Prosecutor did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance to Saminathan, the alternative sentencing regime was not available, and the mandatory death penalty was imposed. As for Rizwan, the Judge found that he was not a courier. In any event, Rizwan did not receive a certificate of substantive assistance. Accordingly, the Judge imposed the mandatory death penalty on him. </p>
<p><span>3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Criminal Appeal No 9 of 2018 (“CCA 9/2018”) and Criminal Appeal No 13 of 2018 (“CCA 13/2018”) were, respectively, Rizwan’s and Saminathan’s appeals against conviction and sentence. </p>
<p><span>4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Prior to the hearing of the appeals, both Rizwan and Saminathan filed separate criminal motions to adduce further evidence, namely, Criminal Motion No 11 of 2019 (“CM 11/2019”) and Criminal Motion No 4 of 2019 (“CM 4/2019”). These were heard and dismissed on 22 November 2019, with the court indicating that its reasons would be given after the hearing of the substantive appeals.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Facts</span></strong></p>
<p><span>5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>On 20 November 2013, Zulkarnain was placed under surveillance by the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) and followed to Chin Bee Drive. At about 9.55pm, a black Mitsubishi Lancer (“the Black Mitsubishi”), which was registered in Rizwan’s name, was observed parked in front of Zulkarnain’s car. Both cars subsequently moved from Chin Bee Drive into Quality Road and drove past a stationary trailer with its hazard lights turned on (“the Trailer”). The driver of the Trailer, a male Indian, alighted and placed some items in Zulkarnain’s car. All three vehicles left Quality Road and were separately tailed by CNB officers.</span></p>
<p><span>6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Zulkarnain was followed to Tagore Industrial Avenue where he was arrested. Two red plastic bags were found in the rear of his car containing 35 black-taped bundles of drugs which formed the subject of the charges against Rizwan and Saminathan. The Black Mitsubishi was tailed to Tampines Avenue 7 where the CNB officers lost sight of the car after it made a sudden U-turn. As for the Trailer, it was tailed to Tuas Checkpoint where it passed through the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) gantry at about 10.15pm and departed for Malaysia.</span></p>
<p><span>7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Five days after the incident, Rizwan left Singapore illegally and entered Malaysia by hiding in the boot of a car. He was eventually arrested on 28 November 2013 and repatriated to Singapore. Saminathan was identified as the driver of the Trailer from ICA’s records and arrested on 25 March 2014 at the Woodlands Checkpoint when he entered Singapore.</span></p>
<p><span>8<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>In the course of investigations, Zulkarnain identified Rizwan as his “Boss”, being the person whom he took orders from to collect the drugs. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The court’s decision regarding Rizwan</span></strong></p>
<p><span>9<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Rizwan contended that the Judge erred in finding that Zulkarnain’s evidence was corroborated by other evidence. He also challenged the Judge’s finding that he had knowledge of the nature of the seized drugs and intended to traffic in them: at <strong>[55]–[56]</strong>. </p>
<p><span>10<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court found that the Judge was entitled to take into account all relevant evidence before the court without first considering whether any particular piece of evidence individually satisfied the test in <em>R v Baskerville</em> [1916] 2 KB 658: at </span><strong>[63]</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>11<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court agreed with the Judge that Zulkarnain’s testimony identifying Rizwan as “Boss” was “cogent, coherent and consistent”. Zulkarnain identified Rizwan’s photograph from the day after his arrest while Rizwan was still at large and explained that he was familiar with Rizwan as he had carried out other similar transactions for Rizwan prior to 20 November 2013. Zulkarnain’s account was also supported by extrinsic evidence in the form of text messages forensically extracted from one of the handphones seized from him: at </span><strong>[65]–[67]</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>12<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>There was no reason for Zulkarnain to implicate Rizwan falsely instead of naming the real “Boss” if his purpose was to obtain a certificate of substantive assistance. At the material time of identification, Rizwan was not in custody and it could not be said that Zulkarnain was simply looking for a convenient scapegoat: at </span><strong>[69]</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>13<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>Rizwan’s account was plainly unconvincing. Rizwan claimed that he had lent the Black Mitsubishi to a man he called “Uncle” and it was the latter who informed him that something had happened to his car and then instructed him to leave home and country. However, Rizwan’s testimony contradicted the objective evidence and he was also unable to provide any explanation for the vastly differing accounts that he put forward on his whereabouts on 20 November 2013. His actions in leaving Singapore illegally also pointed to his guilt: at </span><strong>[70]–[74]</strong><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>14<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>The court also agreed with the Judge that Rizwan had the necessary <em>mens rea</em> for the charge against him. The elaborate planning of the transaction, with multiple electronic communication devices used to avoid detection, as well as Rizwan’s flight from the scene, showed that Rizwan knew the nature of the drugs. The irresistible inference from the sheer amount of diamorphine involved was that Rizwan intended to traffic it: at </span><strong>[77]</strong><span>, </span><strong>[78]</strong><span> and </span><strong>[80]</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>15<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span><span>As such, the court affirmed the Judge’s conclusion that </span>Rizwan was guilty of the charge of abetting by instigating Zulkarnain to be in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking: at <strong>[82]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>16<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In respect of Rizwan’s application in CM 11/2019 to adduce further evidence on appeal, the court explained that it had dismissed the application as it found that the evidence sought to be adduced was not reliable: at <strong>[110]</strong>, <strong>[111]</strong> and <strong>[118]</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The court’s decision regarding Saminathan</span></strong></p>
<p><span>17<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Saminathan argued that the Judge erred in placing undue weight on various strands of circumstantial evidence in order to convict him and that someone had impersonated him by using his passport to enter Singapore to carry out the drug transaction: at <strong>[57]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>18<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court was of the view that Saminathan’s conviction was safe even if the statement from his former employer, Mr Murugan a/l Silvarajoo (“Murugan”) was excluded. It was undisputed that the driver of the Trailer delivered the drugs to Zulkarnain and that the Trailer was tailed to the Tuas Checkpoint where it left for Malaysia. The ICA records showed that Saminathan drove the Trailer into and out of Singapore on numerous occasions and that Saminathan’s passport was used to exit Singapore after the drug transaction took place. The testimony of Staff Sergeant Goh Cheow Siang, who processed the exit of the Trailer, showed at the very least that the person who presented Saminathan’s passport bore a resemblance to the photograph in the passport. The fact that Saminathan’s DNA was found on the interior of one bundle of drugs from each of the red plastic bags pointed “inexorably” to Saminathan having been the one who delivered the drugs to Zulkarnain: at <strong>[97]–[99]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>19<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>As against this, Saminathan’s defence was premised on a fortuitous confluence of several highly unlikely coincidences. The impersonator would have had to be aware of Saminathan’s practice of leaving his passport on the dashboard of the Trailer or came across it by chance, borne a reasonable resemblance to Saminathan’s photo in the passport or took the chance that the discrepancy would not be noticed, and somehow managed to transfer Saminathan’s DNA onto the drug bundles. The actions of the alleged impersonator were patently illogical and highly improbable as they would add to the transaction the unnecessary risks of being stopped by the ICA at the checkpoint. Saminathan’s credit was also further diminished by his failure to mention in any of his statements the possibility of an impersonator despite claiming that he was aware of the possibility in the course of investigations: at [<strong>100]–[105]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>20<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>As such, the court agreed with the Judge’s conclusion that Saminathan was the person who delivered the drugs to Zulkarnain on the night of 20 November 2013. Given the nature of Saminathan’s defence, there was no evidence to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. The court thus affirmed Saminathan’s conviction: at <strong>[106]–[107]</strong>.</p>
<p><span>21<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In respect of Saminathan’s application in CM 4/2019 to adduce further evidence on appeal, the court explained that it had dismissed the application to admit the testimony of his mother and sister as the evidence did not satisfy the requirement of non-availability and was also unreliable. As for the remaining categories of evidence sought to be adduced, they did not satisfy the requirement of relevance: at <strong>[109]</strong> and <strong>[113]–[117]</strong>.</p>
