        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the Comptroller of Income
                    Tax (“the Comptroller”) against the decision of the High Court
                    judge (“the Judge”) granting leave to the respondent under
                    O 53 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) to apply for a quashing order
                    against the Comptroller’s letter dated 6 February 2009 (“the
                    6 February 2009 Letter”) informing the respondent that it was liable
                    to account for withholding tax on certain transactions (see <em>ACC v CIT</em> [2010] 1 SLR 273). After hearing the arguments of
                    both parties, we dismissed the Comptroller’s appeal and now give the
                    reasons for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The respondent is a company incorporated in
                    Singapore, with subsidiaries incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The
                    respondent’s subsidiaries are in the business of leasing certain
                    machinery. Each subsidiary is a special purpose company that owns only one
                    machine. To finance the purchase of the machines, a number of the subsidiaries
                    entered into loan agreements with offshore banks at a floating interest rate.
                    Some of these subsidiaries later leased out their machines at a fixed rental
                    rate (the subsidiaries which did so will hereafter be referred to collectively
                    as “the SPCs” and individually as an “SPC”). As a
                    result, the SPCs were exposed to interest rate fluctuations since the rental
                    income from their machines would not vary with changes in the interest rate on
                    the bank loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       To minimise the risk of such exposure, the SPCs
                    arranged interest swaps with onshore banks. Under these interest swap
                    arrangements, an SPC would make periodic fixed rate payments to the bank
                    concerned in exchange for the bank making floating rate payments to the SPC. The
                    risk of fluctuating interest rates would thus be passed from the SPC to the
                    onshore bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       For reasons of commercial efficiency, the SPCs
                    did not enter into the interest swap agreements with the onshore banks directly.
                    Instead, the respondent acted as a middleman for all the SPCs by entering into
                    the interest swap agreements with the onshore banks. The respondent then entered
                    into individual swap agreements with each of the SPCs which mirrored the swap
                    agreements entered into between the respondent and the onshore banks. The net
                    effect of this arrangement resulted in the SPCs and the onshore banks making
                    payments to each other as described at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>
                    above. The actual floating rate payments to the SPCs were made by the
                    respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Under s 12(6) of the Income Tax Act
                    (Cap 134, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the ITA”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There shall be deemed to be derived from
                        Singapore —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    any interest, commission, fee or any
                                other payment in connection with any loan or indebtedness or with
                                any arrangement, management, guarantee, or service relating to any
                                loan or indebtedness which is —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    borne, directly or indirectly, by a person
                                    resident in Singapore or a permanent establishment in Singapore
                                    except in respect of any business carried on outside Singapore
                                    through a permanent establishment outside Singapore or any
                                    immovable property situated outside Singapore; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(ii)   deductible against any income accruing in
                                    or derived from Singapore; or</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    any income
                                derived from loans where the funds provided by such loans are
                                brought into or used in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The significance of s 12(6) of the ITA is that
                    interest payments falling within this provision are deemed to be income
                    chargeable to tax under s 10(1)(<em>d</em>). Where
                    such interest payments are to be made to a person who is not resident in
                    Singapore, the paying party is required by s 45 of the ITA to withhold tax
                    from the sums payable, and the amount thus withheld is treated as a debt due
                    from the paying party to the Government.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The respondent did not withhold tax from the
                    floating rate payments which it made to the SPCs. It subsequently wrote to the
                    Comptroller to confirm that withholding tax was inapplicable to these payments.
                    On 6 February 2009, the Comptroller replied (via the 6 February 2009
                    Letter) as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2    … we are of the view that the payments made
                            to [the SPCs] fall within the ambit of section 12(6). The scope of
                            section 12(6) covers “<u>any</u>
                            … payment in connection with <u>any</u>
                            loan or indebtedness or with <u>any</u>
                            arrangement, management, guarantee, or service relating to <u>any</u> loan or indebtedness …”. The
                            scope of payments covered within the ambit of section 12(6) of the
                            ITA is therefore, in our view, broad and will bring the interest rate
                            swap payments made by [the respondent] to [the SPCs] within its scope
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3    … As the swap payments fall within the ambit
                            of section 12(6) of the ITA, withholding tax requirements under
                            section 45 of the ITA apply. As [the respondent] has not complied
                            with the relevant withholding tax requirements with respect to the
                            payments made to [the SPCs] for the period October 2006 to March 2008,
                            [the respondent] is required to account for the amount of tax that
                            should have been withheld … [The respondent] is also liable to
                            pay any penalty that will be imposed arising from non-compliance with
                            section 45 of the ITA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4    
              <em>We have reached determination on
                                your request after due consideration and consultation of the issue
                                raised based on the representations and information furnished.
                                … Our Enforcement Division will be contacting you separately
                                on the recovery of the tax and penalty due from [the
                                respondent]</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[underlining in original; emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">For ease of reference, we will use the expression “the material
                    SPC payments” to denote the floating rate payments mentioned in
                    para 3 of the 6 February 2009 Letter (<em>ie</em>, the floating rate payments made by the respondent to the SPCs
                    between October 2006 and March 2008).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The respondent did not agree with the
                    Comptroller’s interpretation of s 12(6) of the ITA. Nevertheless, the
                    respondent seemed to treat the 6 February 2009 Letter as containing an
                    administrative decision or a determination that, if not quashed by a court
                    order, would result in its having to pay withholding tax and any corresponding
                    penalties under s 45 of the ITA. In the course of hearing this appeal, we
                    were informed that the respondent had already paid, under protest, the amount of
                    withholding tax (but not the penalties) determined by the
                Comptroller.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The respondent subsequently obtained leave from
                    the High Court under O 53 r 1 of the ROC to apply for a quashing order
                    against the Comptroller’s determination in the 6 February 2009
                    Letter. In his grounds of decision, the Judge noted that the Comptroller’s
                    determination was a matter which was susceptible to judicial review because, in
                    making such a determination, the Comptroller had exercised his power to assess
                    and collect tax under s 4(3) of the ITA. The Judge also rejected the
                    Comptroller’s argument that the respondent had no <em>locus
                        standi</em> to seek a quashing order. He held that, since the
                    Comptroller had directed the respondent to account for the amount of withholding
                    tax which (in the Comptroller’s view) should have been deducted from the
                    material SPC payments, on pain of such amount being recovered as a debt, the
                    respondent had <em>locus standi</em> to invoke the
                    jurisdiction of the court. Having found that the respondent had an arguable case
                    in challenging the Comptroller’s interpretation of s 12(6) of the
                    ITA, the Judge accordingly granted the respondent leave to apply for a quashing
                    order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Dissatisfied with the decision of the Judge, the
                    Comptroller appealed to this court on the ground that the respondent had no
                        <em>locus standi</em> to seek a quashing order. The
                    Comptroller also introduced a new argument on appeal – namely, that it was
                    in any event an abuse of process for the respondent to take out judicial review
                    proceedings under O 53 of the ROC. Before we address the parties’
                    submissions, we should briefly note that both parties, throughout these
                    proceedings, treated the Comptroller’s determination in the
                    6 February 2009 Letter as a decision capable of being quashed. Indeed, the
                    Comptroller did not, in this appeal, challenge the Judge’s ruling that
                    that determination was susceptible to judicial review. We will comment on this
                    matter further below (at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>–<a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Comptroller’s grounds of appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The <em>locus standi</em> of the
                respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Comptroller argued that the respondent did
                    not have <em>locus standi</em> to apply for a quashing
                    order because the tax liabilities in question were the SPCs’ and not the
                    respondent’s. The respondent, it was contended, was only a collecting
                    agent which owed a debt to the Government due to non-compliance with an
                    obligation imposed under the ITA, and should not be given the same right as if
                    it were the taxpayer. This argument had earlier been made before the Judge, who
                    (as mentioned at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) rejected it on
                    the ground that, since the respondent was being made liable for the amount of
                    withholding tax which (in the Comptroller’s view) should have been
                    deducted from the material SPC payments, it had <em>locus
                        standi</em> to object to the Comptroller’s
                determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Before us, the Comptroller referred to
                        <em>Singapore Airlines Ltd and another v Inland Revenue
                        Authority of Singapore and another</em> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 1097
                        (“<em>Singapore Airlines</em>”) in
                    support of its argument that the respondent lacked <em>locus
                        standi</em> to apply for a quashing order. In <em>Singapore Airlines</em>, G P Selvam J said at [23] apropos
                    O 15 r 16 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev
                    Ed) (the then equivalent of O 15 r 16 of the ROC):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That provision does not mean that declaratory orders can be sought by all
                        and sundry irrespective of whether there was a justiciable issue between the
                        parties. It [<em>ie</em>, a declaratory order] can be
                        sought only by persons who have a right to enforce against a defendant or by
                        persons who say that [they themselves are] not liable. It is not the
                        function or purpose of the courts to render legal opinion to indirect
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This statement was made in the context of a case where the first

                    the ITA), and therefore would not cause the first plaintiff’s employees to
                    lose their right to tax exemption <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    sums transferred. The first defendant disagreed with this view. At the
                    commencement of the hearing, Selvam J queried the <em>locus
                        standi</em> of the first plaintiff to seek the declaration in question
                    when it had no interest in the Fund and would not be liable to pay tax if the
                    proposed transfer did indeed amount to a premature withdrawal of sums in the
                    Fund. The judge eventually dismissed the application on that
                ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In our view, <em>Singapore
                        Airlines</em> is clearly distinguishable from the present case. Here,
                    the Comptroller had determined that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     the material SPC payments fell
                        within the ambit of s 12(6) of the ITA and were thus subject to
                        withholding tax under s 45; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     the respondent was <em>personally
                            liable</em> under s 45(3) to pay to the Government, as a
                        debt, the amount of withholding tax which it had failed to deduct from the
                        material SPC payments, along with any prescribed
                    penalties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, as we mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above), the respondent paid, under protest, the
                    debt claimed by the Comptroller with a view to challenging his determination
                    through legal proceedings. In these circumstances, if the respondent did not
                    have <em>locus standi</em> to commence proceedings for a
                    review of the Comptroller’s determination, we were unable to see who else
                    would have <em>locus standi</em> to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Abuse of process</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Comptroller also submitted that the
                    respondent’s application for leave to apply for a quashing order was an
                    abuse of process as the respondent should have first applied for either
                    ministerial exemption from tax or ministerial remission of tax under,
                    respectively, s 13(4) and s 92(2) of the ITA. This submission was made
                    on the basis that there was no question that the respondent was liable to pay
                    the amount assessed by the Comptroller pursuant to his determination as set out
                    in the 6 February 2009 Letter. We rejected this argument. While a person
                    seeking judicial review should normally exhaust all alternative remedies before
                    invoking the jurisdiction of the court (see <em>Borissik Svetlana
                        v Urban Redevelopment Authority</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 92 at [25]),
                    we did not consider ministerial exemption and ministerial remission under the
                    ITA to be alternative remedies for this purpose. Section 13(4) of the ITA
                    allows the Minister to exempt certain payments which constitute income under
                    either s 12(6) or s 12(7) from tax if the payments are “made
                    for any purpose which will promote or enhance the economic or technological
                    development of Singapore” (see s 13(4)). The Minister’s power
                    under s 13(4) is a discretionary power, and, if a decision is made against
                    a taxpayer pursuant to this power, such decision is not subject to challenge on
                    its merits by way of judicial review. In other words, the Minister’s
                    decision to exempt payments which constitute income under either s 12(6) or
                    s 12(7) from tax is founded on policy considerations, and such ministerial
                    exemption can hardly be considered as a remedy for an aggrieved person who
                    disputes his liability to pay tax in the first place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Similarly, the Minister’s power under
                    s 92(2) of the ITA is a discretionary power. This provision confers
                    discretion on the Minister to remit the tax payable by any person “if he
                    is satisfied that it is just and equitable to do so”. It likewise rests
                    on the premise that tax is payable in the first place, which is precisely what
                    the respondent denies and is trying to challenge in these proceedings.
                    Section 92(2) does not offer a remedy to an aggrieved taxpayer as it does
                    not operate as an appeal against the Comptroller’s interpretation of the
                    provisions in the ITA. Accordingly, since there were no alternative remedies for
                    the respondent to exhaust, it was not an abuse of process for the respondent to
                    bring judicial review proceedings in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The real question to be decided: Whether the Comptroller’s
                determination in the 6 February 2009 Letter could be quashed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Although we ruled against the Comptroller in
                    respect of both of his grounds of appeal (<em>viz</em>,
                    lack of <em>locus standi</em> and abuse of process (see
                        <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above)), it did not follow that the
                    present appeal should therefore be dismissed. We also had to consider what, in
                    our view, was the real issue in this appeal – namely, whether the
                    respondent’s application for leave to apply for a quashing order had no
                    basis as there was nothing for the court to quash. This argument was not raised
                    by the Comptroller, but, as just mentioned, we regarded it as the crux of the
                    present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is trite law that a quashing order will not
                    lie unless a public authority has done something that a court can quash or, in
                    other words, deprive of legal effect (see <em>De Smith’s
                        Judicial Review</em> (Lord Woolf, Jeffrey Jowell &amp; Andrew Le
                    Sueur eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007) (“<em>De Smith</em>”) at paras 18-026 and 18-027). In <em>Regina v Statutory Visitors to St Lawrence’s Hospital,
                        Caterham; Ex parte Pritchard</em> [1953] 1 WLR 1158, for
                    instance, Parker J said (at 1166) that a quashing order “[could]
                    only [lie] to bring up to [the] court and quash something which [was] a
                    determination or a decision”. In that case, the court refused to quash a
                    report as to the need for the continued detention of a mental defective because
                    the power to order continued detention rested in another body, and not the body
                    which prepared the report; as such, the report did not have any legal force of
                    its own. Similarly, in <em>R (on the application of the
                        Association of British Travel Agents Ltd) v Civil Aviation
                        Authority</em> [2007] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 249, the English Court
                    of Appeal saw no need to quash a guidance note which contained erroneous
                    statements of law because it did not affect existing or future rights. Instead,
                    the court ordered the guidance note to be withdrawn because it had the potential
                    to mislead the public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Australian courts have adopted a similar
                    position. This can be seen from (<em>inter alia</em>) the
                    High Court of Australia’s decision in <em>Ainsworth and
                        another v Criminal Justice Commission</em> (1992) 175 CLR 564
                        (“<em>Ainsworth</em>”). In that case, the
                    applicant was defamed by a report which had been tabled in the Parliament of
                    Queensland without his having had a chance to answer the allegations contained
                    in the report. The High Court of Australia readily granted a declaration that
                    there had been a breach of natural justice, but refused to quash the report.
                    Four members of the court (<em>viz</em>, Mason CJ and
                    Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ), in a joint judgment, held at 580:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The function of certiorari [<em>ie</em>, a quashing
                        order] is to quash the legal effect or the legal consequences of the
                        decision or order under review. The report made and delivered by the
                        [Criminal Justice] Commission has, of itself, no legal effect and carries no
                        legal consequences, whether direct or indirect. It is different when a
                        report or recommendation operates as a precondition or as a bar to a course
                        of action, or as a step in a process capable of altering rights, interests
                        or liabilities. A report or a recommendation of that kind may be quashed,
                        that is to say its legal effect may be nullified by certiorari.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, Brennan J, who agreed with the other judges, held in a
                    separate judgment at 595:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Certiorari is not available. Certiorari might go to quash a report if its
                        production or furnishing were to affect directly a prosecutor’s rights
                        or were to subject them in some way to a new hazard but, as the [Criminal
                        Justice] Commission’s Report has no legal effect, there is nothing to
                        be quashed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is also important to note from the judgment
                    in <em>Ainsworth</em> that a decision need not in itself
                    have a direct legal effect or consequence before it can be quashed. A decision
                    which operates as a prerequisite to or a step in a process capable of altering
                    rights, interests or liabilities may also be the subject of a quashing order.
                    For instance, in <em>Hot Holdings Pty Limited v Creasy and
                        others</em> (1996) 185 CLR 149 (“<em>Creasy</em>”), which concerned a recommendation made by a
                    mining warden to the Minister under the Mining Act 1978 (WA) that a ballot
                    should be held in respect of applications for exploration licences and mining
                    leases, the High Court of Australia ruled (by a majority of 3:2) that, although
                    the mining warden’s recommendation was not binding on its own, it was
                    susceptible to a quashing order because the Minister was required to take it
                    into account and, thus, it had a discernible legal effect upon the
                    Minister’s exercise of discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     A similar situation arose in the English Court
                    of Appeal case of <em>Regina v Panel on Take-overs and Mergers,
                        Ex parte Datafin Plc and another</em> [1987] QB 815 (“<em>Datafin</em>”). That case concerned the Panel on
                    Take-overs and Mergers (“the Panel”), an unincorporated
                    association responsible for administering the City Code on Take-overs and
                    Mergers (“the Code”) and deciding if there had been violations of
                    the Code. The Panel had no statutory or contractual powers and, thus, its
                    decisions were without direct legal effect. Nonetheless, the Panel wielded
                    immense <em>de facto</em> power because a ruling by it that
                    there had been a violation of the Code would have led to other sanctions, such
                    as exclusion from the London Stock Exchange and investigation by the Department
                    of Trade and Industry. The Panel’s decisions were therefore capable of
                    indirectly affecting the rights of citizens and were held to be amenable to a
                    quashing order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     
          <em>Creasy</em> and
                        <em>Datafin</em> may be contrasted with a local case,
                        <em>Tan Eng Chye v Director of Prisons</em> [2004]
                    4 SLR(R) 521. The applicant in that case had pleaded guilty to a charge of
                    robbery which carried a mandatory sentence of not less than 12 strokes of the
                    cane. The district judge called for a pre-sentence medical report to determine
                    whether the applicant was fit for caning. The medical report answered this
                    question in the affirmative and the applicant was accordingly sentenced to
                    caning. The applicant subsequently sought to have the medical report quashed,
                    but failed. The High Court held that the district judge was bound by law to
                    impose the mandatory sentence of caning irrespective of what the medical report
                    stated. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,
                    1985 Rev Ed) requiring a prisoner to be certified by a medical officer as
                    being fit for caning only applied at the post-sentence stage when the sentence
                    of caning was about to be carried out. As such, the pre-sentence medical report
                    was redundant and did not have any legal effect on the applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     From the authorities, it appears to us that a
                    quashing order will only lie against decisions which have some form of actual or
                    ostensible legal effect, whether direct or indirect. A mere opinion clearly does
                    not fall within this category. This can be seen from <em>Regina v
                        Secretary of State for Employment, Ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission
                        and another</em> [1995] 1 AC 1, a decision of the House of Lords.
                    In that case, the Equal Opportunities Commission (“the EOC”)
                    considered that certain provisions of the Employment Protection (Consolidation)
                    Act 1978 (c 44) (UK) (“the EPCA”) were contrary to European
                    Community law (including, <em>inter alia</em>, Art 119
                    of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (“the EEC
                    Treaty”)) and wrote to the Secretary of State for Employment (“the
                    Secretary of State”) asking him to reconsider the legislation. The
                    Secretary of State replied via a letter stating his view that the statutory
                    provisions concerned were justifiable. The EOC then applied for judicial review
                    of the Secretary of State’s letter. The House of Lords declared that the
                    statutory provisions in question were contrary to Art 119 of the EEC
                    Treaty, but nevertheless declined to grant a quashing order. Lord Keith of
                    Kinkel, referring to the Secretary of State’s letter, held at 26:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my opinion that letter does not constitute a decision. It does no more
                        than state the Secretary of State’s view that the threshold provisions
                        of the [EPCA] regarding redundancy pay and compensation for unfair dismissal
                        are justifiable and in conformity with European Community law. The real
                        object of [the EOC’s] attack is these provisions themselves.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     A similar decision was reached in <em>Regina v London Waste Regulation Authority, Ex parte Specialist
                        Waste Management Ltd</em> (<em>The Times</em>
                    (UK), 1 November 1988). There, a public authority informed the applicant,
                    through a meeting and a series of letters, that it was required to obtain a
                    licence under the Control of Pollution Act 1974 (c 40) (UK) before it could
                    operate an incinerator on hospital grounds. The court held that the public
                    authority’s opinion was not susceptible to judicial review because it was
                    not a ruling or decision. The statute in question did not give any power to the
                    public authority to make rulings or orders in individual cases placed before it.
                    In communicating its opinion, the public authority was merely expressing its
                    understanding of the law in relation to the applicant’s proposal to
                    operate an incinerator at a hospital. It was open to the applicant to proceed to
                    operate the incinerator as planned and have the matter tested in court if the
                    public authority chose to prosecute it for failing to obtain a licence before
                    beginning to operate the incinerator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the present case, the Comptroller purported
                    to determine the liability of the respondent for withholding tax as if he were
                    exercising a statutory power, with the consequence that the respondent would be
                    legally bound by and obliged to comply with such a determination. The
                    6 February 2009 Letter stated (in para 4) that the Comptroller had
                    “reached determination on [the respondent’s]
                        request”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and that
                    “[the] Enforcement Division [would] be contacting [the respondent]
                    separately on the recovery of the tax and penalty due from
                        [it]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The tone of this letter
                    indicated the finality of the Comptroller’s decision that the respondent
                    was liable for withholding tax <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    material SPC payments and must arrange to pay the amount assessed or computed as
                    being payable on the facts disclosed by the respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The respondent’s position was that the
                    Comptroller’s determination was incorrect in law and that it was not
                    liable for withholding tax in relation to the material SPC payments as no tax
                    was payable by the SPCs. Nonetheless, as a responsible commercial enterprise,
                    the respondent decided to pay, under protest, the amount of withholding tax
                    demanded by the Comptroller with a view to taking court proceedings to nullify
                    or set aside the Comptroller’s determination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The question thus arose as to whether the
                    Comptroller’s determination was a decision which had actual or ostensible
                    legal effect, whether direct or indirect, on the respondent. If that
                    determination were made under a statutory power and were binding on the
                    respondent unless and until it was set aside by a court, then it would certainly
                    affect the rights of the respondent. If, on the other hand, the determination
                    had no such effect, it would be nothing more than an expression of the
                    Comptroller’s opinion or view as regards the respondent’s liability
                    for withholding tax. Such a determination would be no more than advice to the
                    respondent or an answer to the query by the respondent as to its liability for
                    withholding tax, and the respondent was free to disregard the determination if
                    it did not agree with it. In the present case, the respondent disagreed with the
                    Comptroller’s determination, but did not feel free (from a commercial
                    point of view) to disregard it. Hence, it paid under protest the withholding tax
                    determined by the Comptroller and commenced these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Despite the wording used in the
                    6 February 2009 Letter, we were doubtful if the Comptroller’s
                    determination had any actual or ostensible legal effect (whether direct or
                    indirect) on the respondent’s liability to pay the amount claimed by the
                    Comptroller. There seems to be nothing in the ITA which gives the Comptroller
                    the power to unilaterally determine an individual’s liability for
                    withholding tax under s 45.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In this connection, we sought the views of
                    counsel for the Comptroller as to the relevance of s 89 of the ITA
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Comptroller’s purported
                    determination. Section 89 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Suit for tax by
                            Comptroller</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>89</b>.—(1) Notwithstanding the
                        provisions of any other written law, tax, interest and any penalty imposed
                        under this Act and any sum due to the Government under sections 44, 44A
                        and 45, may be sued for by way of a specially endorsed writ of
                        summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    In any suit under this section, the production of
                            a certificate signed by the Comptroller giving the name and address of
                            the defendant and the amount of tax, interest or penalty due [from] him
                            shall be sufficient evidence of the amount so due and sufficient
                            authority for the court to give judgment for that amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     We asked counsel for the Comptroller whether,
                    if the Comptroller were to commence proceedings under s 89 of the ITA
                    against the respondent to recover the debt referred to in the 6 February
                    2009 Letter, the latter would be entitled to dispute its liability to pay the
                    tax demanded. Counsel for the Comptroller conceded that the respondent might be
                    able to resist the Comptroller’s claim on the ground that the
                    Comptroller’s determination was wrong in law. On the basis of this
                    concession, it was clear to us that the Comptroller’s determination in the
                    6 February 2009 Letter was nothing more than an expression of the
                    Comptroller’s opinion. Regardless of whether or not that determination was
                    final from the Comptroller’s point of view, it had no actual or ostensible
                    legal effect on the respondent. Section 89(4) of the ITA, which empowers
                    the Comptroller to issue a certificate conclusive of (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) the <em>amount</em> of tax due for the
                    purposes of proceedings under s 89, only precludes a taxpayer from
                    disputing the <em>quantum</em> of tax demanded, and not his
                        <em>liability</em> to pay that amount. It would follow
                    that the respondent could simply have ignored the Comptroller’s demand for
                    payment and waited for the Comptroller to commence proceedings against it under
                    s 89 to recover the amount which was allegedly payable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above, the Judge held that the Comptroller’s
                    determination in the 6 February 2009 Letter was reviewable because the
                    Comptroller had been exercising his power to assess and collect tax under
                    s 4(3) of the ITA when he made that determination. Section 4(3) of the
                    ITA reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Powers of
                        Comptroller</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>4</b>. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The Comptroller shall be responsible for the
                            assessment and collection of tax and shall pay all amounts collected in
                            respect thereof into the Consolidated Fund.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     With respect, although this aspect of the
                    Judge’s ruling was not challenged by the Comptroller on appeal, we did not
                    agree with the Judge’s reading of s 4(3) of the ITA. That provision
                    merely states the <em>responsibility</em> of the
                    Comptroller to assess and collect tax, and to pay all amounts collected into the
                    Consolidated Fund. It does not confer any <em>power</em> on
                    the Comptroller to make binding determinations of law concerning the provisions
                    of the ITA in the discharge of this responsibility. Instead, as counsel for the
                    Comptroller conceded, it is the court alone which can make such determinations
                    of law if the Comptroller chooses to bring an action under s 89 of the
                    ITA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the circumstances, the legal position of
                    the respondent was really that it was under no liability at all to pay any
                    withholding tax under s 45 of the ITA until a court had decided that it was
                    so liable. That being the case, the 6 February 2009 Letter did not contain
                    any decision having actual or ostensible legal effect for the court to quash,
                    and the proper remedy of the respondent would have been to commence (by filing a
                    normal originating summons) an action for a declaration of non-liability, which
                    action is (as can be seen from O 15 r 16 of the ROC) maintainable in
                    our courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The question which we had to decide,
                    therefore, was whether we should allow the present appeal on the ground that the
                    respondent should have applied for a declaration instead of a quashing order, or
                    let the appeal proceed on the basis that the parties had agreed that there was a
                    determination by the Comptroller which had some legal effect on the respondent.
                    In our view, since both parties had already accepted the Judge’s ruling
                    that the Comptroller’s determination in the 6 February 2009 Letter
                    was susceptible to a quashing order and since the Comptroller did not challenge
                    this particular aspect of the Judge’s decision before us, this appeal
                    should, in the interests of procedural convenience and efficiency, proceed on
                    that basis, <em>ie</em>, on the basis that the
                    6 February 2009 Letter did contain a determination by the Comptroller which
                    was susceptible to judicial review. Indeed, as we noted earlier (at, <em>inter alia</em>, <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> and
                        <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), the respondent had already
                    paid the amount of withholding tax demanded, albeit under protest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Furthermore, the dispute between the parties
                    involved a pure question of law, <em>viz</em>, whether the
                    material SPC payments fell within the ambit of s 12(6) of the ITA. Both
                    counsel for the Comptroller and counsel for the respondent confirmed at the
                    hearing of this appeal that all the relevant facts were before the court, and
                    that there was no issue of any dispute of facts arising. Since the substantive
                    question of law to be decided could be determined by the court regardless of
                    whether the parties proceeded by way of an action for a declaration or an action
                    for judicial review, we decided that, procedurally and substantively, the
                    respondent should be allowed to continue with the present appeal on the basis
                    that the Comptroller’s determination in the 6 February 2009 Letter
                    was susceptible to judicial review. In our view, given the particular
                    circumstances of this case, for the court to require the respondent to
                    recommence proceedings for a declaratory judgment would be to take an overly
                    legalistic view of what procedural justice requires.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     To recapitulate, we dealt with this appeal on
                    the basis that the Comptroller’s determination in the 6 February 2009
                    Letter could be subject to judicial review, and we rejected the
                    Comptroller’s arguments (as outlined at <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above) as to why the Judge should not have granted the
                    respondent leave to apply for a quashing order. For these reasons, we dismissed
                    this appeal with costs and the usual consequential orders.</p>
