One way to achieve this was to interpose an Australian company and then proceed with a share swap. Having received approval in respect of shares issued to the holders of convertible notes, but without the support of 45% of the body of shareholders as it stood prior to the issue of those new shares, the Australian company seeks to rely on the provisions of Companies Act s 215 (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “CA”) to compulsorily acquire the shares held by those non-assenting shareholders.

A term sheet had thus been executed with an Australian private equity fund for an AUD 5 million investment (“the Investment”), and there were some conditions which needed to be satisfied. Verrency Singapore therefore intended to do the following in “entirely separate and independent actions”:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) convert the convertible notes to ordinary fully paid shares in Verrency Singapore; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) exchange shares and options in Verrency Singapore for shares in Verrency Australia on a like-for-like basis; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) become a subsidiary of Verrency Australia.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 To achieve this, Verrency Singapore asked applicants to execute a “Share Swap Acceptance Deed”, which would provide Verrency Singapore with a limited power of attorney to transfer the applicants’ shares in Verrency Singapore to Verrency Australia, and to subscribe for shares in Verrency Australia on their behalf. The deadline for execution of the Share Swap Acceptance Deed was 29 June 2021. None of the applicants executed the Share Swap Acceptance Deed.

The first is that Verrency Australia has not fulfilled the requirements set out in CA s 215(1), that an offer made by Verrency Australia has been approved by the holders of not less than 90% of the shares in Verrency Singapore. It is therefore not entitled to rely on CA s 215(1) to compulsorily acquire their shares. The second prong is that a compulsory acquisition of their shares by Verrency Australia would be unfair, and the court should therefore not allow it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The applicants first argue that Verrency Australia never made an offer to acquire their shares. The 22 June Shareholder Letter was not sent on behalf of Verrency Australia, nor did it purport to be. In any case, Verrency Australia had not even been incorporated on 22 June 2021. Thus, the 22 June Shareholder Letter was simply Verrency Singapore seeking approval on certain matters from its shareholders – it was not an offer from Verrency Australia to acquire their shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The applicants also argue that, even if the 22 June Shareholder Letter was an offer by Verrency Australia, Verrency Australia did not receive the 90% acceptance of its offer that is required under CA s 215(1). This is because, on 22 June 2021, the applicants collectively held 14.589% of the shares in Verrency Singapore. Without their approval, the 90% threshold could not have been crossed.

They submitted that the offer for the purposes of CA s 215(1) was made to all shareholders of Verrency Singapore on 5 August 2021, when the Share Swap Agreement was signed. It was then pointed out that the offer could not have been made on 5 August 2021 because the 28 September Notice referred to 4 August 2021 as the date “within 4 months of making the offer in that behalf by [Verrency Australia]”, and because on 5 August 2021 Verrency Australia had already acquired the shares that it currently holds in Verrency Singapore. The respondents revised their position once more. Their final position is that the offer was made by Verrency Australia to all shareholders of Verrency Singapore (including the convertible noteholders) when the Share Swap Agreement was implemented on 4 August 2021 upon Verrency Australia’s shareholders’ resolution, executed by Norwood as its then sole shareholder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The respondents submit that the 90% threshold has clearly been met, since the Share Swap Agreement was approved by holders of 98.11% of shares in Verrency Singapore.

</div> The option to convert lay solely with the convertible noteholders, and thus Verrency Singapore had to offer them attractive terms to ensure that they converted. In any case, the share swap was entirely separate from the Conversion. The Conversion was between the convertible noteholders and Verrency Singapore, and did not involve Verrency Australia in any way. As such, the conversion rate given to the convertible noteholders is irrelevant in assessing the fairness of Verrency Australia’s one for one share swap offer to acquire the shares in Verrency Singapore.

</div> It is also irrelevant that the applicants wish to commence a suit for minority oppression. It cannot be that the right of Verrency Australia to compulsorily acquire the applicants’ shares is nullified by or subject to the applicants’ intention to sue parties other than Verrency Australia.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Additional question raised by court  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 At the conclusion of the hearing, I offered counsel the opportunity to file written submissions on whether convertible notes are “units of shares” if the right of the holders to convert is not at a fixed or determinable price but at a price to be agreed with the company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The point arose because the term “shares” in CA s 215 of the includes “units of shares”, per s 215(8A). “Unit” is defined by CA s 4 as “any right or interest, whether legal or equitable, in the share… and includes any option to acquire any such right or interest in the share…”  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I posed this question because the respondents contended, as noted at [25] above, that the convertible notes were always shares for the purposes of CA s 215(1) because they conferred a right to convert into shares on the holders. I doubted this proposition given that there was no price for conversion fixed at the time of issue of the notes, not even by reference to any formula or benchmark. Thus, it was only a right to seek to agree a price for conversion that arose shortly before the notes matured. While I expressed these doubts, I recognised that the question had not been fully explored in counsel’s submissions and particularly wanted to give the respondents the chance to address it properly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Only the applicants chose to avail themselves of this opportunity. Their submission in essence was that an “option to acquire a right or interest” under CA s 4 must be an option for a price that is either fixed in advance or determinable by a formula or by reference to a benchmark. A note with an unpriced conversion right, for which the price depends on subsequent agreement between the parties, would not amount to an option, because if the company did not agree on the price the right could not be exercised. An agreement to agree is unenforceable: <span class="font-italic">May and Butcher, Limited v R </span>[1934] 2 KB 17 at 20. Consequently, the convertible notes in this case, which contained only an unpriced right of conversion, were not units of shares for the purposes of CA s 215. The convertible noteholders did not possess a contractual right to acquire shares in Verrency Singapore, and therefore did not have a “right” or “interest” in those shares.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 This was the answer I had anticipated, and I accept that it represents the correct analysis. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The issues are twofold:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the requirements of CA s 215(1) have been met, in particular whether there was an offer made by Verrency Australia and if so whether that offer has been approved by 90% of shareholders; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if the requirements were met, whether the court should nonetheless disallow the compulsory acquisition on the ground of unfairness.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> Issue 1: Whether the requirements of CA s 215(1) have been met </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33  Section 215 of the CA enables the acquirer of a company to compulsorily purchase the shares of residual minority shareholders where its offer to shareholders has been approved by not less than 90% of shareholders of the same class. These buy-out rights mirror the sell-out rights contained in s 215(3) whereby residual minority shareholders may require the successful acquirer to purchase their shares. Buy-out rights can be traced back to the recommendations of the Greene Committee for the Companies Acts 1908–1917 in the UK almost a hundred years ago, and continue to pay an important role in facilitating takeovers and amalgamations where the vast majority of shareholders of a company agree. Nonetheless, as they permit compulsory acquisition, the provisions must be construed strictly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Thus, in the English case of <span class="font-italic">Re Chez Nico (Restaurants) Ltd</span> [1991] BCC 736, the requirement that there be an offer under the broadly similar provisions of the UK Companies Act then applicable was construed to mean an offer “capable of being accepted by the shareholders so as to give rise to a contract (whether absolute or conditional)” (at 204 para d). As the acquirers in that case only invited offers from the shareholders that they could decide whether to accept, there was no offer within the statute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I turn then to the question whether there was an offer made in this case that complies with CA s 215, before going on to the question of whether, if there was one, it was approved by 90% of shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was there an offer made by Verrency Australia?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As I have noted at [24] above, the respondents initially relied on the 22 June Shareholder Letter as the offer for the purpose of CA s 215. This letter was issued even before Verrency Australia was incorporated. The respondents thereafter revised their position twice. Their second contention was that the offer was made to all shareholders of Verrency Singapore on 5 August 2021, when the Share Swap Agreement was signed, but they fell back ultimately to a third and final contention that the offer was made by Verrency Australia to all shareholders of Verrency Singapore (including the convertible noteholders) when the Share Swap Agreement was implemented on 4 August 2021 by the directors of Verrency Singapore pursuant to the powers of attorney granted by the approving shareholders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Before considering the final position contended for, it is helpful to explain why the first and second positions failed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In relation to the respondents’ first position, reliance on the 22 June Shareholder letter as the offer was misplaced, for three distinct reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) It was not issued for or on behalf of the intended acquirer, which was at that time not even in existence. It was sent by Verrency Singapore. Verrency Australia is identified, but there is no language purporting to express any agency relationship between Verrency Singapore and Verrency Australia. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It was framed as a request to approve redomiciling to Australia under a share swap agreement via the interposition of an Australian holding company. It sought a power of attorney from the shareholder in favour of a director of Verrency Singapore, empowering that director to transfer the shareholder’s shares to Verrency Australia and subscribe on the shareholder’s behalf for the corresponding shares in Verrency Australia. Thus, it sought approval for Verrency Singapore to enter into an arrangement with Verrency Australia under which, at some point in the future, Verrency Australia would acquire the shareholder’s shares in return for shares in itself. Approval by a shareholder would not of itself result in any contract by which the shareholder could compel Verrency Australia (even if already in existence) to take its shares. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) At that date, the convertible noteholders had not converted, and as I have accepted at [30] above, they could not be described at that time as holding “units of shares”. Thus, the applicants alone held more than 10% of the shares at that time, and their non-assent meant that 90% approval could not be achieved. In fact, the respondents accept that the 22 June Shareholder Letter at no point garnered even a majority of support from the shareholders as of that date. CA s 215(1C), introduced by amendment in 2014, made clear what was already implicitly the case as a matter of legal principle, that shares issued after the date of the offer are to be disregarded. I do not agree with the respondents that this subsection is only for the benefit of the offeror and so can be waived by it unilaterally. Plainly, the subsection is also for the benefit of the shareholders to whom the offer is made at the date of the offer. Moreover, it is not just for their collective benefit but for their individual benefit. Thus, all shareholders would have to agree to disapply CA s 215(1C) if it were not to apply. Of course, if all shareholders were prepared to do that they would no doubt be happy to approve the offer unanimously too, and there would be no need to count holders of shares issued after the date of the offer to achieve the requisite threshold anyway.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Turning to the respondent’s second position, that the offer was made when the Share Swap Agreement was signed on 5 August 2021, this was abandoned once it was pointed out that based on Verrency Singapore’s records the transfers took place the day before, on 4 August 2021. Thus, as of 5 August 2021, the only shareholders in Verrency Singapore (other than Verrency Australia, whose vote would have to be disregarded for the purpose of CA s 215(1)) were those who had not approved the share swap. But there was another fatal defect. The Share Swap Agreement was only signed by the parties to it or their agents. Verrency Australia and Verrency Singapore were both parties to it. The remaining parties were shareholders of Verrency Singapore (which by now included the convertible noteholders) represented by directors of Verrency Singapore.

</div> The shareholders represented by the directors and thus party to the Share Swap Agreement were only those who had already agreed to the redomiciling and the share swap. They did not include the applicants. Thus, the Share Swap Agreement did not involve the applicants at all. It was not sent to them on 5 August 2021 and could not conceivably amount to an offer to the applicants for the purpose of CA s 215.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Further, even if it had been sent to them, it does not on the face of it contain an offer addressed to the applicants for their acceptance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The third position taken by the respondents was that the offer took place the day before, when the Share Swap Agreement was approved by a written resolution of Verrency Australia’s sole shareholder, Norwood (“4 August 2021 Resolution”).

</div> While this preceded the acquisition of the shares in Verrency Singapore by Verrency Australia (which took place later the same day), it was a resolution internal to Verrency Australia and like the Share Swap Agreement itself did not involve the applicants nor was it sent to them on 4 August 2021. Again, even if it had been sent to them, it does not on the face of it contain an offer addressed to the applicants for their acceptance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The respondents accepted that an essential feature of an “offer” is that it is communicated to the offeree. They contended that while the 4 August 2021 Resolution had not been sent to the applicants, it had been communicated to them via the 22 June Shareholder Letter which indicated that such an offer was to be made at some point in the future. I cannot accept this contention. Informing someone that an offer will be made to them in future is not in itself communication of the future offer. What must be communicated is something capable of being accepted by the shareholders so as to give rise to a contract, whether absolute or conditional (see [34] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The respondents then argued that it would have made no difference if the 4 August 2021 Resolution had been sent to the applicants. In rejecting the 22 June Shareholder Letter, and in taking out this application, the applicants have made it clear that they would not have accepted the offer anyway. Practically, the failure to communicate the offer to them has caused no prejudice, because they are currently being asked to accept exactly the same terms. This contention, however, ignores the purpose of CA s 215. As I have stated at [33] above, the requirements of CA s 215 must be strictly construed because they permit compulsory acquisition of another’s property. There is a reason for the requirement than an offer be made. When a shareholder receives an offer to acquire his shares intended to be relied on under CA s 215, it must be made clear that it is part of a general bid to acquire all the shares in the company. Only if that is clear will he know that if he wishes to reject it and avoid the operation of CA s 215(1) against him, he must find common cause with at least 10% of the shareholders (including himself) to reject the offer. If no offer is sent, whether on the assumption that it will be rejected or otherwise, the non-assenting shareholder loses the opportunity to organise opposition to the bid. Such a situation was described in <span class="font-italic">Re Chez Nico </span>at p 204: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The only offers made by [the acquirers] were offers to receive offers from shareholders. How then can there be a compulsory acquisition on the terms offered by [the acquirers]?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This conclusion does not simply reason on a legalistic interpretation of words. As [the shareholder] told me, and I accept, he was not aware when he received the letters of 15 June and 16 July that [the acquirers] were making a general bid for all the shares which they did not own…If he had known that he was facing a bid for all the shares he would have started to organise an opposition at a much earlier stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Accordingly, I hold that there was no offer made to the applicants for the purpose of CA s 215(1). Without an offer, the respondents are not entitled to rely on CA s 215(1) to compulsorily acquire the applicants shares.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was the 90% threshold for approval met?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45  In view of my finding that there was no offer, the question of meeting the 90% threshold is moot. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether there was unfairness such that the court should not allow the compulsory acquisition of the applicants’ shares?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46  This issue is also moot. In general, the question of unfairness should be addressed holistically and in the full context of the company’s situation. However, it would not be appropriate for me to make any further observations given that the question of unfairness may be material to minority oppression proceedings that the applicants may commence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The applicants have satisfied me that the requirements of CA s 215 have not been met, specifically that there was no offer made within s 215(1). Accordingly, the respondents are not entitled to proceed under CA s 215(4).
