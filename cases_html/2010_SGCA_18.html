<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by the appellant, Goh Teh Lee
                    (“Mr Goh”), against the decision of the High Court in OS
                    No 1627 of 2008. The judge in the court below (“the Judge”)
                    upheld the Strata Titles Board’s (“the Board”) decision in
                    STB No. 33 of 2008 where it granted an order, pursuant to s 84E of the Land
                    Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Act”),
                    for the collective sale of a development (“the Development”)
                    comprising of a four-storey block containing 24 flats (“Koon Seng
                    House”) and nine pre-war terrace houses, making a total of 33
                    units.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Mr Goh is the co-owner of one of the 24
                    flats (“Unit 136D”) and the sole dissentient in the proposed
                    collective sale of the Development. We should explain that at the time of the
                    hearings before the Board and the Judge, Mr Goh was involved in divorce
                    proceedings with his then-wife, the other co-owner of Unit 136D, who agreed to
                    the collective sale and appended her signature to the relevant documents. The
                    respondents to this appeal, Lim Li Pheng Maria, Liew Yeow Siang, and Gobindram
                    s/o Ramchand Chandumal (collectively “the respondents”), are
                    members of the sales committee representing the proprietors forming the majority
                    in the application for the collective sale of the Development.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       This collective sale was unusual in the sense
                    that it involved a property which had a mixed development on it, consisting of
                    not only flats (which is normally the case), but also of terrace houses all on
                    one piece of freehold land which had not been subdivided. The 24 flats were not
                    strata subdivided but were comprised in 999,999 year leases with no share
                    in the land. There was  no separate subdivided title for the terrace houses
                    either. The single owner of the terrace houses (now deceased), who was also the
                    proprietor of the land, therefore held her freehold interest in the land subject
                    to the leases of the 24 flats.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The idea of a collective sale was first raised
                    in late 2006. By mid 2007, a collective sale agreement (“the CSA”)
                    was signed by the owners of 27 out of the 33 units in the Development. Later,
                    upon realising that the stipulated reserve price for the collective sale was too
                    high, the owners, who were agreeable to the collective sale, agreed to reduce
                    the same. A supplemental agreement (“Supplemental CSA”) to that
                    effect was signed by the owners of 30 out of 33 units (which included the owners
                    of 21 out of the 24 flats). The majority then applied for and obtained an
                    allotment of notional share value for each flat and terrace house. Subsequently,
                    on 16 April 2008, an application to the Board for a collective sale order
                    in respect of the Development was lodged, whereupon Mr Goh objected to the
                    same. Despite Mr Goh’s objections, the Board made a collective sale
                    order (“the Order”) under s 84E of the Act as it stood prior
                    to the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Act 2007 (No 46 of 2007) and the
                    Statutes (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No 2) Act 2008 (No 30 of 2008).
                    However, these subsequent amendments to the Act did not concern the present
                    case. Dissatisfied, Mr Goh lodged an appeal against the Board’s
                    decision to the High Court, seeking to halt the collective sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Before the Board and the High Court, Mr Goh
                    raised numerous grounds of objection to the collective sale. They were,
                        <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_a"></a>(a)     The method of distribution for the
                        sale proceeds (which was equal distribution of the sale proceeds among the
                        33 units) was unfair. Mr Goh argued that the notional share value or
                        floor area of each unit was not taken into account. The “valuation
                        method” of distribution should have been chosen
                    instead;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_b"></a>(b)     It was not
                        possible to determine if the required 80% majority had been obtained as
                        notional share values were only assigned after the majority had executed the
                        CSA. In any case, the 80% share value was in fact not
                    obtained;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_c"></a>(c)     The
                        application to the Board for a collective sale order was out of time.
                        Mr Goh argued that the application was not made within 12 months after
                        the first 18 owners appended their signatures to the first
                    CSA;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_d"></a>(d)     Numerous
                        breaches of mandatory statutory provisions of the Act had been committed and
                        the Board could not waive the same;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_e"></a>(e)     There was an injunction made by the Subordinate Court in
                        the course of the matrimonial proceedings between Mr Goh and his
                        then-wife which prevented Mr Goh from disposing of his assets, and the
                        Board did not have the power to override the order of the Subordinate Court;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_5-p2_f"></a>(f)     Pursuant to
                        s 84E(11) of the Act, the owner of the nine terrace houses was not
                        entitled to the proceeds of the collective sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Being
                    dissatisfied with his appeal being dismissed by the High Court, Mr Goh then
                    further appealed to this court, seeking to reverse the Judge’s
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Preliminary issue before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Prior to the scheduled hearing of the appeal, we
                    asked for submissions on whether it was necessary, under the existing scheme for
                    collective sales, for co-owners (whether by way of joint tenancy or common
                    tenancy) to act together if they wanted to either support or oppose a proposed
                    sale. The answer to this question was pivotal, as it would determine whether
                    Mr Goh had the <em>locus standi</em> to lodge not only
                    the appeal before us, but also the appeal before the court below, and his
                    objections before the Board. Should Mr Goh lack the requisite <em>locus standi</em>, it would mean that he would not have a
                    right to address us on the merits of his case, <em>viz</em>, his substantive objections to the collective
                sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Having analysed and considered the submissions
                    of both parties, we concluded that all co-owners had to act together to either
                    support or oppose a proposed sale. As Mr Goh’s ex-wife, the other
                    co-owner of unit 136D, did not object to the collective sale, and had in fact
                        <em>agreed</em> to the collective sale, we found that
                    Mr Goh did not have the <em>locus standi</em> to
                    appeal against the Board’s Order (be it before this court or the High
                    Court) or to object before the Board in relation to the proposed collective sale
                    of the Development. Accordingly, we dismissed his appeal before us. We now set
                    out the reasons for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The nature of co-ownership</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Our decision that all co-owners must act
                    together to either support or oppose a proposed sale is premised on first, the
                    nature of the interest that is being held by the co-owners, specifically, the
                    concurrent interests in the same property, and second, the collective sale
                    regime set out under the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It is trite law that an interest in the same
                    property can be owned by two or more persons at the same time, thereby entitling
                    them to simultaneous enjoyment of that property. This form of concurrent
                    ownership of an interest in land is known as co-ownership. Its increasing
                    prevalence in Singapore reflects family patterns of today and the rising cost of
                    housing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     There are two types of co-ownership in
                    Singapore, <em>viz</em>, joint tenancy and tenancy in
                    common (For a general discussion on the nature of joint tenancy and tenancy in
                    common, see <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>
                    vol 14 (Lexis Nexis, 2009 Reissue) at paras 170.0034-170.0037 and
                    170.0046-170.0048; Kevin Gray &amp; Susan Francis Gray, <em>Elements of Land Law</em> (Oxford University Press,
                        5<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2009) at pp 913-926, Robert Megarry
                    and William Wade, <em>The Law of Real Property</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 7<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008) at pp 489-494; and
                    Tan Sook Yee, Tang Hang Wu &amp; Kelvin FK Low, <em>Tan Sook
                        Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law</em> (Lexis Nexis,
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2009) at pp 187-191).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Joint tenancy is that form of co-ownership
                    where each of the co-owners is entitled to the whole of the interest which is
                    the subject of co-ownership. In a joint-tenancy, each joint tenant holds the
                    whole jointly and nothing severally: <em>quilibet totum tenet et
                        nihil tenet; scilicet, totum in communi, et nihil separatism per
                        se</em> [each holds the entirety and yet holds nothing; that is, the
                    entirety in common, and nothing separately by itself]. Joint tenants have rights
                        <em>inter se</em>, but against the world they are seen
                as one single owner. Thus, no one joint tenant holds any specific or
                    distinct share of the co-owned interest himself. Rather, the interest of each
                    joint tenant is identical and lies in the whole and every part of the land, and
                    none of that land is held by one joint tenant to the exclusion of the rest.
                    Blackstone wrote (Sir William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the
                        Laws of England vol </em>2 (London,
                        15<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1809) at p 181):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Joint-tenants are said to be seised <em>per my et per
                            tout</em> [by half and by all], by the half or <em>moiety</em>, and by <em>all</em>: that is,
                        they each of them have the entire possession, as well of every <em>parcel</em> as of the <em>whole</em>. They have not, one of them a seisin of one half or
                        moiety, and the other of the other moiety; neither can one be exclusively
                        seised of one acre, and his companion of another; but <b><em>each has an undivided moiety of the whole, and not the whole of an
                            undivided moiety</em></b>. [original emphasis in italics, emphasis in
                        bold italics added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     This position was reaffirmed recently by Lee
                    Seiu Kin J in <em>Shafeeg bin Salim Talib and another
                        (administrators of the estate of Obeidillah bin Salim bin Talib, deceased) v
                        Fatimah bte Abud bin Talib and others</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 439 (“<em>Shafeeg
                    HC</em>”). The learned judge wrote at [9] quoting from <em>Megarry and Wade: The Law of Real Property</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 7<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008) at 13-003 that “it is
                    often said … that each joint tenant holds nothing by himself and yet
                    holds the whole together with the other”. We should add that <em>Shafeeg HC</em> went on appeal to this court which very
                    recently (after we had decided in the present appeal) released its judgment
                    affirming the determination of the court below on this point (<em>Shafeeg bin Salim Talib and another (administrators of the estate of
                        Obeidillah bin Salim bin Talib, deceased) v Fatimah bte Abud bin Talib and
                        others</em> [2010] SGCA 11 (“<em>Shafeeg CA</em>”)). This court in <em>Shafeeg
                        CA</em> stated at [39] and [40]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… in a joint tenancy no interest in the joint property

                        word “passes” to describe the legal effect of the right of
                        survivorship, the word was used as a figure of speech since under English

                            accrescendi</em> was described. The joint tenancy is a peculiar
                        institution of English land law which has been received as part of the law
                        of Singapore since 1826 under the Second Charter and which the courts have
                        not found necessary to modify to suit the circumstances of the local
                        inhabitants. English land law was a law of general application which was
                        entirely suitable for local conditions as no functional system of law
                        practically existed in Singapore at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The true doctrine is set out in Wayne Morrison ed, <em>William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of
                            England</em> vol II (Cavendish Publishing Limited, 2001) at
                        para 184, where the chronicler of the common law said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">From the same principle also arises the remaining grand incident of
                            joint estates; <em>viz</em>. the doctrine of
                                <em>survivorship</em>: by which, when two or
                            more persons are seized of a joint estate, of inheritance, for their own
                            lives, or <em>pur auter vie</em>, or are jointly
                            possessed of any chattel interest, <b><u>the entire
                                tenancy upon the decease of any of them remains to the survivors,
                                and at length to the last survivor; and he shall be entitled to the
                                whole estate, whatever it be, whether an inheritance or a common
                                freehold only, or even a less estate. This is the natural and
                                regular consequence of the union and entirely of their interest. The
                                interest of two joint-tenants is not only equal or similar, but also
                                is one and the same</u></b>. One has not originally a distinct
                            moiety from the other; but, if by any subsequent act (as by alienation
                            or forfeiture of either) the interest becomes separate and distinct, the
                            joint-tenancy instantly ceases. <b><u>But, while it
                                continues, each of two joint-tenants has a concurrent interest in
                                the whole; and therefore, on the death of his companion, the sole
                                interest in the whole remains to the survivor</u></b>. <u>For the interest which the survivor originally had is
                                clearly not divested by the death of his companion; and no other person can now claim to have a</u><em><u>joint</u></em><u>estate with him, for no one can now have an
                                interest in the whole, accruing by the same title, and taking effect
                                at the same time with his own; neither can any one claim
                                a</u><em><u>separate</u></em><u>interest in any part of tenements; for that would be
                                to deprive the survivor of the right which he has in all, and every
                                part. As therefore the survivor’s original interest in the
                                whole still remains</u>; and as no one can now be
                            admitted, either jointly or severally, to any share with him therein; it
                            follows, that his own interest must now be entire and several, and that
                            he shall alone be entitled to the whole estate (whatever it be) that was
                            created by the original grant.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Tenancy in common, by contrast, is the form of
                    co-ownership in which co-owners own specific, but undivided <em>shares</em> in the land. Coke explains the essential difference
                    between joint tenants and tenants in common as follows (Edward Coke, <em>The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England</em>:
                    or, <em>A Commentary upon Littleton</em> (London,
                        19<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1832) at 188b):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he essential difference between [joint tenants] and tenants in common
                        is, that [joint tenants] have the lands by one joint title and in one right,
                        and tenants in common by severall titles, or by one title and by severall
                        rights; which is the reason, that [joint tenants] have one joint freehold,
                        and tenants in common have severall freeholds. [Only] this [property] is
                        common to them both, viz. that their occupation is individed, and neither of
                        them knoweth his part in severall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Hence, the main difference lies in the fact that unlike joint tenants,
                    tenants in common hold distinct “shares” in a single piece of
                    land, albeit land which has not yet been divided physically among the co-owners.
                    Whilst the tenancy in common continues, each tenant in common has a separate and
                    distinct interest of his own in the land held in common. This interest can be
                    assigned either to a third party or to the other co-owner(s). However, each
                    tenant in common does not own any specific part of the land over another part.
                    Instead, his interest in that piece of land attaches to any part of the
                    land.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Co-ownership and the Land Titles (Strata) Act</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     With this understanding of the nature of
                    co-ownership, we now turn to the Act. The Judge found that the application for a
                    collective sale order in respect of the Development came within s 84E of
                    the Act. We saw no reason to disagree with his finding. Under
                    s 84E(3)(b), an application for a collective sale order may be made to the
                    Board by:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the <em>proprietors</em> of the flats who own not
                        less than 80% notional share of the land where 10 years or more have passed
                        since the date of the issue of the latest Temporary Occupation Permit on
                        completion of any building comprised in the development or, if no Temporary Occupation Permit was issued, the date of the issue of the
                        latest Certificate of Statutory Completion for any building comprised in the
                        development, whichever is the later [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Additionally, s 84E(5) allows “a
                        <em>proprietor</em> of any flat in the development who
                    has not agreed in writing to the sale referred to in [s84E(3)]” to file
                    an objection with the Board, stating the grounds for the objection. Section 3 of
                    the Act defines “subsidiary proprietor” to mean, <em>inter alia</em>, “the registered subsidiary proprietor
                    for the time being of the <em>entire</em> estate in a lot
                    including an estate for life, an estate in remainder or an estate in
                    reversion”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Because the definition of “subsidiary
                    proprietor” requires the person to be proprietor of the <em>entire</em> estate, in cases where a flat is co-owned by
                    tenants in common, a single tenant in common will not be a subsidiary proprietor
                    within the ambit of s 84E(3) and (5) for the purpose of supporting or
                    opposing a proposed sale since this co-owner would not be the owner of the
                    entire interest (as required under s 3 of the Act) but merely an owner of a
                        <em>distinct portion</em> of the estate, for example, a
                    one-quarter interest or even a one-half share of the land held in common.
                    Accordingly, all tenants in common of a particular flat will have to act in
                    concert before that unit can be reckoned to be either in support of or in
                    opposition to a proposed sale under s 84E(3) and (5).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In the situation where a flat is co-owned by
                    joint tenants, which was the situation at hand (it was not disputed that
                    Mr Goh and his ex-wife both hold Unit 136D as joint tenants), <em>prima facie</em>, one joint tenant may, on his own, support
                    or oppose a collective sale order under s 84E(3) and (5) respectively,
                    since each joint tenant owns the whole of the interest together with the other
                    joint tenants. However, this cannot be right, as it directly contradicts the
                    nature of a joint tenancy. Joint tenants hold just one estate. As a result, a
                    distinct characteristic of a joint tenancy is the presence of the four unities,
                        <em>viz</em>, unity of interest, unity of title, unity
                    of time and unity of possession. This was explained by Blackstone in his
                        <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England</em> at
                    pp 179-180:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]he properties of a joint estate are derived from its unity, which is
                        fourfold; the unity of interest, the unity of title, the unity of time, and
                        the unity of possession: or, in other words, joint-tenants have one and the
                        same interest [unity of interest], accruing by one and the same conveyance
                        [unity of title], commencing at one and the same time [unity of time], and
                        held by one and the same undivided possession [unity of possession]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Since the interest of each joint tenant is the same in extent, nature
                    and duration, a necessary consequence is that each and every joint tenant must
                    partake in any dealings with the whole legal estate before such dealings may
                    effectively bind the entire estate. An action by one joint tenant, or even by
                    some joint tenants but short of all of them collectively, will not suffice to
                    bind the estate, as the whole estate does not reside in the single joint tenant
                    or the select few (as the case may be).</p>

          <em>Leek and Moorlands Building
                        Society v Clark and others</em> [1952] 2 QB 788
                        (“<em>Leek and Moorlands Building
                    Society</em>”) is the <em>locus classicus</em>
                    for this proposition. <em>Leek and Moorlands Building
                        Society</em> involved a couple who were joint tenants of a
                    rent-controlled dwelling house. The husband purchased the reversion of the long
                    lease-hold interest of the dwelling house from the landlords and sold it on to
                    Clark, who obtained a mortgage from Leek and Moorlands Building Society. The
                    sale between the landlords and the husband was “subject to the existing
                    tenancy” but these words were deleted from the agreement of resale
                    between the husband and Clark. Instead, they were substituted with an express
                    provision that “vacant possession will be given on completion”.
                    The wife, the other joint tenant, knew of the sale and resale but not the
                    provision relating to vacant possession. Subsequently, Leek and Moorlands
                    Building Society brought proceedings against the couple for possession of the
                    premises and the couple argued that they were entitled to remain in occupation.
                    In affirming the decision of the lower court, the English Court of Appeal said
                    at p 795:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[O]ne of two joint lessees cannot, in the absence of
                            express words or authority, surrender rights held jointly. If property
                            or rights are held jointly, prima facie, a transfer must be by or under
                            the authority of all interest</em>… if a joint enterprise
                        is due to terminate on a particular day, all concerned must agree if it is
                        to be renewed or continued beyond that day… it will only be continued
                        if “all shall please”. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The requirement that joint tenants must act
                    jointly before the estate may be bound by their actions continues to operate in
                    more recent times. In <em>Malhotra v Choudhury</em> [1980]
                    Ch 52, a case involving a sale by the defendant to the plaintiff of a particular
                    property, which was owned by the defendant and his wife as joint tenants,
                    Stephenson LJ found that where a vendor of real property sought to limit
                    his liability for breach of the contract of sale, he was under a duty to show
                    that he had used his best endeavours to fulfil his contractual obligations. On
                    the facts, Stephenson LJ found at 70F that the case before him was not a
                    case where the defendant’s difficulties in discovering whether he had a
                    perfectly good title could excuse him. Rather, the defendant “knew all
                    along what his title was to [the property] and that he shared it with his
                    wife.” (at 70F). Yet, he granted an option to sell the property which he
                    “clearly knew could not be enforced against him without [his
                    wife’s] concurrence” (at 70F). There was also no evidence that
                    the defendant had attempted to obtain his wife’s consent to the sale.
                    Hence, Stephenson LJ concluded that the defendant had not discharged the
                    burden of proving that he was unable to convey the property to the plaintiff.
                    Implicit in Stephenson LJ’s decision was the proposition that in a
                    sale of jointly owned property, the purchaser would only take good title if he
                    received a disposition from all of the joint tenants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Similarly, in the Singapore case of <em>Mookka Pillai Rajagopal and others v Khushvinder Singh
                        Chopra</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 210 (“<em>Mookka Pillai Rajagopal</em>”), a case concerning the sale of
                    a property known as 91 Jalan Seaview, which was jointly owned by the three
                    appellants, the Court of Appeal held at [21] and [22] that where land was held
                    by three persons as joint tenants, an option to sell the whole interest which
                    was signed by only two of them was an “incomplete or unperfected option
                    and was ineffective as an option to the respondent to purchase the
                    property”. In <em>Mookka Pillai Rajagopal</em>, the
                    option to purchase 91 Jalan Seaview, which was granted to the respondent,
                    purported to emanate from all three appellants. However, it was signed by only
                    two of them. Despite objections from the third appellant, the respondent
                    exercised the option and lodged a caveat against the property to protect his
                    interest as purchaser. The Court of Appeal subsequently ordered the caveat be
                    removed. The principle established in <em>Mookka Pillai
                        Rajagopal</em> was accepted (though distinguished on the facts) by Woo
                    Bih Li JC (as he then was) in the later case of <em>Fong Yoke San
                        and another v Chan Lee Pa</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 739
                        (“<em>Fong Yoke San</em>”). Unlike
                        <em>Mookka Pillai Rajagopal</em>, the option to
                    purchase in <em>Fong Yoke San</em> granted to the plaintiff
                    emanated only from the defendant, who was one of three joint tenants of a
                    property known as 50 Jalan Lembah, and not from all three joint tenants. Woo JC
                    found that there was no need for all three joint tenants to execute the
                    option before a valid contract <em>between the plaintiffs and the
                        defendant</em> could arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Arising from the requirement that joint
                    tenants must act jointly before the estate may be bound by their actions is the
                    rule that in cases involving actions as to the joint estate, one joint tenant
                    may not sue or be sued without joining the others. In <em>Williams v British Gas Corporation</em> (1980) 41 P&amp;CR106
                        (“<em>Williams</em>”), a case involving a
                    claim by the claimant against the defendant for the pollution of four lakes, the
                    Lands Tribunal held (at 109) that the claimant had no <em>locus standi</em> to commence or maintain the claim by himself,
                    unless his wife joined him as claimant. This was because the claimant and his
                    wife were joint owners of the property on which the lakes stood:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is clear law that, although as between themselves joint tenants (and,
                        therefore, joint owners) have separate rights, as against everyone else they
                        are in the position of a single owner. <em>There is absolute
                            unity between them and together they form one person</em>. Apart
                        from equitable remedies inter se, <em>one of the joint
                            tenants cannot commence any proceedings without the aid of the other or
                            others</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     
          <em>Williams</em> was
                    applied in the Hong Kong case of <em>Lui Yuk Yin v Lam Chuen
                        &amp; Another</em> [2006] HKCU 359 (“<em>Lui Yuk Yin</em>”). In <em>Lui Yuk
                        Yin</em>, the plaintiff wife, Lui, sought a declaration against the
                    defendants, the registered owners of a flat in Hong Kong, that they held this
                    property in trust for herself and her husband as beneficial joint tenants. The
                    defendants were the parents of her husband. Lui’s husband was not a party
                    in the action against the defendants. The plaintiff later sought to apply to
                    join her husband as a defendant in the action. The District Court of Hong Kong
                    held, based on <em>Williams</em>, that the cooperation and
                    joinder of Lui’s husband as plaintiff was necessary before Lui had
                        <em>locus standi</em> to bring the action against the
                    defendants. This was because Lui’s husband was the other joint tenant and
                    hence both Lui and her husband had an “identical interest in the whole
                    land and every part of it” (at [20]). The court also held that
                    Lui’s husband should not be added as a defendant as “his interest
                    and title in the [property], together with that of [Lui], was regarded as that
                    of a single owner”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Finally, in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em>, the authors restated the law
                    on this subject as follows (at 170.0035):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In actions as to the joint estate one joint tenant may not sue or be sued
                        without joining the others, and a judgment for possession against one joint
                        tenant is not an effective judgment. One joint tenant may not part with the
                        title deeds of the property without the consent of the other. Nor can one of
                        several joint lessees surrender rights held jointly before the full period
                        of the lease has run.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">A similar statement of the law may be found in <em>Halsbury’s Law of England</em> Vol 39 at
                [530].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     From this brief survey of the jurisprudence of
                    England, Singapore and Hong Kong law, it was clear to us that joint tenants must
                    act jointly in order to effectively bind the whole estate which they hold
                    jointly, whether the act is by way of a disposition of the said estate
                        (<em>Leek and Moorlands Building Society</em>,
                        <em>Mookka Pillai Rajagopal</em>) or a suit (<em>Williams</em>, <em>Lui Yuk Yin</em>). In
                    the context of a collective sale, the implication of this requirement is that
                    where a flat is held jointly, none of the joint tenants may support or oppose
                    the proposed collective sale unilaterally. Since all must act together, where
                    one objects to the sale and the rest do not object (or they might even support
                    the sale, as is the present situation), the preference of neither side may trump
                    the other. This explains why Mr Goh’s ex-wife could not, on her own,
                    consent to the collective sale of the Development on behalf of Unit 136D. It
                    would be recalled that the effect of Mr Goh’s refusal to sign the CSA
                    (even though his ex-wife had appended her signature to the same) was that Unit
                    136D could not be taken to have contributed to the requisite 80% under
                    s 84E(3)(b) of the Act. In the same way, it should also not be possible for
                    Mr Goh to file an objection to the sale with the Board by himself under
                    s 84E(5) of the Act. Mr Goh will not have the necessary <em>locus standi</em> to object to the sale, unless his ex-wife
                    joins him in his objections. Unit 136D must act together with one voice. If
                    Mr Goh is allowed to object to the sale before us (and indeed before the
                    Judge below and the Board), we will be disregarding the interest of
                    Mr Goh’s ex-wife altogether.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     At this juncture, we would like to emphasise
                    that a unit in the position of Unit 136D (<em>ie</em>, a
                    jointly held unit where one co-owner has objected to the collective sale whereas
                    the other has agreed to the collective sale) should not be regarded as having
                    objected to the collective sale <em>per se</em>. The
                    correct legal position is that such a unit has simply not taken a position as to
                    the collective sale, <em>ie</em>, it neither supports nor
                    opposes the sale. Section 84E(3)(b), read with paras 1 and 1A of the Act,
                    requires proprietors who <em>agree</em> to the collective
                    sale to append their signatures to a collective sale agreement before an
                    application for a collective sale order may be made.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The corollary is that proprietors who do
                    not append their signatures to the collective sale agreement fall within one of
                    two categories: they either positively object to the sale (the first category)
                    or have <em>abstained from voting</em> (the second
                    category). In the latter category, they are <em>neither in favour
                        of nor against the collective sale</em>. It is one thing to object to
                    the collective sale (the first category) and quite another to merely desist from
                    agreeing to it (the second category).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Accordingly, in the situation involving a
                    jointly held unit where one joint tenant has objected to the collective sale but
                    the other has agreed to the collective sale, the unit cannot be regarded to have
                    either agreed or objected to the collective sale. This proposition stems from
                    the rule that joint tenants must act together if they want to either support or
                    oppose a proposed sale before the unit which they hold jointly may be bound.
                    This position is necessary to respect the rights of both co-owners. As a result,
                    we found that, in the absence of the opposition of Mr Goh’s ex-wife
                    to the collective sale, Mr Goh did not have <em>locus
                        standi</em> to commence or sustain the action before us.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Before we conclude the discussion on this
                    issue, we should perhaps address an argument raised by Mr Goh based on
                    s 84(5) of the Act which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A proprietor of any flat in the development who has not agreed in writing
                        to the sale referred to in subsection (3) and any mortgagee, chargee or
                        other person (other than a lessee) with an estate or interest in the flat
                        and whose interest is notified on the land-register for the flat may each
                        file an objection with a Board stating ….</p>
<p class="Judg-1">His point was that since this provision allows even “any
                    mortgagee, charge or other person with an interest in the flat” to
                    object, surely a co-owner should have a right or sufficient interest to object.
                    However, this is not comparing like with like. The analogy is hardly
                    appropriate. A mortgagee or chargee with an estate or interest in the flat could
                    lodge an objection because the provision expressly allows him or her to do so.
                    But where a flat is owned by more that one person, for the reasons we have
                    alluded to above, the co-owners must act in concert. Mr Goh, being only one
                    of two joint owners, does not own the entire estate to his flat (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above and s 3 of the Act referred to in
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The merits of the claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Having found against Mr Goh on the issue
                    of <em>locus standi</em>, there was No need for us to
                    consider the merits of Mr Goh’s substantive claim. It suffices for us
                    to indicate briefly our view on the same. Mr Goh insisted that he had a
                    strong case for objecting to the sale on the bases of procedural irregularities
                    and unfairness. Upon a closer analysis of Mr Goh’s claim however, we
                    were extremely doubtful that he had a strong case. Indeed, most, if not all, of
                    the points raised were without merit. We could not agree with his allegations
                    that the sales committee constituted for the purposes of the collective sale had
                    breached its fiduciary duties to all the owners by failing to make timely and
                    proper disclosure and failing to act in good faith in respect of them. We also
                    did not think that an equal distribution of the sale proceeds among all owners
                    within the Development was unfair or inequitable in the present circumstances.
                    Allegations that the Board had failed to act independently were misguided.
                    Moreover, in respect of Mr Goh’s allegations of procedural
                    irregularities, we were of the view that the Judge had more than adequately
                    considered these allegations and dismissed them with sound and detailed reasons.
                    As for the additional instances of alleged procedural irregularities which
                    Mr Goh had raised before us, these were also without any substance. It
                    seemed to us that he was nitpicking. Accordingly, even if Mr Goh had the
                    standing to bring this appeal before us, upon viewing Mr Goh’s case
                    in its totality, we would have upheld the Judge’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the result, we dismissed the present
                    appeal. As regards costs, we fixed it at $3,000 which Mr Goh should pay to
                    the Respondents. We upheld the cost order made by the Judge below. Finally, as
                    requested by the Respondents, we authorised the Registrar of the Supreme Court
                    to execute, on behalf of Mr Goh, all documents necessary to effect the
                    collective sale should Mr Goh refuse to execute the same.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"/><p class="Footnote"><sup><a href="#Ftn_1_1" id="Ftn_1">[note: 1]</a></sup>Under s 84E(3)(b) of the Act, an application for a
                                collective sale order may be made to the Board by “the
                                proprietors of the flats who own not less than 80% notional share of
                                the land…[and] who have agreed in writing to sell all the
                                flats in the development to a purchaser under a sale and purchase
                                agreement…” Further, para 1 of the Schedule provides
                                that before an application to the Board is made, the proprietors of
                                the flats referred to in s 84E(3) must execute within the
                                permitted time, but in not more than 12 months before the
                                application is, made a collective sale agreement in writing among
                                themselves “agreeing to agree to collectively sell”
                                all the flats and the land in the development. Paragraph 1A then
                                defines “permitted time” with respect to the date the
                                first proprietor signs the collective sale
                        agreement.</p></p></div><p style="text-align: center;color: #555;font-size: 12px;font-weight: 200;width: 100%;">Copyright © Government of Singapore.</p>
