Vicarious liability cannot be imposed on a defendant where the tortfeasor is an independent contractor: <span class="font-italic">Ng Huat Seng</span> at [33] and [38].

Two policy considerations underlie the doctrine of vicarious liability, namely: (a) effective compensation for the victim; and (b) deterrence of future harm by encouraging the employer to take steps to reduce the risk of similar harm in future. However, a precondition for the imposition of vicarious liability is that the victim seeking compensation should either be without fault himself, or be less at fault than the blameworthy party and/or the ultimate defendant; otherwise, the policy of victim compensation as a justification for imposing vicarious liability loses much of its moral force.

It was abundantly clear from the plaintiff’s testimony that she gave Kelvin the four cheques signed in blank and left everything to him simply because she chose to trust Kelvin. The plaintiff said that she was recovering from her knee surgery at the material time. However, that did not explain why she could not have (a) obtained the details from Kelvin and filled in the details on the cheques herself, or (b) asked Kelvin to complete the cheques before she signed them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In my view, the plaintiff’s conduct was grossly negligent.
