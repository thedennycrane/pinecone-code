</div>
</div> Mr Danial Higgins (“Mr Higgins”) acted for AirLNG in the purchase. Shortly after the Aircraft was acquired, AirLNG entered into an Aircraft Management Services Agreement (“the AMS Agreement”) with Singapore Air Charter Pte Ltd (“SAC”), a Singapore incorporated company of which Mr Higgins was the Managing Director (“MD”). In February 2012, the AMS Agreement was terminated but Mr Higgins continued to do further work in relation to the Aircraft until May 2012, when AirLNG concluded an aircraft management contract with another company. Meanwhile. Mr Higgins continued as the MD of SAC until he resigned his position in July 2012.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 This, in a nutshell, forms the background to the suits. Most of the events which are material to this judgment took place between March 2011, when the Aircraft was purchased, and July 2012, when Mr Higgins left SAC. I will examine the facts in greater detail later but it suffices for now to sketch the broad outlines of each suit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In Suit No 244 of 2013 (“Suit 244”), Mr Danial Higgins alleges that he had entered into an oral contract with Mr Philippe Emanuel Mulacek (“Mr Mulacek”), Mr Carlo Guiseppe Civelli (“Mr Civelli”), and Pacific LNG Operations Pte Ltd (“PacLNG”) (which was beneficially owned by Mr Civelli) under which he was to be remunerated for work done in relation to the management of the Aircraft.  In the alternative, and in the event the court finds that there was no such oral contract, he brings a claim in restitution, arguing that he ought to be given a reasonable sum in compensation for the work he did on behalf of the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In Suit No 733 of 2014 (“Suit 733”), SAC brings a claim against Mr Higgins for breach of fiduciary duty. SAC’s case is that Mr Higgins had actively worked to undermine SAC’s interests by, among other things, procuring the termination of the AMS Agreement for his own benefit and by making secret profits which he is not entitled to keep. In response, Mr Higgins counterclaims against Mr Mulacek, Mr Civelli, SAC, as well as the remaining directors of SAC – Mr Nicholas Johnstone (“Mr Johnstone”), Mr Danny Walker (“Mr Walker”), and Mr Stefan Wood (“Mr Wood”) – for unpaid directors fees and salary for the period between April and July 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 After careful consideration of the evidence presented, I dismissed Suit 244 in its entirety. As for Suit 733, I allowed SAC’s claim in full and Mr Higgins’s counterclaim in part. For ease of exposition, I propose to deal with the issues in each suit in sequence, rather than to go through the matters chronologically. As will be clear in the course of my judgment, the matters in both suits are closely inter-related and proceeding in this fashion will allow a fuller picture of the relevant facts to be presented.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 I begin with a more detailed recitation of the background facts.

Three days after that meeting, on 29 November 2010, Mr Higgins wrote to Mr Mulacek to explain that a Gulfstream aircraft might suit Mr Mulacek’s needs.

He explained that both of them were unhappy with, among other things: Mr Johnstone’s resignation as a pilot, Mr Walker’s extended vacation, and the fact that neither Mr Johnstone nor Mr Walker showed much interest in dealing with the issues arising from the maintenance of the Aircraft. He informed them that Mr Mulacek had proposed two possible courses of action. First, Mr Mulacek would buy into SAC and retain Mr Higgins’s as the MD. Second, the AMS Agreement would be terminated and the contract would be reassigned to a new company (which Mr Higgins would head) and this new company would manage both the [Aircraft] as well as “all of the PNG flight operations”. This was referred to during the trial as the “two-options email”.

At the start of May 2012, Mr Higgins was asked to stop all the work he was doing in relation to the registration of the Aircraft

</div> As a technical argument, this fails. It is open for Mr Higgins to run the argument that the contracting parties were persons other than the original parties to the AMS Agreement and to hold them liable for breach of contract. However, as a factual matter, the defendants’ argument reveals how factually incongruous Mr Higgins’s case is and it is a factor I took into account in assessing the veracity of Mr Higgins claim that there was such an oral contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, I find that the correspondence exchanged between the parties between February and May 2012 clearly shows that they were – even taking Mr Higgins’s case at the highest – still in the midst of negotiations and that there could not possibly have been a concluded oral agreement on 27 January 2012. When Mr Higgins sent Mr Ng the draft SAM Agreement on 29 March 2012, he wrote in his covering email that this was a “<span class="font-italic">Draft</span> contract for operation of [the Aircraft] for the next 12 months” [emphasis added]. I have emphasised the word “Draft” because it is clear to me that even Mr Higgins did not think that there was any concluded agreement and, more importantly, he did not allude to the fact that the draft merely reflected what had previously been agreed on 27 January 2012. This was not, as Mr Higgins now submits, an attempt to regularise the oral contract in writing; rather, it was an attempt to conclude an agreement where none previously existed.

On 10 April 2012, he wrote to Mr Ng saying that he was “doing lots of work trying to get the aircraft re-registered, essentially for free at the moment”. In the same email, he also explained that he had paid the salaries of the contract pilots and that it was only right that “when the new contract is signed it should be backdated.”

</div> This was followed by a lengthy email sent by Mr Mulacek to Mr Higgins on 7 May 2012 in which it was explained that the understanding had always been that Mr Higgins would work for AirLNG <span class="font-italic">if</span> an agreement could but reached, but none could because of issues over costs. This was consistent with Mr Higgins’s email of 15 April 2012, in which it was said that no agreement had yet been reached on the terms of Higgins’s future relationship with the Aircraft. However, Mr Mulacek adverted to the possibility that they might yet cooperate in the future if such an agreement could be reached, though he stressed that it would not be a comprehensive management agreement, but would instead be one of more limited scope.

Instead, the most that could be said was that there was a hope and an expectation, at least on the part of Mr Higgins, there would be an agreement and that he was actively working towards making that a reality. This cannot form the basis of a contract. In <span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332, the Court of Appeal held that in order for there to be a concluded contract, the negotiations between the contracting parties must have “crystallised into a contractually-binding agreement in which there is no uncertainty as to the terms of the contract concerned” (at [47]). This is far from the case here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Third, I find it inexplicable that Mr Higgins never once mentioned the existence of the alleged oral contract in the correspondence he exchanged with Mr Ng or with Mr Mulacek. In fact, as the defendants pointed out, the <span class="font-italic">first </span>time Mr Higgins mentioned the existence of any oral contract was on 21 June 2012 when he emailed Mr Ben Ng on 21 June 2012 to say that he “shook hands with [Mr Mulacek] on an agreement to manage the jet just before I left Singapore”.

In Mr Higgins’s Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”), he explained that he had met Mr Mulacek, and Mr Civelli at the Executive Lounge at Changi International Airport and they came to an agreement on the terms of their future cooperation. The narrative of events in the AEIC was presented in dialogic form, and Mr Higgins set out in great detail the specific concerns which were raised by Mr Mulacek and the responses he gave to each of these queries. In the AEIC, he averred that at the end of the conversation, it was agreed that he would continue managing the aircraft, initially through MAM, but eventually through a new company which would be specially incorporated to take over the management of the Aircraft.

In amending his SOC and filing the supplemental AEIC, he was effectively disavowing the long and detailed exposition of events which he had set out in his AEIC. This is no small matter. As I noted at the outset, in order for there to be a contract, there must be a <span class="font-italic">consensus ad idem </span>on terms which are both certain and complete. This is not the case here. When Mr Higgins’s AEIC and supplemental AEIC are read together, the overall picture of events is murky.

Depending on the circumstances, there can still be a binding contract even though there are peripheral terms which have not been agreed on; however, this is qualified by the rule that if there is no agreement as to a <span class="font-italic">material </span>term of the contract, there can be no binding agreement (see <span class="font-italic">Foley v Classique Coaches Ltd </span>[1934] 2 KB 1 at 13 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Maugham LJ). In <span class="font-italic">Grossner Jens v Raffles Holdings Ltd </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 202, for example, the High Court found that there was no binding brokerage contract as the parties had failed to agree on, among other things, the terms of the plaintiff’s remuneration, which would be a material term of the contract (at [16]). Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">Likpin</span>, the High Court held that could not have been a concluded charterparty as the parties had, even by the plaintiff’s case, only agreed on an “approximate" rate of hire. The court explained that the rate of hire was an essential term of a charterparty and that the use of an approximate rate of hire was entirely inconsistent with the existence of a concluded charterparty.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In my assessment, the quantum of Mr Higgins’s remuneration would be a material term of the alleged oral agreement. Under the AMS Agreement, upon which the oral agreement was putatively modelled, AirLNG was to pay a monthly management fee of $25,000 each month in addition to paying each member of the flight crew an hourly wage (see [11] above).

In his AEIC, Mr Higgins explained on the day in question, he met Mr Mulacek and Mr Civelli at InterOil’s Singapore office “fully prepared for the hatchet”. However, in the course of the discussions, he explained how he was able to persuade them that many of the problems were not his fault. At the end of the discussion, he was told that his services would be retained on the same terms as in the AMS Agreement although he would not have anything to do with the NAS Project in PNG. In his submissions, Mr Higgins referred to an email which he sent Mr John Roche (a friend whom he had intended to hire to assist with the operation of the Aircraft in PNG) the very next day in which he described this “abrupt turn of events” in detail.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As a preliminary point, I note that the existence of an oral contract on 8 May 2012 was never pleaded. As the Court of Appeal stressed in <span class="font-italic">V Nithia (co-administratrix of the estate of Ponnusamy Sivapakiam, deceased) v Buthmanaban s/o Vaithilingam and another</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1422 at [37], adherence to the rules on pleadings is essential not just for good case management but also to maintain substantive fairness. It is also no good to say that this account of events is set out in his AEIC. It is a settled principle of law that defects in pleadings cannot be cured by averments in affidavits (see <span class="font-italic">Abdul Latif bin Mohammed Tahiar (trading as Canary Agencies) v Saeed Husain s/o Hakim Gulam Mohiudin (trading as United Limousine)</span> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 61 at [7]). For this reason alone, I would dismiss this argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In any event, I am of the view that the evidence <span class="font-italic">clearly </span>shows that no contract was entered into on 8 May 2012. I note the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, if there were an oral contract on 27 January 2012, I cannot see how or why it would be “re-entered” on 8 May on exactly the same terms. Indeed, it is not clear what the position would be as a matter of law: Mr Higgins did not elaborate if this new agreement was intended to supersede the old or if it was intended to give rise to an entirely new set of obligations which would operate in parallel (the latter of which would be a puzzling result, to say the least). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, on the same day that this second oral contract was to have been concluded, AirLNG signed an agreement with AAC. I cannot see why the defendants would have wanted to hire Mr Higgins to do exactly the same thing as AAC. In cross-examination, Mr Mulacek described this as a commercially absurd result which “no prudent business person” would do.

In particular, I note that Mr Mulacek had written to Mr Higgins on 7 May 2012 to state that the terms of their future partnership (if any) would be far more restricted. It certainly would not take the form of a comprehensive management agreement as the AMS Agreement was or the alleged oral contract was alleged to be (see [38] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my assessment, the email sent to Mr Roche on 9 May 2012 does not go very far towards supporting Mr Higgins’s case.

</div> In the circumstances, the overall impression that I received was that Mr Higgins was trying to let Mr Roche down gently while avoiding the embarrassment of having to tell his friend that he had been let go as well. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The claim for a reasonable sum in compensation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I turn to Mr Higgins’s second alternative argument, which is that even if there were no oral contract, he is entitled to be given a reasonable sum for the work which he had done. As the Court of Appeal set out comprehensively in its recent judgment in <span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong and others v Cheong Soh Chin and others and another appeal </span>[2016] SGCA 45 (“<span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong</span>”) at [28] and [41], recovery for compensation for work done in situations where there is no express contact may be mounted either in contract or in restitution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Recovery pursuant to contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 If the argument is framed in contract, the claim may either be premised on (a) an implied contract or (b) if there is an express contract with no agreed term as to remuneration, then it will proceed on the basis that there is an implied term that a reasonable sum will be paid. In either of these two sub-cases, the touchstone is necessity – the claimant must show that it was necessary for the contract or the term, as the case may be, to be implied (see <span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong </span>at [30]). It is clear that Mr Higgins’s claim cannot be based on an implied term since I have found that there is no express contract. Thus, the question is whether a contract may be implied. In my judgment, it may not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As the Court of Appeal stressed in <span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong </span>at [29], contracts are not lightly to be implied. It will only be done in situations where it is clear that the parties <span class="font-italic">intended </span>to contract and where it is <span class="font-italic">clear </span>what they intended to contract to. This is far from the case here. I have found that Mr Higgins had proceeded on the basis of a hope or an expectation that an agreement would eventually be concluded, but this is not enough for a contract to be implied. As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong </span>at [36] and [86], citing Prof Ewan McKendrick, “[t]he anticipation of a contract is not the same thing as the existence of a contract.” It is abundantly clear from the correspondence that there was deep disagreement over the terms of Mr Higgins’s participation in the defendants’ work. It is simply not possible for a contract to be implied in these circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Recovery pursuant to restitution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 This leaves Mr Higgins’s case in restitution.

</div> It is settled law that parties may plead inconsistent causes of action in the alternative as long as the inconsistency does not, on the facts, offend common sense (see <span class="font-italic">Ng Chee Wee Weng v Lim Jit Meng Bryan </span>[2012] 1 SLR 457 at [37]). I see no inconsistency of this nature here. Mr Higgins’s case is that in the event the court finds that there is no contract, he claims a sum in restitution. There is no fatal inconsistency here – I have found that there is no contract so the question which arises for discussion is whether he can nevertheless succeed in his alternative claim in restitution. My finding that there is no contract also disposes of the defendants’ alternative preliminary objection, which is that the plaintiff’s claim in restitution cannot exist in parallel with his claim in contract. It is settled that there cannot be a claim in restitution which exists in parallel with an inconsistent contractual promise (see <span class="font-italic">Rabiah Bee bte Mohamed Ibrahim v Salem Ibrahim </span>[2007] 2 SLR(R) 665 at [123]). However, since I have found that there is no contract, any potential inconsistency falls away.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It is now settled law that the juridical basis for recovery under a claim in restitutionary <span class="font-italic">quantum meruit </span>is the doctrine of unjust enrichment (see <span class="font-italic">Benedetti and another </span>v <span class="font-italic">Sawiris and others </span>[2013] WLR (D) 286 (“<span class="font-italic">Benedetti</span>”) at [9]); <span class="font-italic">Eng Chiet Shoong </span>at [33]. Thus, in order to make good his case, Mr Higgins has to show the following three things: (a) a benefit had been received or the defendants had been enriched; (b) this benefit or enrichment was at his expense; and (c) the enrichment was “unjust”. If these three elements are satisfied, the further question to consider is whether there are any defences to the claim (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Swimming Club </span><span class="font-italic">v Koh Sin Chong Freddie</span> [2016] 3 SLR 845 at [90]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In his amended Statement of Claim (“SOC (S 244)”), Mr Higgins puts forward six distinct heads of claim, but they can conveniently be merged into four main categories.

</div>
</div>
</div> I reject this argument as it flies in the face of the documentary evidence, which clearly shows that MAM received a surplus of US$24,000 (being the difference between the US$50,000 transferred to MAM by AirLNG and the outstanding sum ofUS$26,000 owed to Elite Jets). There is no evidence that MAM later transferred this sum of money to anyone else. The US$24,000 made by MAM is the subject of a claim in Suit 733 and I shall say more of it later. For now, it suffices to say that the charters had been paid for and there is no basis for Mr Higgins to mount a claim in restitution in respect of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The claim in relation to pilot training relates to a sum of $22,000 incurred for a simulator training course. In my judgment, this is a non-starter. On 17 April 2012, Mr Higgins emailed Mr Ng to informed him of his intention to enrol the pilot on the simulator course and asked for a decision “one way or the other” failing which he would take the pilot off the course.

</div>  Mr Higgins did not receive an affirmative reply but nevertheless went ahead and enrolled the pilot on the course. In the circumstances, there is no unjust factor that justifies recovery. Where a defendant informs a claimant that he does not wish to receive a benefit but the claimant nevertheless proceeds to confer the benefit anyway, the defendant is under no obligation to pay for it (see <span class="font-italic">Leigh v Dickeson </span>(1884) 15 QBD 60 at 64–65 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Brett MR). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Mr Higgins had argued that he had acted “reasonably” in a situation of “urgency” in sending the pilots for training.

</div> I am not persuaded. The common law does not, outside of cases involving emergencies (mostly involving accidents at sea), permit recovery for expenses incurred in the unsolicited management of the affairs of another (see Charles Mitchell, Paul Mitchell and Stephen Watterson, <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones</span>”) at para 18-02–18-03). The “urgency” Mr Higgins refers to does not fall within any of the recognised categories in which recovery has been permitted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The claim in relation to management services must also fail. The claims falling in this head, itemized at para 74 of the SOC (S 244), relate to a miscellany of different things, most of which overlap with the substance of the other claims for pilot training and private flight services. Insofar as this is the case, the reasons I give in respect of those categories will serve to dispose of the claims under to management services).

It is plain that what Mr Higgins seeks here is the payment of his remuneration under the alleged oral agreement. However, the law of unjust enrichment acts to reverse benefits unfairly derived at the expense of another, it <span class="font-italic">cannot </span>be used to enforce a party’s expectation interest – that is the realm of contract.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The difficulty with the claim in this case (as encapsulated in the defendants’ submissions) is that it involves a claim for “pure” services – that is to say, services which do not redound in tangible monetary benefits. [It is complicated by the fact that the services were rendered in anticipation that a contract would be concluded, but I will deal with that when I come to the unjust factors analysis at [68]). As pointed out in Man Yip &amp; Yihan Goh, “Liability for work done where contract is denied: contractual and restitutionary approaches” [2012] LMCLQ 289 (“<span class="font-italic">Yip &amp; Goh</span>”) at 303, the law has long drawn a distinction between monetary benefits and non-monetary benefits. The former is the currency of economic value and is the quintessential example of an incontrovertible benefit. However, it is not always clear whether the provision of goods and services objectively benefits the recipient. This is particularly the case here, where it is undisputed that Mr Higgins’s efforts came to naught, because it was subsequently discovered that it was unfeasible for the Aircraft to be registered in Malaysia (see [20] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 There have been cases in which claims in unjust enrichment for the provision of pure services have been allowed (see the cases cited in <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at para 5-21). The common thread in these cases appears to be that the defendants there conceptualized of the benefit as the rendering of the <span class="font-italic">service</span><span class="font-italic"> itself</span>, and not the attainment of a particular <span class="font-italic">result or end-product</span>. One way in which this can be shown is if it could be shown that the defendants had accepted responsibility for the cost of the work (see <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones </span>at para 5-25). For example, in <span class="font-italic">Brewer Street Investments Ltd v Barclays Woollen Co Ltd </span>[1954] 1 QB 428, the parties were negotiating for a lease. Before negotiations concluded, the defendants requested that the plaintiff-landlord carry out some alterations to the premises and undertook to pay for them. Negotiations broke down and the plaintiff brought suit to recover the cost of the alterations. The English Court of Appeal granted judgment in favour of the plaintiff even though the defendants never came into possession of the premises. As <span class="font-italic">Yip &amp; Goh </span>suggest at 304–305, this is best seen as a case in which the defendants must – in requesting for the work to be done even before the lease was granted – objectively be taken to have valued the benefits in terms of the provision of the services themselves and therefore must be seen as having benefitted whether they came into possession of the premises or not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In this connection, the two strongest points in favour of Mr Higgins’s claim would appear to be the fact that Mr Mulacek had specifically given Mr Higgins the green light to proceed with efforts to register the Aircraft in Malaysia on 13 March 2012

</div> Taken together, these two facts would seem to suggest that he had accepted responsibility for the cost of the work done in relation to the registration of the Aircraft in Malaysia and could objectively be taken as having viewed the benefit in terms of the efforts taken towards registration rather than as the actual registration itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 However, when the context is examined, this argument loses much of its force. As I noted above at [20], on 12 March 2012, Mr Kendall wrote to Mr Higgins to insist that the Aircraft no longer be registered in the name of his company. Mr Kendall gave Mr Higgins two options: (a) either the Aircraft would be registered in another jurisdiction or (b) the Aircraft would remain on the US register but under the name of a different company. Mr Higgins wrote to Mr Mulacek on the same day and he asked for instructions as to “what country register you want me to arrange on an interim basis”.

On the stand, Mr Higgins admitted that all would have been well if the Aircraft had been registered through a US trustee, as was eventually done when the Aircraft was restored to the US Register by AAC (see [14] above).

</div> The evidence put forward by Mr Higgins on this point is slender and it is falsified by the fact that, eventually, the Aircraft was restored to the US Register and there is no evidence that Mr Civelli demurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The point, for present purposes, is that Mr Mulacek’s agreement to having Mr Higgins proceed with the registration of the Aircraft is intimately tied to the advice that Mr Higgins had given prior to that, namely, that continued registration in the US would not be possible and that alternative registration in another jurisdiction was necessary. This was the basis upon which Mr Mulacek had accepted responsibility for the work done by Mr Higgins and it turned out to be wrong (and egregiously so). Or, to put it another way, the common basis upon which the parties had approached the matter was that Mr Higgins would be conferring a benefit to Mr Mulacek in the form of the taking of <span class="font-italic">necessary </span>efforts to securing the Aircraft’s re-registration in another jurisdiction. This was manifestly not the case as it was not necessary for the Aircraft to be taken off the US register. In the circumstances, my judgment is that it cannot be said that Mr Mulacek had derived any objective benefit from the work done. What was worse, Mr Higgins admitted on the stand that he had not made any preliminary inquiries with the Malaysian authorities before recommending that the Aircraft be registered in Malaysia. It was only <span class="font-italic">after </span>he had flown the Aircraft to Malaysia that he reached out to the Malaysian authorities and quickly discovered that registration in Malaysia was not feasible. I cannot see how Mr Higgins can claim, in these circumstances, that his work was of benefit to the defendants.

</div> This is sufficient to dispose of Mr Higgins’s claim in unjust enrichment. However, for completeness, I will go on to explain why I do not think that the third element – that enrichment was “unjust” – has been satisfied.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The relevant context is that the work done here was done in anticipation that a contract would eventually be concluded. This much is clear from what I have found thus far. In this context, the authorities suggest that the key question is: who ran the risk of the contract not materialising? The general position is that it is the claimant. In <span class="font-italic">M.S.M. Consulting v United Republic of Tanzania </span>[2009] EWHC 121 (QB), Christopher Clarke J summarised the position in the authorities as follows (at [171(b)]–[171(e)]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Generally speaking a person who seeks to enter into a contract with another cannot claim to be paid the cost of estimating what it will cost him, or of deciding on a price, or bidding for the contract. Nor can he claim the cost of showing the other party his capability or skills even though, if there was a contract or retainer, he would be paid for them. The solicitor who enters a "beauty contest" in the course of which he expresses some preliminary views about the client's prospects cannot, ordinarily expect to charge for them. If another firm is retained; he runs the risk of being unrewarded if unsuccessful in his pitch.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) The court is likely to impose such an obligation where the defendant has received an incontrovertible benefit (e.g. an immediate financial gain or saving of expense) as a result of the claimant's services; or where the defendant has requested the claimant to provide services or accepted them (having the ability to refuse them) when offered, in the knowledge that the services were not intended to be given freely;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) But the court may not regard it as just to impose an obligation to make payment if the claimant took the risk that he or she would only be reimbursed for his expenditure if there was a concluded contract; or if the court concludes that, in all the circumstances the risk should fall on the claimant: <span class="font-italic">Jennings &amp; Chapman</span>;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) The court may well regard it as just to impose such an obligation if the defendant who has received the benefit has behaved unconscionably in declining to pay for it;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In this case, it is clear to me that Mr Higgins had clearly run the risk of the contract not materialising. This much is clear from the extracts from the correspondence, all of which point towards the conclusion that Mr Higgins had been trying to put himself in the best possible position to sign a new contract to replace the AMS Agreement. As the defendants put it, “[Mr] Higgins was auditioning for an aircraft management contract, an audition on the evidence, he failed.”

It is telling that there is nothing in the email which suggests that Mr Higgins was at all certain that a new contract would be signed. Instead, he clearly perceived that there was a risk that everything he did would come to nothing (which is consistent with what he said in his email of 10 April 2012 to Mr Ng: see [33] above), and contemplated the possibility that he might switch to pursuing other business opportunities instead. But he did not. Instead, Mr Higgins elected to continue working on the Malaysian registration and in so doing he had, in my judgment, run the risk that there would be no contract and the work that he did would be unremunerated. Furthermore, when I considered the facts – chiefly, the fact that the work he did came to naught and the fact that he gave wrong advice without ascertaining its viability (both in relation to the deregistration from the US as well as his recommendation that the plane be registered in Malaysia) – I do not find that there is anything unconscionable about the defendants declining to pay him for the work that he did. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss Mr Higgins’s claims in Suit 244 in their totality.

As I detailed at [17]–[18] above, it is clear that Mr Higgins had concealed the fact that he had accepted the termination of the AMS Agreement on 10 February 2012, prior to the Board of SAC having come to an agreement on the way forward. In and of itself, it is a serious breach of his fiduciary duty for Mr Higgins to have acted unilaterally in this regard when the AMS Agreement was SAC’s only contract at the time and, in the words of Mr Walker, “not to be taken lightly”.

Instead, he surreptitiously received a draft of the termination agreement in his private email and did not tell his fellow directors about this and behaved as if the termination agreement had not been signed.

January 2012 was a critical time for SAC, for that was when it encountered its first serious setback as a company. In that situation, it was incumbent upon Mr Higgins, as the MD, to have acted to regain the trust of Mr Mulacek and Mr Civelli but he did not. What Mr Higgins did went beyond mere reportage of the travails faced by SAC. Instead, he actively worked to undermine SAC’s interests by representing to Mr Mulacek and Mr Civelli that SAC was dysfunctional and ought to be replaced.

</div> I do not accept Mr Higgins’s argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 In essence, the dispute centres on the issue of causation. The law in this area was recently summarised by Hoo Sheau Peng JC in <span class="font-italic">Beyonics </span>at [131]–[137] where she explained that where there has been a culpable breach of a core fiduciary relationship, the approach to causation set out in the decision of the Privy Council in <span class="font-italic">Brickenden v London Loan &amp; Savings Co of Canada </span>[1934] 3 DLR 465 (“<span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span>”) applies. To summarise, the <span class="font-italic">Brickenden</span> approach does not obviate the requirement for the principal to prove causation, but it eases the evidential burden. Under this approach, the principal does not have to satisfy the “but-for” test of causation – that is to say, the principal does not have to show that but for the defendant’s breach of his fiduciary duties, the losses would not have occurred. Instead, the principal only has to establish that the losses are “caused by or linked to” the breaches of fiduciary duty. Thereafter, the evidential burden <span class="font-italic">shifts </span>to the fiduciary to show that the principal would have suffered these losses <span class="font-italic">even if there had been no breach</span>. In addition, under the <span class="font-italic">Brickenden </span>approach, causation will be determined without regard to the rules of foreseeability, remoteness, and <span class="font-italic">novus actus interveniens</span>; and there will also not be any examination of the contributory fault of the principal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Based on what I have found, it is clear that Mr Higgins’s breaches of duties had paved the way for the termination of the AMS Agreement. As I noted above, I do not accept that Mr Higgins was only “stating facts at all times”.

</div>
</div> The question is whether Mr Higgins has shown that these losses would have been sustained irrespective of his breaches. In my judgment, he has not done so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Mr Higgins’s main argument in this regard is that SAC had, by its conduct, effectively rejected the AMS Agreement. He argues that instead of fighting to retain the contract, Mr Walker and Mr Johnstone had instead “resigned themselves… to the impending fate of termination.” In essence, this is an argument founded on contributory fault. As a matter of law, it is not open for Mr Higgins to run this argument. In <span class="font-italic">Beyonics</span>, the defendant was the former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of a company who had, during his tenure, wrongfully diverted business away to a competitor. In his defence, he argued that the business had been lost not because of his breaches but because of mismanagement on the part of the new executives who took over from him. Hoo JC rejected this argument both as a matter of law and on the facts. She held, first, that this argument was legally unsustainable because the <span class="font-italic">Brickenden </span>approach did not allow for consideration of the contributory fault of the principal and, second, that the defendant was the CEO of the company at the time the contract was lost and so his argument that he was not factually responsible for the loss of the contract could not be accepted. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 These same points can be made in response to Mr Higgins’s argument. First, his argument cannot be accepted as it is an impermissible attempt to invoke the contributory fault of SAC in order to avoid liability. Second, it also cannot be accepted on the facts. At the material time, Mr Higgins was the MD of SAC and he was the primary point of contact in relation to matters concerning the AMS Agreement (see [12] above). It was incumbent upon him to act in SAC’s best interests by trying to retain the AMS Agreement, but he plainly failed to do so and instead strived to procure its termination in order that he might secure the business for himself. In the premises, I conclude that Mr Higgins’s breaches caused SAC to lose out on the profits it would otherwise have made under the AMS Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 This brings me to the question of quantification. There are two components to this inquiry. The first is to determine the period of time in respect of which the loss should be calculated (“the period of loss”, which is used as the multiplier); the second is to determine the <span class="font-italic">profits </span>that SAC would have made during the relevant period (the multiplicand). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 On the issue of the period of loss, it must first be stressed that the <span class="font-italic">Brickenden </span>approach only applies in the area of causation; it does not apply in the quantification of loss (see <span class="font-italic">Beyonics </span>at [222]). Thus, even though I have held that Mr Higgins had caused the termination of the AMS Agreement, this does not, without more, mean that he is liable for all the lost revenue arising thereto in perpetuity. At the end of the day, the court still has to decide, based on the evidence, what the relevant period of loss ought to be. This is not a question which can be answered with precision as it involves a degree of prognostication. SAC’s case is that the AMS Agreement would continue in perpetuity, for it has brought a claim for lost profits from the effective date of termination (22 March 2012) until the present day. Mr Higgins’s position is that the AMS Agreement would have been terminated immediately, or at least in the immediate future. I accept neither of these arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It is undisputed that at the time Mr Higgins committed the breaches in question, SAC was facing or would imminently be facing headwinds in the form of (a) the resignation of Mr Johnstone as a pilot (although he stated his willingness to fly if necessary), (b) disagreements between the directors; and (c) Mr Walker’s resignation as the flight operations manager: see [13] and [14] above. These would have negatively affected SAC’s performance. However, I also do not accept Mr Higgins’s argument that the AMS Agreement would have been terminated imminently. Even before the termination of the AMS Agreement, SAC had hired contract pilots;

</div> It seems to me that SAC would have been able to continue performing its obligations under the AMS Agreement, perhaps with the assistance of contract pilots.

It is clear that the pilots’ salaries were paid to the pilots themselves, and not to SAC. This is clear from the ledgers of SAC contained in the accountant’s report tendered by SAC, where it is shown that the pilots (mostly Mr Johnstone and Mr Walker) were paid a sum of US$11,875 a month for flying the Aircraft.

In this regard, I note that SAC continued to be a going concern even after the AMS Agreement, so the crux of the inquiry is the <span class="font-italic">additional </span>expenses SAC would need to have incurred in order to continue performing the AMS Agreement. Mr Higgins did not address me on this issue, as his submissions were confined only to arguing that his breaches did not lead to the termination of the AMS Agreement. This case was quite unlike <span class="font-italic">Beyonics</span> where the parties hired accounting experts to determine the quantum of the losses suffered by the company as a result of the diversion of the business (see <span class="font-italic">Beyonics </span>at [189]–[190]). The only evidence which would seem to bear on this question are the audited financial statements for SAC for the financial year ending 31 August 2012. However, they do not contain a detailed breakdown of the relevant expenses incurred by SAC for the period of time and it is unhelpful to have regard to the gross expenses because the reference period for the financial statement includes five months in which the AMS Agreement was not in force (22 March 2012 to 31 August 2012). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 In these circumstances, I conclude that there is no objective premise upon which any reduction can presently be made to account for operating expenses. There is a paucity of evidence and any reduction I make would be entirely arbitrary and be no better than a shot in the dark. However, I do not consider that it would be just, for the reasons which I have already set out above, to award the full sum of US$25,000 claimed. In the premises, I exercise my power under O 37 r 4(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 6, 2014 Rev Ed) to direct that an assessment be carried out by the Registrar.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Secret profits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 I move to SAC’s claim for secret profits. It has long been held, since the old case of <span class="font-italic">Bray v Ford </span>[1896] AC 44, that a fiduciary is not entitled to make a profit out of his trust without the informed consent of his principal because this could give rise to a danger of a conflict of interest (at 51 <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Herschell). One particular expression of this rule is the prohibition against the usurpation, by a fiduciary (usually a director), of corporate opportunities that properly belong to his principal (which, in the case of a director, is a company): see <span class="font-italic">Industrial Development Consultants Ltd v Cooley</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[1972] 1 WLR 443.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 SAC’s case is that Mr Higgins had breached this duty in two ways:

</div> I do not accept either of these two arguments.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Because the rule against the making of secret profits is aimed at protecting the integrity of the fiduciary relationship from being tainted by the prospect of a conflict of interest, it is stringently applied and bites even where the company did not, or even could not, take up the opportunity – liability arises from the mere fact that profit had been made (see <span class="font-italic">Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver</span> [1967] 2 AC 134 (“Regal”) at 144–145). In <span class="font-italic">Mona Computer Systems (S) Pte Ltd v Singaravelu Murugan</span> [2014] 1 SLR 847 at [13]–[16], the Court of Appeal further explained that this was because the rule was a gains-based remedy aimed at disgorgement of all illicit profits obtained by the fiduciary; and therefore it did not matter that the principal would thereby gain a “windfall” in the process. It also applies, and this is particularly important for present purposes, even if the fiduciary (usually a director) had come upon the opportunity in another capacity (see Andrew Keay, <span class="font-italic">Directors’ Duties </span>(Jordans, 2009) at para 10.94). Jonathan Parker LJ, delivering the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bhullar v Bhullar</span>  [2003] 2 BCLC 241 (“<span class="font-italic">Bhullar</span>”), put it thus (at [28]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In a case such as the present, where a fiduciary has exploited a commercial opportunity for his own benefit, the relevant question, in my judgment, is not whether the party to whom the duty is owed (the company, in the instant case) had some kind of beneficial interest in the opportunity: in my judgment that would be too formalistic and restrictive an approach. Rather, the question is simply whether the fiduciary’s exploitation of the opportunity is such as to attract the application of the rule. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The “rule” which Jonathan Parker LJ was referring to was the rule in <span class="font-italic">Bray v Ford </span>– that fiduciaries should not be allowed to place themselves into engagements in which they might have a personal interest which conflicts with, or might possibly conflict with, the interests of their principal (at [27]).  At [30], Jonathan Parker LJ explained that in determining whether there was such a conflict, the test to be applied was that articulated by Lord Upjohn in <span class="font-italic">Boardman v Phipps </span>[1967] 2 AC 46 at 124, which was whether “reasonable men looking at the facts would think there is a real sensible possibility of conflict” between the interests of the principal and the personal interests of the fiduciary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 What this means, for present purposes, is that it does not matter whether Mr Higgins came upon the opportunity in his capacity as the MD of MAM (and on this point, I am prepared to assume in his favour that he was invited to the Portcullis networking event where he met Mr Mulacek as a representative of MAM). It also does not matter that SAC was not or would not be entitled to retain the back-to-back profits from the acquisition of the Aircraft. Instead, the question is whether reasonable men looking at the facts would think that there was a real sensible possibility of conflict between his interests and that of SAC’s. In my judgment, there was such a conflict.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 First, and contrary to Mr Higgins’s submissions, aircraft acquisition falls within the scope of SAC’s activities.

</div> There was some dispute as to whether Mr Higgins’s had handed Mr Mulacek his MAM or his SAC business card when they first met in 2010 (see [6] above), but, in my assessment, this is neither here nor there. The point is that the business cards, which were requisitioned on 15 November 2010, is clear evidence that SAC thought of itself as being in the business of aircraft acquisition from its inception.

</div> Second, when Mr Higgins first pursued the acquisition, he did so <span class="font-italic">qua </span>MD of SAC. This is clear from the fact that when Mr Higgins first contacted Mr Mulacek, he not only signed off as MD of SAC but also asked that Mr Johnstone be contacted to assist in matters relating to the acquisition of the Aircraft and continued copying Mr Johnstone in the correspondence concerning the acquisition of the Aircraft for the next two months (see [7] above). Third, it is clear that SAC had an interest in the acquisition for it was allocated a “finders’ fee” of $15,000 for the acquisition.

</div> Instead, I find that the explanation which is more consistent with the evidence is that proffered by Mr Johnstone, which was that he had asked Mr Higgins if there would be a finder’s fee because he perceived aircraft acquisition to be within SAC’s business and had therefore sought a finder’s fee on SAC’s behalf.

In the ordinary course of things, this would be the end of the matter, and Mr Higgins would be subject to an obligation to account for all of the profits he received. However, Mr Higgins argued that he is absolved of liability because he had made full and frank disclosure to SAC on three occasions, of which the most significant was on 11 August 2011 when he allegedly informed SAC’s board of directors of his intentions to set up an aircraft acquisition business. This was recorded in a document which was purportedly the minutes of a meeting between the directors of SAC on 11 August 2011. It reads in material part as follows:

</div>
</div>
</div> In my judgment, there are serious doubts as to whether the minutes are genuine and I decline to place any weight on them. In any event, I note that there was no agreement reached at the meeting; instead, all that was said was that the item – by which it can only mean <span class="font-italic">both </span>Mr Higgins’s proposal to set up an aircraft business with Mr Kendall <span class="font-italic">and </span>the proposal that Mr Walker and Mr Johnstone receive a monthly salary – was under review and there is no evidence that it was taken up on another occasion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I am further fortified in my conclusion by the facts leading up to the disclosure of the Escrow documents, which I adverted to at [10] above. Mr Higgins first alluded to the existence of the transfer for $15,000 to SAC (which was referred to as a finder’s fee) during the trial. Thereafter, SAC sought disclosure of these documents but only a redacted copy of the Escrow Report was released which revealed that $15,000 had been transferred to MAM. Critically, what was redacted were the transfers of US$316,500 to MAM and a further US$316,500 to OK Consultants. What followed was a vigorous exchange of correspondence in which Mr Higgins continued to resist disclosure. This culminated in the filing of Summons No 3381 of 2016, which was an application for specific discovery of an unredacted copy of the Escrow Report. I heard this application and granted it on the first day of the second tranche of the trial. If it were the case that Mr Higgins had the consent of the board of SAC to pursue the acquisition through MAM (and if it were the case that SAC had merely been given the finder’s fee as an undeserved gratuity), there would have been no need for the titanic struggle to hide the contents of the Escrow Report. The fact he did, in my judgment, is eloquent of a clear consciousness of wrongdoing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In the result, I conclude that Mr Higgins is liable to account to SAC in the sum of $316,500 for the profits he obtained from the acquisition of the Aircraft. For avoidance of doubt, I clarify that since AirLNG was not a party before me, my judgment does not affect whatever rights it might have against Mr Higgins or SAC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Makassar-Ambon Charter</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 As for the claim relating to the Makassar-Ambon Charter, there is no question that the chartering of flights is part of SAC’s core business. As its MD, Mr Higgins ought not to have profited personally from this. Mr Higgins’s only response was that he had not profited from the charter and that the sums received went to someone else instead. I have already dealt with this at [56]–[57] above. I therefore find that Mr Higgins is to account to SAC in the sum of US$24,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Retention of documents</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 Finally, I come to the third alleged breach, which is that Mr Higgins had acted against SAC’s interests in retaining – among other documents – one of the logbooks relating to the maintenance and servicing history of the Aircraft (the “Logbook”). I will briefly set out the background to this claim. On 30 April 2012, after the termination of the AMS Agreement, SAC had delivered all of the Aircraft’s records to AirLNG, believing these to be the complete set of technical documents relating to the Aircraft which was in their possession. However, during the trial, it transpired that – much to the surprise of the directors of SAC – Mr Higgins had the Logbook in his possession and that he had been holding onto it for the past four years. Mr Higgins initially resisted delivery up of the Logbook on the ground that he had a lien over it but complied after a summons was filed.

</div> Mr Higgins has not cited any authority to support his contention that a lien may arise under these circumstances nor has he even specified what type of lien he is asserting. On the assumption that it is a common law possessory lien that he claims, this argument cannot succeed. At common law, a possessory lien, arises in respect of goods owned by the debtor (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 5<span class="font-italic"> </span>(LexisNexis, 2013 Reissue) at para 60.363). The Logbook belongs to AirLNG while Mr Higgins’s case is that it is SAC which owes him money. I fail to see how he can assert a lien over the Logbook in these circumstances. In holding onto the logbook for four whole years, Mr Higgins placed SAC in breach of contract and had thereby fallen short of his duty to act in SAC’s best interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 I turn to the question of the remedy, and this is where I find that SAC’s claim falters for want of proof of loss. By SAC’s own case, the losses were borne by AirLNG, and there is no evidence that AirLNG had, at the date of the trial, sued SAC.

</div> serves either as reparations for damages suffered or as a monetary substitution for the loss of a trust asset (see <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity </span>(John McGhee gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2015) (“<span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span>”) at para 20-028). Either way, it functions as restitution for the <span class="font-italic">loss</span> which is suffered as a result of the breach of trust (see <span class="font-italic">Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns </span>[1996] 1 AC 421 at 434C–E <span class="font-italic">per </span>Lord Browne-Wilkinson). In this way, while the remedy of equitable compensation may be analogised to the award of damages, there are important differences (see, generally, <span class="font-italic">Quality Assurance</span> <span class="font-italic">Management Asia Pte Ltd v Zhang Qing </span>[2013] 3 SLR 631 at [39]–[50]. One important difference, it seems to me, is that it is not possible to make a nominal award. It stands in contrast with actions in contract (or torts which are actionable <span class="font-italic">per se</span>, such as defamation),where a nominal sum may be awarded in damages even if there is no proof of actual loss. In such cases, the award of nominal damages serves a vindicatory function, it “mark[s] the fact that there has been a breach of contract” (see <span class="font-italic">Andrew Mappouras v Waldrons Solicitors </span>[2002] EWCA Civ 842 at [15] <span class="font-italic">per </span>Kay LK). No authority has been cited to me to demonstrate that the remedy of equitable compensation may play this vindicatory, rather than compensatory, function. In the circumstances, therefore, I find that SAC is not entitled to the remedy of equitable compensation which it has claimed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In concluding my analysis of the main claim in Suit 733, I will state that, contrary to what was submitted, it is clear from what I have found that there is no basis to for Mr Higgins to be granted relief under s 391(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), which permits the court to excuse a director from liability for breach of fiduciary duty if it can be shown that the director had “acted honestly and reasonably”.
