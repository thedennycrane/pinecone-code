By this it is meant that its issuer represents that it backs each stablecoin issued with an equivalent value in fiat currency or other reserves. The issuer typically offers terms of service under which verified holders of the stablecoin have the right to redeem it with the issuer for fiat currency. This link to a fiat currency, in this case the United States Dollar, is reflected in the name by which Tether is commonly referred to, namely USDT, standing for United States Dollar Tether. I will adopt this acronym in this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In this application, ByBit Fintech Limited (“ByBit”) seeks summary judgment against the first defendant, one Ms Ho Kai Xin (“Ms Ho”). The claim against her is that in breach of her employment contract, she abused her position to transfer quantities of USDT to “Addresses” secretly owned and controlled by her, as well as a quantity of fiat currency to her own bank account. The main relief sought is a declaration that Ms Ho holds both the USDT and the fiat currency on trust for ByBit. ByBit accordingly seeks an order for the return of the same or of its traceable proceeds, or for payment of a sum equivalent in value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The courts in Singapore and elsewhere have in granting interlocutory injunctions recognised that there is at least a serious question to be tried or a good arguable case that crypto assets are property capable of being held on trust. In so doing, it has not been necessary to determine whether such crypto assets are things in action or are instead a novel type of intangible property. To grant judgment and finally declare a trust, this court must go further and decide that the crypto assets in question, here USDT, are indeed property capable of being held on trust and, if so, what type of property they are.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 In this case, I find that USDT, which may be transferred from one holder to another cryptographically without the assistance of the legal system, nonetheless are choses in action. In this judgment, I mostly use the phrase things in action, which means the same as choses in action. While the fact that USDT also carries with it the right to redeem an equivalent in United States Dollars from Tether Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”), makes it look more like traditionally recognised things in action, I do not consider that this feature is necessary for a crypto asset to be classed as a thing in action. Like any other thing in action, USDT is capable of being held on trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 I further hold that ByBit has established its case for summary judgment, and accordingly grant the declarations sought on the basis of institutional constructive trust.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 I now explain my reasons for these conclusions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 ByBit, a Seychellois company, owns a namesake cryptocurrency exchange. ByBit remunerates its employees with traditional currency, cryptocurrency, or a mixture of both. WeChain Fintech Pte Ltd (“WeChain”), a Singapore incorporated company, provides payroll services for ByBit and related entities. Ms Ho was employed by WeChain and was responsible for the payroll processing of ByBit’s employees.

The Cryptocurrency Excel Files list the “Address” designated by ByBit’s employees for the receipt of cryptocurrency payments. An “Address” can be understood as an encrypted digital “folder” which can “receive” and “store” cryptocurrency. Each Address takes the form of a unique string of alpha numerals. A corresponding “Private Key” is required to access and authorise transfers between Addresses. These Private Keys are in turn stored in “Wallets”, which can thus be understood as the means of interfacing with cryptocurrency. Wallets which are hosted online by a service provider, usually a cryptocurrency exchange, are known as “Custodial Wallets”. Custodial Wallets usually take the form of an application with a user interface. Offline Wallets are known as “Self-Custodial Wallets” and may range from a simple piece of paper inscribed with the Private Key or complex encryption software restricting access to the Private Key. In short, access to a Wallet grants access to the stored Private Keys which provide control over an Address and thus the cryptocurrency stored therein. ByBit’s employees could and did regularly change their designated Address by communicating a new Address to Ms Ho, who would then update the Cryptocurrency Excel Files.

</div> The core of Ms Ho’s defence is that Jason stole the Crypto Asset from ByBit without her knowledge. She did not receive or benefit from them as the Wallets associated with the four Addresses are owned and controlled by Jason alone. Her case is that from May 2022, she had asked Jason to assist in checking the Cryptocurrency Excel Files on “numerous occasions” when Jason visited her home. Jason had thereafter accessed her work laptop without her knowledge or consent, which Ms Ho only discovered after reviewing her home’s closed-circuit surveillance footage when ByBit drew her attention to the Anomalous Transactions. She then confronted Jason, who admitted that he had intentionally substituted the designated Address of several ByBit employees with the four Addresses. Despite repeated requests, Jason has refused to return the Crypto Asset.

This revealed that Ms Ho owns the Wallet and included details such as Ms Ho’s identity card and even a self-portrait, which were provided by her as part of the account registration process. Disclosed transaction records also match the Anomalous Transactions flowing into Address 1, and amounts transferred on certain dates appear to show that the USDT transferred into Address 2 and Address 3 were shortly thereafter transferred into Address 1.

</div> For Address 1, 2, and 4, these are associated with Custodial Wallets. In the case of Custodial Wallets, access to the Private Keys is kept by the service provider rather than the user of the Custodial Wallet. Instead, the user of the Custodial Wallet is contractually entitled to instruct the service provider to transfer cryptocurrency between Addresses. ByBit likens this to a bank account, where the cryptocurrency balance stated in the Custodial Wallet (equivalent to an account balance) is a chose in action against the service provider (equivalent to the bank). The relevant property is therefore also a chose in action, being the right to instruct the service provider in respect of the credit balance of USDT.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) has recently issued a consultation paper on proposed amendments to the payment services regulations that will implement segregation and custody requirements for digital payment tokens: MAS, “Response to Public Consultation on Proposed Regulatory Measures for Digital Payment Token Services” published on 3 July 2023. These proposed amendments reflect the reality that it is possible in practice to identify and segregate such digital assets, and hence support the view that it should be legally possible to hold them on trust. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Moreover, general recognition has been given to cryptocurrency as property in the Rules of Court. In Order 22 of the Rules of Court 2021, which deals with the enforcement of judgments and orders, O 22 r 1(1) defines “movable property” to include “cash, debt, deposits of money, bonds, shares or other securities, membership in clubs or societies, and <span class="font-italic">cryptocurrency or other digital currency</span>” [emphasis added]. Cryptocurrency has thus been expressly recognised as a form of property capable of being the subject matter of an enforcement order. Although the drafters of the Rules of Court 2021 did not specify a precise method for carrying out such an enforcement order (see the <span class="font-italic">Civil Justice Commission Report</span> (29 December 2017) (Chairperson: Justice Tay Yong Kwang)), I observe in passing that the procedures for serving a notice of seizure on the persons or entities having possession or control of movable property (O 22 r 6(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court 2021) or on the persons or entities which register the ownership of intangible movable property (O 22 r 6(4)(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Rules of Court 2021) are logically extendable to cryptocurrency or other digital currency. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Crypto assets are not classed as physical assets because we cannot possess them in the way we can possess objects like cars or jewellery. They do not have a fixed physical identity. Yet, crypto assets do manifest themselves in the physical world, albeit in a way that humans are unable to perceive. The combination of Private Key with Public Key unlocks the previous cryptographic lock and in turn locks the unspent transaction output of the crypto asset to the holder’s public Address on the blockchain. Professor Kelvin Low suggests that the right that the holder of the Private Key has by virtue of holding the Private Key is “properly conceptualised as a narrow right to have the unspent transaction output (UTXO) of a cryptoasset locked to a holder’s public address on a blockchain”: see Kelvin FK Low, “Trusts of Cryptoassets” (2021) 34(4) Trust Law International 191. This physical manifestation at the level of digital bits and bytes is not permanent, and changes with every transaction. Nonetheless, we identify what is going on as a particular digital token, somewhat like how we give a name to a river even though the water contained within its banks is constantly changing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 While some people are sceptical of the value of crypto assets, it is worth keeping in mind that value is not inherent in an object. While we speak of expensive materials, with gold being more valuable than wood, this is a judgment made by an aggregate of human minds. It is also a judgment that varies with circumstances. A wooden chair that can float is more valuable on a ship that is sinking than a golden throne would be. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 This description of crypto assets shows that they can be defined and identified by modern humans, such that they can be traded and valued as holdings. They certainly meet Lord Wilberforce’s oft-quoted <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth</span> [1965] 1 AC 1175 at 1248:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Before a right or an interest can be admitted into the category of property, or of a right affecting property, it must be definable, identifiable by third parties, capable in its nature of assumption by third parties, and have some degree of permanence or stability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The next question is whether USDT can be classed in the category of things in action. The argument that crypto assets should not be classified as things in action rests on the origin of this category as rights enforceable by action (in the sense of litigation in court) against persons, such as the right to be paid money or debts, or contractual rights. There is no individual counterparty to the crypto holder’s right. But over time the category of things in action has expanded to include documents of title to incorporeal rights of property, and ultimately incorporeal rights themselves such as copyrights: see W.S. Holdsworth, “The History of the Treatment of ‘Choses’ in Action by the Common Law” (1920) 33(8) Harvard Law Review 997. As Holdsworth noted at 998 in the introduction to his authoritative essay:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is clear that the diversity of the things included under the category of choses in action must lead to a diversity in the legal incidents of various classes of choses in action. In fact their legal incidents do differ very widely; for, being different in themselves, they have necessarily been treated differently both by the courts and by the legislature. It is impossible to treat fully of the law of choses in action in general; and the various classes of choses in action are usually treated, not under this one general category, but under the separate branches of law to which they more properly belong. If we want to know the law, for instance, as to bills and notes, or shares, or copyright, or patents, we should not think of looking for it in a treatise on choses in action, but rather in books on mercantile law, company law, or in special treatises devoted to these particular things.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Holdsworth’s historical survey demonstrates the diversity of incorporeal property that has been classed as things in action. This diversity suggests that the category of things in action is broad, flexible, and not closed. It is these features that both explain and justify Fry LJ’s oft-cited <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> in <span class="font-italic">Colonial Bank v Whinney</span> (1885) 30 Ch D 261 at 285, that: “All personal things are either in possession or action. The law knows no <span class="font-italic">tertium quid</span> between the two.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 My conclusion is therefore that the holder of a crypto asset has in principle an incorporeal right of property recognisable by the common law as a thing in action and so enforceable in court. While it might be said that this conclusion has an element of circularity in that it could also be said that the right to enforce in court is what makes it a thing in action, this type of reasoning is not strikingly different from how the law approaches other social constructs, such as money. It is only because people generally accept the exchange value of shells or beads or differently printed paper notes that they become currency. Money is accepted by virtue of a collective act of mutual faith. This is reflected in Lord Mansfield’s famous observation in <span class="font-italic">Miller v Race </span>(1758) 1 Burr 452 at 457, that what is treated as money “by the general consent of mankind” is given “the credit and currency of money to all intents and purposes”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 ByBit also relies on the current terms of service for USDT which provide for a contractual right of redemption.

Tether Tokens may be used, kept, or exchanged online wherever parties are willing to accept Tether Tokens. Tether Tokens are 100% backed by Tether's Reserves. Tether Tokens are denominated in a range of Fiat. For example, if you purchase EURT, your Tether Tokens are 1-to-1 pegged to Euros. If you cause to be issued EURT 100.00, Tether holds Reserves valued at €100.00 to back those Tether Tokens. The composition of the Reserves used to back Tether Tokens is within the sole control and at the sole and absolute discretion of Tether. Tether Tokens are backed by Tether's Reserves, including Fiat, but Tether Tokens are not Fiat themselves. Tether will not issue Tether Tokens for consideration consisting of the Digital Tokens (for example, bitcoin); only money will be accepted upon issuance. In order to cause Tether Tokens to be issued or redeemed directly by Tether, you must be a verified customer of Tether. No exceptions will be made to this provision. The right to have Tether Tokens redeemed or issued is a contractual right personal to you. Tether reserves the right to delay the redemption or withdrawal of Tether Tokens if such delay is necessitated by the illiquidity or unavailability or loss of any Reserves held by Tether to back the Tether Tokens, and Tether reserves the right to redeem Tether Tokens by in-kind redemptions of securities and other assets held in the Reserves.

</div> Conversely, Ms Ho cannot establish a fair or reasonable probability of a real or <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Jason does not exist</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I accept on a balance of probabilities the inference that ByBit seeks to draw from the totality of the evidence that Jason does not exist (or at any rate did not play the role asserted for him by Ms Ho). The evidence is indeed compelling that Ms Ho fraudulently transferred the Crypto Asset and the Fiat Asset to herself. As outlined in [25] above, there is the direct evidence that Ms Ho owns the Wallet associated with Address 1 as well as the circumstantial evidence of her unexplained spending spree. Taking advantage of her employment with WeChain which was engaged to handle ByBit’s payroll and abusing the trust reposed in her, Ms Ho manipulated the Cryptocurrency Excel Files to steal the Crypto Asset and the Fiat Asset.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 An institutional constructive trust arises over stolen assets at time of the theft, and the remedy of tracing in equity is available in respect of stolen assets. As Lord Browne-Wilkinson noted in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council </span>[1996] 1 AC 669 at 716:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I agree that the stolen moneys are traceable in equity. But the proprietary interest which equity is enforcing in such circumstances arises under a constructive, not a resulting, trust. Although it is difficult to find clear authority for the proposition, when property is obtained by fraud equity imposes a constructive trust on the fraudulent recipient: the property is recoverable and traceable in equity. Thus, an infant who has obtained property by fraud is bound in equity to restore it: Stocks v. Wilson [1913] 2 K.B. 235, 244; R. Leslie Ltd. v. Sheill [1914] 3 K.B. 607. Moneys stolen from a bank account can be traced in equity: Bankers Trust Co. v. Shapira [1980] 1 W.L.R. 1274, 1282C-E. See also McCormick v. Grogan (1869) L.R. 4 H.L. 82, 97.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I should also add that the constructive trust may operate even if Ms Ho mixed the USDT with other USDT in the balances of the respective online Custodial Wallets, or the Fiat Asset with other money in her bank account: <span class="font-italic">Foskett v </span><span class="font-italic">McKeown</span> [2001] 1 AC 102.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Given my findings on the facts, I declare a constructive trust over the Crypto Asset and the Fiat Asset. ByBit is the legal and beneficial owner of the Crypto Assets. In view of my grant of relief on the basis of institutional constructive trust, I need not deal with the alternative bases of remedial constructive trust and unjust enrichment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 ByBit following its investigations has sought a mix of proprietary and personal orders, which I now grant, as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A declaration of constructive trust over the Crypto Asset and Fiat Asset;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  An order that Ms Ho does forthwith pay to ByBit the sum of USD 647,880 (being the value of the Crypto Assets in Wallets 3 and 4); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) An order that Ms Ho does forthwith pay to ByBit the sum of SGD 117,238.46 (the Fiat Asset); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) An order that Ms Ho does forthwith transfer all sums remaining in Wallet 1 to ByBit, up to the sum of USD 3,561,840 (being the value of the Crypto Assets transferred to Wallets 1 and 2); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) In respect of the remainder of the Crypto Assets transferred to Wallets 1 and 2 (being USD 3,561,840 worth of USDT) after deducting the amount transferred in (d) above (the “Remainder Sum”):</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) An order that Ms Ho give an account of the Remainder Sum, or such money or funds representing the value of the Remainder Sum as have been possessed or received by her or by any person on their behalf or to their order;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) A tracing order in respect of the Remainder Sum, or any part thereof, for ByBit to trace and recover the assets or the proceeds thereof into which the aforesaid properties have been converted, if any;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) An order for payment by Ms Ho to ByBit of all sums found to be due to ByBit on the taking of the account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I also award interest at the standard rate of 5.33% per annum on the sums payable under [45(b)] and [45(c)] above from the dates the assets in question were transferred by Ms Ho until date of judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Having granted ByBit summary judgment against Ms Ho, I also award costs in favour of ByBit in the amount of $45,000.00 (which takes into account the legal novelty of the issues argued as well as the work done in seeking interim relief for which costs were in the cause) and disbursements of $11,500.00.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Quek Wen Jiang Gerard, Kyle Gabriel Peters, Ling Ying Ming Daniel, Mato Kotwani and Chua Ze Xuan (PDLegal LLC) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The first to sixth defendants absent and unrepresented. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

This is the first time that this has been decided in any common law court. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background to the dispute</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">1 ByBit Fintech Limited (“ByBit”) sought summary judgment against the first defendant, one Ms Ho Kai Xin (“Ms Ho”) in respect of certain crypto assets. The crypto asset in question was one called Tether which is an example of what has been described as a stablecoin. By this it is meant that its issuer represents that it backs each stablecoin issued with an equivalent value in fiat currency or other reserves. The issuer typically offers terms of service under which verified holders of the stablecoin have the right to redeem it with the issuer for fiat currency. This link to a fiat currency, in this case the United States Dollar, is reflected in the name by which Tether is commonly referred to, namely USDT, standing for United States Dollar Tether.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 The claim against her was that in breach of her employment contract, she abused her position to transfer quantities of USDT to “Addresses” secretly owned and controlled by her, as well as a quantity of fiat currency to her own bank account. The main relief sought was a declaration that Ms Ho holds both the USDT and the fiat currency on trust for ByBit. ByBit accordingly sought an order for the return of the same or of its traceable proceeds, or for payment of a sum equivalent in value. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The court’s decision </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 The court decided that the crypto assets in question, here USDT, are indeed property capable of being held on trust. The court further found that USDT, which may be transferred from one holder to another cryptographically without the assistance of the legal system, are nonetheless things in action. While ByBit relied on the fact that USDT also carries with it the right to redeem an equivalent in United States Dollars from Tether Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”), makes it look more like traditionally recognised things in action, this feature was not considered necessary for a crypto asset to be classed as a thing in action. The court held that like any other thing in action, USDT is capable of being held on trust.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 In so holding, the court referred to the legal history of things in action as they developed in the common law in England (see <span class="font-weight-bold">[34]</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[35]</span>) and how the law approaches other social constructs such as money (see <span class="font-weight-bold">[36]</span>).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The court went on to hold that on the facts Ms Ho had wrongfully transferred the assets in question and declared an institutional constructive trust over them in favour of ByBit. The court also made ancillary orders, including tracing orders. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The court therefore granted summary judgment in ByBit’s favour.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
