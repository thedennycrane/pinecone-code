In the first contemporaneous statement recorded on 25 February 2020, Mr Tan said that E1A and E1B contained “Heroin <span class="font-italic">and</span> Ice” [emphasis added] and that they belonged to one Malaysian man. Mr Tan “was <span class="font-italic">supposed</span> to drop [E1A and E1B] off as instructed” [emphasis added] by the Malaysian man.

</div> In the third contemporaneous statement, Mr Tan identified the Malaysian man as “Sal Poulez”. Once again, he stated that the Four Bundles, E1A1, E1A2, E1B1 and E1B2, contained “Heroin <span class="font-italic">and</span> Ice, but he do [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] not know which is Heroin, which is Ice” [emphasis added]. The items belonged to Sal Poulez. When asked what he was “<span class="font-italic">supposed </span>to do with the Heroin and Ice” [emphasis added], he said he was to wait for Sal Poulez’s call with instructions “to drop the Heroin and Ice at specified location”. In return for his help, Sal Poulez would “pay [him] SGD$500 for 02 batu heroin, SGD$300 for 01 batu heroin and 125g of Ice for SGD$200”.

When asked, “[D]o you know how much you supposed to collect today?” Mr Tan answered, “No. I do not know”.

Pal told Mr Tan that he had a package to deliver to Mr Tan at night. While on the way home from work, there was another call between them. Pal told him there was a slight delay in the delivery. According to Mr Tan, Pal did not inform him of the amount of drugs he would be collecting that night. This was the norm. Normally, Mr Tan would collect the drugs, and he would know the amount of drugs he had collected once he reached home. Mr Tan would then confirm with Pal the amount of drugs he had collected was correct. Up to then, there had been no mistakes or discrepancies in the amount of drugs that Mr Tan had collected with the amount he was supposed to collect. For one “batu” of heroin, Mr Tan would receive $300. For 125g of “ice”, he would receive $200. To Mr Tan, one “batu” amounts to about 450g of heroin.

Mr Tan agreed. However, as he was feeling very agitated and angry with Pal at that point in time, Mr Tan told the officers that he would “fuck” Pal first before saying what the CNB officers had wanted him to say. However, the officers did not let Mr Tan answer the phone when it rang. When the officers tried calling Pal afterwards, the calls went through, but Pal did not answer.

Mr Tan knew there must have been ice in the Recycle Bag because Pal told him after lunch on 25 February 2020 that he had packed instruments for Mr Tan to smoke ice together with some ice for that night’s collection.

That is why Mr Tan continued to collect and deliver drugs for Pal. Mr Tan said that he never repacked Pal’s drugs; he had merely removed the black tapes and wrapped the drugs in newspaper before delivering them.

However, while it was probable for Mr Tan to have continued to drop the Drugs off for Pal, Mr Tan was not certain if he would have continued to help Pal as he was really upset at Pal at that point in time for giving him more drugs than what he would typically receive without informing him beforehand.

To do so, they were assisted by a Tamil interpreter, Mdm Vijaya Thavamary Abraham (“Mdm Vijaya”).

He did so as he hoped to receive a lighter sentence for telling the truth.

If the Prosecution relies on the s 18(1) presumption, the accused person may rebut this presumption by either establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that (i) he was never in possession of or never had custody of or control over the container, keys or document referred to in s 18(1), or (ii) that he was never aware that the thing which was later found to be a drug was in his custody: <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor</span> [2019] 2 SLR 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Adili</span>”) at [40].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 As regards s 18(2) of the MDA, the presumption will be rebutted where an accused person establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not know the nature of the drugs in his possession. This would be the case where the accused person was able to prove that he believed he was carrying something innocuous (even if he is unable to specify exactly what that was) or where the accused person was able to prove that he believed he was carrying some other illegal item or drug other than the specific drug in his possession: <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l </span><span class="font-italic">Avedian v Public Prosecutor</span> (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>”) [2021] 1 SLR 180 at [57] and [59].

However, for the purposes of the MDA, possession has been interpreted to mean not just the fact of physical possession or custody but also to incorporate an element of knowledge. As regards the sort of knowledge required, all that is needed is that the accused person must know of the existence, within his possession, control or custody, of the thing which is later found to be a controlled drug. To be clear, it is not necessary that the accused person also knows that the thing was, in fact, a prohibited drug, much less its specific nature: <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> at [31].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Prosecution ran a different case at trial</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Mr Tan does not dispute that he was in physical possession of the Recycle Bag, which contained, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the Drugs when he alighted from the Car. Accordingly, the Prosecution invokes s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA for the presumption that Mr Tan had the Drugs in his knowing possession. However, in his closing submissions, Mr Jumabhoy argues that a line of questioning taken by the Prosecution in the cross-examination of Mr Tan shows that the Prosecution’s case against Mr Tan is one of wilful blindness. Accordingly, it is impermissible for the Prosecution to rely on s 18(1) of the MDA to presume that Mr Tan was wilfully blind to the presence of the Drugs in his possession. In fact, Mr Jumabhoy proceeded on the basis that the Prosecution was running its case based on wilful blindness and focused on how the Prosecution had failed to establish the elements of wilful blindness.

To elaborate, these questions concerned whether Mr Tan took any steps to open the plastic bags so as to “verify” their contents. In my view, this line of questioning was primarily aimed at demonstrating that Mr Tan is unable to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. For the avoidance of doubt, the element of knowledge is distinct from that of knowing possession. This coheres with established law that an accused person who was merely indifferent to or ignorant of what he was carrying would not be able to rebut the presumption in s 18(2): <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> at [64]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In any event, the Prosecution is only precluded from invoking the presumption under s 18(1) of the MDA if its case proceeds <span class="font-italic">solely</span> on the basis that the accused person had been wilfully blind: <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> at [100].

It was Mr Tan who then placed the plastic bags into the Recycle Bag. Notwithstanding this, during cross-examination, Mr Dineshkumar disavowed his earlier narrative and admitted that Mr Tan had no role in placing E1A and E1B into the Recycle Bag.

However, Insp Eugene’s evidence clearly contradicts that of Mr Tan. I see no reason to doubt Insp Eugene’s account. At the material time, Insp Eugene’s focus would have been on Mr Tan. It is unlikely that he would have missed the strong reaction (if any). I pause to observe that the sentiment underlying the purported reaction <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Mr Tan had been deceived, was not reflected in either the first or the second contemporaneous statement. In these statements, Insp Eugene had duly recorded Mr Tan’s other responses, which included those that implicated Pal in the transaction.

</div> This is because even if Pal had deceived Mr Tan concerning the quantity of drugs involved, it does not necessarily mean that Mr Tan would be exculpated.

His reaction was not in relation to being deceived into taking delivery of <span class="font-italic">any</span> drugs at all, other than some “ice” for his own consumption.

Mr Tan answered that he wished to cooperate but did not know who to incriminate. It is incongruous for Mr Tan to offer to cooperate with the CNB if he had wanted to implicate himself and be sentenced to suffer death at that time. Mr Tan also did not provide any satisfactory explanation for the inconsistency of the answer with his alleged state of mind. When asked about the inconsistency, Mr Tan could only say that he did not know why, and his mind was muddled at that point in time.

In the first place, this claim that he said “heroin <span class="font-italic">or </span>ice” was not raised in Mr Tan’s examination-in-chief. Mr Tan appended his signature at the bottom of the two pages of the first contemporaneous statement. It is also incredible that Mr Tan would have “overlooked” the mistake on <span class="font-italic">two </span>occasions because, in the third contemporaneous statement, recorded by <span class="font-italic">another</span> officer, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, SSgt Eric, it was also stated that the four bundles contained “heroin <span class="font-italic">and</span> ice” [emphasis added].

</div> There is no reason why two different officers would have recorded the same conjunctive “and” if Mr Tan had indeed verbalised the word “or” to them. I shall deal with the allegations against SSgt Eric shortly. More detrimental to Mr Tan’s position is the fact that in the third contemporaneous statement, Mr Tan was recorded as saying that he “[did] not know which is Heroin, which is Ice” <span class="font-italic">immediately</span> after identifying the Four Bundles as “Heroin <span class="font-italic">and</span> Ice”.

Mr Tan had an altercation with SSgt Eric and was not “in a very good frame of mind at that time”. According to Mr Tan, he had an altercation with SSgt Eric because the latter was insisting that Mr Tan was guilty and hurrying the recording process.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Even if I were to assume in Mr Tan’s favour that the first and third contemporaneous statements should read “heroin <span class="font-italic">or</span> ice”, there is no reason for Mr Tan to have identified the Four Bundles (which were wrapped in black tape) as “heroin or ice” if he had only been expecting some “ice” and “popeyes” as per the Nature of Transaction Defence. Even taking Mr Tan’s case at the highest and proceeding on the basis that he was expecting some “ice” and “popeyes”, it is hard to believe that he had no inkling what could be within the Four Bundles. Further, assuming there was the Alleged Agreement between Mr Tan and Pal, it would have been perfectly in accord with the agreement for Mr Tan to handle one pound of heroin <span class="font-italic">and </span>125g of “ice”. Thus, by the foregoing, I accept the contents of the first and third contemporaneous statements that Mr Tan said that the Four Bundles contained heroin and “ice”, and that this contradicts the Nature of Transaction Defence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Whether the Nature of Transaction Defence is believable </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In and of itself, I am of the view that the Nature of Transaction Defence is unbelievable, and I do not accept Mr Tan’s belated bare assertions of the same. I explain. Before 25 February 2020, there were prior transactions with Pal which first involved heroin <span class="font-italic">or </span>ice, and then heroin <span class="font-italic">and </span>ice. This was stated in paragraph 19 of the second long statement (see [89] above). Sometimes, some “ice” for Mr Tan’s personal consumption would also be delivered. I accept these aspects concerning the prior transactions as recorded in the long statements, which were not disputed by Mr Tan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Given the history of the dealings, it is conceivable that Pal would have agreed to deliver the items for Mr Tan’s use (along with other drugs for trafficking and to collect cash from Mr Tan); this would have followed the pattern of earlier transactions. However, it is unbelievable that Pal would go out of his way to help Mr Tan by making such a special arrangement (by delivering small quantities of “ice” and three “popeyes” for Mr Tan’s personal consumption and use), even if Pal also wanted to collect the money from Mr Tan. I note that on that night alone, the transaction required nine calls between the parties. In the day, there were also calls between them. Furthermore, Pal would be putting his “conveyor” at some risk – purportedly for a small amount of “ice” and three “popeyes”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 There is, moreover, no reason whatsoever for Mr Tan to believe that Pal would only deliver the items meant for his personal use. According to Mr Tan, Pal was essentially a drug dealer who he had never met in person.

</div> Moreover, Pal was associated with Segar, another drug dealer who had previously betrayed Mr Tan by causing Mr Tan to collect a large amount of heroin. There was no special relationship between them for Pal to agree to help Mr Tan, and certainly, there was no basis for Mr Tan to believe the delivery would only be of the items he required. Instead, the contents of paragraph 19 of the second long statement – that Mr Tan was expecting a delivery of drugs, along with items for his own use – rang more of the truth.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 For all the foregoing reasons, as well as my views on the Alleged Agreement below, I reject the Nature of Transaction Defence.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Alleged Agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As part of his defence, Mr Tan also raises the Alleged Agreement. As explained in [42] above, this serves as the backdrop not only in relation to the question of Mr Tan’s knowledge of the Drugs but also the issue of whether Mr Tan had the intention to traffic the Drugs. In this regard, as the Prosecution acknowledges, if this agreement exists, one <span class="font-italic">may argue</span> that Mr Tan would not have known that the Three Bundles all contained heroin since he did not expect to receive more than one pound of heroin.

However, Mr Tan did not mention Segar and how the botched transaction with Segar on or around 9 January 2020 led to the Alleged Agreement in any of the statements. This was not for want of an opportunity to do so. In Mr Tan’s second long statement, he dealt at some length with his dealings with Boy Tanjong before he started dealing with Pal.

The Alleged Agreement was raised belatedly at the trial and not in Mr Tan’s investigation statements. Accordingly, I am unable to accept Mr Tan’s account that the Alleged Agreement exists.

Therefore, it is likely that at least two deliveries to two different persons were planned.

</div> Further, the way the bundles were hidden in the boot of the Car lend support to this. Mr Dineshkumar’s evidence is that originally there was one bundle in the black plastic bag (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, E1B), while the other three bundles were simply in the boot. Mr Dineshkumar placed one more bundle in the black plastic bag and the other two bundles in the white plastic bag.

</div> Mr Dineshkumar had to sort out the bundles for ease of delivery. Mr Tan argues that as the Three Bundles, E1A1, E1A2 and E1B1 contained heroin, it must have been E1B2 (which contained “ice”) which was separately placed into the black plastic bag for easy identification. In any case, from the fact that the Three Bundles were left in the car boot and not in a plastic bag, they could have been meant for different deliveries. If Mr Tan only became the recipient of the Drugs because Mr Dineshkumar did not go to the first location at Jalan Besar, and no one turned up at the second location at Fishery Port Road, whether Mr Tan knew about the delivery of the Drugs becomes highly questionable.

While Mr Tan was not the original intended recipient, there was little to suggest that he was not meant to receive all Four Bundles. I agree with the Prosecution that at no time did Mr Dineshkumar say that there were any instructions for him to split up the Four Bundles across several recipients. In fact, at Fishery Port Road, Mr Dineshkumar was specifically informed that the Four Bundles were meant to be collected by one recipient.

</div> That said, even if Mr Tan might not have expected to collect so many bundles of drugs, based on my discussion above, it seems clear enough that he was meant to collect heroin and “ice”. Therefore, such surrounding context does not, in my view, assist Mr Tan in rebutting the presumption of knowledge of the Drugs.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Mr Tan has successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 In evaluating Mr Tan’s evidence concerning the issues above, I bore in mind that he is highly educated, intelligent and articulate. A long-term drug addict, he knew the severe repercussions of carrying certain quantities of drugs. Mr Tan would have appreciated that his claims <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that he was only expecting some “ice” and three “popeyes” for his own use and that he had only agreed to deal with one pound of heroin and no more, are important matters which should have been raised during investigations. While Mr Tan might not have been in the best frame of mind during the recording of the various statements, I do not think he would have had any problems clearly communicating these claims to the recording officers. When Mr Tan read the statements, he should also have been able to clarify any factual ambiguities. Strangely, he failed to state the material aspects which now ground his defence at the trial. The main portion which he points to in support of the Alleged Agreement is vague. In sharp contrast, in the long statements, he provided a lot of details about his drug deals, including previous dealings with Boy Tanjong. Therefore, I reject these belated claims. Accordingly, I also find that on a balance of probabilities, Mr Tan has failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Intention to traffic</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 I now proceed to address the final element of the offence, which pertains to the intention to traffic the Drugs. The Prosecution bears the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr Tan intended to deliver the Drugs to a third party as per Pal’s instructions. On this score, the Prosecution relies on Mr Tan’s admissions in his investigation statements. The Prosecution asserts that Mr Tan’s attempt to discredit these admissions during the trial should be dismissed.

First, Mr Jumabhoy relies on the following key aspects of the defence. Specifically, there was never an agreement for Mr Tan to traffic more than one pound of heroin. Effectively, this concerns the Alleged Agreement and Mr Tan’s evidence regarding the previous transactions with Pal (which did not involve more than one pound of heroin). Further, Mr Tan was not the intended recipient of the Drugs.

</div> These aspects raise doubts about his intention to deliver them according to Pal’s instructions.

In the statements themselves, Mr Tan expressed the possibility that he would not have continued with the delivery of the Drugs.

I should add that I have also rejected the Nature of the Transaction Defence. That said, when I consider the contents of the investigation statements in a moment, I shall refer to these matters, as well as Mr Tan’s claim that, in any event, he had not dealt with more than one pound of heroin in any of his previous dealings (see [109] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Mr Tan also says that the fact that he was not the intended recipient of the Drugs is indicative of the lack of intention to traffic the Drugs on his part.

The purported reactions, argues Mr Tan, show that his first reaction was to scold Pal for giving him such large quantities of drugs, and his first reaction was not to deliver the Drugs for Pal. Therefore, this points against him having the intention to traffic the Drugs.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In this connection, Mr Jumabhoy relies on the proposition in <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 1003 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramesh Perumal</span>”) at [110] that a person who returns drugs to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him would not ordinarily come within the definition of “trafficking”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 I have carefully considered Mr Jumabhoy’s arguments. But based on the evidence before me, I am unable to accept them. By the time the first and third contemporaneous statements were recorded, Mr Tan was well aware that there were Four Bundles in the Recycle Bag. He does not dispute this. In the first contemporaneous statement, Mr Tan said he was “<span class="font-italic">supposed </span>to drop it off as instructed” [emphasis added]. He reiterated this in the third contemporaneous statement. I can accept that “<span class="font-italic">supposed </span>to” (what he was required to do) is not the same as “<span class="font-italic">intended </span>to” (what Mr Tan would do). However, intention is a subjective state of mind to be objectively inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhammad </span><span class="font-italic">Salihin bin Ismail</span> [2023] SGHC 155 at [72]. From the statements, it is evident that Mr Tan knew what he was required to do, as per his arrangement with Pal. There was no indication that Mr Tan would depart from his arrangement with Pal <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>to drop off the Drugs as instructed by Pal. From these clear and unequivocal admissions, the only inference to be drawn is that it was his intention to deliver the Drugs. Indeed, even in paragraph 20 of Mr Tan’s second long statement, recorded a week after his arrest, he said that he “would had [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] still continued to drop off the drugs from this collection on ‘Pal’s’ instruction”. This confirms the inference to be drawn with regard to his intention. Accordingly, the difference between what Mr Tan was <span class="font-italic">supposed</span> to do and what he <span class="font-italic">intended</span> to do is more apparent than real. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 In my view, although there was apparently a shift in position reflected in paragraph 20, whereby Mr Tan expressed that “whether [he] would continue to [deliver the Drugs] is not confirmed as [he] felt unhappy that ‘Pal’ had passed [him] drugs more than the usual collected”, this shift came belatedly. The <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> and <span class="font-italic">mens</span><span class="font-italic"> rea</span> of the offence had already coincided on 25 February 2020 – when Mr Tan took possession of the Drugs. Moreover, Mr Tan’s position merely became equivocal. Mr Tan only expressed a <span class="font-italic">possibility</span> that he would not have delivered the Drugs, and this shift does not seriously undermine Mr Tan’s original intention to deliver the Drugs. I should add that even in the fourth long statement, recorded some months later on 18 August 2020, this equivocal stance remained (see [23(b)] above).   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 Weighed against Mr Tan’s evidence of the Alleged Agreement, or even of his prior experience of not delivering more than one pound of drugs for Pal, I find Mr Tan’s equivocal stance puzzling. By way of reminder, according to Mr Tan, when Segar delivered more than one pound of heroin on or around 9 January 2020, Mr Tan felt betrayed. He had no qualms about confronting Segar about it over the phone, going as far as to say that he did not “want to have anything to do with this one and they should come pick it up” (see [36] above). Indeed, eventually, Pal picked up the drugs in question. That is why there was the Alleged Agreement with Pal. In any event, he had never dealt with more than one pound of heroin. In contrast, the statements do not show Mr Tan exhibiting such a strong reaction in relation to the present collection. If Mr Tan indeed had no intention to deliver more than one pound of heroin, and especially given his alleged prior dealing with Segar and Pal on or around 9 January 2020, I would expect him to have rejected outright any further involvement with the Four Bundles and to require Pal to collect the Drugs. But nothing is said along these lines. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 In fact, in paragraph 20 of the second long statement, Mr Tan merely said, “[Pal] should not have assumed that [Mr Tan] would be ok to collect this amount of drugs. If ‘Pal’ try to brush [Mr Tan] off, [Mr Tan] would have warned him not to put this amount of drugs without letting [Mr Tan] know next time….” (see [20(d)] and [107] above). Following this portion of paragraph 20, Mr Tan then expressed uncertainty about whether he would proceed to deliver the Drugs. His equivocal stance continued in the fourth long statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 At the highest, the tenor of the second and fourth statements suggests that Mr Tan had second thoughts about what to do with the Drugs and that he developed some doubts about whether he should proceed with the intended plan. This was completely contradictory to his professed firm and uncompromising stance with Segar and Pal concerning the January 2020 transaction. I agree with the Prosecution that by this shift to an equivocal position, Mr Tan was merely seeking to disassociate himself from the prior consistent admissions.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Lastly, in my judgment, <span class="font-italic">Ramesh Perumal</span> does not greatly assist Mr Tan. In <span class="font-italic">Ramesh Perumal</span>, two accused persons, Ramesh and Chander, drove into Singapore together from Malaysia. At some point during the journey, Ramesh received a bag containing four bundles of diamorphine from Chander. Ramesh argued that he did not know about the contents of the bag. He claimed that Chander had told him that the bag contained some documents and had passed them to him for safekeeping. Chander also told Ramesh that he would take the bag back from Ramesh later that day and bring the items in that bag back to Malaysia. However, Chander gave evidence that Ramesh was supposed to deliver the four bundles to a recipient in Singapore. On the facts, the court found that there was a reasonable possibility that Ramesh was safekeeping the drugs with the intention of returning them to Chander. Accordingly, the trafficking charge against Ramesh was amended to a charge of possession simpliciter under s 8(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, as an accused who was in possession of drugs with no intention of parting with them other than to return them to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him does not come within the definition of possession of those drugs “for the purpose of trafficking”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 The present case is readily distinguishable from <span class="font-italic">Ramesh Perumal</span><span class="font-italic">.</span> Mr Tan was not entrusted to safe keep the Drugs and return them to Pal. As is clearly stated in the statements, the arrangement was for Mr Tan to deliver the Drugs to others in Singapore. While Mr Tan expressed the possibility that he would not proceed to deliver the Drugs, this was belated. To my mind, this was an attempt to distance himself from the earlier admissions. By the above, I am of the view that the contents of the statements reveal that Mr Tan accepted that he was required to drop off all Four Bundles within the Recycle Bag and that the inference to be drawn is that it was his intention to do so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mr Tan’s conduct </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I wish to discuss Mr Tan’s behaviour during the collection (including his failure to check the contents of the Recycle Bag). To recapitulate, while he was in the Car, Mr Tan claimed that he did not know that Mr Dineshkumar was placing things into the Recycle Bag, as Mr Tan’s attention was on the road.

It would not have taken more than a moment for him to roughly ascertain what had been placed into the Recycle Bag (which was on the floorboard in front of him). By the time he exited the Car, Mr Tan had sensed that the weight of the Recycle Bag was heavier than usual upon lifting the Recycle Bag from the floorboard.

</div> I appreciate that the Unit was nearby, but again, I am of the view that if Mr Tan truly did not expect to receive the Drugs, then he ought reasonably to have at least looked into the Recycle Bag to have a quick glance at its contents. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 If the Nature of Transaction Defence were to be believed, and if the Alleged Agreement were in place, I would have considered Mr Tan’s behaviour incomprehensible. Setting aside these defences, which I have rejected, as I said at [109] above, there remains Mr Tan’s claim that he had never dealt with more than one pound of heroin in the previous transactions. Mr Tan said that he would not traffic in more than one bundle of heroin as it would carry a death sentence.  Given these circumstances relied on by Mr Tan, it is unbelievable that Mr Tan did not bother to check on the contents of the Recycle Bag while in the Car or exhibit any reaction or concern at all after he felt that the Recycle Bag was heavier than usual as he left the Car. Mr Tan’s nonchalance buttresses the inference that he intended to deliver the amount of drugs which he collected.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Mr Tan had the intention to traffic  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 In conclusion, I am satisfied that the Prosecution has proved Mr Tan’s intention to traffic the Drugs beyond a reasonable doubt. In the final analysis, the investigation statements and surrounding circumstances strongly evince Mr Tan’s intention that he would have gone on to deliver the Drugs. Contrary to Mr Tan’s contention in the closing submissions, his purported reactions of shock and surprise when the Drugs were first revealed to him are not supported by CNB officers who observed him, and neither were those reactions reflected in the contemporaneous statements. Moreover, Mr Tan’s shift in position as regards his intention came too late, and even then, it suffered from ambiguity. The irresistible inference to be drawn is that he intended to traffic the Drugs which he collected. For completeness, I should state that in arriving at this conclusion, I have considered Mr Tan’s background and experience, as set out in [114] above.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision: Mr Dineshkumar</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 I now turn to consider the case against Mr Dineshkumar.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Act of trafficking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The first element to be established for a charge of trafficking under s 5(1) of the MDA, as faced by Mr Dineshkumar, is the act of trafficking in the Drugs.

</div> I have already set out the applicable law as to how an accused person may rebut the s 18(2) presumption (at [51] above) and need not repeat it here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 The Prosecution argues that Mr Dineshkumar has failed to discharge his burden of rebutting the presumption on the basis that: (i) Mr Dineshkumar is not a credible witness; (ii) Mr Dineshkumar’s claim that he lacks the requisite knowledge is unbelievable; and (iii) Mr Dineshkumar was, in any event, indifferent to the contents of the Three Bundles.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Conversely, as stated (at [45] above), Mr Dineshkumar’s defence is that he was always under the impression that he was delivering “ice”. This is mainly because Mr Dineshkumar was made to believe that he was to deliver only one bundle of “ice” by Kelvin. Even when Mr Dineshkumar discovered that the Car contained four bundles of drugs, he was made to believe, and believed, that they all contained “ice”.

It was only five months later that the Knowledge Defence was raised.

</div> Presumably, by stating this, Mr Dineshkumar sought to give credence to the Knowledge Defence. However, this claim is not made in any of Mr Dineshkumar’s statements. Crucially, Mr Dineshkumar stated in his third long statement that he did not know the type or quantity of drugs he was delivering on 24 February 2020 and did not ask Kelvin about it. There was no mention of the delivery of “ice” in the statement.

</div> Mr Dineshkumar’s explanation for the preceding inconsistency is that he had told informed recording officer of his third long statement, through Mdm Vijaya, that Kelvin had in fact told Mr Dineshkumar that he would be delivering one bundle of “ice” on 24 February 2020, but Mdm Vijaya, “may not have heard him right”.
