The facts of the present case were proof of that. The Applicant had advanced a large sum of money to the Respondent, who claimed she had given birth to twins, to cover their medical expenses, on the assumption that the children were his. Later events caused the Applicant to suspect that the twins did not really exist, or that if they did, they were not his children. If the children do indeed exist, and are indeed of his blood, then, the Applicant says, he has no cause of action. But if he had been lied to, and the twins do not exist, or are not his, then he believes he has a cause of action in either unjust enrichment or the tort of deceit. He therefore applied for pre-action discovery and interrogatories, seeking information which would enable him to decide on the viability of his claims.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 On or around 9 August 2019, the Respondent informed the Applicant that she was pregnant with fraternal twins.

That said, the court will only allow pre-action discovery if it is necessary to do so: O 24 r 7 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322 R 5, 2014 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The same principles apply to pre-action interrogatories.

Other notions of proportionality, such as the availability of alternative avenues to obtain the information and the intrusiveness of those interrogatories, are also relevant considerations. If the plaintiff already has a complete cause of action against an identified party, then pre-action interrogatories would be unnecessary, and should not be ordered.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Here, the Applicant argued that his intended causes of action were in unjust enrichment or the tort of deceit, given his suspicion that he had been deceived by the Respondent.

</div> The application for pre-action discovery and interrogatories, the Applicant argued, was necessary to allow him to obtain information and documentation as to whether the twins existed, and whether he was the biological father.

If the information which the Applicant sought had no bearing in relation to the contemplated causes of action, in that they would not enable him to assess the viability of his claims, then, bearing in mind the overriding test of necessity, the application for pre-action discovery and interrogatories should be disallowed. I turn now to examine the law on unjust enrichment and the tort of deceit to determine the relevance of the information sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Unjust enrichment is a relatively recent development in private law, having only been formally recognised in the UK decision of <span class="font-italic">Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd </span>[1991] 2 AC 548, and subsequently by our Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Seagate Technology Pte Ltd v Goh Han Kim </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 836.

Third, it must be unjust to allow the defendant to retain that benefit (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, there must be an “unjust factors”: see <span class="font-italic">Anna Wee </span>at [129]). Finally, the court looks at whether there are any defences to the claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Applying this to the present facts, it was clear that the Respondent, having received some $300,000 from the Applicant, was indeed enriched at his expense. What then was the unjust factor that could be relied on? Some examples of recognised unjust factors include:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Mistake, either of fact or of law;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Duress;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Undue influence; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) Unconscionability.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Further, as noted by Sundaresh Menon CJ in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Swimming Club </span>at [93], while the categories of unjust factors are not closed, courts are “generally cautious not to recognise new grounds of recovery too freely”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Can a mistake as to the paternity of children, for instance, amount to a mistake of fact for the purposes of unjust enrichment? An example can be found in the local textbook on the subject, <span class="font-italic">Principles of the Law of Restitution in Singapore </span>at [04.051]. There, Prof Tang cites the case of <span class="font-italic">BMM v BMN </span><span class="font-italic">and another matter </span>[2017] 4 SLR 1315 (“<span class="font-italic">BMM</span>”) for the proposition that where there are multiple causative factors motivating the transfer of an enrichment, restitutionary recovery should not be allowed if it is shown that only one of the factors turned out to be untrue. In that case, Y married X and had twins with her in 2000. In 2001, Y added X as a joint tenant to a property which he bought before the marriage. It later transpired that Y’s marriage to X was void because X was not granted a <span class="font-italic">decree absolute </span>of her earlier marriage. It also turned out that the twins were not Y’s biological children. Y thus sought a declaration that the transfer of the property be set aside on the ground of mistake.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Foo Tuat Yien JC who heard the case observed (at [96]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As discussed above, I have found that [Y] was unaware of the invalidity of his marriage until about 2008.

The way the parties dealt with each other was premised less on the assumption that their marriage had been validly registered and more on the fact that, at the time, they were in a considerably close and loving relationship, which was borne out by the fact that [Y] had fought for the custody of the twins despite the fact that they were not his biological children. Had [Y] been made aware of the invalidity of his marriage at that point in time, I think that it is improbable that he would have suddenly sought to annul his marriage; on the contrary, I think it probable that he would have re-registered his marriage to establish its validity. The position <span class="font-italic">may</span> be different if [Y] had been made aware of <span class="font-italic">both</span> the invalidity of his marriage <span class="font-italic">and</span> the fact that the twins were not his biological children. However, as [Y] did not pursue the issue of the twins’ paternity (as noted above at [91]–[92]), I do not make any finding on this point. [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The above passage suggests that Y must have been mistaken as to both the validity of his marriage, as well as the fact that the twins were not his biological children before the transaction could be reversed. I would, however, make no comment as to the proposition advanced by Prof Tang, save that, in my view, <span class="font-italic">BM</span><span class="font-italic">M </span>simply illustrates that a mistake of fact could also encompass a mistake as to the paternity of one’s children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Based on the facts before me, it was therefore clear that, without knowledge of the non-existence of the twins, or whether they are his children, the Applicant would not be able to assess the viability of his claim in unjust enrichment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I turn next to examine the elements of the tort of deceit, which have been set out in <span class="font-italic">Panatron Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [14]. First, there must be a representation of fact made by words or conduct. Second, this representation be made either with the knowledge that it is false, or that it is wilfully false, or in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true. Third, the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted on by the plaintiff, or by a class of persons which includes the plaintiff. Finally, the plaintiff must have acted on the false statement and suffered damage as a consequence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22  On the present facts, it was clear that the Respondent had represented, either through words or her conduct, that she was pregnant with his children. What the Applicant did not know was whether she had made this representation with the knowledge that it was false. The Applicant also did not know whether the Respondent had intended for him to act on that representation. Here, the application for pre-action discovery and interrogatories would allow the Applicant to determine the truth of the matter – did the twins exist? And if they did, was he the biological father? If, for instance, it emerged that the twins did not exist, the Applicant would be able to plead facts to establish the second element of the tort of deceit: that the Respondent had lied to him about her pregnancy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In summary, while the facts of the present case appeared rather unique, a closer examination reveals that the Applicant could have a cause of action in either unjust enrichment, or the tort of deceit. What the Applicant lacked, to establish the viability of those claims, was information (if any) concerning the existence of the twins, and assuming the twins did exist, information which would establish whether they were his biological children. I was therefore satisfied that the application for pre-action discovery and interrogatories was necessary to allow the Applicant access to that information.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In the circumstances, I found it appropriate to allow the application for pre-action discovery and interrogatories. I therefore granted an order in terms of the prayers sought (see [7(a)] and [7(b)] above) with costs reserved.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Benjamin Niroshan Bala and Dhaniyah Binte Hishammudin (TSMP Law Corporation) for the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The respondent absent and unrepresented.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
