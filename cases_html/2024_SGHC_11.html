</div> He went on to strike out the defences in this action on the basis that all of the pleaded defences were wholly contrary to the plain text of the Guarantee and the other relevant contracts and documents. Accordingly, he entered judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the first defendant in the sum of US$63.3m with interest and costs (the GD at [5] and [140]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 I have, in substance, dismissed the defendants’ appeals. If I had considered it necessary to characterise the Guarantee, I would not have characterised it as an on-demand performance guarantee or as any other type of performance guarantee or bond. Despite this difference of approach, however, I agree with AR Chong that both defendants’ defences should be struck out. This is because, in my view, it is not necessary to declare the Guarantee to be an on-demand performance guarantee in order to determine whether the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment. It is plain and obvious that the first defendant’s defence is devoid of any merit, whatever the true character of the Guarantee may be. As for the second defendant’s defence, it is a completely unnecessary pleading. The second defendant is named as a defendant purely because it is the assignor of the US$63.3m debt that the first plaintiff claims in this action and because it does not wish to be named as a co-plaintiff in this action. As a result, neither plaintiff makes any claim whatsoever in this action against the second defendant. It is a complete waste of time, costs and judicial resources for a defendant against whom the plaintiffs make no claim to file a defence or indeed to be compelled by the plaintiffs to file a defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The defendants have appealed against my decision.

Their case proceeds as follows. Because the Guarantee is properly characterised as an on-demand performance guarantee, the first defendant’s liability under the Guarantee is a primary liability. The first defendant cannot resist payment under the Guarantee by attacking the validity or subsistence of the debt that the Operating Companies owe to the second defendant. The first defendant will be liable under the Guarantee simply upon proof that: (a) the second plaintiff made a demand on the first defendant for payment under the Guarantee; and (b) that demand complied with the terms of the Guarantee. In the alternative, if the Guarantee is not properly characterised as an on-demand performance guarantee, the first defendant’s liability is a secondary liability. The first defendant will be liable under the Guarantee only if the second plaintiff can prove that: (a) the Operating Companies’ underlying debt to the second defendant is valid and subsisting; and (b) that the Operating Companies have failed to perform their obligation to pay that debt. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Given the contractual structure of the Guarantee, I do not consider it necessary to determine whether the Guarantee is properly characterised as an on-demand performance guarantee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Clause 3.1 of the Guarantee obliges the first defendant to pay the debt that is due from the Operating Companies to the second defendant under the Materials Contract upon the second defendant’s demand for such payment. Assuming for the time being that the second defendant’s assignment of its rights under the Guarantee to the first plaintiff is valid, the first plaintiff has stepped into the shoes of the second defendant. From the time of the assignment, the first defendant owed its obligations under the Guarantee to the first plaintiff. The first plaintiff then demanded payment from the first defendant under the Guarantee. The first defendant accepts that, if time is frozen at the time of the first plaintiff’s demand, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 24 January 2020, the Operating Companies were in breach of their obligations under the Materials Contract and did owe US$63.3m to the second defendant (see the GD at [3]).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 There is no need to consider whether the first defendant’s obligation under the guarantee arises independently of establishing the Operating Companies’ default under the Materials Contract, whether by characterising the Guarantee as an on-demand performance guarantee or by relying on cl 3.2 of the Guarantee. Clause 3.2 applies only if, for whatever reason, some sums that are due from the first defendant  to the second defendant are not recoverable from the first defendant under cl 3.1 “on the footing of a guarantee”. That situation can arise either because: (a) the Operating Companies have a substantive defence arising under the law of contract or under the general law to the second defendant’s claims under the Materials Contract <span class="font-italic">and</span> the first defendant is able under the law of assignment to assert that defence against the first plaintiff as assignor; or (b) the first defendant has a defence arising from the law of suretyship and unrelated to the Operating Companies’ defences as against the second defendant arising from the Materials Contract. The first defendant asserts no defence to the plaintiffs’ claim that falls into either category.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The question of whether the Guarantee is properly characterised as an on-demand performance guarantee is therefore immaterial. The first defendant accepts that the Operating Companies owed US$63.3m to the first plaintiff on 24 January 2020. Clause 3.1 is therefore engaged. There is simply no need to consider whether the first defendant owes an independent obligation as principal debtor to the first plaintiff whether by characterising the Guarantee as an on-demand performance guarantee or under cl 3.2 of the Guarantee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my view, the Guarantee is simply a contract. And so, it should be construed as a contract, applying the ordinary approach to contractual construction in light of the law on suretyship. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nature of on-demand performance guarantees </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Had it been necessary for my decision, however, I would have found that the Guarantee is not an on-demand performance guarantee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 An on-demand performance guarantee is also known as a “performance bond”, “first demand guarantee” or “demand bond”. Whatever the name, it is a contract under which a guarantor undertakes to pay a creditor a sum of money upon the creditor’s demand. The guarantor can therefore be held liable to the creditor even without proof of any failure by the principal debtor to perform its obligations to the creditor and even if there has been no such failure (<span class="font-italic">Vossloh</span><span class="font-italic"> Aktiengesellschaft v Alpha Trains (UK) Ltd</span> [2011] 2 All ER (Comm) 307 at [46]). This is unlike an ordinary guarantee, under which the guarantor undertakes to pay the creditor only if the principal debtor fails to perform its obligations to the creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The purpose of an on-demand performance guarantee is to protect against the failure of a contractual counterparty to perform (Wayne Courtney, <span class="font-italic">The Modern Contract of Guarantee </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2020) (“<span class="font-italic">The Modern Contract of Guarantee</span>”) at para 13-001). A party to a contract therefore seeks an on-demand performance guarantee when it has doubts about its counterparty’s ability to perform its obligations under their contract or its ability to pay damages for a failure to perform those obligations. The on-demand performance guarantee confers two advantages upon the creditor. First, the creditor can secure payment simply upon demand, regardless of the existence or merits of any dispute between the creditor and principal debtor. Second, because the guarantor is liable to pay simply upon demand, there is a much lower risk of a dispute or litigation (<span class="font-italic">Master Marine AS v </span><span class="font-italic">Labroy Offshore Ltd and others </span>[2012] 3 SLR 125 (“<span class="font-italic">Master Marine</span>”) at [26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Although on-demand performance guarantees have been mistaken for guarantees and likened to “exceptionally stringent contracts of indemnity” (H. G. Beale, <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span><span class="font-italic">, Volume 2: Specific Contracts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2021)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 47-009), they are more accurately seen as being analogous to letters of credit, though they are “not equivalent to a letter of credit for all purposes” [emphasis in original omitted] (<span class="font-italic">Master Marine </span>at [26], citing LP Thean JA, “The Enforcement of a Performance Bond: The Perspective of the Underlying Contract” [1998] 19 Sing LR 389 at 400). Nevertheless, like the letter of credit, commerce and the courts treat the on-demand performance guarantee as the equivalent of cash. Provided that the demand complies with the terms of the guarantee, the only two bases on which a guarantee can resist payment are by establishing the narrow grounds of either fraud or unconscionability (<span class="font-italic">Dauphin Offshore Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan </span>[2000] 1 SLR(R) 117 at [34]–[41]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Because the on-demand performance guarantee is offered and taken as a substitute for cash and is therefore treated as the functional equivalent of cash, the identity of the guarantor is of utmost importance. It is for this reason that an on-demand performance guarantee is typically issued by a bank, insurance company or other financial institution (<span class="font-italic">Meritz</span><span class="font-italic"> Fire and Marine Insurance Co Ltd v Jan De Nul NV and another </span>[2011] 1 All ER (Comm) 1049 at [66]). The on-demand performance guarantee substitutes the guarantor’s creditworthiness for the counterparty’s creditworthiness. The creditor will therefore want the guarantor to satisfy two criteria. First, the guarantor must be of high creditworthiness. Second, the guarantor must have a high reputation for performing its own contractual obligations. Financial institutions satisfy both criteria. That is why the on-demand performance guarantee is typically issued by a financial institution. It is their financial strength and their reputation that gives creditors the confidence that they will get in fact get cash upon demand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 In <span class="font-italic">Marubeni Hong Kong and South China Ltd v Mongolian Government </span>[2005] 1 WLR 2497, the English Court of Appeal held that there is a strong presumption that parties do not intend to create an on-demand performance guarantee where a guarantee is given outside the banking context and does not contain language appropriate for an on-demand performance guarantee (“<span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 There are differing views on whether the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption is part of Singapore law. In <span class="font-italic">China Taiping Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (formerly known as China Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd) v Teoh Cheng Leong </span>[2012] 2 SLR 1 at [19], Chan Seng Onn J recognised that the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption was “important”, without expressly accepting that it was part of Singapore law. For the reasons I have given, I consider the rationale behind the presumption to be sound. I accept that the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni</span> presumption is part of Singapore law. In the present case, the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption is engaged because the first defendant, the guarantor, is not a bank. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Related to the <span class="font-italic">Marubeni </span>presumption are the factors set out in John Odgers QC (gen ed), <span class="font-italic">Paget’s Law of Banking</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(LexisNexis, 15th Ed, 2018)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 35.8 (the “<span class="font-italic">Paget </span>factors”). It states that an instrument will almost always be construed as an on-demand performance guarantee where it: (a) relates to an underlying transaction between the parties in different jurisdictions; (b) is issued by a bank; (c) contains an undertaking to pay “on demand”; and (d) does not contain clauses excluding or limiting the defences available to a guarantor (<span class="font-italic">Wuhan Guoyu Logistics Group Co Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Emporiki Bank of Greece SA (No. 1) </span>[2013] 1 All ER (Comm) 1191 at [26]–[28]). The <span class="font-italic">Paget </span>factors also point against the Guarantee being an on-demand performance guarantee, again because the first defendant is not a bank. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Construction of on-demand performance guarantees </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The <span class="font-italic">Marubeni</span> presumption and the <span class="font-italic">Paget</span> factors are not intended to be conclusive in themselves. Ultimately, the characterisation of a guarantee as an on-demand performance guarantee is a matter of construction. An example of words construed as creating an on-demand performance guarantee in the banking context is found in <span class="font-italic">Wood Hall Ltd v Pipeline Authority</span> (1979) 141 CLR 443 at 447:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Bank unconditionally undertakes and covenants to pay on demand any sum or sums which may from time to time be demanded in writing by Owner up to a maximum aggregate sum of ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,500,000) to be held by Owner … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 An example of words construed as creating an on-demand performance guarantee outside the banking context is found in <span class="font-italic">Bitumen Invest AS v Richmond Mercantile Ltd FZC </span>[2016] EWHC 2957 (Comm) at [19]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[A] In consideration of the Owners entering into the Charter with the Charterers and delivering the vessel thereunder, and for other good and valuable consideration (the receipt and adequacy of which the Guarantor hereby acknowledges) the Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the due and proper performance of all obligations, including payment obligations, which the Charterers incur or may incur towards the Owners under the Charter (the ‘Guaranteed Obligations’) and to pay to the Owners on demand all monies as may fall due from the Charterers to the Owners and to discharge all Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof when the same become due for payment or discharge.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[C] The Guarantor expressly undertakes to make payment on demand of any amount certified by Owners by written notice to be due to the Owners as a consequence of the Charterers not having fulfilled their obligations under the Charter, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of written notice for payment from the Owners. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[D] Any payments under this Guarantee shall be made in full, free and clear of any deductions, withholdings, set-offs or counterclaims of any nature whatsoever …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is clear to me that the words of cl 3 of the Guarantee cannot be construed as creating an on-demand performance guarantee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The first defendant did not undertake in the Guarantee to pay the liabilities due from the Operating Companies to the second defendant simply upon demand. Instead, the first defendant’s liability under cl 3.1 arises only if there has been a failure in “due and punctual performance by the Operating Companies of all of their obligations” (cl 3.1.1). It is only in that event that the first defendant comes under an obligation to “pay [to the first plaintiff] such sum on demand” (cl 3.1.2). Further, the first defendant’s liability under cl 3.2 arises only if cl 3.1 is triggered, but for whatever reason the Operating Companies have a defence to the second defendant’s claim under the Materials Contract or the first defendant has a defence to the second defendant’s claim under cl 3.1 of the Guarantee. It is only in that event that the first defendant becomes liable to pay the first plaintiff the sum due to the second defendant from the Operating Companies “[a]s a separate and independent stipulation” (cl 3.2). As a matter of construction, it is clear that the first defendant’s obligations under cl 3 of the Guarantee do not arise unconditionally upon demand. Its obligations arise only if a specified condition precedent is satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The presence of cll 7.3 and 9.1 do not make the Guarantee an on-demand performance guarantee. I agree with the first defendant that cl 9.1 is conclusive only as to the quantum of money owed by the first defendant, and not conclusive as to the first defendant’s liability to pay.

And where a clause is found on its proper construction to cover both liability and quantum, this is a factor in favour of construing the instrument as an on-demand performance guarantee (<span class="font-italic">Van Der Merwe v IIG Capital LLC </span>[2008] 1 All ER (Comm) 435<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [32] and [51]). I cannot construe cl 9 as covering both liability and quantum. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As for cl 7.3, it merely prevents the first defendant from exercising any right of set-off against amounts due under the Guarantee. The only effect of this clause is to require the first defendant to litigate any alleged set-off, counterclaim or other right of deduction rather than to exercise a right of self-help against a payment due to the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Even if the commercial result of an on-demand performance guarantee and the Guarantee may be the same, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the first defendant is liable to pay US$63.3m to the first plaintiff, the way in which the outcome is reached is significantly different. It is not the case that the first defendant’s liability to pay the first plaintiff arose merely by reason of the first plaintiff’s demand on 24 January 2020. Instead, the liability arose: (a) because the Operating Companies failed to perform their obligations to pay the second defendant (cl 3.1.1); (b) because this failure triggered the first defendant’s liability to pay (cl 3.1.2) and (c) because the first plaintiff made a demand upon the first defendant for payment under the Guarantee. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 For the reasons I have given, I am satisfied that the Guarantee is not an on-demand performance guarantee. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the first defendant’s case should be struck out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I turn to address whether the first defendant’s defence should be struck out under O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Court and judgment entered against it accordingly. In my view, it should be. The first defendant’s defence is legally and factually unsustainable and thus frivolous or vexatious within the meaning of O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Before explaining my reasons for striking out the first defendant’s defence, I make two points. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 First, where a plaintiff makes a claim against a defendant, there are three types of points a defendant can raise in response:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) points going to liability;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) points going to quantum; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) points going to the risk of over-recovery, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the risk that the plaintiff will ultimately recover more than the sum for which the defendant has been held liable to the plaintiff. </div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">Points of the first and second type are true defences, going either to negate liability or to reduce quantum. A point of the third type is not a defence at all. The risk of over-recovery can always be addressed by the court extracting suitable undertakings from a plaintiff either when the court enters judgment or when the court lends its aid to the plaintiff by levying execution upon the judgment. The points raised by the first defendant are, at their highest, of the third type. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Second, where a debtor fails to pay a debt to a creditor and the creditor holds guarantees or security for the debt, the creditor has multiple and independent avenues of recourse to recover the debt (subject of course to contract or statute). Typically, the creditor can sue the debtor to recover the debt. He can sue the guarantor of the debt. Or he can have recourse to the security that the borrower or a third party has given for the debt. Unless otherwise bound by contract or statute, the creditor can choose in what order to pursue the various avenues of recourse. In the absence of a contractual right, a guarantor cannot resist liability to the creditor on the basis that creditor should have sued the principal debtor first. Likewise, in the absence of a contractual right, a principal debtor cannot resist the creditor’s claim on the basis that the creditor should have recourse to the security. Any risk that the creditor will recover more than the debt by pursuing these separate avenues consecutively can, as I have said, be addressed by the court extracting suitable undertakings from the creditor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the alternative, the points raised by the first defendant are of this type. They are not defences to liability. Instead, the first defendant simply assumes that there is a sequence of recourse that the first plaintiff must pursue in recovering the undisputed debt that the Operating Companies owe to the first defendant and that the first defendant has assigned to the first plaintiff, failing which the first defendant will not be liable under the Guarantee. There is no basis for this in the Guarantee or in any of the other relevant contracts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the GEM and Hangji securities can satisfy the sum owed under the Guarantee </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I begin with what appears to be the first defendant’s primary defence.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In oral submissions, the first defendant initially argued that parties came to a consensus – not a contract – that the GEM and Hangji securities could be used to satisfy the debt that the first defendant owes to the first plaintiff under the Guarantee. But upon further questioning, the first defendant applied – at the tail-end of counsel’s oral submissions – to amend the first defendant’s defence to plead a contract between parties to this effect. I allowed the amendment, subject to the usual costs consequences, so that I could determine the first defendant’s appeal on the best and final version of its defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 This defence is nevertheless unsustainable. I do not accept that, as a matter of fact, there exists any connection between the GEM and Hangji securities and the debt that the first defendant owes to the first plaintiff under the Guarantee. The first defendant does not own the GEM and Hangji securities. I agree with AR Chong that the first defendant cannot rely on the GEM and Hangji securities to discharge or even reduce its own liability to the first plaintiff under the Guarantee (the GD at [111(b)]). At the very highest, the GEM and Hangji securities may be security for the Operating Companies’ liabilities to the first plaintiff under the ATFF2 Loan. But even then, the existence of that security affords the first defendant no defence to its liability to the first plaintiff under the Guarantee (the GD at [111(c)]). It merely raises a possibility that the first plaintiff may at some point in the future over recover.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Even if there exists a connection between the GEM and Hangji securities and the first defendant’s liability under the Guarantee, I do not accept that any contract exists obliging the first plaintiff to apply the GEM and Hangji securities against the first defendant’s liabilities under the Guarantee, failing which the first defendant will not be liable under the Guarantee. Much of the first defendant’s oral submissions were premised on the discussions between parties leading to nothing but a<span class="font-italic"> consensus ad idem</span> falling short of a contract. Any such consensus is incapable of having legal consequences, as are necessary to afford a defence to the first defendant. The first defendant’s original framing of its case and its reframing of its case at the tail end of its submissions suggests to me that the allegation of a contract is a mere afterthought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Further, even on the merits, I am satisfied that there was no such contract. I come to that conclusion for two reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, for a contract to be formed, there must be offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations and certainty of terms. Although the traditional oral and acceptance analysis may be of limited assistance where continuing negotiations are concerned (<span class="font-italic">Projection Pte Ltd v The Tai Ping Insurance Co Ltd </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 798 at [16]–[17]), parties are still required to plead a specific date when the contract was concluded (<span class="font-italic">Likpin</span><span class="font-italic"> International Ltd v Swiber Holdings Ltd and another</span> [2015] 5 SLR 962 (“<span class="font-italic">Lipkin International</span>”) at [42]). The flexible approach in cases of continuing negotiations does not require departure from the offer and acceptance model, but simply requires a deeper appreciation of the context of the agreement, to be gained by looking at the whole course of negotiations (<span class="font-italic">Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter</span><span class="font-italic"> and another appeal</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [63]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The first defendant’s case of an oral contract relies on events from February to May 2019. That spans three months. But the first defendant does not plead when, within these three months, the alleged contract was concluded. This is not sufficient. I accept that a party should be given latitude to plead with reasonable certainty the date at which an oral agreement was concluded. The party alleging it need not plead an exact date. But a pleading that asserts that an agreement was somehow entered into over a period of three months fails the reasonably certain test required for the formation of an oral agreement (<span class="font-italic">Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd </span>[2019] SGHC 68 at [148]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 This requirement also gives commercial certainty to the parties that their continuing negotiations will not be taken to be a binding contract unless there was a clear acceptance at some point in time (<span class="font-italic">Day, Ashley Francis v Yeo Chin Huat Anthony and others </span>[2020] 5 SLR 514 (“<span class="font-italic">Day, Ashley Francis</span>”) at [49]). It is not desirable nor sufficient for a plaintiff to pool a universe of e‑mails, messages and conduct, and argue that the collective sum of these show that an agreement must have had been reached at some point in time, without making a case as to when that point was (<span class="font-italic">Day, Ashley Francis</span> at [49]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The first defendant’s pleaded case of an oral contract is unsustainable. Further, given the circumstances in which it was put forward, I am entitled to assume that it cannot be improved by amendment or particulars.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Second, on the facts, the discussions between February and May 2019 do not reveal that any contract was concluded. The evidence shows only that the plaintiffs asked for details of the various securities. At best, all that the evidence shows is that the first defendant formed a belief unilaterally that the GEM and Hangji securities could or would be used to reduce or extinguish the debt that the first defendant owes to the first plaintiff under the Guarantee. There is simply no evidence of a consensus <span class="font-italic">ad idem </span>between the parties sufficient to afford the first defendant any sort of a defence, let alone a contract to the same effect.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Where a party is unsure of the most salient terms of a contract – including the date of the contract, whether the contract was oral or written and the consideration that was agreed – it is frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process to expect the counterparty to defend a contractual claim (<span class="font-italic">Likpin</span><span class="font-italic"> International </span>at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Even if I accept the first defendant’s claim that there was a contract, it remains the case that it is not for the first defendant to dictate the sequence in which the first plaintiff should have recourse to its personal claim against the Operating Companies for the debt, against the first defendant on its guarantee for the debt or against the Gem and Hangji security, assuming that there was indeed a contract that they were to be used as security for the first defendant’s debt to the first plaintiff under the Guarantee. I say this because the first defendant’s defence is essentially that the first plaintiff should satisfy the sums that the first defendant owes to the first plaintiff under the Guarantee by realising the GEM and Hangji securities, instead of claiming that sum from the first defendant. It is not a defence for a debtor to complain that a creditor is taking a course of action that the debtor considers undesirable or even irrational. In so far as the first defendant’s real concern is about the first plaintiff over-recovering, that is not a defence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the GEM and Hangji securities can be used to set off the sum owed under the Guarantee</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As an alternative to the Cross-collaterisation Theory, the first defendant argues that Ontario law applies to the Guarantee

From my review of both parties’ expert opinions on Ontario law, there is no significant difference between Singapore law and Ontario law on the exclusion of a debtor’s right of set-off, whether legal or equitable. Both systems of law accept that parties have the contractual freedom to vary or even to exclude entirely the exercise of legal or equitable set-off. Ascertaining whether they have done so is ultimately a question of construing the contractual provision said to have this effect in accordance with the usual principles of contractual construction. Under both systems of law, the starting point in the exercise of contractual construction is the words which the parties have chosen to express their agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The words chosen by the parties in cl 7.3 of the Guarantee could not be clearer:

I consider the wording of the clause wide enough to exclude set-off in all its varieties, both legal and equitable set-off, and both as a matter of Singapore law and as a matter of Ontario law. As AR Chong rightly acknowledged, the word “set-off” is broad enough to cover both legal and equitable set-off (the GD at [113]). The parties did not limit “set-off” in cl 7.3 to legal set-off. This must mean that they intended the word not to be limited to legal set-off (the GD at [113]). In contrast, it is usually clauses providing that amounts are to be paid “without any deduction” that may, in some contexts, be insufficient to exclude equitable set-off (<span class="font-italic">The Modern Contract of Guarantee </span>at para 11-081, citing <span class="font-italic">Connaught Restaurants Ltd v Indoor Leisure Ltd </span>[1994] 1 WLR 501). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The first defendant’s expert opines that cl 7.3 is not wide enough to bar equitable set-off for all purposes. But he does not substantiate his opinion by setting out for what purposes cl 7.3 bars equitable set-off and for what purposes cl 7.3 does not bar it. Nor does he cite any authority from any jurisdiction for coming to this conclusion. Like AR Chong, I reject this argument as contrived and unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the notices of assignment were validly given</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I turn to address the first defendant’s defence arising from the notices of assignment. Their defence proceeds in two steps as follows. First, the GSA and Security Deed were executed on 22 November 2019. This was several months after the alleged drawdowns took place between May and July 2019. The ATFF2 facility agreement requires the security to be executed before the drawdown dates. Therefore, the Security Deed and the GSA were not executed pursuant to the conditions of the ATFF2 facility agreement and the assignment is invalid.
