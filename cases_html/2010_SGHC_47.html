<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Ng Koo Kay Benedict (“Benedict”)
                    and Rajathurai Suppiah (“Suppiah”) (hereinafter referred to
                    jointly as “the plaintiffs”) commenced this action against Zim
                    Integrated Shipping Services Ltd (“Zim” or “the
                    defendant”) for defamation arising out of a statement that the defendant
                    published on the Internet. The facts are brief and are not in
                dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Benedict was, at the material time, a director
                    and/or shareholder of various companies in the shipping and shipping-related
                    business around the world. Amongst these companies were Charter Shipping
                    Agencies (S) Pte Ltd (“Charter Shipping Agencies”) and Starship
                    Agencies Sdn Bhd (“Starship Agencies”). Benedict was a shareholder
                    and director of both companies at the material time. Suppiah is a qualified
                    accountant and was, during the material time, involved in the business of a
                    number of companies as a director, manager, consultant or owner. Alain Koh Hong
                    Seng (“Alain”) was the Assistant General Manager of Charter
                    Shipping Agencies and was a witness in these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant is in the container-shipping
                    business with operations around the world. It has four operational headquarters,
                    with one of them being in charge of Asia and the Far East. The defendant owns a
                    number of other companies including Gold Star Line Ltd (“GSL”) and
                    Seth Shipping Ltd (“Seth”). Dan Hoffman (“Hoffman”)
                    took over as the defendant’s Area President for Asia in May
                2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Dafni Igal (“Captain Dafni”) was
                    GSL’s Managing Director from November 1995 to December 2004 and was the
                    Area President of the defendant for the Asia region between December 2004 and
                    November 2006. Captain Dafni resigned in May 2006, was placed on garden leave
                    until November 2006 and subsequently joined Cheng Lie Navigation Co Ltd
                    (“CNC Lines”), a competitor of the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 3 December 2007, the defendant, together
                    with other related companies, commenced Suit 755 of 2007 (“Suit
                    755”) against (<em>inter alia</em>) Captain Dafni
                    and the plaintiffs. In Suit 755, the defendant argued that Captain Dafni was in
                    breach of his fiduciary duties (under the common law and the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2008 Rev Ed)) and/or his employment contract by engaging in
                    various alleged acts of impropriety. Similarly, the defendant argued in Suit 755
                    that the plaintiffs, together with various companies owned and/or controlled by
                    them, were liable for inducing Captain Dafni to breach his employment contract
                    and/or fiduciary duties. The detailed facts and holdings in Suit 755 can be
                    found at <em>Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd v Dafni
                        Igal</em> [2010] SGHC 8 (the “<em>Suit
                        755 Judgment</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After Suit 755 was commenced, on 18 January
                    2008, the defendant sent an email to two salespersons from the HKSG Group Media
                    Ltd (“HKSG”), enclosing a press release (“the Press
                    Release”) to be published in the “HK [Shipping] GAZETTE as [early]
                    as possible”. The email also sought confirmation of publication. The
                    Press Release stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[1]    Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. and her
                            related companies had on 3 Dec 2007 issued a Writ of Summons in the
                            Supreme Court in Singapore against their former Area President (Asia and
                            Far East), Mr Dafni Igal. Dafni Igal is being charged together with
                            Benedict Ng and Rajathurai Suppiah, who are the Directors and
                            Shareholder [of] Starship Agencies Sdn. Bhd., the former Malaysian agent
                            of Seth Shipping.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[2]    According to the Court documents, Benedict Ng and
                            Rajathurai Suppiah are alleged to have made secret and undisclosed
                            payment of salaries and benefits, to Dafni Igal, and the secret payment
                            of salaries and benefits induced him (Dafni Igal) to breach his duties
                            as the Area President to Zim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[3]    Dafni Igal is presently the managing director of
                            CNC Line with Benedict Ng and Rajathurai Suppiah as the directors and

                            CNC Line in Malaysia.</p>

                    websites from the stated dates:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Websites were accessible by any user of the
                    Internet without charge. Further, the Press Release was also published on the
                    Asian Shipper e-News dated 24 January 2008, which was sent by email to
                    “undisclosed-recipients” (“the Email”). The Email
                    contained a list of articles, with the third item on that list being “Zim
                    Integrated Shipping issues statement to the shipping press”. The
                    “undisclosed-recipients” were the subscribers of the Asian Shipper
                    e-News newsletter. Scofield provided to the court a document setting out the
                    list of recipients (the “List of Recipients”) who received the
                    Asian Shipper e-News (including that sent on 24 January 2008 through the
                    Email) with email addresses ending with the suffix “.sg”. There
                    were 1,776 names on the List of Recipients and these recipients were in the
                    shipping industry. The relevant portion of the Email states (the
                    “Statement”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[1]    Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. and her
                            related companies had on 3 Dec 2007 issued a Writ of Summons in the
                            Supreme Court in Singapore against their former Area President (Asia
                            Pacific Region), Mr Dafni Igal. Mr Dafni is being charged
                            together with Benedict Ng and Rajathurai Suppiah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[2]    According to the Court documents, Benedict Ng and
                            Rajathurai Suppiah are alleged to have made secret and undisclosed
                            payment of salaries and benefits to Mr Dafni, and the secret
                            payment of salaries and benefits induced him (Mr Dafni) to breach
                            his duties as the Area President to Zim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[3]    Dafni Igal is presently the president and CEO of
                            CNC Line with Benedict Ng and Rajathurai Suppiah as the directors and
                            shareholders in Starship Agencies Sdn. Bhd., which is now the agent for
                            CNC Line in Malaysia,” the Zim statement concluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Statement and the Press Release are largely similar, except
                    that the Press Release describes the plaintiffs as the directors and
                    shareholders of Starship Agencies Sdn Bhd., the former Malaysian agent of Seth.
                    Scofield testified that the Press Release was published on HKSG’s websites
                    for a few days before it was taken down as it was deemed to be
                sensitive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 4 February 2008, the plaintiffs’
                    solicitors wrote to (<em>inter alios</em>) HKSG demanding
                    that the Statement be withdrawn and that an apology be posted on its websites.
                    On 5 February 2008, the plaintiffs’ solicitors also wrote to the
                    defendant’s solicitors, demanding that the defendant furnish a copy of the
                    statement that it had issued to the various international shipping press and
                    media and the names of those who received the Statement. The defendant’s
                    solicitors responded on 14 February 2008 denying liability. Not
                    surprisingly, the plaintiffs commenced this suit on 27 February
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues to be determined</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     To succeed in an action for defamation, a
                    plaintiff must show that a defendant has published, to a third person, matter
                    containing an untrue imputation against the plaintiff’s reputation
                        (<em>Gatley on Libel and Slander</em> (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 11<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2008) (“<em>Gatley on Libel</em>”) at para 1.6). The defendant here
                    did not dispute that the Statement was made in relation to the plaintiffs, but
                    argued that the defence of justification applied to some parts of the Statement
                    or Press Release. As such, the plaintiffs will have to establish that: (a) the
                    Statement was defamatory; and (b) that the Statement was published to a third
                    person. In addition, the defendant will have to establish that it was entitled
                    to rely on the defence of justification. I will turn to consider these issues
                        <em>seriatim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was the Statement defamatory?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The test for determining whether a statement
                    is defamatory is a two-stage process. First, the court will have to decide on
                    the meaning of the statement. Next, the court will have to determine whether the
                    meaning ascribed to the statement is defamatory (<em>Gatley on
                        Libel</em> at para 2.1). Turning first to consider the meaning of
                    the Statement, the plaintiffs pleaded that the ordinary and natural meaning of
                    the Statement was as follow:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiffs were being charged together with
                            Captain Dafni for committing a crime or crimes;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiffs had made secret and undisclosed

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">these secret and undisclosed payment of salaries
                            and benefits induced Captain Dafni to breach his duties as the Area
                            President of the defendant;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiffs bribed Captain Dafni (as Area

                            and/or companies;</div>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The test for determining the natural and
                    ordinary meaning of the offending words in a defamatory action is well
                    established. The court must ascertain what the words would convey to an ordinary
                    reasonable person, using his general knowledge and common sense (<em>Review Publishing Co Ltd v Lee Hsien Loong</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 52 (“<em>Review
                    Publishing</em>”) at [27]). The ordinary reasonable reader is an
                    average rational layperson who can read between the lines, read in an
                    implication more readily than a lawyer or indulge in a certain amount of loose
                    thinking, but is not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal (<em>Review Publishing</em> at [27], [30] and [31]). The natural and
                    ordinary meaning of the offending words is not confined to its strict or literal
                    meaning. It can include inferences and implications that the ordinary reasonable
                    person may draw in the light of his general knowledge, common sense and
                    experience, but will not include those based on extrinsic evidence. (<em>Review Publishing</em> at [28]-[29]) The meaning intended by
                    the defendant or actually understood by the plaintiff is irrelevant (<em>Review Publishing</em> at [27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Statement made various allegations that
                    were purportedly based on court documents that were filed. It would be apposite,
                    at this juncture, to set out the rules relating to repetition and how it affects
                    the meaning that the offending words convey. Under the repetition rule, where
                    (for example) A writes “I am told by B that C has stolen funds”, A
                    will be treated as if he has alleged that C has stolen funds: see <em>Duncan and Neill on Defamation</em> (LexisNexis,
                        3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2009) at para 5.16. As Lord Devlin
                    observed in <em>Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph
                        Ltd</em> [1964] AC 234 (“<em>Rubber
                        Improvement</em>”) (at p 284):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[One] cannot escape liability for defamation by putting the libel behind a
                        prefix such as "I have been told that ..." or "It is rumoured that ...", and
                        then asserting that it was true that you had been told or that it was in
                        fact being rumoured. You have … "to prove that the subject-matter of
                        the rumour was true." But this is not a case of repetition or rumour. I
                        agree with the distinction drawn by Horridge J. on this point, though
                        not necessarily with his limited view of the effect of the libel in that
                        case. Anyway, even if this is to be treated as a rumour case, it is still
                        necessary to find out what the rumour is. A rumour that a man is suspected
                        of fraud is different from one that he is guilty of it. <em>For the purpose of the law of libel a hearsay statement is the same as
                            a direct statement, and that is all there is to it</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The repetition rule is grounded in policy and
                    it recognises that the repetition of another’s libellous statement is
                    “just as bad as making the statement directly”: see <em>Rubber Improvement</em> at p 260 (per Lord Reid). In
                        <em>Shah v Standard Chartered Bank</em>
                    [1999] QB 241 (“<em>Shah</em>”),
                    Hirst LJ observed that the repetition rule (at p 263):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">reflects a fundamental canon of legal policy in the law of defamation
                        dating back nearly 170 years, that words must be interpreted, and the
                        imputations they contain justified, by reference to the underlying
                        allegations of fact and not merely by reliance upon some second-hand report
                        or assertion of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     However, a defendant’s obligation to
                    prove the truth of a report or rumour will depend on the meaning that is
                    conveyed by the report or rumour: see Lord Devlin’s observations in
                        <em>Rubber Improvement</em> (above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>) and <em>Duncan and Neill on
                        Defamation</em> at para 12.41. The meaning that the court
                    determines of the offending material will be of especial relevance towards the
                    defence of justification, which I will turn to consider in greater detail below.
                    In <em>Chase v News Group Newspapers</em>
                    [2003] EMLR 218 (“<em>Chase</em>”),
                    Brooke LJ outlined the three possible levels of involvement that could
                    arise in every particular case in the following manner (at [45]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The sting of a libel may be capable of meaning that a claimant has in fact
                            <b><em>committed</em></b> some serious act, such as
                        murder. Alternatively, it may be suggested that the words mean that there
                        are <b><em>reasonable grounds to suspect</em></b> that he/she
                        has committed such an act. A third possibility is that they may mean that
                        there are <b><em>grounds for investigating</em></b> whether
                        he/she has been responsible for such an act. [Emphasis added in bold
                        italics.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The courts have since labelled these three
                    possible meanings, as highlighted above (in bold italics), as being the
                        “<em>Chase</em> Level One meaning” (i.e.,
                    the imputation of guilt), “<em>Chase</em> Level Two
                    meaning” (i.e., that there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that
                    the act was committed) and “<em>Chase</em> Level
                    Three meaning” (i.e., that there were grounds for inquiring into whether
                    the acts were committed). All three levels are generally regarded as being
                    defamatory, though in varying degrees (see <em>Gatley on
                        Libel</em> at para 3.27). These <em>Chase</em> categories are simply convenient labels and the court does
                    not necessarily have to pigeonhole the offending material within one of the
                    three <em>Chase</em> levels: see <em>Curistan v Times Newspapers Ltd</em> [2008] 1 WLR 126 at
                    [10].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is clear, from the plaintiffs’
                    pleaded case as to the meaning of the Statement, that there are two factual
                    components to the Statement. The first generally relates to the bribes allegedly
                    given by the plaintiffs to Captain Dafni as Area President of the defendant. The
                    second generally relates to the bribes allegedly given to Captain Dafni as
                    President and CEO of CNC Lines. For each component, the question arises as to
                    what the ordinary reasonable reader would read the Statement as
                imputing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defendant did not deny, in its pleadings,
                    that the Statement was capable of conveying the meaning that the plaintiffs had
                    made secret payments to induce Captain Dafni to breach his duties as the
                    defendant’s Area President and that such secret payments constituted
                    bribes by the plaintiffs to corruptly procure favours from Captain Dafni. In my
                    view, such a meaning is plainly made out. The second paragraph of the Statement
                    plainly alleged that the plaintiffs had made such secret payments to induce
                    Captain Dafni to breach his duties as the Area President of the defendant. The
                    sting of the Statement was that the plaintiffs had bribed Captain Dafni to
                    procure benefits for their benefit. The more difficult issue is the level of
                    imputation made under the Statement. Drawing from the <em>Chase</em> meanings, did the Statement convey the meaning that the
                    plaintiffs were guilty of bribing Captain Dafni, that there were reasonable
                    grounds to suspect that such bribes had been given, or simply that there were
                    grounds for investigating whether such an act had been committed?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The difficulty that arises here is through the
                    use of the qualifying words such as “charged”, “Writ of
                    Summons” and “alleged” in the first two paragraphs of the
                    Statement. The defendant highlighted that in <em>Stern v
                        Piper</em> [1996] 3 QB 123, Hirst LJ had made the
                    following comments with respect to a statement concerning the commencement of a
                    writ (at p 134):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Cadam v. Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd. [1959] 1 Q.B. 413 and Waters v.
                        Sunday Pictorial Newspapers Ltd. [1961] 1 W.L.R. 967 are both decisions of
                        this court, and the former to my mind does not create any difficulty, since
                        I think it is acceptable that a statement that a writ or equivalent civil
                        proceeding has been issued (or for that matter that an indictment or similar
                        criminal proceeding has been laid) may be capable of conveying no more than
                        the fact that the relevant proceedings have in fact been launched; moreover,
                        and most important, there is no hearsay problem.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Waters's case presents more difficulty, since there was a hearsay problem,
                        and I think that case can only be explained, as Mr. Price suggested, on
                        the basis that the statements reported were judicial pronouncements made in
                        open court, and therefore fell into a special category. But I for my part
                        regard Waters v. Sunday Pictorial Newspapers Ltd. as on the outer fringe of
                        this class of case, and consider it should not be followed save on similar
                        facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In <em>Cadam v Beaverbrook
                        Newspapers Ltd</em> [1959] 1 QB 413 (“<em>Cadam</em>”), the defendant there had published the
                    following words in its newspaper (at pp 414-415):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">ZENA DANIELS GETS A WRIT. Mr. Percy Oakley, 67-year-old former
                        company director, of Sutton Coldfield, said last night that his solicitor
                        had issued a writ claiming £350,000 damages for alleged conspiracy to
                        deprive him of his interests in certain limited companies. He named
                        Miss Zena Daniels, the racehorse owner and company director; her
                        father, Mr David Daniels [other names removed]. Mr Oakley said:
                        ‘A writ has been issued, and I have been told by my solicitor that it
                        has been served. The companies were: [there followed a list of four
                        companies with their addresses]. I was originally managing director of those
                        four companies. Mr Daniels and Miss Daniels took over by
                        arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The newspaper sought leave to amend its pleadings to include
                    particulars of justification that Mr Oakley did issue such a writ claiming
                    damages for conspiracy to defraud. Cadam (the plaintiff in the action) objected
                    on the basis of the repetition rule. The court, without making any determination
                    on the merits, granted leave for the defendant there to amend its
                    defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Similarly, in <em>Shah</em>, the UK Court of Appeal was concerned with various
                    publications in which numerous qualifying words were used. Hirst LJ opined
                    as follows (at p 257):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Coming now to Mr. Rampton’s meanings of no more than reasonable
                        suspicion, his argument of course rests principally on the context in each
                        of the publications, and in particular, the omitted words with their
                        frequent use of qualifying words such as “alleged,”
                        “suggested,” “apparently,” “said to
                        be,” and the like, coupled with the reservations sometimes expressed,
                        such as the statement in the last paragraph of the report that inquiries
                        have so far failed to substantiate that Suresh Shah is the frontman for
                        Dalal. I do not propose to go through these in detail; suffice it to say
                        that I have come to the conclusion that in the case of each of the
                        publications these miscellaneous qualifying words and reservations do render
                        each set of the words complained of capable of bearing a meaning of no more
                        than reasonable suspicion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In light of the qualifying words used in the
                    Statement, I am of the view that the Statement is not capable of conveying the
                    meaning that the plaintiffs were <em>guilty</em> of bribing
                    Captain Dafni. However, the Statement is, in my judgment, capable of conveying a
                        <em>Chase</em> Level 2 meaning, that there were grounds
                    to suspect that the plaintiffs had bribed Captain Dafni to procure favours,
                    despite the presence of the qualifying words. The use of the word
                    “charged” in the opening paragraph of the Statement conveys, to
                    the ordinary reasonable reader, the meaning that criminal proceedings had been
                    initiated against the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that the word
                    “charge” is used in s 8 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75,
                    1985 Rev Ed) to mean “allegation” and that the court should
                    therefore adopt the same definition in considering the Statement. I do not place
                    any weight on the meaning of “charge” as used under the Defamation
                    Act as its legal meaning would unlikely be known to the ordinary reasonable
                    reader. An ordinary reasonable reader would, through his general knowledge or
                    experience, know that criminal proceedings are initiated against a person only
                    where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the person had committed the
                    offence in question. As a consequence of using the word “charged”,
                    I am unable to interpret the Statement as merely conveying the fact that
                    proceedings have been launched and <em>Cadam</em> is
                    therefore distinguishable. As a result, I find that the Statement conveys, to
                    the ordinary reasonable reader, the meaning that there were reasonable grounds
                    to suspect that the plaintiffs had bribed Captain Dafni to corruptly procure
                    favours from the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I now turn to consider the third paragraph of
                    the Statement. The defendant denied that it bore the defamatory meaning that the
                    plaintiffs had pleaded, <em>viz</em>, that Starship
                    Agencies came to be appointed as agent for CNC Line in Malaysia as a result of
                    bribes given by the plaintiffs to Captain Dafni. The defendant advocated for a
                    factual interpretation of the third paragraph of the Statement and argued that
                    the ordinary reasonable reader would not infer misconduct by association. If a
                    strict and literal reading of the third paragraph of the Statement is adopted,
                    it would arguably not be defamatory as it states, factually, the links that
                    existed between Captain Dafni and the plaintiffs through their respective
                    companies. However, the law does not confine the ordinary and natural meaning of
                    the Statement to its literal meaning and allows for inferences or implications
                    to be drawn: see above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> and <em>Goh Chok Tong v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin</em> [1998]
                    2 SLR(R) 971 at [24]. Further, I am mindful of the need to read and
                    consider the Statement as a whole. I accept that there was nothing in the
                    Statement which suggested or implied that the plaintiffs had, in fact, given
                    bribes to Captain Dafni so that the latter would appoint Starship Agencies the
                    agent for CNC Lines in Malaysia. To that end, I do not think that the Statement
                    conveys the meaning that the plaintiffs were guilty in that respect. However,
                    the Statement was arranged such that the above-mentioned links between Starship
                    Agencies (being the plaintiffs’ company) and CNC Lines (being Captain
                    Dafni’s employer) were highlighted immediately <em>after</em> allegations that the plaintiffs had bribed Captain Dafni
                    whilst he was with his previous company, were made. To my mind, the sting of the
                    Statement was that there were reasonable grounds to suspect that this agency
                    relationship had been procured through bribes given by the plaintiffs to Captain
                    Dafni.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Having decided on what the natural and
                    ordinary meaning of the Statement is, it remains for me to decide whether the
                    Statement was defamatory. A statement is considered to be defamatory if it would
                    “tend to lower the [plaintiffs] in the estimation of right-thinking
                    members of society generally” (<em>Sim v
                        Stretch</em> (1936) 52 TLR 669 at p 671, cited with approval by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>Aaron Anne Joseph and Ors v Cheong Yip
                        Seng and Ors</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 258 at [51]). In my view,
                    given the meanings that the Statement convey, it cannot be disputed that the
                    Statement is defamatory. The defendant had made very serious allegations that
                    there were reasonable grounds to suspect that the plaintiffs were involved in
                    acts of corruption and bribery, and it is difficult to see how the Statement
                    would not have adversely affected the plaintiffs’ reputation. I therefore
                    find that the plaintiffs have succeeded in proving that the Statement was
                    defamatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Was the Statement published?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As a general principle, publication takes
                    place where the defamatory material is published by the defendant and <em>communicated to a third party</em> (other than the claimant).
                    At law, publication to even one person will suffice to make out a finding of
                    liability, with the scale of publication affecting, instead, the quantum of
                    damages: see <em>Gatley on Libel</em> at para 6.1
                    (citing <em>Capital and Counties Bank v Henty</em> (1882)
                    7 AC 741 at p 765). Whether this principle is subject to the
                    doctrine of abuse of process is something that I need not consider in the light
                    of my findings below. For materials that are made available on the Internet,
                    publication takes place when the material is downloaded and accessed by the end
                    user: see <em>Dow Jones and Company Inc v Gutnick</em> 210
                    CLR 575 at [44] and <em>Godfrey v Demon Internet Ltd</em>
                    [2001] QB 201 at pp 208-209. The plaintiffs will therefore have to
                    show that the Statement was downloaded and accessed in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Despite the ubiquity and broad reach of the
                    Internet, the law continues to require a plaintiff to show that publication has
                    taken place within a jurisdiction. The law does not recognise that there is a
                    rebuttable presumption of law that substantial publication takes place within a
                    jurisdiction simply because the material is placed on an Internet website that
                    is generally accessible: see <em>Al Amoudi v Bisard</em>
                    [2007] 1 WLR 113 (“<em>Al
                    Amoudi</em>”) at [32] and [37]. However, the court can <em>infer</em> that substantial publication within the
                    jurisdiction has taken place (<em>Al Amoudi</em> at [33]).
                    In the book by M Collins, <em>The Law of Defamation and the
                        Internet</em> (Oxford University Press, 2005) (“<em>Collins</em>”), the learned author succinctly
                    summarised the law on the circumstances in which the court could infer
                    substantial publication for materials that are made available on the Internet,
                    as follow (at para 5.04):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Proof that Internet communications have been published is therefore not
                        usually a difficult task. Every e-mail message which has been received and
                        seen by a recipient, other than the person defamed, who is capable of
                        understanding it, has been published. So too has every message posted on a
                        bulletin board and every web page which is accessible to computer users, if
                        it can be proved that any third person capable of understanding it has
                        displayed and seen the message or web page on a computer screen. The
                        claimant bears the burden of proof. <b><em>That burden will
                            generally be discharged by proving that at least one other person, other
                            than the claimant, saw, read, or heard the communication. In the case of
                            generally accessible web pages and bulletin boards with many
                            subscribers, it may be inferred that publication has
                        occurred</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where, however, an email message has not been read by any person other
                        than its author and the defamed person, or a web page, although technically
                        accessible, has not been visited by any person other than its author and its
                        defamed person, then publication will not have occurred… [Emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the present case, there are two ways
                    through which the Statement could possibly be published: through the Websites
                    and/or the Email.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Publication through the Websites</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiffs highlighted that it was
                    unchallenged evidence that the Press Release had been published on the Websites
                    which were available to any user of the Internet, and that these publications
                    had a far-reaching and worldwide scope of exposure. They argued that an
                    inference ought to be drawn that publication had taken place through the
                    Websites, relying on <em>John Roger Steinberg v Pritchard
                        Englefield (a firm)</em> [2005] EWCA Civ 288 (“<em>Steinberg</em>”) and <em>Gregg v
                        O’Gara</em> [2008] EWHC 658 (“<em>Gregg</em>”) in support. This was especially since Hoffman
                    himself gave evidence that the Press Release was available on the Internet and
                    that the Press Release could be found by doing a search on the plaintiffs’
                    names through a search engine. In response, the defendant highlighted that the
                    plaintiffs did not provide any evidence that publication had taken place through
                    the Websites in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     I do not find that the Press Release had been
                    substantially published through the Websites in Singapore. None of the
                    plaintiffs’ witnesses gave evidence that they had accessed those websites
                    in Singapore during the material time. As a result, there is no direct evidence
                    of substantial publication in Singapore. Neither do I draw an inference that
                    such publication had taken place in Singapore. The law appears to permit the
                    court to draw an inference of publication even in the absence of any direct
                    evidence (see <em>Collins</em>, above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>). Indeed, this appeared to be the case in
                        <em>Steinberg</em>, where the UK Court of Appeal upheld
                    the finding of publication, taking the view that the inference of publication
                    was irresistible even in the (apparent) absence of direct evidence.
                    Sedley LJ opined as follow (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have therefore looked again at the factual basis of the claim upon which
                        summary judgment was given. It was a long way from the situation found in
                            [<em>Jameel v Dow Jones &amp; Co Incorporated</em>
                        [2005] EWCA 75]. The copy letter from Mr Steinberg to Pritchard
                        Englefield, suggesting in no uncertain terms that the latter artificially
                        and unprofessionally inflated their solicitor and own client costs, was
                        accessible to anyone, including in particular a potential client, who fed
                        the claimant’s name into a standard search engine. It was also
                        readable by anyone who accessed the defendant’s own professional
                        website. The inference of substantial publication was, it seems to me,
                        irresistible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     However, I do not think that an inference
                    ought to be drawn in the present case for the following reasons:
                    Scofield’s evidence was that the Shipping Gazette Website was designed for
                    subscribers in China and Hong Kong while the Asian Shipper Website was designed
                    for Singapore and Malaysia subscribers. There was no evidence as to the number
                    of Singapore-based subscribers for the Asian Shipper Website and its general
                    viewership. As such, I do not think it would be safe to infer that the Press
                    Release was published in Singapore through the Websites, as it would be
                    tantamount to recognising a rebuttable presumption of publication (which, as I
                    have already held, is not the case). I accept that Hoffman gave evidence that
                    the Press Release could be found on the Internet by using both the
                    plaintiffs’ names as one search term. The plaintiffs further provided
                    evidence that conducting a search using the search term “dafni, benedict
                    ng, rajathurai suppiah” would reveal the Press Release on two major
                    search engines. I think that it would be highly unusual for any person to
                    conduct a search by combining two or three names in the search field and, as
                    such, I do not believe that such a fact warrants the inference that substantial
                    publication had taken place in Singapore on the peculiar facts of this case.
                    Neither does <em>Gregg</em> assist the plaintiffs’
                    case in this respect. The court there opined that the jury would draw an
                    irresistible inference of substantial publication as there were witnesses who
                    had accessed the defendant’s website in the jurisdiction and a search of
                    the subject-matter of the defamatory material (viz, the “Yorkshire
                    Ripper”) would result in the defendant’s website being the first to
                    appear amongst the list of results (<em>Gregg</em> at
                    [51]). There is no such evidence here. I therefore find that there is
                    insufficient evidence to support the finding or inference of substantial
                    publication of the Press Release through the Websites, in
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there publication through the Email?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     I now turn to consider whether publication had
                    taken place, in Singapore, through dissemination of the Email. The plaintiffs
                    relied on the evidence of Alain and one K. Cthembram (“Citi”), who
                    was the Sales Manager at Forte Global Services Pte Ltd. Both Alain and Citi
                    deposed that they received the Email containing the Statement. In addition, the
                    plaintiffs sought to rely on the List of Recipients to establish that the Email
                    had been sent to at least 1,776 persons in Singapore. The defendant argued that
                    Alain’s evidence was not relevant as he was a manager with Charter
                    Shipping Agencies (of which Benedict was and Suppiah used to be a shareholder at
                    the material time). Neither was the List of Recipients admissible as the
                    plaintiffs had not complied with s 35(1)(b) or s 35(1)(c) of the
                    Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (the “EA”) by providing a
                    certificate of the person responsible for the operation or management of the
                    computer. The plaintiffs, in response, argued that the List of Recipients was
                    not a computer output under the meaning of the EA. Even if it was computer
                    output, the plaintiffs contended that the list satisfied the conditions required
                    under s 35(1)(c) of the EA and was therefore admissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Section 35(1)(c) of the EA states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

                                the accuracy of the output was not affected by such
                                circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In turn, s 3 of the EA defines
                    “computer output” as:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… a statement or representation (whether in audio,
                        visual, graphical, multi-media, printed, pictorial, written or any other

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) produced by a computer; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) accurately translated from a statement or representation so
                            produced;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The List of Recipients comes in the form of a
                    spreadsheet, with headings of “S/No”, “Company
                    Name”, “Recipient Name” and “Email
                    Addresses”. According to Scofield, companies or persons who wished to
                    receive shipping news from ASPL would have to fill up a registration form on its
                    website by providing their names, company names and email addresses. The
                    plaintiffs argued that the List of Recipients was not “computer
                    output” as it was a statement produced by a person, with the aid of a
                    computer, to answer Interrogatories that were ordered by the Court. They
                    contended that the list would have been admissible if Scofield had chosen to
                    write it by hand instead. However, Scofield did not give evidence as to how the
                    List of Recipients spreadsheet was created. Given the large number of addressees
                    on the list, together with the various inconsistencies throughout the list
                        (<em>e.g</em>., some names were entirely capitalised
                    while others were entirely in small letters), it seemed more likely than not to
                    me that the List of Recipients was produced or generated by the computer
                    instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I will therefore proceed to consider whether
                    the List of Recipients is admissible under s 35(1)(c) of the EA.
                    Section 35(1)(c) of the EA is in <em>pari materia</em>
                    with s 69(1) of the UK Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE
                    Act”), which has since been repealed in the UK. There is no dispute that
                    the List of Recipients is relevant. I will first deal with the defendant’s
                    suggestion that s 35(1)(c) of the EA could only be satisfied by producing a
                    certificate from the person responsible for the operation or management of the
                    computer, as is permitted under s 35(6) of the EA. However, nothing in
                    s 35 of the EA states or suggests that the production of the certificate is
                    a mandatory condition: see <em>Lim Mong Hong v PP</em>
                    [2003] 3 SLR(R) 88 at [41] and <em>R v
                        Shepherd</em> [1993] AC 380 (“<em>Shephard</em>”) at pp 386-387. Even if so, it is clear that
                    the witness called to verify the reliability and accuracy of the computer will
                    have to be someone fairly familiar with its operations. In <em>Shephard</em>, the House of Lords considered whether it was necessary
                    for a person with responsibility for the operation of the computer to give
                    evidence as to its reliability, under s 69(1) of the PACE Act. The House of
                    Lords took the view that such a requirement was unnecessary. Lord Griffiths,
                    delivering the judgment of the court, held as follows (at p 387):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Documents produced by computers are an increasingly common feature of all
                        business and more and more people are becoming familiar with their uses and
                        operation. Computers vary immensely in their complexity and in the
                        operations they perform. The nature of the evidence to discharge the burden
                        of showing that there has been no improper use of the computer and that it
                        was operating properly will inevitably vary from case to case. The evidence
                        must be tailored to suit the needs of the case<b><em>. I
                            suspect that it will very rarely be necessary to call an expert and that
                            in the vast majority of cases it will be possible to discharge the
                            burden by calling a witness who is familiar with the operation of the
                            computer in the sense of knowing what the computer is required to do and
                            who can say that it is doing it properly</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The computer in this case was of the simplest kind printing limited basic
                        information on each till roll. The store detective was able to describe how
                        the tills operated, what the computer did, that there had been no trouble
                        with the computer and how she had also examined all the till rolls which
                        showed no evidence of malfunction either by the tills or the central
                        computer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In these circumstances I agree with the Court of Appeal … that she
                        was fully qualified to give the evidence required by section 69 and that in
                        the light of her evidence the till rolls were properly admitted as part of
                        the prosecution case.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The view espoused by Lord Griffiths in
                        <em>Shephard</em> applies with equal force here. The
                    computer in use here would only have to collate information typed in by a
                    subscriber and would not be complex in nature. I am of the view that Scofield
                    satisfies the requirement of being someone familiar with the operations of the
                    computer. Scofield was able to describe how the entire subscription process took
                    place and gave unchallenged evidence that the appropriate procedure for
                    inserting the Statement into the e-news bulletin had been followed. I therefore
                    find that Scofield was qualified to give evidence on the computer’s
                    reliability and accuracy under s 35(1)(c) of the EA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiffs on their part needed to satisfy
                    three requirements under s 35(1)(c) of the EA, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     there was no reasonable ground for
                        believing that the output is inaccurate because of improper use of the
                        computer;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     no
                        reason existed to doubt or suspect the truth or reliability of the output;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     there was
                        reasonable ground to believe that the computer was operating properly at all
                        material times.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The plaintiffs suggested that a presumption of
                    regularity applied to the List of Recipients, citing <em>R v

                    in relation to s 69(1) of the PACE Act, that (at p 306):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr. Ross-Munro had a subsidiary argument in relation to computer

                        up his employment. Nor had the deponent stated the source of his information
                        and belief. There is nothing in either of these points. <b><em>Where a lengthy computer printout contains no internal evidence of
                            malfunction, and is retained, e.g. by a bank or a stockbroker as part of

                            the record was functioning correctly</em></b>. [Emphasis added in bold
                        italics.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Further, the plaintiffs cited the decision of
                        <em>R v Blackburn</em> (The Times, 1 December 1992),
                    where Henry J held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As will be apparent, there was nothing on the face of these invoices to
                        throw any doubt on the accuracy of the serial numbers set out thereon, nor
                        had the appellants any grounds, reasonable or otherwise, which they were
                        able to put forward to suggest that there had been some computer
                        malfunction. The trial judge in the event correctly held that the
                        prosecution had discharged the initial evidential burden put on them under
                        section 69(1) of the Act by the presumption of regularity: see The Governor
                        of Pentonville Prison ex parte Osman 90 Cr App Rep 281, and by the more
                        recent decision of another court in this division, R v Shephard 93 Cr App
                        Rep 139 [not to be confused with the House of Lords’ decision in
                            <em>Shephard</em>].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     However, the notion of the presumption of
                    regularity was rejected by the House of Lords in <em>Shephard</em>. Lord Griffith explained (at p 384):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The object of section 69 of the Act is clear enough.
                            <em>It requires anyone who wishes to introduce computer
                            evidence to produce evidence that will establish that it is safe to rely
                            on the documents produced by the computer</em>. This is an
                        affirmative duty emphatically stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">"a statement in a document produced by a computer shall not be
                            admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein unless it is shown."
                            (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Such a duty cannot be discharged without evidence by the application of
                        the presumption that the computer is working correctly expressed in the
                        maxim omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta as appears to be suggested in some
                        of the cases. Nor does it make any difference whether the computer document
                        has been produced with or without the input of information provided by the
                        human mind and thus may or may not be hearsay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Be that as it may, while the plaintiffs will
                    have to provide evidence as to the reliability and accuracy of the List of
                    Recipients, the burden imposed on them may not always be an onerous one. Much
                    will have to depend on the facts of the case and the nature and complexity of
                    the computer system involved: see <em>Shephard</em> at
                    p 387 (cited above at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a>). In
                    addition, the first two requirements as listed above at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> (<em>i.e</em>., those required under
                    s 35(1)(c)(i) of the EA) were deliberately phrased in the negative to
                    facilitate proof: see the Explanatory Statement to the Evidence (Amendment) Bill
                    (Bill No 45 of 1995).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     I have already found that the computer system
                    in place here was not complex in nature. Scofield gave evidence that he had no
                    knowledge that the proper procedure for releasing such a press release through
                    the e-mail bulletin had not been followed, and that he believed those on the
                    List of Recipients would have received the Email. As such, there was no
                    reasonable ground for me to believe that the output was inaccurate due to
                    improper use of the computer. As for the truth or reliability of the output, the
                    Email was successfully sent to Alain and his name was on the List of Recipients.
                    I do not accept the defendant’s contention that Alain’s evidence
                    should be disregarded simply because he was an employee in one of
                    Benedict’s companies. It bears noting that Alain attended court on a
                    subpoena issued by the plaintiffs, not voluntarily.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The case of <em>Jameel v Dow
                        Jones &amp; Co</em> [2005] QB 946 (“<em>Jameel</em>”) does not assist the defendant’s
                    case in this respect. The fact that persons in the plaintiff’s camp in
                        <em>Jameel</em> had accessed the defamatory material
                    knowing what they would find on it appeared to go towards the issue of damages
                    rather than publication (<em>Jameel</em> at [68]). In
                    certain instances, it may be the case that internal circulation of documents
                    does not constitute publication where such acts are considered acts of the
                    companies (see <em>Gatley on Libel</em> at para 6.9),
                    but this does not apply in the present case. There was also no evidence of any
                    complaint or feedback to ASPL that any of the subscribers, for one reason or
                    another, did not receive the Asian Shipper e-News publication on 24 January
                    2008. Neither was there any evidence that the computer had malfunctioned.
                    Instead, Scofield’s evidence was that he had no knowledge that it had not
                    been sent to the List of Recipients. I am satisfied, taking the evidence as a
                    whole, that there was no reason to doubt the truth or reliability of the
                    computer output and that there was reasonable ground to believe that the
                    computer was operating properly at all material times. I will therefore admit
                    the List of Recipients as evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     With the List of Recipients, I hold that the
                    plaintiffs have established that there was substantial publication of the
                    Statement within Singapore. I note that Scofield could not positively aver that
                    every person on the List of Recipients had downloaded and accessed the Email in
                    Singapore. However, given the large number of persons and email addresses on the
                    List of Recipients, it seems more likely than not that a not insubstantial
                    number of persons would have downloaded and read the Email in Singapore. In
                    addition, Citi (whose name was not even on the List of Recipients) and Alain
                    testified they had downloaded and accessed the Email in Singapore. As such, I
                    would infer that substantial publication of the Statement had taken place in
                    Singapore through dissemination of the Email, applying the test suggested by
                        <em>Collins</em> (as quoted above at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defence of justification</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The defendant sought to rely on the defence of
                    justification in relation to the plaintiffs’ pleaded case that the
                    Statement meant that they (the plaintiffs) had made secret payments to induce
                    Captain Dafni to breach his duties as its Area President, and that such secret
                    payment constituted bribes by the plaintiffs to corruptly procure favours from
                    Captain Dafni (see [12(b)] to [12(e)] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The defence of justification requires a
                    defendant to justify the imputation contained in the words and not the literal
                    truth of the words: <em>Gatley on Libel</em> at
                    para 11.8 and <em>Chase</em> at [35]. In the light of
                    my findings above, I need to consider whether the imputation that there was
                        <em>reason to suspect</em> that the plaintiffs had made
                    secret payments to induce Captain Dafni to breach his duties, and that such
                    payments constituted bribes to corruptly procure favours from Captain Dafni, was
                    justified. The law requires a defendant to prove that the “main charge or
                    gist of the libel” is true and a slight inaccuracy will not prevent a
                    defendant from succeeding in his defence: <em>Chase</em> at
                    [34] and <em>Gatley on Libel</em> at para 11.10.
                    Furthermore, as the court in <em>Chase</em> observed (at
                    [35]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities, the more
                        improbable an allegation the stronger must be the evidence that it did occur
                        before, on the balance of probabilities, its occurrence will be
                        established.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Although I dismissed all of the
                    defendant’s claims in Suit 755, in the light of my finding on the meaning
                    of the Statement, it is theoretically possible for the defendant to succeed in
                    its defence of justification here. The defendant can rely on strong
                    circumstantial evidence implicating the claimant that might objectively amount
                    to reasonable grounds for suspicion: see <em>Chase</em> at
                    [51]. However, the defendant cannot rely on facts arising after the publication
                    to establish the existence of reasonable grounds, though it can rely on facts
                    subsisting at the time of publication, even if he was unaware of them at that
                    time: <em>Masa King v Telegraph Group Ltd</em>
                    [2004] EMLR 23 at [22] and <em>Chase</em> at
                    [52].</p>

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Captain Dafni was induced by the plaintiffs to
                            commit the above breaches. Benedict gave evidence that he needed Captain
                            Dafni’s contacts and expertise, and further, knew that Captain
                            Dafni was being employed by GSL and/or the defendant. The plaintiffs
                            wanted to take advantage of Captain Dafni’s position and contacts
                            and thereby continued to induce him to commit the above breaches of
                            duties to GSL and the defendant;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Bribe(s) were given, as secret payments had been
                            made to induce Captain Dafni to act in the plaintiffs’
                            favour.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Under s 8 of the Defamation Act, where
                    there are two distinct charges made against the plaintiff, the defence of
                    justification shall not fail because the truth of every charge is not proved, if
                    the words not proved to be true do not materially injure the plaintiff’s
                    reputation. Since the sting of the Statement was that the plaintiffs had bribed
                    Captain Dafni to breach the duties he owed, it was necessary for the defendant
                    to prove the truth of such matters only.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     While a Writ of Summons was, in fact, issued
                    against the plaintiffs in Suit 755, given my earlier finding that the sting of
                    the Statement was that there were <em>grounds to
                        suspect</em> that the plaintiffs had committed those alleged acts,
                    this fact is not relevant towards the defence of justification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     I accept that payments were indeed made by
                    Charter Shipping Agencies to Captain Dafni, and that there were documents which
                    stated that Captain Dafni had drawn a salary from the company. However, I also
                    accept that Captain Dafni had informed Mr Strammer (former Vice-President
                    of the defendant in Israel) about his employment with Charter Shipping and that
                    Mr Strammer had consented to the same (see the <em>Suit
                        755Judgment</em> at [69]). Therefore, it did not lie in the
                    defendant’s mouth to now allege that Captain Dafni was in breach of his
                    duties by becoming an employee of Charter Shipping Agencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Further, Captain Dafni started receiving
                    payments from Charter Shipping Agencies from March 2003 onwards. The plaintiffs
                    rightly pointed out that some of the alleged breaches of duties took place
                    before that. In respect of the allegation that the Rebates and Waivers were
                    known to Captain Dafni but was not disclosed to the defendant, the evidence that
                    the defendant relied on were the letters sent between 1999 and 2001. Similarly,
                    for the allegedly inflated trucking and depot charges, the defendant’s
                    claim was that such charges were inflated from 2002 onwards. Both alleged
                    breaches of duties pre-dated the alleged secret payments. In the circumstances,
                    it is difficult to see how the defendant can say that the payments induced the
                    breach of duties, or that the payments were bribes to procure such
                    favours.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Furthermore, the evidence which the defendant
                    relied on to substantiate its claim that breaches of duties had taken place did
                    not, in my view, amount to reasonable grounds to suspect that the plaintiffs had
                    committed such acts. In respect of the Rebates and Waivers, there was no
                    evidence that the letters sent in 1999 were known to Captain Dafni or binding on
                    the parties involved (see the <em>Suit 755
                        Judgment</em> at [39]-[40]). The letter from Westports dated 30 April
                    2007 also did not assist the defendant’s case for reasons already
                    explained (see the <em>Suit 755 Judgment</em> at
                    [42]). Furthermore, the new rates in 2001 were made known to the defendant by
                    Captain Dafni (see the <em>Suit 755 Judgment</em> at [44]).
                    Hoffman himself admitted that he did not know whether Captain Dafni had known
                    about the Rebates and Waivers and allowed Starship Agencies to keep them. The
                    documentation relied on by the defendant to purportedly show that the Rebates
                    and Waivers had been paid over to the plaintiffs’ company (Starship
                    Agencies) was not reliable for reasons explained in the <em>Suit
                        755 Judgment</em> (at [46]-[49]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In respect of the trucking and depot charges
                    that were allegedly inflated, the evidence which the defendant relied on did not
                    show what the prevailing market rates were at the material time (<em>Suit 755 Judgment</em> at [52]). There was also no proof that
                    the defendant could obtain substantially lower rates thereafter. For the above
                    reasons, it is difficult to see how there were reasonable grounds to suspect
                    that Captain Dafni was in breach of his duties to Zim, let alone to suspect that
                    the undisclosed payments or bribes had induced Captain Dafni to breach his
                    duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As for the payment to Maxwin, the defendant
                    did not have any evidence to show how this payment was linked to any alleged
                    breaches of duties (see the <em>Suit 755Judgment</em> at
                    [75]). Neither did the payment to Maxwin involve Suppiah. In a similar vein, the
                    payment to Maxwin took place in 2005 and it is difficult to see how it could
                    cause or was related to any of the alleged breaches of duties by Captain Dafni.
                    As a result, I do not see how the defendant can use the payment to Maxwin to
                    support its defence of justification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     To summarise, in my view, the defendant did
                    not have any evidence that the payments that Captain Dafni received (or
                    allegedly received) from the plaintiffs had induced, or was for the purpose of
                    inducing him to breach his duties owed to the defendant or to corruptly procure
                    favours from him. The fact that Captain Dafni might have received payments from
                    the plaintiffs or their companies could not, each on its own, give rise to any
                    reasonable suspicion that the plaintiffs had bribed Captain Dafni to procure
                    favours. Neither did I, for the same reasons, think that there was strong
                    circumstantial evidence indicating such reasonable grounds for suspicion.
                    Consequently, I dismiss the defendant’s defence of
                justification.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In the light of my findings, the plaintiffs
                    have successfully made out its case of defamation against the defendant. I will
                    now turn to consider the damages which the plaintiffs should be entitled
                    to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The plaintiffs’ claim for damages was
                    twofold: compensatory damages and aggravated damages. To support their claim for
                    compensatory damages, the plaintiffs highlighted that they were both involved in
                    the business of various companies in various capacities. The Statement, coming
                    from the defendant (which they submitted were a large and well-known company in
                    the shipping industry) and being published on the Internet, inflicted grave
                    damage to both their reputations within the shipping industry as well as their
                    livelihood.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The defendant argued that the plaintiffs were
                    only entitled to nominal damages as they were confined to claiming damages
                    arising from publication of the Statement to Citi and those who might have read
                    the Email in Singapore only. There was no evidence of publication vis-à-vis the
                    websites in Singapore; in any case, the Statement was removed from the websites
                    within a few days. There was also no evidence that the plaintiffs or their
                    companies had suffered losses as a result of publication of the Statement.
                    Further, Suppiah had admitted during the Suit 755 trial that he was a nominee
                    director for a number of companies and did not take an active role in managing
                    companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The plaintiffs argued they were also entitled
                    to aggravated damages for three reasons. First, they submitted that the
                    defendant had acted with malice in publishing the Statement as its intention was
                    to stain the reputation of Captain Dafni and the plaintiffs, especially since
                    CNC Lines was, during the material time, a “formidable competitor”
                    of the defendant. Second, the defendant did not, at any time, apologise to the
                    plaintiffs. Third, the defendant persisted and failed in its defence of
                    justification despite the lack of evidence against the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The defendant contended that the plaintiffs
                    were not entitled to aggravated damages as it did not issue the Statement
                    maliciously to maximise damage to the plaintiffs and had merely stated the
                    matters contained in the Writ of Summons for Suit 755 and no more. The defendant
                    highlighted that the allegations raised were the result of investigations that
                    it had conducted and were not without basis. Further, the defendants claimed
                    that they released the Statement to refute rumours about GSL’s future,
                    which it thought had been started by Captain Dafni.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The purpose of compensatory damage is to
                    restore the plaintiff(s), as far as money can do so, to the position that he
                    would have been in if the tort had not been committed: see <em>Duncan and Neill on Defamation</em> at para 23.04. The three
                    factors that have to be taken into account in determining the award for damages
                    are the damage to reputation, vindication of reputation and injury to feelings:
                        <em>id</em> at para 23.07. Other factors that the
                    court may take into consideration in determining the amount of damages include
                        (<em>Gatley on Libel</em> at para 9.2):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the conduct of the claimant, his position and standing, the
                        nature of the libel, the mode and extent of publication, the absence or
                        refusal of any retraction or apology, and the conduct of the defendant from
                        the time when the libel was published down to the verdict. The conduct of
                        the claimant is relevant not only in respect of matters which go to
                        “partial justification” of the libel but also to his conduct
                        in the course of the litigation, as where he engages in an elaborate and
                        long-lasting attempt to pervert the course of justice involving making and
                        procuring false testimony and making the most damaging allegations of
                        corruption and lying against innocent third parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Aggravated damages may be awarded by the
                    court, taking the conduct of the defendant and his state of mind into account
                        (<em>Gatley on Libel</em> at para 9.14). In
                        <em>Sutcliffe v Pressdram Ltd</em> [1991]
                    1 QB 153, Nourse LJ observed (at p 184):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The conduct of a defendant which may often be regarded as aggravating the
                        injury to the plaintiff's feelings, so as to support a claim for
                        "aggravated" damages, includes a failure to make any or any sufficient
                        apology and withdrawal; a repetition of the libel; conduct calculated to
                        deter the plaintiff from proceeding; persistence, by way of a prolonged or
                        hostile cross-examination of the plaintiff or in turgid speeches to the
                        jury, in a plea of justification which is bound to fail; the general conduct
                        either of the preliminaries or of the trial itself in a manner calculated to
                        attract further wide publicity; and persecution of the plaintiff by other
                        means….</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I recognise that the gravity of the defamation
                    involved here was fairly serious as it impugned the personal integrity of the
                    plaintiffs. Hoffman admitted that publication of the Statement would have
                    adversely affected the plaintiffs’ reputation, causing the
                    plaintiffs’ potential business partners to have doubts about appointing
                    them as their agent. However, I am of the view that based on the evidence, the
                    Statement, while published substantially within Singapore, was not widely
                    disseminated. This was especially since the only evidence of publication from
                    which an inference was drawn, was through sending the Email to the 1,776
                    recipients. I accept that some may not have read the offending Statement and/or
                    did not read it in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     On the one hand, I had to take into account
                    the fact that the Email was sent to recipients who were operating in the same
                    industry as the plaintiffs (the shipping industry). On the other hand, I do not
                    think that the defendant had acted with malice in publishing the Statement.
                    Hoffman’s evidence was that the defendant had published the statement to
                    quell rumours in the market about GSL and there is nothing in the evidence which
                    suggested that the publication was made with malice. I do however, accept that
                    the lack of an apology and the failed justification defence constitute valid
                    grounds for claiming aggravated damages. Finally, I took into account the fact
                    that there was no evidence that the defendant had repeated the defamatory
                    Statement subsequently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In my view, an award of $25,000 would be
                    adequate to compensate each of the plaintiffs for the damage suffered as well as
                    to vindicate their reputations. In addition, I grant each of them $10,000 by way
                    of aggravated damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Exemplary Damages and Injunction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     For the same reasons given above, I do not
                    accept the plaintiffs’ submission that exemplary damages should be awarded
                    on the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As for the plaintiffs’ argument that an
                    injunction ought to be granted to restrain further publication by the defendant,
                    I am of the view that an injunction would not be appropriate or necessary as
                    there was no evidence to suggest that the defendant intended to repeat the
                    defamatory allegations: see <em>Duncan and Neill on
                        Defamation</em> at para 24.14.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     I therefore award judgment to each of the
                    plaintiffs in the sum of $35,000. In the light of the quantum of damages
                    awarded, I need to and will hear further arguments from the parties on a later
                    date on the issue of costs. In that regard, the parties are to write in to the
                    Registrar to fix a hearing date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Supplemental Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">10 March 2010</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Pursuant to the direction contained at
                        <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a> of the judgment dated
                    9 February 2010, counsel for the plaintiffs wrote to the Registrar to fix a
                    hearing date before me to address the issue of costs. Having heard the
                    parties’ submissions, I awarded costs to the plaintiffs on the High Court
                    scale to be taxed on a standard basis unless otherwise agreed together with
                    costs of attendance fixed at $500.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Counsel for the plaintiffs rightly pointed out
                    that this court has the discretion under s 39(4) of the Subordinate Courts
                    Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“the Sub-Courts Act”) to
                    award costs on the High Court scale notwithstanding s 39(1) of the
                    Sub-Courts Act and the fact that the plaintiffs were each awarded damages
                    totalling $35,000 only. In support of his arguments, counsel for the plaintiffs
                    referred to <em>Arul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik Victor
                        JP</em> [2000] SGHC 111 where the plaintiff was awarded
                    costs on the High Court scale even though the damages awarded arising out of
                    defamatory remarks made by the defendant there against him were $150,000. The
                    trial judge’s award of costs on the High Court scale was affirmed by the
                    Court of Appeal (see <em>Arul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik
                        Victor</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 86 at [62]). Counsel for the
                    plaintiffs also referred to the judgment of this court in <em>Premier Security Co-Operative Ltd and others v Basil Anthony
                        Herman</em> [2009] SGHC 214 (“<em>Premier</em>”) where costs on the High Court scale were
                    allowed even though the damages awarded to the three plaintiffs in their
                    defamation action totalled $150,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Another submission from counsel for the
                    plaintiffs was that unlike the aforementioned cases, there was an additional
                    factor here that justified the award of costs on the High Court scale to his
                    clients, <em>viz</em> this suit was heard by this court
                    immediately after Suit 755. He pointed out that the plaintiffs initiated
                    this suit after Suit 755 was filed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The court’s attention was then drawn by
                    counsel for the plaintiffs to an affidavit filed by Zim’s District Manager
                    Edward Collins Patrick (“Edward”) on 20 May 2009, to support
                    Zim’s application for consolidation of this action with Suit 755.
                    Edward had deposed that the factual circumstances of both suits were largely
                    identical and the evidence (both documentary as well as oral to be adduced from
                    witnesses) would be substantially the same. Edward had further deposed that both
                    suits had a common link due to the overlap of factual issues to be
                    determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Not surprisingly, counsel for Zim took a
                    contrary stand and argued that the plaintiffs should only be awarded costs on
                    the Subordinate Courts scale for three reasons, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a>a    this trial lasted barely three
                        days;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a>b    there was
                        an overlap of evidence in relation to Zim’s defence of justification.
                        Counsel drew to the court’s attention that Zim raised only this
                        defence unlike the defendant in <em>Premier</em> who
                        raised every conceivable defence possible on the defamatory statements he
                        had made, all of which failed, and the fact that the defendant there was
                        actuated by malice in making those statements;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_c"></a>c    the number of witnesses for this case was
                        substantially reduced because of the overlap with
                    Suit 755.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In reply, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed
                    out that had this suit not been heard in the High Court, trial dates would have
                    taken a considerably longer time than three days as some of the issues in
                    Suit 755 would need to be canvassed in this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I accepted the arguments of counsel for the
                    plaintiffs. I was of the view that the plaintiffs’ commencement of this
                    suit in the High Court was fully justified by Zim’s filing of
                    Suit 755. Indeed, I pointed out to both counsel that had these proceedings
                    been commenced in the Subordinate Courts, the action would very likely had been
                    transferred to the High Court to be heard with Suit 755 in any case, for
                    reasons of expediency and costs savings. It did not make sense for Suit 755
                    to be tried in the High Court and for this suit to be dealt with in the
                    Subordinate Courts when the facts of both suits were intrinsically linked and
                    overlapped to a considerable extent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Further, it did not lie in Zim’s mouth
                    to argue that the plaintiffs were only entitled to costs on the Subordinate
                    Courts scale when it was Zim that had applied to court on 20 May 2009 (in
                    Summons No. 2673 of 2009) to consolidate this suit with Suit 755,
                    alternatively, that this action be tried at the same time as Suit 755. In
                    the event, the court below ordered that trial of the present action be fixed
                    before the same trial judge as Suit 755 and that the evidence adduced in
                    Suit 755 be admitted as evidence in this action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Consequently, I allowed the plaintiffs costs
                    on the High Court scale.</p>
