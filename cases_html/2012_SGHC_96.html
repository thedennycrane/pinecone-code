<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal,
                    Magistrate’s Appeal No 279/2011 (“MA
                    279/2011”), was brought by the Prosecution against
                    the sentence meted out by the District Judge (“the
                    DJ”) in respect of a charge of negligent driving,
                    which caused the death of one Phyie Phyo Swe (“the
                    deceased”), under s 304A(b) of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”).
                    The DJ sentenced the Respondent to a fine of $6,000 and
                    disqualified him from driving all classes of vehicles for a
                    period of three years. In imposing this sentence, the DJ
                    also took into consideration a second charge under s 337(b)
                    of the Penal Code for causing hurt to Lin Nandar Han
                    (“the victim”) by doing a negligent act which
                    endangered human life. Having heard the parties on
                    7 March 2012, I allowed the Prosecution’s appeal
                    and substituted the sentence of a fine with imprisonment for
                    one week. I now give my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Respondent pleaded
                    guilty to one charge for causing death by a negligent act
                    under s 304A(b) of the Penal Code. The charge reads as
                        follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">You, … are charged that you, on the
                            26<sup>th</sup> day of March
                        2011, at about 9.59p.m., along Upper Serangoon Road,
                        Singapore, being the driver of motor car bearing
                        registration number SGA8826T, did cause the death of a
                        pedestrian, one Pyie Phyo Swe (male/ aged 31 years old),
                        by doing a <u>negligent</u> act
                        not amounting to culpable homicide, <em>to wit</em>, by failing to keep a proper
                        lookout while reversing the said motor car along Upper
                        Serangoon Road and thereby resulting in a collision with
                        the said pedestrian, who was crossing from the right to
                        left side along the said road, which resulted in the
                        death of the said pedestrian, and you have thereby
                        committed an offence punishable under Section 304A(b) of
                        the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The salient facts pertaining
                    to the commission of the offence by the Respondent are as
                    follows. On 26 March 2011, at approximately 9.59pm, the
                    Respondent was driving his motor car along Upper Serangoon
                    Road towards the direction of Serangoon Road.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> He was
                    driving along the extreme left lane of the three-lane
                    carriageway road. When the Respondent arrived at the
                    entrance of the Singapore Institute of Commerce
                    (“SIC”), he realised that the gate was
                        closed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The
                    Respondent then decided to reverse his vehicle far enough so
                    as to turn left into Lorong Batawi which had an alternative
                    entrance (through a side gate) to the SIC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The
                    Respondent, in order to take advantage of the lull in the
                    traffic flow at that very moment, quickly reversed so as not
                    to cause any obstruction to oncoming vehicles at the
                        rear.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In
                    the course of speedily reversing his vehicle, the Respondent
                    did check his rear view mirror and turn his head back
                    (towards the left).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>
                    However, he failed to look at his speedometer and the right
                    rear view of his vehicle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> As a
                    result, he failed to see the deceased and the victim, who
                    were crossing the same stretch of the road at that very
                    moment from the centre divider at the rear (viewed from the
                    Respondent’s position, from his right to the left side
                    of the road).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>
                    Understandably, the victim did not notice the
                    Respondent’s vehicle which was reversing as the
                    deceased and the victim would not have expected any vehicles
                    to come from that direction, their right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The collision occurred
                    somewhere between the extreme left and the centre lane of
                    the road.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The location
                    was not within 50 metres of any designated pedestrian
                        crossing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The
                    Respondent’s vehicle was believed to have run over the
                        deceased.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> An
                    independent eye witness to the unfortunate event saw the
                    Respondent reversing his vehicle at a fast speed prior to
                    colliding with the deceased and the victim.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       As a result of the accident,
                    the deceased sustained multiple injuries and was conveyed to
                    Changi General Hospital.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The deceased
                    remained in a state of coma until 3 April 2011 when his
                    family decided, in the light of his grave state, to withdraw
                    further medical therapy.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The
                    deceased was pronounced dead on the same day at
                        1.30pm.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Health Science Authority
                    certified that the cause of the deceased’s death was
                    pneumonia following severe head injury.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The
                    head injury to the deceased was due to the impact of a
                    severe blunt force to the face and skull which could have
                    been sustained by the deceased having been run over by the
                    respondent’s vehicle.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At the time of the accident,
                    the weather was fine, visibility was clear, and the road
                    surface was dry.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> In addition,
                    traffic flow was light and there were no inherent mechanical
                    defects detected in the Respondent’s vehicle following
                    a mechanical inspection of the vehicle carried out after the
                        accident.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The DJ’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The DJ first considered the
                    case of <em>Public Prosecutor v Gan Lim
                        Soon</em> [1993] 2 SLR(R) 67
                        (“<em>Gan Lim
                    Soon</em>”) where Yong Pung How CJ ruled
                    that fines should be imposed as a starting point for such
                    offences (<em>Gan Lim Soon</em> at
                        [10]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Under s 304A the act can be due to either rashness or
                        negligence. If death has been caused by a rash act the
                        proper punishment would be imprisonment for a term not
                        exceeding two years. If death has been caused instead by
                        a negligent act, it would be sufficient <em>in most cases</em> to inflict a fine
                        on the accused. In this case the charge is for causing
                        death by a negligent act, and in my view the appropriate
                        punishment would be a fine. Accordingly I allow the
                        appeal, set aside the order of acquittal, and impose a
                        fine of $6,000 with a sentence of three months’
                        imprisonment in default of payment. The respondent is
                        also disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles
                        for five years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The DJ then considered that
                    the Respondent’s level of culpability was mitigated by
                    the steps that he had taken to reverse responsibly –
                    <em>ie.</em>, by checking his rear view
                    mirror and by turning his head to the left and back whilst
                    reversing – although he failed to take the critical
                    step of checking the rear right of his vehicle (see [24] of
                    the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The DJ further considered
                    two precedents. Firstly, the case of <em>Sim
                        Chong Eng v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    Magistrate’s Appeal No 119 of 1993, where the
                    offender, a driver of a bus belonging to the Singapore Bus
                    Service (“SBS”) at the time of the commission
                    of the offence, was charged with causing death by doing a
                    negligent act, namely encroaching onto the path of an
                    oncoming bus. The offender was turning out of a bus
                    interchange. Upon reaching the T-junction of the driveway of
                    the interchange, he turned left without stopping and
                    encroached onto the path of another SBS bus, which was on
                    its proper side and hence had the right of way, coming from
                    the opposite direction. A collision occurred between the two
                    buses and the driver of the oncoming vehicle was killed. The
                    offender was sentenced to a fine of $6,000 and disqualified
                    from driving all classes of vehicles for five
                years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The DJ next considered the
                    case of <em>Chew Ah Kiat v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 886. The
                    offender in this case was charged with causing death by
                    doing a negligent act, namely, by failing to keep a proper
                    lookout. The offender, who, at the material time was driving
                    a bus belonging to SBS, failed to notice an elderly cyclist
                    crossing a pedestrian crossing and collided into him when he
                    made a right turn at a signalled controlled T-junction. The
                    victim fell from his bicycle and died from a fractured
                    skull. For this offence, the offender was sentenced to a
                    fine of $6,000 and disqualified from driving for 5
                    years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     All matters considered,
                    the DJ concluded (at [25] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...In our present case, the court considered that the
                        accused did take some degree of caution in ensuring that
                        the road was clear before reversing but unfortunately,
                        he failed to look at the right rear view of his vehicle
                        and check his speedometer. Moreover, the deceased and
                        the victim were not crossing within the 50 metres zone
                        from any designated pedestrian crossing. Taking all the
                        circumstances of this case into consideration, the court
                        imposed a fine of $6000 and ordered a disqualification
                        from all classes of vehicles for 3 years. The
                        prosecution is appealing against the sentence
                        imposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Prosecution’s contentions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Prosecution contended,
                    in the main, that the sentence meted out by the DJ was
                    manifestly inadequate and that the DJ had failed to properly
                    appreciate the aggravating features present in this case and
                    the need for general deterrence. The Prosecution highlighted
                    the following factors which the DJ had failed to place
                    adequate, if any, weight upon:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Respondent
                        caused the death of the deceased whilst committing
                        another traffic offence;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Respondent had reversed
                        his vehicle for an extended distance of 65.7 metres
                        against the flow of traffic; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Respondent had
                        reversed his vehicle at a high
                speed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In relation to factor (a)
                    above, the Prosecution contended that the Respondent’s
                    actions in reversing his vehicle against the flow of traffic
                    constituted a violation of traffic rules. As for factor (b)
                    above, the Prosecution submitted that the Respondent had
                    reversed his vehicle, against the flow of traffic, for a
                    significant distance of 65.7 metres. As a result, it was
                    submitted, the Respondent’s culpability was aggravated
                    because of the sustained manner of negligent
                driving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In the light of the
                    factors highlighted above (at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>), the Prosecution contended that the
                    Respondent’s actions – when viewed in totality
                    – bordered upon gross recklessness and that a
                    custodial term was warranted in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As stated at the outset of
                    this Grounds of Decision, the appeal is in relation to
                    sentence. In this regard, the law as to when appellate
                    courts will interfere with sentences meted out by trial
                    courts was succinctly stated by the Court of Appeal
                        (<em>per</em> Chan Sek Keong CJ) in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v UI</em>
                    [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (“<em>PP
                        v UI</em>”) as follows (at [12]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is, of course, well established
                            (see, <em>inter
                            alia</em>, Tan <em>Koon Swan v
                            PP</em> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 976 and <em>Ong Ah Tiong v PP</em> [2004]
                        1 SLR(R) 587) that an appellate court will not
                        ordinarily disturb the sentence imposed by the trial
                        court except where it is satisfied that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the trial judge erred with
                            respect to the proper factual basis for
                            sentencing;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the trial judge failed to
                            appreciate the materials placed before
                        him;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the sentence was wrong in
                            principle; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the sentence was manifestly
                            excessive or manifestly inadequate, as the case may
                            be.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     For the reasons set out
                    hereunder, this was a case where this appellate court ought,
                    in accordance with principles (a), (b) and (d) enunciated in
                        <em>PP v UI</em> (see immediately
                    preceding paragraph), to interfere in the sentence imposed
                    by the DJ. While it is true that a person guilty of an
                    offence under s 304A of causing death by a negligent act
                    will ordinarily be sentenced to a fine (see <em>Gan Lim Soon</em> quoted at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above), much would depend
                    on the nature and extent of the default (see <em>Mohamad </em><em>Iskandar
                        bin Basri v Public Prosecutor</em> [2006]
                    4 SLR(R) 440 at [24] and <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Poh Teck Huat</em> [2003]
                    2 SLR(R) 299 at [19]–[20]). Custodial sentences have been imposed
                    for the causing of death by a negligent act. For example, in
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Jamil bin
                        Kassan</em> [2009] SGDC 167 the
                    offender, a taxi driver, was speeding and did not keep a
                    proper look-out while driving along a four-lane carriageway
                    when he collided into a pedestrian who was crossing the
                    road. The pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene. The
                    offender was sentenced to one-week’s imprisonment and
                    was disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence
                    in all classes of vehicles for five years. His appeal
                    against his sentence was later withdrawn. Another example is
                        <em>Public Prosecutor v Abdul Latiff bin
                        Maideen </em><em>Pillay</em>
                    [2006] SGDC 245 where a taxi driver, while
                    travelling on the middle lane of a three-lane road, failed
                    to keep a proper look-out and collided into and caused the
                    death of a 85 year old pedestrian who was crossing the road.
                    He was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment and was
                    disqualified from holding driving licences for all classes
                    of vehicle for three years. An appeal against his sentence
                    appears to have been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Ultimately, the
                    circumstances under which the offences were committed are
                    decisive and it is not an issue which is amenable to precise
                    definition. It stands to reason that the more serious the
                    negligence, the more justification there is for the
                    imposition of a custodial sentence. It is a fact-sensitive
                    question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In relation to the present
                    case, I am of the view that the DJ’s sentence was
                    manifestly inadequate because he did not give sufficient
                    consideration to the aggravating features of this case which
                    were: (i) the accident was not caused by a momentary
                    lapse on the part of the Respondent but due to a deliberate
                    move on his part to reverse his vehicle for an extensive
                    distance in order to be in a position to turn left into
                    Lorong Batawi; (ii) in so reversing, the Respondent had
                    committed a traffic offence; and (iii) in reversing his
                    vehicle at such high speed, he could not completely see what
                    was in the path of his reversing vehicle. In my opinion,
                    reversing a vehicle at high speed over an extensive distance
                    when you cannot see everything in your path is indeed a
                    dangerous act or recklessness. However, the DJ instead
                    seemed to have given credit to the Respondent for checking
                    his rear view mirror and turning his head backwards (from
                    the left) in reversing. What the DJ did not appear to
                    appreciate is that turning his head to the left and towards
                    the back would not and did not give the Respondent a full
                    view of what was in his path. Moreover, the DJ, instead of
                    viewing the fact that the Respondent did the reversing over
                    an extended distance with concern, seemed to have given more
                    consideration to the reason that the Respondent reversed
                    quickly, <em>viz</em>, that he
                    “did not want to cause any disruption to the traffic
                    flow”. The proper course for the Respondent would
                    have been to drive forward to the next available U-turn
                    which was in fact a fairly short distance away. Instead, the
                    Respondent took a course which caused a dangerous situation
                    to arise. I agree with the Prosecution that the
                    Respondent’s culpability, insofar as the manner in
                    which he was negligent, at least bordered upon recklessness.
                    In short, the Respondent was grossly negligent in reversing
                    his vehicle in the manner which he did – and in so
                    doing caused the death of the deceased. In the public
                    interest, it is vitally important not to create the
                    impression that traffic offences due to negligence which
                    causes death are, whatever the circumstances, not serious
                    and will only attract a fine. In the result, I was of the
                    view that a fine, which would ordinarily be imposed for the
                    offence of negligently causing death, should not be followed
                    in this case because of the aggravating circumstances and
                    that a custodial sentence was warranted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     I therefore allowed the
                    Prosecution’s appeal and imposed a term of one
                    week’s imprisonment in place of a fine. The term of
                    disqualification imposed by the DJ (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above) was to remain. I
                    also ordered that the fine imposed by the DJ and already
                    paid by the Respondent was to be refunded to
                him.</p>
