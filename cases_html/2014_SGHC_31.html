<p class="Judg-Author">
        Sundaresh Menon CJ:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The
accused, Ng Chun Hian (“the appellant”), appealed against the decision
of the District Judge (“the DJ”) sentencing him to 12 years’ corrective
training and six strokes of the cane for a conviction in respect
of one charge of house-breaking under s 454 of the Penal Code (Cap
224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) punishable under s 458A Penal Code,
with two ot her charges being taken into consideration for the purposes
of sentencing. The appellant submitted that the DJ had erred in
failing to have regard to his mental condition, which he contended
had directly contributed to his commission of the offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At
the conclusion of the appeal, I set aside the appellant’s sentence and
remitted the case to the DJ for a Newton Hearing. I now give my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The appellant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The
appellant is 35 years old. He was unemployed when he committed the
present offences. His parents divorced when he was seven years old
and he lived with his mother and sister until he was sent to the Singapore
Boys Home in 1992. The appellant had a long history of antecedents.
Shortly before the commission of the present offences, he completed
a ten-year sentence of corrective training for house-breaking and
theft and was released from prison on 26 September 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On
14 June 2013, the appellant pleaded guilty to one charge of house-breaking
(DAC No 39172 of 2012) under s 454 Penal Code, for breaking into
and entering a dwelling unit on 8 October 2012 at about 2.00pm in order
to commit theft of S$1,900 in cash and about S$1,000 in foreign currency.
As an offender with a previous conviction under s 454 Penal Code,
the appellant was additionally liable to be punished under s 458A Penal
Code, which prescribes a mandatory sentence of caning:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Punishment
for subsequent offence under section 454 or 457</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>458A.</b> Whoever, having been
convicted of an offence under section 454, 455, 457 or 458, commits
an offence under section 454 or 457 shall be punished with caning
in addition to the punishment prescribed for that offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       According
to the Statement of Facts, which the appellant admitted without
qualification, the stolen items were not recovered as the appellant had
spent all the money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The
appellant also consented to two other charges being taken into consideration
for the purposes of sentencing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     one
charge of house-breaking under s 454 read with s 458A Penal Code
(DAC No 37985 of 2012) for the theft of goods with a total value
of S$1,820 from a flat on 11 October 2012; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     one
charge of attempted house-breaking under s 454 read with s 511 (DAC
No 39171 of 2012) for an attempt to enter a dwelling unit in order
to commit theft on 11 October 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The
three offences were committed over the course of four days. The first
of these occurred less than two weeks after his release from prison following
the completion of a ten-year sentence of corrective training.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The psychiatric reports</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Two
psychiatric reports were presented before the DJ for the purpose of
sentencing. The Prosecution submitted a report dated 5 November
2012 from Dr Jerome Goh Hern Yee (“Dr Goh”) from the Institute of
Mental Health (“IMH”). Counsel for the appellant submitted a psychiatric
report dated 20 June 2013 from Dr Lionel Lim Chee Chong (“Dr Lim”)
of L P Clinic Pte Ltd, who was in private practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The IMH report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The
appellant was remanded at the IMH from 19 October 2012 to 5 November
2012 following his arrest for the above offences. Dr Goh examined
the appellant on three occasions on 23 October 2012, 31 October 2012
and 2 November 2012. In addition, Dr Goh relied on the following sources
of information to prepare his report:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     an
interview with the appellant’s father on 30 October 2012;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     documented
observations by IMH nursing staff during his remand;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     a
report on the appellant prepared by IMH’s Medical Social Worker;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
appellant’s IMH clinical notes;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
charge sheets; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_f"></a>(f)     the
report and summary of facts prepared by the investigating officer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In
his report, Dr Goh noted the appellant’s claims that he had started hearing
“voices” upon his recent release from prison and that the “voices” were
inside his head, telling him that he would not get caught. However, these
voices did not specifically instruct him to do anything in particular
or to commit the house-breaking offences. The appellant also said
that he did not hear the “voices” when he committed the offences.
The appellant also claimed that house-breaking was to him “just
a game”; that he “just enjoyed it” and that he felt very happy when
he was committing house-breaking. Finally, the appellant also said
that he kept thinking about house-breaking and could not stop himself
once he started house-breaking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Dr
Goh diagnosed the appellant with an antisocial personality disorder,
but concluded that the appellant was not suffering from a mental illness.
Dr Goh thought that the “voices” described by the appellant were not
consistent with auditory hallucinations of a psychotic nature. He further
opined that the appellant was not of unsound mind at the time of the
alleged offences and was fit to plead in court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Dr Lim’s report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The
appellant was interviewed by Dr Lim on 21 March 2013. In addition
to this interview, Dr Lim also relied on other sources of information,
including the following, to prepare his report:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     interviews
with the appellant’s father, sister and long-time pen friend;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
charge sheets;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
IMH psychiatric report; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_d"></a>(d)     the
Prison medical report dated 8 May 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The
appellant was recorded as informing Dr Lim that he started to experience
an urge to break into houses two days after his release from prison
and that he finally yielded to these impulses on 8 October 2012.
The appellant also claimed that he felt “very excited” when committing
house-breaking and described the urge as akin to an addiction. He
said that he would experience a sense of great relief and a release
of inner tension once he had committed a house-breaking offence.
The appellant also told Dr Lim that he had thrown away the items
that he had stolen, including a laptop, a handphone and a walkman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Dr
Lim concluded that the appellant was suffering from kleptomania, a
psychiatric disorder. I set out the more significant extracts from
his report as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Chun
Hian suffers from Kleptomania, an Impulse-Control Disorder. This
disorder may be associated with compulsive behaviour. …</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">3.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Chun
Hian’s psychological disorder was previously undiagnosed. His psychological
condition started some years back and he continued to experience
these symptoms during his imprisonment. The symptoms probably contributed
to his insomnia.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">5.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The
psychiatric medication that he received from the prison psychiatrists
was not consistent with a diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder.
As stated previously, he was on one antipsychotic, one anti-itch/anti-anxiety
and two antidepressant medication. Indeed, if Chun Hian has antisocial
personality disorder and does not have a mental illness …, then
it is difficult to understand why treatment was given to him during
and after his imprisonment.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">6.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The medication that he received in
prison unwittingly treated the symptoms of Impulse-Control Disorder.
This probably explained for the recurrence of his compulsive house
breaking behaviour when he erroneously stopped the treatment after
his release from prison.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Relying
on Dr Lim’s diagnosis of kleptomania, counsel for the appellant
urged the DJ to impose a short custodial sentence to enable the appellant
to receive treatment for his medical disorder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In
response, the Prosecution submitted that this was not appropriate given
the different diagnoses put forward by the psychiatrists. The Prosecution
observed that there were some discrepancies in the version of events
given by the appellant to each psychiatrist and submitted that the police
statement which was given by the appellant four days after the commission
of the offence should be given more weight than what he told Dr
Lim months after the offence. The Prosecution also submitted that contrary
to the first of the five diagnostic criteria for kleptomania stated
in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders</em> (American Psychiatric Association, text
revision, 2000) (“the DSM-IV-TR”), the Accused had stolen items
of value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The corrective training report</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The
DJ called for a pre-sentencing report for corrective training (“the CT
Report”) in view of the appellant’s multiple antecedents. Both psychiatric
reports were made available for the purposes of preparing the CT
Report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The
CT Report consisted of a Medical Officer’s Memorandum dated 13 July
2013 and a Pre-Sentencing Report dated 29 July 2013. The former stated
that the appellant was fit at the time of the examination to undergo corrective
training and certified him to be suffering from “mood disorder, insomnia
and eczema since 2012 at least.” The latter stated that the appellant
was fit to undergo corrective training and assessed the appellant’s risk
of re-offending in the category of high risk/need of criminal offending, with
a = 62% probability of recidivism within two years of release.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The
DJ accepted that in principle, the element of general deterrence could
be given considerably less weight where an offender suffered from
a mental illness that contributed to the commission of the offence.
However, the DJ noted that this would depend on whether there was
a causal link between the illness and the offence, as well as the
seriousness of the mental condition, the likelihood of re-offending
and the severity of the crime (at [17] of the DJ’s Grounds of Decision
(“GD”)). The DJ noted the different diagnoses in the reports of
Dr Goh and Dr Lim and appeared to have come to the conclusion that
as the appellant did not satisfy one of the five diagnostic criteria
for kleptomania that were noted in Dr Lim’s report, namely, the
theft of items that were unnecessary for personal use or that were
of no monetary value, Dr Lim’s report would be accorded less weight (at
[18] of the GD). The DJ also observed that neither report indicated
any causal link between the appellant’s alleged mental disorder
and the offence (at [18] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The
DJ also noted that the appellant had a long history of property-related
antecedents, primarily house-breaking offences, and had committed the
present offences within days of his release from prison. In the circumstances,
the DJ rejected counsel’s submissions that the appellant had acted
out of character, and considered that a short custodial sentence
would be inappropriate (at [19] of the GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In
the light of the CT Report which indicated the appellant’s high
risk of recidivism and his fitness for corrective training, the
DJ was satisfied that it was expedient with a view to the appellant’s
reformation that he should receive a sentence of corrective training
for a substantial period of time and imposed a sentence of 12 years’
corrective training and six strokes of the cane (at [20] of the
GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The
parties initially appeared before me on 3 October 2013. Two aspects
of the case troubled me at that time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     First,
there were two conflicting psychiatric reports concerning the appellant’s
mental condition before the court. The Prosecution took issue with
Dr Lim’s diagnosis of kleptomania. Yet neither doctor responsible
for these reports had been cross-examined. Moreover, the CT Report
indicated a third diagnosis of mood disorder which was not elaborated
upon. In the light of this, a question arose as to whether a Newton
hearing should be called to determine whether the appellant indeed
suffered from kleptomania (or any other mental condition).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     A
Newton hearing is called when a fact is contested and it is material to
sentencing. In such circumstances, the court will hear evidence
and then make a finding: <em>R v Robert John Newton</em> (1982)
4 Cr App R(S) 388. I recognise that a Newton hearing is the exception
rather than the norm and should not ordinarily be convened unless
the court is satisfied that it is necessary to do so in order to
resolve a difficult question of fact that is material to the court’s
determination of the appropriate sentence: see <em>R
v Kevin John Underwood</em> [2005] 1 Cr App R(S) 90 (“<em>Underwood</em>”) (at [10(e)]), adopted in <em>PP v Soh Song Soon</em> [2010] 1 SLR 857 (at
[3]–[4]). Undoubtedly, the sentencing judge has a discretion to
decline to hear such evidence if he is satisfied that the case advanced
on the defendant’s behalf is, with good reason, to be regarded as
“absurd or obviously untenable”. In such a case, the judge should
explain his conclusion: <em>Underwood</em> (at [10(f)]).
Ultimately, the sentencing judge must do justice and sentence the offender
as far as possible on the basis of accurate facts: see <em>PP v Aniza </em><em>bte </em><em>Essa</em> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 327 (at [62]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Second,
I was troubled by the fact that the appellant had a long list of house-breaking
antecedents which stretched back to his days as a juvenile offender.
Despite having been incarcerated for much of his life, the appellant
had been unable to remain crime-free for any period of significant length
from the time he was first sentenced to prison in 1995. As noted above,
he committed the present offences within two weeks of being released
after serving a ten-year sentence of corrective training.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The
corrective training regime is focussed on the <em>rehabilitation</em> of
the offender. This is unlike the preventive detention regime which
primarily serves the aim of incapacitating recalcitrant offenders
from re-offending through prolonged custody. As was observed in <em>G Ravichander v PP</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 665
at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On the other hand, when determining what
a suitable term is for corrective training, the court should keep
in mind that this form of punishment, though in substance very similar
to imprisonment …, should not be treated as a lesser form of preventive
detention. <em>Those undergoing corrective training must
first be capable of reform, while those sent in for preventive detention
are hardened criminals. Sending hardened criminals through the corrective training
regime would not only dilute the programme’s aims but also endanger the
reformative path of more promising prisoners.</em> [emphasis
added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     This
was echoed by the Court of Appeal in <em>PP v Rosli
bin Yassin</em> [2013] 2 SLR 831 (at [11]), where it cited
with approval Yong CJ’s observation in <em>PP v
Wong Wing Hung</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 304 (at [10]) that the “sentence
of [preventive detention] is meant essentially for habitual offenders
… whom the court considers to be <em>beyond redemption</em> and <em>too recalcitrant for reformation</em>” [emphasis
added]. It seemed uncertain to me that corrective training was the
appropriate sentence in the light of the appellant’s constant re-offending,
and I thought consideration ought to have been given to whether
preventive detention was a more suitable option in the absence of
any other explanation for his behaviour such as a psychiatric disorder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In
the premises, I raised three queries at the first hearing of the
matter and invited the parties to make further submissions on them:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether
the appellant’s psychiatric condition is irrelevant to sentencing,
as the Prosecution contends;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     how
corrective training would benefit the appellant given the scant
evidence showing any capacity for reform; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     in
the event the court was of the view that preventive detention should
be imposed upon the appellant, how should the appellant’s previous
sentence of corrective training affect the court’s consideration
of the length of a sentence of preventive detention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In
response to query (a), the Prosecution advanced three grounds in support
of its position that the appellant’s psychiatric condition was irrelevant
to the sentence that was to be meted upon him:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     first,
it was submitted that there was insufficient evidence to support
a conclusion that the appellant suffered from kleptomania;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     second,
it was submitted that Dr Lim’s report did not state that there was
a causal link between the alleged condition of kleptomania and the
commission of the offence; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     finally,
it was submitted that the severity of the appellant’s criminal tendencies
rendered any psychiatric condition irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Counsel
for the appellant submitted that the appellant’s medical condition <em>was</em> material to the question of whether
there were “special reasons” rendering him unfit for corrective
training or preventive detention under s 304(1) and (2) of the Criminal
Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Both
parties also made submissions on the remaining two questions but,
as it transpired, it was unnecessary for me to consider those matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The
key question for me was whether the appellant’s alleged psychiatric
condition of kleptomania was a relevant sentencing consideration.
In my judgment it was plainly relevant to determining what the appropriate
sentence should be as well as whether it should be coupled with
a suitable treatment plan. It is well established that rehabilitation
is often the foremost sentencing consideration for a sentencing
court when dealing with a mentally-disordered offender, including
one suffering from an impulse control disorder such as kleptomania
that causes the commission of the offence at hand: see <em>Goh Lee Yin v PP</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 530 at
[108]; and <em>PP v Goh Lee Yin</em> [2008]
1 SLR(R) 824 at [97], [100] and [107]. A diagnosis of kleptomania
would therefore, at least potentially, be relevant to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     the
question of whether the Appellant is “<em>beyond
redemption or too recalcitrant for reformation</em>”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
question of whether a sentence of incarceration should be paired
with a suitable mental health treatment and rehabilitation regime
that could be offered to the Appellant by the Prison authorities;
and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
question of what type of incarceration should be imposed upon him
and for what duration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     If
there exists an underlying psychiatric condition which caused the appellant
to offend as he did and this were left untreated, the appellant’s cycle
of re-offending is likely to continue as soon as he is released.
This indeed is what happened in the present case and it is consistent
with his pattern of offending.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The
Prosecution’s submission that there was insufficient evidence to support
Dr Lim’s diagnosis of kleptomania missed the mark. Once it was established
that the psychiatric diagnosis of kleptomania is a relevant sentencing
consideration, the next question that arises is whether this material
fact was contested. It undoubtedly was in this case, with the two psychiatric
opinions pulling in different directions. In these circumstances, it
was not evident to me how I, or the DJ, could have resolved this divergence
without evidence being taken from both Dr Goh and Dr Lim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I
make no comment on the Prosecution’s submissions on Dr Lim’s report
but it was plain to me that I was in no position to dismiss it as patently
untenable or absurd. Even if there was a failure to meet one of
the diagnostic criteria, it was not evident that this fact alone
would rule out a valid diagnosis of kleptomania.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As
for the Prosecution’s alternative submission that there was no causal
link between the appellant’s alleged psychiatric condition and the commission
of the offences, this appeared to have been inspired by the DJ’s observation
that Dr Lim’s report did not specifically state that there was such
a link.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I
accept that as a matter of principle, such a causal link must be proved:
see <em>Ng So Kuen Connie v PP</em> [2003]
3 SLR(R) 178 at [58]. In my judgment, where the DJ erred was in
concluding that Dr Lim had not attested to such a link. Although
there was no sentence in the report that specifically stated a causal
link, it was clear that Dr Lim’s report evinced such a causal link.
Dr Lim’s report must be read fairly and in context. In it, he dealt
substantially with the appellant’s past history of house-breaking and
his account of events leading to the commission of the offence and
its aftermath. Dr Lim specifically stated that the recurrence of
the appellant’s compulsive house-breaking behaviour could have been
due to his ceasing to take the medications he had been prescribed
in prison after his release; medications which Dr Lim averred “unwittingly
treated the symptoms of Impulse-Control Disorder” – this “Impulse-Control
Disorder” being kleptomania, as Dr Lim made clear at page 7 of his
report. In the circumstances, it was clear to me that Dr Lim did
find and put forward a causal link between his diagnosis and the
commission of the present offences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As
to the final argument advanced by the Prosecution, although I agreed
that the severity of the appellant’s criminal tendencies were potentially
relevant to the question of the length of any period of incarceration,
this could not render the appellant’s mental condition irrelevant
as a sentencing consideration. This was especially so here, where the
court had to choose from among a variety of alternative sentences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     For
completeness, I mention some other points which I noticed and thought
might benefit from further examination in a Newton hearing:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     Although
Dr Goh had stated in his report that the appellant was not suffering
from mental illness, the appellant had been prescribed medicines
whilst he was in prison which, according to Dr Lim, were medicines
that are prescribed in order to treat psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     Although
both Dr Lim’s report and the CT Report averred that the appellant
had previously undergone mental health treatment in prison, Dr Goh
appeared to be under the impression that the appellant had never
undergone any prior treatment for a mental health disorder.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     There
was a diagnosis of “mood disorder” in the CT Report which was not
further elaborated on and which remains unexplained.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_d"></a>(d)     Finally,
as previously mentioned at [25] above, I was struck by the very
short periods of time that elapsed between the appellant’s release
from prison after long sentences for property related offences and
the commission of further offences of the same sort. I considered that
it would be useful to invite the psychiatrists to comment on whether
such a pattern of offending could be attributed to a person of normal
mental health.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     For
all these reasons, I held that a Newton hearing would be appropriate
in the circumstances. In the light of this, there was no need for me
to consider at this stage whether corrective training or preventive detention
was appropriate. Any sentencing decision should be taken on the basis
of the conclusions that are reached at the Newton hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For
the foregoing reasons, I allowed the appeal and set aside the DJ’s sentence.
I ordered that the case be remitted to the same DJ for a Newton hearing.
Without seeking to constrain the discretion of the DJ, I directed that
the following questions should be considered:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether
the appellant is a kleptomaniac and if so, the relevance of that
condition to the commission of his offences; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     if
the appellant is a kleptomaniac what the appropriate type and period
of incarceration should be, and whether the appellant should be
offered an appropriate treatment programme that could be undertaken
in conjunction with the period of incarceration to which he is eventually
sentenced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Counsel
for both parties agreed that the appellant should continue to be
remanded in the meantime.</p>
