Dividing these sums by the net equity of the matrimonial home, I arrived at parties’ percentage share of the matrimonial home: 50.8% for the Husband and 49.2% for the Wife.

The Husband’s submitted that the present car was paid for by trading in the previous car, which in turn was paid for by trading in the car before that, and that he had contributed substantially to the purchase of this earliest car.

Care of a child in his infancy and younger formative years often requires more time and intensive attention.   Although both parents played their part in the care and nurturing of the son, more was undoubtedly done by the Wife. Among other things, she had stopped work for about a year in 2007 to 2008 to care for the son. As a spouse-partner of the Dental Practice, she was able to work flexible hours to give her the time to take care of the child’s needs, whilst being assisted by her parents. The nature of her duties and work at the Dental Practice enabled her to carry out her duties off-site and after office hours and did not detract from her direct financial contribution towards the Dental Practice. It is to be noted that when the Dental Practice clinic started operations in February 2009, the son would have been less than two years old and the Wife would have had to judiciously balance her role as the primary care-giver and her role in the Dental Practice in its start-up operations. I accordingly gave the Wife more credit for non-financial contribution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Indirect financial contributions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In terms of indirect financial contributions, I accept that the Husband contributed more to the household expenses.

It was in parties’ interests to cooperate to preserve the value of the Dental Practice to secure the best price, if it was to be sold to a third party. Given their acrimony, there were real concerns that the value of the Dental Practice as a going concern could be progressively reduced, the longer a decision on its future remained in doubt, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, dental associates and staff, knowing of these problems, might leave.

</div> I had considered but later decided against a joint valuation of the Dental Practice when it became clear that it would only lead to further delay and was impracticable as parties would not be able to agree on a joint or other brief. It was submitted by the Husband’s counsel that the Husband was then still open to having an option to buy over the Wife’s share in the Dental Practice. It was in this context, that I made the practical orders for the logistics for division of the Dental Practice at [4(d)], after I had decided on the substantive shares for division of this asset.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Thus, I ordered that the Dental Practice be divided in the ratio of 55:45 in favour of the Wife, while the rest of the matrimonial assets were to be divided 55.65:44.35 in favour of the Wife. The Dental Practice and the matrimonial home were to be divided according to the steps stated above at [4(b)(i)]–[4(b)(ii)] and [4(d)(i)]–[4(d)(vii)]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53  The Husband has also appealed against my indication that parties are to bear the mortgage payments and other payments relating to the matrimonial home in the same proportion as 50.8:49.4 (H:W) (see above at [4(b)]). I had informed counsel when I gave my decision on 28 November 2016, that as the division of the assets, including the matrimonial home, had been effected upon my decision that day,  that thereafter (unless changed on appeal), the remaining mortgage instalments as well as other outgoings should rightly be borne in proportion to the ratio of 50.8:49.2 (H:W). The actual sorting out of accounts on this score could be effected upon completion of the transfer of the Husband’s estate title and interest in the matrimonial home at KL Road to the Wife or upon completion of the sale of the property, if such was the case. My view was that it was not necessary for a specific order to be made in that regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I also ordered that each party was to bear their own costs. The Wife had not succeeded in her contention that the assets in [6(a)]-[6(c)] be included in the matrimonial pool, that the asset in [6(d)] be excluded from the pool or that the Husband had not contributed to the purchase of the shares in her name. The Husband had not succeeded on the issue of direct financial contribution as well as the issue of the car.
