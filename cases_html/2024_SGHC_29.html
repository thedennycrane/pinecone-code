Lim’s position was that Shopee had not demonstrated that it had any legitimate proprietary interest in respect of the “confidential information” protected under the RCA that was not already protected under the ECA. Clause 2 of the RCA was also unreasonable in scope and duration and amounted to an unlawful restraint of trade. In the circumstances, Lim refused to provide the undertakings and responded that he would not be acceding to Shopee’s demands.

Interim injunctions should therefore be granted as Lim has not shown that he will suffer hardship over and above observing his contractual obligations. In any event, there is a serious case to be tried in respect of the validity, enforceability and breach of the restraint of trade clauses, and the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the interim injunctions. Further or in the alternative, Shopee submits that a springboard injunction should be granted as Lim has misused confidential information to give ByteDance an unfair advantage. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Lim submits that there is no serious question to be tried with respect to his alleged breach of the restraint of trade clauses.

Shopee has also failed to show that the Client Non-Solicitation Restriction and the Employee Non-Solicitation Restriction, which I shall refer to collectively as the “Non-Solicitation Restrictions”, are about to be breached. Furthermore, the springboard injunction should not be granted as Lim was not privy to confidential information, and in any event, has not obtained an unfair “head start” as a result of his unlawful acts. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The </span><span class="font-weight-bold">American Cyanamid</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">test in respect of restraint of trade interim injunctions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In <span class="font-italic">Reed Exhibitions </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Khoo Yak Chuan Thomas and another </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 383 at [14], the Court of Appeal held that in considering the grant of an interlocutory injunction to enforce a restraint of trade covenant, the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd</span> [1975] AC 396 (“<span class="font-italic">American Cy</span><span class="font-italic">anamid</span>”) should be applied.

The threshold is a low one. All it requires is that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious. The court will only investigate the prospects of success to a limited extent – “[a]ll that has to be seen is whether [the applicant] has prospects of success which, in substance and reality, exist”: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2022 </span>vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2022) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2022</span>”) at para 29/1/12.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If there is a serious question to be tried, whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the injunction. The court proceeds on a two-stage analysis:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) If damages would be an adequate remedy and the respondent is in a financial position to pay them, an injunction should normally not be granted. On the other hand, if damages would not be an adequate remedy, the court should consider whether, if the injunction was granted, the respondent would be adequately compensated under the applicant’s undertaking as to damages: <span class="font-italic">Re Fineplas Holdings Pte Ltd (formerly known as Tasinder Pte Ltd) </span>[2001] 1 SLR(R) 192 at [7]. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) If damages would not be an adequate remedy, or if the court is doubtful about the adequacy of damages, the court considers where the balance of convenience lies: <span class="font-italic">Leong Quee Ching Karen v Lim Soon Huat </span><span class="font-italic">and others </span>[2023] SGHC 359 at [42], citing <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2022 </span>at paras 13/1/14–13/1/16. The court should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if that course should ultimately turn out to have been the “wrong” course. This principle is necessary as the court is asked to assess the balance of convenience at an early stage and based only on affidavit evidence:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports Co Ltd and another v GMR Malé International Airport Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Maldives Airports Co Ltd</span>”) at [53]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 An additional point of consideration in this case is that restraint of trade clauses, particularly those in the context of employment, are <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>void and unenforceable. This is to give effect to the public policy that frowns upon attempts to unreasonably proscribe freedom of trade: <span class="font-italic">Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (formerly known as E D &amp; F Man International (S) Pte Ltd) v Wong Bark Chuan David </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 663 (“<span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span>”) at [45]. In <span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span>, the Court of Appeal cited with approval at [70] and [79] a two-stage test <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">for determining whether a restrictive covenant in restraint of trade is en</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">forceable, namely: </span></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the court will first consider whether the restrictive covenant protects a legitimate interest of the employer;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if the answer to (a) is “yes”, the restrictive covenant will be enforceable if it is in addition: (i) reasonable in the interests of the parties; and (ii) reasonable in the public interest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court recognised at [94] and [121] that an employer can have legitimate proprietary interests in: (a) restraining an employee from misusing any trade secrets (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, confidential information); (b) protecting the special trade connections established by the employee with the employer’s customers; and (c) maintaining a stable, trained work force. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In <span class="font-italic">Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart </span>[2012] 4 SLR 308 (“<span class="font-italic">Smile Inc Dental</span>”), the Court of Appeal held at [20] that the courts adopt a stricter approach when considering restrictive covenants in the context of a contract of employment as compared to the situation where such a clause is contained in a contract for the sale of a business. This is because of the differing nature of the legitimate proprietary interest to be protected and the greater inequality of bargaining power in an employment context. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Where the protection of confidential information or trade secrets is already covered by another contractual clause, the covenantee will have to demonstrate that the restraint of trade clause in question covers a legitimate proprietary interest over and above the protection of confidential information or trade secrets. This proposition is a <span class="font-italic">general </span>one and would apply equally in the context of other legitimate proprietary interests, for example, that of trade connections: <span class="font-italic">Man Financial</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span>at [92].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Therefore, applying the <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid </span>principles to an interim injunction in respect of a restraint of trade clause, an applicant must show:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a serious question to be tried that the restraint of trade clause is valid and enforceable, namely that it protects a legitimate proprietary interest and that it is reasonable in the interests of the parties and the public;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) a serious question to be tried that a restraint of trade clause has been breached; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if there are serious questions to be tried, that the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the interim injunction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span>, the Court of Appeal held at [33] that the <span class="font-italic">American Cyanami</span><span class="font-italic">d </span>test does not apply to an application for an interim prohibitory injunction where the respondent is about to breach, or has already breached, a negative covenant in a contract. The court in such a case does not ask whether there is a serious question to be tried and whether the balance of convenience is in favour of granting such an injunction. Instead, an interim prohibitory injunction will readily be granted to restrain a prospective breach or a further breach. It will only be refused if the respondent shows that he will suffer hardship over and above that which results from having to observe the contract. One of the issues in this case is whether this holding in <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>applies to trade restraint cases generally and to this particular trade restraint case, such that the <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid</span> test does not apply.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The law applicable to springboard injunctions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In respect of the grant of springboard injunctions, the High Court accepted in <span class="font-italic">Goh Seng Heng v RSP Investments</span><span class="font-italic"> and others and another matter </span>[2017] 3 SLR 657 (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Seng Heng</span>”) at [67] that the following requirements need to be satisfied: (a) confidential information had been misused or is at risk of being misused; (b) such misuse of confidential information had given an unfair competitive advantage to the respondent; (c) the “unfair advantage” was still being enjoyed by the respondent at the time the injunction was sought; and (d) damages would be inadequate to compensate the applicant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The issues for determination are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the holding at [33] of <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span> is generally applicable to restraint of trade cases. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Whether there are serious questions to be tried that the restraint of trade clauses are valid and enforceable, and were breached by Lim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If there are serious questions to be tried, whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the interim injunctions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I shall address each issue in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Whether the holding at [33] of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">RGA Holdings</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> is applicable </span><span class="font-weight-bold">to restraint of trade cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Shopee submits that in this case, the <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid </span>principles<span class="font-italic"> </span>are inapplicable and that <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span> applies instead. <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings</span> held at [33] that the <span class="font-italic">American Cyanamid </span>test does not apply to an application for an interim prohibitory injunction where the respondent is about to breach, or has already breached, a negative covenant in a contract (see [22] above).

The court went on to cite with approval the English case of <span class="font-italic">Vefa Ibrahim Araci v Kieren Fallon</span> [2011] EWCA Civ 668, which concerned an interim prohibitory injunction which was granted to restrain a jockey from acting in breach of a negative covenant in his contract with a racehorse owner not to ride a rival owner’s horse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my view, the force of the public policy that restraint of trade clauses are <span class="font-italic">prima fa</span><span class="font-italic">cie</span> invalid, comes through the two-stage test set out in <span class="font-italic">Man Financial </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">for determining whether a restrictive covenant in restraint of trade is enforceable</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">, rather than through the inapplicability of the holding at [33] of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">RGA Holdings</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">to restraint of trade clauses.</span> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It should be borne in mind that the principles in <span class="font-italic">RGA Holdings </span>are only applicable where an applicant has shown that the respondent is about to breach, or has already breached, a negative covenant. In the context of a restraint of trade clause, the applicant must first show that the restraint of trade clause is valid and enforceable, in that it <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">protects a legitimate interest of the </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">applicant and in addition is reasonable in the interests of the parties and the public.

This is because Shopee’s case is that the restriction is triggered by Limb (C) of the definition of “Restricted Territories” and consequently is premised on a legitimate proprietary interest in the protection of confidential information, and not the maintenance of a stable and trained workforce. As set out above, given that such an interest in the protection of confidential information is already protected elsewhere by the ECA, there are serious doubts that Shopee would be able to rely on such an interest in asserting the validity of the Non-Competition Restriction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I also observe that the confidential information that Shopee seeks to protect is set out along fairly generic categories, for example: (a) immediate and long-term growth and business plans; (b) seller and listing management, customer satisfaction, pricing and marketing strategies; and (c) detailed statistics on orders, financial metrics, users and gross merchandise value, that Lim continued to have access to up until July 2023.

</div> Nor it is apparent why Lim should have to provide further undertakings. Lim stated that he did not want to provide the further undertakings in relation to the Non-Competition Restriction as Shopee has not shown a legitimate proprietary interest and the trade restraint clause is unreasonable in scope and duration and amounts to an unlawful restraint of trade.

The ex-employee in <span class="font-italic">Heller</span> had issued a tacit assertion of entitlement and threatened to poach the former employer’s customers. The ex-employee regarded the factoring business as a free and competitive one. To him it was “fair game” to poach the former employer’s customers by using their proprietary information. Given the ex-employee’s proclivity for breaching the restrictive covenant, the court held that an injunction would be warranted so as to better enforce it. In contrast, Lim has stated on affidavit that he has not and will not breach the confidentiality restrictions  or the Non-Solicitation Restrictions. I therefore find that Shopee has not, on its bare assertions alone, shown a serious case to be tried that the Non-Solicitation Restrictions have been or are about to be breached by Lim. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicability of </span><span class="font-weight-bold">R</span><span class="font-weight-bold">GA Holdings</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> to the facts</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Given that Shopee has not shown that there are serious questions to be tried that the Non-Competition Restriction is valid and enforceable or that there is a serious question to be tried that the Non-Solicitation Restrictions have been or are about to be breached, I do not find that it could be said that these negative covenants have been or are about to be breached.

For example, it does not set out which potential client or area of business it could lose. If Shopee is able to do this, it does not seem that it would be impossible to derive an estimate of the value of the business lost by reason of Lim working for ByteDance during the one-year restraint period. Counsel for Shopee explained that the potential losses are framed generically, because the concern is that Lim’s knowhow can be used by TikTok to gain an unfair advantage and it is difficult to say how Lim might use the information.

</div> That being the case, it appears that the issue is not that there is conceptual difficulty in quantifying the loss, but that Shopee is not clear what would be its loss, a point which counsel for Shopee accepts.
