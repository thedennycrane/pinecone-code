        V K Rajah JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Ought an action which is not certain to fail,
                    brought by an applicant who has <em>locus standi</em>, be
                    peremptorily struck out by the High Court even though it accepts that it has
                    jurisdiction to hear the action? This is one of the pivotal issues at the heart
                    of this appeal by Tan Eng Hong (“Tan”) against the decision of the
                    High Court judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Tan Eng Hong
                        v Attorney-General</em> [2011] 3 SLR 320 (“the
                    Judgment”) striking out his application in Originating Summons
                    No 994 of 2010 for declaratory relief (“the
                    Application”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Application under O 15 r 16 of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Rules”) was brought by Tan to ask the court to declare s 377A of the
                    Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the current Penal
                    Code”) unconstitutional under the Constitution of the Republic of
                    Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint). For ease of reference, this
                    version of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore as well as its
                    predecessor versions (where relevant) will hereafter be denoted as either
                    “the Constitution” or “the Constitution of
                    Singapore”, as may be appropriate to the context.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       We ought to also emphasise at the outset that
                    the present appeal does <em>not</em> deal with the
                    substantive issue of the constitutionality of s 377A of the current Penal
                    Code (“s 377A”), but only concerns the <em>preliminary</em> issue of whether the Application was correctly
                    struck out under O 18 r 19 of the Rules (“O 18
                    r 19”) on the basis that it disclosed no cause of action and/or was
                    frivolous and/or was an abuse of the process of the court (referred to hereafter
                    as “an abuse of court process” for short).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 9 March 2010, Tan and another male
                    person (“the co-accused”) were arrested for engaging in oral sex
                    in a cubicle in a public toilet of a shopping complex. Both parties are adult
                    males in their forties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In due course, Tan and the co-accused were
                    separately charged under s 377A with the commission of “[an] act of
                    gross indecency with another male person”. Tan was charged on
                    2 September 2010 and the co-accused was charged on 1 September
                    2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 24 September 2010, Tan brought the
                    Application to challenge the constitutionality of s 377A under the
                    Constitution. Counsel for Tan, Mr M Ravi
                    (“Mr Ravi”), prayed for the following declarations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     s 377A is inconsistent with
                        Art 9 of the Constitution (“Art 9”) and is therefore
                        void by virtue of Art 4 of the Constitution
                        (“Art 4”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     s 377A is inconsistent with Arts 12 and 14 of
                        the Constitution (“Art 12” and
                        “Art 14” respectively) and is therefore void by virtue of
                        Art 4; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     for these reasons, the charge brought against Tan under s 377A is
                        void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Not long after this, on 15 October 2010,
                    the Prosecution informed Tan that the s 377A charge against him had been
                    substituted with one under s 294(<em>a</em>) of the
                    current Penal Code (“s 294(<em>a</em>)”)
                    for the commission of an obscene act in a public place. The charge against the
                    co-accused was similarly substituted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Attorney-General (“the AG”)
                    then applied via Summons No 5063 of 2010 to strike out the Application
                    pursuant to O 18 r 19 and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court.
                    At the hearing before the assistant registrar (“the AR”), Tan
                    abandoned prayer 3 of the Application (<em>ie</em>,
                    the prayer for the declaration set out at [6(c)] above) as there was no longer a
                    s 377A charge to be voided. On 7 December 2010, the AR struck out the
                    Application on the grounds that it:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">disclosed no reasonable cause of action;
                            and/or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">was frivolous or vexatious; and/or</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">was an abuse of court process.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Tan appealed via Registrar’s Appeal
                    No 488 of 2010 (“RA 488/2010”) against the AR’s
                    decision to strike out the Application. That appeal formed the subject matter of
                    the Judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Tan subsequently pleaded guilty to the
                    substituted charge under s 294(<em>a</em>) on
                    15 December 2010, and was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $3,000. The
                    co-accused had earlier pleaded guilty, and had similarly been convicted and
                    sentenced to a fine of $3,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In RA 488/2010, the Judge had to
                    determine whether the Application could be struck out under O 18
                        rr 19(1)(<em>a</em>), 19(1)(<em>b</em>) and/or 19(1)(<em>d</em>) for,
                    respectively, disclosing no reasonable cause of action, being frivolous or
                    vexatious and/or being an abuse of court process. Mr Aedit bin Abdullah
                    (“Mr Abdullah”), who appeared on behalf of the AG, did not
                    rely on O 18 r 19(1)(<em>c</em>) (<em>viz</em>, prejudice to, or embarrassment or delay of the fair
                    trial of an action) as a ground for striking out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Although the Judge unequivocally found that
                    Tan had <em>locus standi</em> to bring the Application, she
                    also found that the Application disclosed no real controversy to be adjudicated
                    (see [25] of the Judgment). For this reason <em>alone</em>,
                    she dismissed Tan’s appeal in RA 488/2010 and upheld the AR’s
                    striking-out order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In arriving at her decision, the Judge
                    examined the three grounds under O 18 r 19 that the AG sought to rely
                    on and considered the elements in each ground. Her rulings on these grounds were
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Vis-à-vis</em> O 18 r 19(1)(<em>a</em>) (the “no reasonable cause of action”
                        ground), the Judge found that an action could be struck out where the
                        applicant was unable to establish <em>locus standi</em>
                        (see <em>Abdul Razak Ahmad v Majlis </em><em>Bandaraya Johor Bahru</em> [1995] 2 MLJ 287 (cited
                        at [5(a)] of the Judgment)).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <em>Vis-à-vis</em> O 18
                            r 19(1)(<em>b</em>) (the “frivolous or
                        vexatious” ground):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The Judge found that an
                            action could be deemed frivolous where it was incapable of legally
                            sustainable and reasoned argument (see <em>Chee Siok Chin
                                and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another</em> [2006]
                            1 SLR(R) 582 (“<em>Chee Siok
                            Chin</em>”) at [33] (cited at [5(b)] of the Judgment)). The
                            Judge further held that an action could be deemed vexatious where it was
                            without foundation and/or could not possibly succeed (see likewise
                            [5(b)] of the Judgment, citing <em>Chee Siok
                                Chin</em> at [33]). An action could also be said to be
                            vexatious where the party bringing the action was not acting <em>bona fide</em> but merely wished to annoy or
                            embarrass his opponent, or where the action was not calculated to lead
                            to any practical result (see <em>Goh Koon Suan v Heng
                                </em><em>Gek </em><em>Kiau
                                </em><em>and others</em> [1990]
                            2 SLR(R) 705 at [15] (cited at [5(b)] of the
                            Judgment)).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       As the Application was for declaratory relief,
                            the Judge considered that if the court could not grant the declaratory
                            relief sought, it was arguable that the Application was frivolous and
                            vexatious as it would have no practical value (see the Judgment at [6]).
                            The Judge then considered and applied the test elucidated in <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas
                                </em><em>Co LLC v Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd
                                and another appeal</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 112
                                (“<em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em>”) at [14] for determining whether
                            declaratory relief could be granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>Vis-à-vis</em>
                        O 18 r 19(1)(<em>d</em>) (the “abuse
                        of court process” ground), the Judge found that an action could be
                        struck out where it: (i) effected a deception on the court;
                        (ii) used the court’s processes for some ulterior or improper
                        purpose or in an improper way; (iii) was manifestly groundless or
                        useless or served no useful purpose; or (iv) was one of a series of
                        multiple or successive proceedings which caused or were likely to cause
                        improper vexation or oppression (see <em>Chee Siok
                            Chin</em> at [34] (cited at [5(c)] of the
                    Judgment)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     From this, the Judge distilled the four key
                    issues below that, in her view, would determine the outcome of RA 488/2010
                    (see the Judgment at [7]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     Did Tan have <em>locus standi</em> to bring the Application?</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The Judge
                        reasoned that if Tan did not have <em>locus
                            </em><em>standi</em> to bring the
                        Application, the Application could be struck out under either O 18
                            rr 19(1)(<em>a</em>) or 19(1)(<em>b</em>). The Judge found that Tan had satisfied the
                        “substantial interest” test for <em>locus
                            standi</em> laid down in <em>Chan Hiang
                            </em><em>Leng Colin and others v Minister for
                            Information and the Arts</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 294
                            (“<em>Colin Chan</em>”) as it was
                        arguable on the facts that Tan’s constitutional rights under
                        Art 12 had been violated (see the Judgment at [19]–[21]). The
                        Judge thus held that the AG’s striking-out application could not be
                        granted on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Was there a real controversy to be adjudicated?</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The Judge held that if
                            there was no real controversy to be adjudicated, the Application could
                            be struck out under either O 18 rr 19(1)(<em>b</em>) or 19(1)(<em>d</em>). (As noted
                            earlier at [12] above, the Judge struck out the Application on this
                            ground alone.) While there were specific facts involving specific
                            parties, the Judge found that the facts were “merely
                            hypothetical” (see [25] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Although Tan raised an
                            argument based on the Hong Kong case of <em>Leung v
                                Secretary for Justice</em> [2006] 4 HKLRD 211
                                (“<em>Leung</em>”) that there
                            could be adjudication on hypothetical facts in “exceptional
                            cases”, the Judge found that <em>Leung</em>
                            could be distinguished (see [26] of the Judgment). First, the Judge
                            noted that <em>Leung</em> was based on the
                            International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty which had
                            no force of law in Singapore. Second, she found that the court’s
                            reasoning in <em>Leung</em> –
                            <em>viz</em>, that if the court were to refuse to
                            hear the application on the ground that it concerned a hypothetical
                            scenario, it would mean that the applicant could only gain access to
                            justice by breaking the law – was less persuasive in Singapore as
                            compared to Hong Kong, given the referral mechanism provided for in
                            Art 100 of the Constitution of Singapore
                            (“Art 100”) apropos questions on the effect of any
                            constitutional provision. The Judge opined that the possibility of
                            convening a tribunal (“the Constitutional Tribunal”) under
                            Art 100 was “an established procedure through which guidance
                            [might] be obtained [on constitutional questions] in the absence of
                            specific facts” (see [26(b)] of the Judgment). Further, the Judge
                            expressed concern that the criterion of “exceptional
                            cases” was too vague and might open the floodgates to
                            constitutional challenges (see [26(a)] of the
                        Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_ii_1"></a>(ii)       In addition, the Judge found that there was “nothing at
                            stake for Tan” (see [26(c)] of the Judgment) as Tan had already
                            pleaded guilty and been convicted under s 294(<em>a</em>). In the Judge’s view, Tan’s conduct in
                            pursuing the Application “[went] against the spirit of the
                            adversarial process where the parties’ conduct [was] conditioned
                            by the possibility of gain and/or loss” (see likewise [26(c)] of
                            the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_b-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       The Judge also expressed concern that since the
                            s 377A charge against Tan had been dropped, there were “no
                            subsisting facts upon which there [could] be <em>res
                                judicata</em>” (see the Judgment at [27]) and the
                            Application thus had “no real practical value” (see
                            likewise [27] of the Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     Was Tan’s claim certain to
                        fail?</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The Judge held that if Tan’s claim was certain to
                        fail, the Application could be struck out under either O 18
                            rr 19(1)(<em>b</em>) or 19(1)(<em>d</em>). Pertinently, the Judge found that Tan’s
                        case was <em>not</em> certain to fail, and in fact
                        raised many novel issues that deserved more detailed treatment (see the
                        Judgment at [30]–[31]):</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">30    ... Tan’s
                                case was not completely without merit, especially on the ground of
                                Art 12. Furthermore, his case raised many novel issues that
                                deserved more detailed treatment, for example:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-4">(a)    whether an
                                    unconstitutional law in itself can constitute an injury or
                                    violation to one’s constitutional rights;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-4">(b)    whether Art 14
                                    can encompass a right to express one’s homosexual sexual
                                    orientation.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">31    The AG had submitted that Tan was certain to
                                fail given that he had no <em>locus standi</em>
                                to seek a declaration that s 377A of the [current] Penal Code
                                contravened the Constitution. This argument was dealt with under the
                                issue of <em>locus standi</em>. Here, the issue
                                is whether the case is so weak, as gleaned from the pleadings, that
                                it should be struck out because the result is a foregone conclusion.
                                    <b><em>This threshold has not been
                                    satisfied</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The Judge therefore did not grant the AG’s striking-out
                        application on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     Did the court have jurisdiction to declare s 377A
                        unconstitutional in view of the fact that Tan had not come to court by way
                        of s 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed)
                        (“the SCA”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The Judge reasoned that if
                        Tan’s failure to have recourse to s 56A of the SCA amounted to an
                        abuse of court process, the Application could be struck out under O 18
                            r 19(1)(<em>d</em>). While the Judge found
                        that it was more likely than not that s 56A of the SCA was meant to be
                        an exclusive regime, she also noted (at [42] of the Judgment) that it could
                        not be said that it was a “very clear case” that this was so.
                        She thus ruled that the AG’s striking-out application could not be
                        granted on this ground.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     At this juncture, we will confine ourselves to
                    a few brief preliminary remarks on the Judgment, which we will elaborate on
                    later in our decision when discussing the requirement (<em>vis-à-vis</em> applications for declaratory relief) that there must
                    be a “real controversy” for the court to resolve (see [143]
                    below). <em>The anomalous result brought about by the Judgment
                        </em><em>– specifically, the Judge’s ruling
                        that there was no real controversy to be adjudicated –
                    </em><em>is that a claim which was not certain to fail and
                        which was brought by an applicant who had</em> locus standi <em>was struck out by a court which had jurisdiction to hear the
                        claim.</em> With respect, we find it difficult to reconcile the
                    Judge’s findings that, on one hand, “Tan’s constitutional
                    rights [might] arguably have been violated” (see the Judgment at [19])
                    and “Tan’s case was not completely without merit” (see the
                    Judgment at [30]) with her finding that, on the other hand, the Application did
                    not disclose a real controversy to be adjudicated. We note that on the
                    Judge’s view, it appears that: (a) a real controversy refers solely
                    to a real controversy <em>on the facts</em>; and (b) a
                    real controversy of <em>law</em>, even one which possibly
                    has merit and which is brought by a person with <em>locus
                        standi</em>, remains within the realm of the merely
                    hypothetical.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     One of the Judge’s chief concerns in
                    coming to her conclusion that there was no real controversy to be adjudicated
                    was that subsisting facts were necessary for a judgment to be <em>res judicata</em> (see the Judgment at [25], and the Judge’s
                    reiteration at [27]), and that unless that condition was satisfied, the court
                    should not hear a matter. With respect, if this were correct, then it would
                    never be possible to seek a declaratory order on the law. In our view, this
                    would be an undesirable state of affairs. There is, undoubtedly, much value in
                    having judicial determinations in appropriate cases on debatable points of law
                    of public interest, not just for the benefit of the parties concerned, but also
                    (and primarily) for the benefit of the public. Clear judicial pronouncements on
                    what the law is help to ensure that the rule of law is upheld. The rule of law
                    requires that the law be capable of fulfilling its function of guiding the
                    behaviour of persons living under the law. For persons to be able to be guided
                    by the law and to act on it, they need to first know what the law is, and it is
                    thus essential that principles of law are correctly and authoritatively decided.
                    This is especially so where the point of law to be clarified is, as in the
                    present case, one of high constitutional importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Moreover, as <em>Zamir &amp;
                        Woolf: The Declaratory Judgment</em> (Lord Woolf &amp; Jeremy
                    Woolf eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th Ed, 2011) (“<em>Zamir &amp; Woolf</em>”) aptly states at
                    para 1-07:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A declaration by the court is not a mere opinion devoid of legal effect:
                        the controversy between the parties is determined and is res judicata as a
                        result of the declaration being granted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present case, a judicial decision on the Application would bind
                    the Government, and not just Tan. Further, such a decision would be based on the
                    underlying facts of the case, in particular, Tan’s arrest, detention and
                    charge under s 377A (see [151]–[154] below). This determination would
                    also address the Judge’s concerns about <em>res
                        judicata</em>. We thus disagree with the Judge that Tan’s claim
                    has “no real practical value” (see the Judgment at
                [27]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The following issues were raised on
                    appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Does Tan have a reasonable cause of
                        action under Art 4, given that, on the face of it, Art 4 only
                        applies to “any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement
                        of this Constitution” (“Issue 1”)? This is a new
                        issue which was raised by the AG on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Is the test for <em>locus
                            standi</em> in applications involving constitutional rights
                        different from, and less strict than, the test for <em>locus
                            standi</em> laid down in <em>Karaha
                            </em><em>Bodas</em> (“the <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em>
                        test”) (“Issue 2”)? The following sub-issues were
                        raised under this issue:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       whether a subsisting
                            prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law is a necessary
                            element to found <em>locus standi</em> to challenge
                            the constitutionality of that law; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       if there is no need for an actual
                            subsisting prosecution under the allegedly unconstitutional law to found
                                <em>locus standi</em>, whether there is at
                            least a need for a real and credible threat of prosecution, or whether
                            the very existence of the allegedly unconstitutional law in the statute
                            books suffices.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Has the applicable test for <em>locus
                            standi</em> (as determined in Issue 2) been satisfied on the
                        facts, <em>ie</em>, does Tan have <em>locus standi</em> to bring the Application
                        (“Issue 3”)? The following sub-issues were raised under
                        this issue:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       whether any constitutional
                            rights are at stake in the instant case; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_18-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       whether Tan’s
                            constitutional rights were violated on the
                    facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     Do
                        the facts of the present case raise any real controversy to be adjudicated
                        (“Issue 4”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The AG, quite correctly, is not pursuing the
                    issue of whether Tan’s failure to have recourse to the mechanism provided
                    for in s 56A of the SCA was an abuse of court process as there are no
                    longer any subsisting proceedings in the Subordinate Courts. As was the case in
                    the court below (see [31] of the Judgment), in this appeal, the AG is confining
                    his arguments on certainty of failure to Tan’s lack of <em>locus standi</em>. Therefore, the issue of certainty of failure now
                        <em>pivots</em> on the issue of <em>locus standi</em>, <em>and not on the merits of the
                        </em><em>Application</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     We add that it must be remembered that this is
                    an appeal against a striking-out order, and the threshold for striking out is a
                    high one. As this court emphasised in <em>Gabriel Peter &amp;
                        Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin </em><em>and
                        others</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 at [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As long as the statement of claim discloses some cause of action, or

                            ground for striking it out.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, in <em>The “Tokai
                        Maru”</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 646 at [44], this court

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A reasonable defence means one which has some chance of success when only
                        the allegations in the pleadings are considered: <em>per</em> Lord Pearson in <em>Drummond-Jackson
                            v British Medical Association</em> [1970] 1 All ER 1094,
                        cited with approval by Rubin J in <em>Active Timber
                            Agencies Pte Ltd v Allen &amp; Gledhill</em> [1995]
                        3 SLR(R) 334. The hearing of the [striking-out] application should
                        not therefore involve a minute examination of the documents or the facts of
                        the case in order to see whether there is a reasonable defence. To do that
                        is to usurp the position of the trial judge and the result is a trial in
                        chambers, on affidavits only, without discovery and without oral evidence
                        tested by cross-examination in the ordinary way (see <em>Wenlock v Moloney</em> [1965] 2 All ER 871).
                            <em>The mere fact that the defence is weak and not likely
                            to succeed is no ground for striking it out, so long as the pleadings
                            raise some question to be decided by the court</em> (see <em>Attorney-General </em><em>of The Duchy of
                            Lancaster v London and North Western Railway Co</em> [1892]
                        3 Ch 274). In short, the defence has to be obviously unsustainable
                        on its face to justify an application to strike out. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Therefore, all that Tan has to show is that he
                    has on the facts and law an arguable case. We add that, for the purposes of a
                    striking out application, even if the statement of claim is inadequately drawn
                    up, an opportunity to amend will be given, unless the court is satisfied that
                    the defect cannot be cured by an amendment (see see <em>Singapore

                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 2007) at para 18/19/2). This is particularly so
                    where there are substantive merits in the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Before we turn to consider the issues on
                    appeal proper, we will first set out the legislative history of s 377A so
                    as to give body to the context of our decision. In this regard, it should be
                    noted that the Indian Penal Code 1860 (Act 45 of 1860) (“the
                    IPC”), which sired Singapore’s Penal Code, was not enacted British
                    law, but rather, a code derived from British legal doctrines and policies that
                    were then viewed as necessary to maintain social order among the colony’s
                    natives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legislative history of s 377A</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Section 377A provides as follows:</p>

                    the legislative origins of s 377A, we will also examine its sister
                    provision, <em>viz</em>, s 377 of the Penal Code
                    (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985 Penal Code”).
                    Section 377 of the 1985 Penal Code (“s 377”) has now
                    been repealed (see below at [31]–[32] for the reasons for its repeal). It
                    provided as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The earliest version of s 377, which was
                    modelled on the English offence of buggery, was enacted in Singapore in 1872 by
                    the Penal Code (Ord 4 of 1871) (“the Straits Settlements Penal
                    Code”) when Singapore was part of the Straits Settlements. The Straits
                    Settlements Penal Code, which was the earliest precursor of the current Penal
                    Code, was derived from the IPC. Section 377 of the Straits Settlements
                    Penal Code was <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with s 377 of the IPC. In <em>Naz
                        Foundation v Government of NCT of Delhi and Others</em> WP(C)
                    No 7455 of 2001 (2 July 2009) (“<em>Naz</em>”), a decision of the High Court of Delhi, the court
                    considered the legislative history of s 377 of the IPC in some detail as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<em>HISTORY OF THE
                            LEGISLATION</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    ... The legislative history of [s 377 of the
                            IPC] indicates that the first records of sodomy as a crime at Common Law
                            in England were chronicled in the Fleta, 1290, and later in the Britton,
                            1300. Both texts prescribed that sodomites should be burnt alive. Acts
                            of sodomy later became penalized by hanging under the Buggery Act of
                            1533 which was re-enacted in 1563 by Queen Elizabeth I, after which
                            it became the charter for the subsequent criminalisation of sodomy in
                            the British Colonies. Oral-genital sexual acts were later removed from
                            the definition of buggery in 1817. And in 1861, the death penalty for
                            buggery was formally abolished in England and Wales. However, sodomy or
                            buggery remained as a crime “not to be mentioned by
                            Christians.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    [The IPC] was drafted by Lord Macaulay and
                            introduced in 1861 in British India. Section 377 [of the] IPC is
                            contained in Chapter XVI ... [and] is categorised under the
                            sub-chapter titled “Of Unnatural Offences”
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Pertinently, the above extract shows the
                    historical umbilical cord between the “parent” English legislation
                    and the legislation enacted in British colonies at the time. A year after
                    s 377 of the IPC was enacted, the maximum penalty for buggery in England
                    was amended from the death penalty to that of life imprisonment (see s 61
                    of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (c 100) (UK) (“the UK
                    Offences Against the Person Act 1861”)), bringing the position under
                    English law into line with that under the IPC. Following this, s 11 of the
                    Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 (c 69) (UK) (commonly known as
                    “the Labouchere Amendment” after Henry Labouchere, the Member of
                    Parliament who introduced it) was passed. Section 377A can be traced to the
                    Labouchere Amendment, which provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Any male person</em> who, in <em>public or private</em>, commits, or is a party to the commission
                        of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by <em>any male person</em> of, any act of gross indecency with another
                        male person, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof
                        shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be imprisoned for any term
                        not exceeding two years, with or without hard labour. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is clear that the Labouchere Amendment was unlike the offence of
                    buggery in two respects. First, the buggery laws were gender neutral, whereas
                    the Labouchere Amendment focused on sexual conduct between <em>male</em> homosexuals. Second, the Labouchere Amendment expressly
                    extended to private acts. The next legislative development of note came in the
                    form of a report published in 1957 (<em>viz</em>, <em>Report of the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and
                        Prostitution</em> (Cmnd 247, 1957) (Chairman: Sir John
                    Frederick Wolfenden) (“the Wolfenden Report”)), which ignited a
                    vigorous debate that eventually led to the passage of the Sexual Offences Act
                    1967 (c 60) (UK) (“the UK Sexual Offences Act 1967”).
                    The UK Sexual Offences Act 1967 amended s 12(1) of the Sexual Offences Act
                    1956 (c 69) (UK) (“the UK Sexual Offences Act 1956”) to
                    partially decriminalise consensual homosexual acts, including anal intercourse.
                    Following the enactment of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994
                    (c 33) (UK) (“the 1994 UK Act”), non-consensual anal
                    intercourse in England was classified as rape (see s 142 of the 1994 UK
                    Act). English law currently no longer criminalises consensual heterosexual and
                    homosexual anal intercourse in private, nor acts of “gross
                    indecency” in private between consenting males, subject to limits such as
                    an age of consent (see, <em>eg</em>, s 12 of the UK
                    Sexual Offences Act 1956, s 1 of the UK Sexual Offences Act 1967 as well as
                    ss 142 and 143 of the 1994 UK Act). In other words, English law no
                    longer has provisions corresponding to s 377 and s 377A in its statute
                    books. We note that on this issue, Scottish law was brought into line with that
                    of England and Wales through the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980
                    (c 62) (UK), and the law of Northern Ireland was brought into line with
                    that of the rest of the United Kingdom after the decision in <em>Dudgeon v The United Kingdom</em> [1981] ECHR 5.
                    Interestingly, of the great colonial powers of Western Europe (<em>viz</em>, Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal
                    and Spain), only Britain and France left the legacy of s 377 to its
                    colonies (see Douglas E Sanders, “377 and the Unnatural Afterlife of
                    British Colonialism in Asia” (2009) Asian Journal of Comparative Law
                    vol 4, issue 1, article 7 (“Sanders”) at p 1).
                    This, it also bears mention, happened during a period in which parallel
                    prohibitions were eliminated in the other major European colonial powers except
                    Germany (see Sanders at p 15).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Although provisions equivalent to s 377
                    were enacted in both the Straits Settlements and British India, the same cannot
                    be said of s 377A. While a provision similar to s 377A was never
                    enacted in the IPC, such a provision was enacted in the successor to the Straits
                    Settlements Penal Code (<em>viz</em>, the Penal Code
                    (Cap 20, 1936 Rev Ed) (“the 1936 Penal Code”)) by
                    s 3 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Ordinance 1938 (No 12 of 1938)
                    (“the Penal Code (Amendment) Ordinance 1938”). During the
                    second reading of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 1938 (<em>viz</em>, the Bill which was subsequently enacted as the Penal Code
                    (Amendment) Ordinance 1938) in the Straits Settlements Legislative Council,
                    Mr C G Howell (“Mr Howell”), the then
                    Attorney-General, made the following comments on the decision to enact a
                    provision <em>in pari </em><em>materia</em> with s 377A (see <em>Proceedings of
                        the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements</em> (13 June
                    1938) at p B49):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With regard to clause 4 [<em>viz</em>, the
                        clause which subsequently became s 3 of the Penal Code (Amendment)
                        Ordinance 1938], it is unfortunately the case that acts of the nature
                        described have been brought to notice. As the law now stands, such acts can
                        only be dealt with, if at all, under the Minor Offences Ordinance, and then
                            <em>only if committed in public</em>. Punishment
                        under the Ordinance is inadequate <em>and the chances of
                            detection are small</em>. <em>It is desired,
                            therefore, to strengthen the law and</em> to bring it into line
                        with English Criminal Law, from which this clause is taken, and the law of
                        various other parts of the Colonial Empire of which it is only necessary to
                        mention Hong Kong and Gibralter where conditions are somewhat similar to our
                        own. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Prior to the enactment of s 377A of the
                    1936 Penal Code, the law making “gross indecency” between male
                    homosexuals an offence only targeted public conduct, and Mr Howell’s
                    comment on how small the chances of detection were was probably stated in this
                    context. As private acts were largely out of the law’s reach,
                    Mr Howell stated that the Legislature desired to “strengthen the
                    law” (see <em>Proceedings of the Legislative Council of
                        the Straits Settlements</em> (13 June 1938) at p B49) by
                    extending it to reach the private domain. Section 377A of the 1936 Penal
                    Code thus expressly provided that acts of “gross indecency”,
                    whether committed “in public or private”, were equally to be
                    treated as offences. <em>It appears from this that the enactment
                        </em><em>of s 377A </em><em>of the 1936 Penal Code was a calculated move to criminalise private sexual
                        conduct between males.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As Mr Howell referred to the position in
                    Hong Kong, we will add a few brief words on the same. Hong Kong previously had a
                    section equivalent to s 377A in the form of s 51 of the Offences
                    Against the Person Ordinance (Cap 212, 1981 Rev Ed) (HK)
                    (“s 51”). Section 51 was located in a chapter entitled
                    “Abominable Offences”. That chapter also included the offence of
                    buggery under s 49, which, like the corresponding English provision, was
                    gender neutral. The provisions on “Abominable Offences” were
                    introduced into Hong Kong law in 1865 when the UK Offences Against the Person
                    Act 1861 was adopted. In 1983, the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong
                    (“the Commission”), in its report dated 15 April 1983
                    entitled “Laws Governing Homosexual Conduct (Topic 2)”,
                    recommended that the law should not prohibit consensual sexual conduct between
                    adults of the same sex in private (at para 11.50). The Commission defined
                    “in private” as a situation where not more than two persons were
                    present. These proposals were not implemented by the Hong Kong government. In
                    1990, with the imminent passage of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance
                    (Cap 383) (this was eventually passed in 1991), the Hong Kong Legislative
                    Council held a debate and the Chief Secretary of Hong Kong noted that the laws
                    against homosexual conduct would soon be “open to challenge under the
                    [proposed] Bill of Rights” (see <em>Hong Kong Legislative
                        Council, Official Report of Proceedings</em> (11 July, 1990)).
                    Following the debate, the Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance (No 90 of 1991) (HK)
                    was passed, decriminalising consensual sexual conduct between two homosexual
                    adults, with adults defined as persons of 21 years and above. The relevant
                    provisions of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) (HK) (“the Hong Kong
                    Crimes Ordinance”) were subsequently challenged in <em>Leung</em> (see below at [96]), and were found to be unconstitutional
                    as they infringed the right to privacy and equality. The Hong Kong Court of
                    Appeal found (at [51(2)] of <em>Leung</em>) that there was
                    no justification as to “why the minimum age requirement for buggery [was]
                    21 whereas as far as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman [was]
                    concerned, the age of consent [was] only 16”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Developments in the law have not been confined
                    to England and Hong Kong. There have also been further developments in both
                    Singapore and India with regard to the ambit of, respectively, s 377 and
                    s 377A (where Singapore is concerned) and s 377 of the IPC (where
                    India is concerned). In <em>Naz</em>, the High Court of
                    Delhi noted (at [2]) that s 377 of the IPC was extremely broad as it
                    criminalised all “sex other than heterosexual penile-vaginal
                    [sex]”. Further, consent was not a defence, and there were no
                    distinctions made as to the age of the participants. Acts which amounted to
                    “sexual perversity” (see <em>Calvin Francis v
                        Orissa</em> 1992 (2) Crimes 455 and <em>Fazal </em><em>Rab </em><em>Choudhary v State of Bihar</em> AIR 1983 SC 323),
                    including oral sex, anal sex and penetration of other orifices (see <em>Lohana </em><em>Vasantlal </em><em>Devchand and others v The State</em> AIR 1968
                    Guj 252), were caught by s 377 of the IPC. This would have included
                    both <em>heterosexual and homosexual</em> oral sex and anal
                    sex. We note that based on such an interpretation (as applied to the Singapore
                    context), s 377A may be seen as a subset of s 377, covering a specific
                    class of persons, <em>viz</em>, men who participate in
                    sexual conduct with other men. In <em>Naz</em>, the court
                    (at [132]) read down s 377 of the IPC to only govern “<em>non-consensual</em> penile non-vaginal sex and penile
                    non-vaginal sex involving <em>minors</em>” [emphasis
                    added]. We note that <em>Naz</em> has since been challenged
                    through public interest litigation before the Supreme Court of India, and at the
                    time of writing this judgment, the appeal has yet to be
                determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In Singapore, the predecessor versions of
                    s 377 and s 377A were absorbed unchanged into the Penal Code
                    (Cap 119, 1955 Rev Ed). As alluded to above at [24], s 377 was
                    subsequently repealed by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (Act 51 of
                    2007) (“the 2007 Amendment Act”). During the parliamentary debates
                    on 22 and 23 October 2007 (“the October 2007 parliamentary
                    debates”) regarding the Bill which later became the 2007 Amendment Act

                    (Bill 38 of 2007)), the then Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs,
                    Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee (“Assoc Prof Ho”), explained the
                    decision to repeal s 377 as follows (see <em>Singapore

                        will be criminalised, that is, bestiality (sexual acts with an animal) and
                        necrophilia (sexual acts with a corpse).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It can thus be seen that the over-breadth of
                    s 377, which criminalised consensual <em>heterosexual</em> oral and anal sex in private, was a key reason for
                    its repeal. The gender neutrality of s 377 was affirmed in <em>Public Prosecutor v Kwan Kwong </em><em>Weng</em> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 316 (“<em>Kwan
                        Kwong </em><em>Weng</em>”), which held (at
                    [17]) that s 377 was an “all-embracing provision concerning
                    ‘unnatural offences’”. The scope of s 377 was clarified
                    by this court to cover more than just the offences of sodomy and bestiality (at
                    [17]), and to include <em>consensual</em> fellatio between
                    a man and a woman where fellatio did not lead to consensual sexual intercourse
                    (at [31]). Where fellatio was a substitute for “natural sexual
                    intercourse”, the woman’s consent to perform the act of fellatio
                    “[could not] save it from being an offence under s 377” (at
                    [32]). <em>Kwan Kwong </em><em>Weng</em> was followed in the later case of <em>Annis
                        bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</em> [2003] SGDC 290
                        (“<em>Annis bin Abdullah</em>”), which
                    Assoc Prof Ho referred to in the October 2007 parliamentary debates (see
                    above at [31]). In <em>Annis bin Abdullah</em>, the accused
                    engaged in the act of fellatio with a female (“the complainant”).
                    The fellatio did not lead to sexual intercourse. The complainant subsequently
                    lodged a police report, and the accused was charged under s 377. He pleaded
                    guilty, and was convicted and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment, a
                    sentence which was subsequently lowered to one year’s imprisonment on
                    appeal (see <em>Annis bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2004] 2 SLR(R) 93). The charge sheet and the statement of facts
                    stated that the complainant was 16 years old at the time of the offence. While
                    there was a side issue regarding the complainant’s age (it was
                    subsequently revealed that the charge sheet and the statement of facts were
                    erroneous, and that the complainant was actually 15, rather than 16, years old
                    at the time of the offence), this had no effect on the accused’s
                    conviction under s 377. The complainant’s age would only have been
                    relevant to the accused’s conviction if the complainant’s consent
                    had been a defence to the charge under s 377 (the age of consent is 16
                    years of age). Pursuant to <em>Kwan Kwong </em><em>Weng</em>, the District Court in <em>Annis bin
                        Abdullah</em> held (at [2]) that consent was irrelevant to a charge
                    under s 377 where fellatio was performed “as a substitute for
                    natural sexual intercourse”. Nonetheless, the fact that the complainant
                    had voluntarily performed fellatio on the accused was published by the media,
                    leading to an intense public debate (see, <em>eg</em>,
                    Tanya Fong &amp; Glenys Sim, “Oral sex ruling vexes many”
                    <em>The Straits Times</em> (8 November 2003) at
                    p H1). The tenor of the views publicly expressed was largely supportive of
                    the repeal of s 377, and this did not go unnoticed by the Legislature,
                    which consequentially undertook the updating of the 1985 Penal Code to
                    “reflect societal norms and values” (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em>
                    (22 October 2007) vol 83 at col 2198). The archaic wording of
                    s 377 was also found to be too vague to be effective, and more precise
                    provisions were enacted to cover cases which were thought to be deserving of
                    criminal sanction and which would formerly have been within the ambit of
                    s 377 (see now ss 376A–376G and 377B of the current Penal
                    Code).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As is well known, and as the facts of the
                    present case attest, while s 377 was repealed by the 2007 Amendment Act,
                    the then equivalent of s 377A (<em>viz</em>,
                    s 377A of the 1985 Penal Code) was retained. While it was uncontroversial
                    that the 2007 Amendment Act was timely and necessary, the issue which attracted
                    the most press and public debate was, ironically, a non-amendment, <em>viz</em>, the retention of the then equivalent of
                    s 377A. With this overview of the relevant legislative history in place, we
                    will proceed to examine the issues on appeal set out at [18]
                above.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As noted above, what has to be ascertained
                    with regard to Issue 1 is whether Tan has a reasonable cause of action
                    under Art 4, given that, on the face of it, Art 4 only applies to
                    “any law enacted by the Legislature <em>after the
                        commencement of this Constitution</em>” [emphasis added]. This
                    is a new issue raised on appeal by the AG that was not before the Judge. The
                    crux of this issue is whether laws enacted prior to the commencement of the
                    Constitution can also be voided under Art 4 (hereafter called “the
                    Art 4 issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The AG’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On behalf of the AG, Mr Abdullah contends
                    that Art 4 <em>cannot</em> be relied on to invalidate
                    s 377A. Given that s 377A was enacted (in the form of s 377A of
                    the 1936 Penal Code) by the Penal Code (Amendment) Ordinance 1938 (see above at
                    [27]), <em>ie</em>, well <em>before</em> the commencement of the Constitution on 9 August
                    1965, Mr Abdullah submits that Tan may not rely on Art 4 to have
                    s 377A declared void. Mr Abdullah thus submits that the Application
                    discloses no reasonable cause of action under Art 4 and must be struck out
                    under O 18 r 19(1)(<em>a</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     According to Mr Abdullah, the proper
                    constitutional provision under which a constitutional challenge against
                    s 377A can be brought is Art 162 of the Constitution
                    (“Art 162”). He emphasises that the material difference
                    between Art 4 and Art 162 is that <em>only</em>
                    the former provides for the voiding of unconstitutional laws. While
                    Mr Abdullah concedes that it is open to Tan to argue for the modification,
                        <em>etc</em>, of s 377A under Art 162, he
                    contends that it is incumbent on Tan to distinctly state the modification,
                        <em>etc</em>, which he seeks in the Application itself
                    as his standing depends on the precise modification, <em>etc</em>, sought. As Tan did not do so in the Application,
                    Mr Abdullah argues that it is “fatally deficient, discloses no
                    reasonable cause of action, and ought to be struck out”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tan’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Before us, Mr Ravi stated that he did not
                    intend to address the Art 4 issue as it was a new point which was raised
                    only on appeal. As such, he confined himself to stating that Art 4 stressed
                    the supremacy of the Constitution and that Art 162 should be read subject
                    to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our analysis and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As noted above at [34], the Art 4 issue
                    is a new issue that the AG has raised on appeal. Under O 57
                        r 9A(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Rules, where a party
                    intends to introduce on appeal a new point not taken in the court below, it is
                    incumbent on that party to state this clearly in its Case. This was not done in
                    the present appeal: the Respondent’s Case filed by the AG does not clearly
                    disclose the Art 4 issue as a new point. Be that as it may, O 57
                    r 13(4) of the Rules provides that even if the requirements of O 57
                    r 9A are not met, this court may make “any order, on such terms as
                    the Court thinks just, to ensure the determination on the merits of the real
                    question in controversy between the parties”. An appellate court should
                    only hear a new point on appeal where it is competent <em>and</em> where it is “expedient, in the interests of
                    justice” to do so (see <em>Connecticut Fire Insurance
                        Company v Kavanagh</em> [1982] AC 473 at 480 (cited in
                        <em>Feoso (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Faith Maritime Co
                        Ltd</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 556 (“<em>Feoso</em>”) at [28])). One of the factors going to an
                    appellate court’s competency to hear a new point on appeal is whether the
                    new point can be disposed of without deciding questions of fact (see <em>Feoso</em> at [28]). If the new point cannot be disposed of
                    without deciding questions of fact, the appellate court will be in a less
                    advantageous position to determine that point than the court below. In the
                    present case, the Art 4 issue is purely a question of law, and given that
                    it is a novel issue of constitutional interpretation, we find that it is
                    expedient and in the interests of justice for us to proceed to determine the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Article 162 of the Constitution of
                    Malaysia provides for two avenues to deal with existing laws that are
                    unconstitutional. The first, provided for by Art 162(1), is legislative
                    – such laws may be repealed by legislation. The second, provided for by
                    Art 162(6), is judicial – such laws may be applied by the courts with
                    the necessary modifications to bring them into accord with the Constitution of
                    Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We note that there are four differences
                    between the wording of Art 162 of the Constitution of Singapore and its
                    Malaysian counterpart. The first difference is relatively minor, namely, that
                    Art 162 of the Constitution of Singapore only expressly provides for
                    judicial interpretation and makes no mention of legislative repeal. We find this
                    difference to be minor as it is trite that the Singapore legislature has the
                    power to repeal or modify any law (Arts 38 and 58 of the Constitution of
                    Singapore vest the legislative power in Singapore’s legislature), and this
                    must apply with particular force where the law in question is unconstitutional.
                    The second difference is that Art 162 of the Constitution of Singapore
                    provides that all laws shall be <em>construed</em> with the
                    necessary modifications, <em>etc</em>, to bring them into
                    conformity with the Constitution, whereas Art 162(6) of the Constitution of
                    Malaysia speaks instead of <em>applying</em> existing laws
                    with the necessary modifications. As both the construction and the application
                    of the law involve a process of judicial interpretation, we do not find this
                    difference to be material. The third difference is that Art 162 of the
                    Constitution of Singapore provides that the courts <em>shall</em> construe all laws with the necessary modifications,
                        <em>etc</em>, to bring them into conformity with the
                    Constitution, whereas Art 162(6) of the Constitution of Malaysia provides
                    that the courts <em>may</em> apply existing laws with the
                    necessary modifications. This difference may be more apparent than real as the
                    word “may” was interpreted by the Privy Council in <em>B Surinder Singh </em><em>Kanda
                        </em><em>v </em><em>The Government
                        of the Federation of Malaya</em> [1962] MLJ 169
                        (“<em>Surinder Singh</em>”) (at 171)
                    to mean “must”, which aligns the positions under the two
                    Constitutions in this respect. The fourth difference is that the Singapore
                    courts’ power of modification, <em>etc</em>, under
                    Art 162 of the Constitution of Singapore applies to <em>all</em> laws, and is thus broader than the Malaysian courts’
                    corresponding power under Art 162(6) of the Constitution of Malaysia, which
                    is expressly limited to “<em>existing</em>
                    law” [emphasis added]. For our purposes, the relevance of this fourth
                    difference is that it shows that under the Constitution of Singapore, there is
                    no stark dichotomy between the Singapore courts’ power to deal with,
                    respectively, unconstitutional <em>existing</em> laws and
                    unconstitutional laws enacted <em>after</em> the
                    commencement of the Constitution. Both types of laws fall under Art 162 and
                    can be construed with the appropriate modifications, <em>etc</em>, to bring them into conformity with the Constitution. The
                    question that we now have to decide is whether both types of laws also fall
                    under Art 4 such that they can be held to be void to the extent of their
                    inconsistency with the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     While this is the first time that the
                    Singapore courts have had to confront the Art 4 issue, it has previously
                    arisen for decision in Malaysia. We will thus begin by considering the line of
                    Malaysian cases which have interpreted the equivalent provisions of Art 4
                    and Art 162 in the Constitution of Malaysia. While we have noted certain
                    differences between the relevant constitutional provisions of Singapore and
                    Malaysia (see above at [46]), we find that these differences do not detract from
                    the Malaysian cases as a helpful reference point. These cases were not cited to
                    us by the AG, perhaps because they do not speak with one voice. Upon a close
                    scrutiny, we find that the tenor of these cases <em>does
                        not</em> go so far as to support the position contended for by the AG.
                    We now proceed to analyse these cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In <em>Surinder
                        Singh</em>, the applicant, a police inspector, challenged his
                    dismissal as being unconstitutional for a failure to adhere to the
                    constitutionally-stipulated procedure. For our purposes, the relevant issue in
                        <em>Surinder Singh</em> arose from two sets of
                    legislation prescribing conflicting procedures for the dismissal of police
                    officers. There is a need to go into a fair level of detail to appreciate the
                    import of the case. The overarching framework for the dismissal of members of
                    the police service was stipulated in Art 135(1) of the Constitution of
                    Malaysia, which provided that such dismissal could only be carried out by a
                    person who had the power at that time to also appoint officers of the same rank
                    as that of the officer whom he sought to dismiss. In other words, the power of
                    appointment and the power of dismissal went hand in hand. The Privy Council thus
                    had to determine who had the authority to appoint persons of the
                    applicant’s rank. Here is where we come to the two conflicting sets of
                    legislation. The first set consisted of ss 9(1) and 45(1) of the Police
                    Ordinance 1952 (M’sia) (“the Police Ordinance 1952”), an
                    existing law which pre-dated the Constitution of Malaysia. Section 9(1) of
                    the Police Ordinance 1952 provided that the Commissioner of Police could appoint
                    superior police officers, including police inspectors, and s 45(1) provided
                    that the Commissioner of Police could dismiss (<em>inter
                        alia</em>) police inspectors. The second set of provisions was
                    constitutional, <em>viz</em>, Arts 140(1) and 144(1)
                    of the Constitution of Malaysia. Article 140(1) set up the Police Service
                    Commission, and Art 144(1) provided that it had the duty to appoint members
                    of the police service. As the applicant had been dismissed by the Commissioner
                    of Police rather than the Police Service Commission, the procedure for dismissal
                    had failed to comply with the constitutional provisions, and this was the source
                    of the applicant’s complaint. However, his dismissal was in line with the
                    existing law (<em>viz</em>, s 45(1) of the Police
                    Ordinance 1952). Given that Art 144(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia
                    expressly provided that it was “<em>[s]ubject to the
                        provisions of any existing law</em>” [emphasis added], the
                    respondent in <em>Surinder Singh</em> argued that the
                    Constitution of Malaysia was subject to the existing law, and not <em>vice versa</em>. Therefore, it was sufficient that the
                    applicant’s dismissal had been in line with the existing law, even though
                    this inevitably led to a failure to comply with the conflicting constitutional
                    provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     This argument was rejected by the Privy
                    Council. Lord Denning, who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council in
                        <em>Surinder Singh</em>, unequivocally upheld the
                    supremacy of the Constitution of Malaysia, stating (at 171):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In a conflict of this kind between the existing law and the Constitution
                            [<em>viz</em>, the Constitution of Malaysia],
                            <em>the Constitution must prevail</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, to give effect to the Constitution of Malaysia, the
                    court’s power under Art 162(6) was exercised to apply the existing
                    law with such modifications as were necessary to bring it into accord with the
                    Constitution of Malaysia. As noted earlier at [46] above, the Privy Council
                    stated (at 171) that modification of unconstitutional law “must”
                    be carried out. On the facts of the case, the necessary modification applied was
                    that since Merdeka Day, it was the Police Service Commission, and not the
                    Commissioner of Police, that had the power to appoint members of the police
                    service. As the applicant had been dismissed by the Commissioner of Police, his
                    dismissal was void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     We observe that the Privy Council’s
                    “modification” to the existing law in <em>Surinder
                        Singh</em> involved a substitution <em>in
                        toto</em> of the words “Police Service Commission” in
                    place of the words “Commissioner of Police”. This demonstrates a
                    broad understanding of the court’s power of modification. The breadth of
                    the court’s power of modification meant that the Privy Council did not
                    have to consider a situation where modification of an existing law was
                    impossible, and whether, in such a case, that law could be voided under
                    Art 4 of the Constitution of Malaysia, an argument which was raised in the
                    later case of <em>Assa Singh v Mentri </em><em>Besar, Johore</em> [1969] 2 MLJ 30
                        (“<em>Assa Singh</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     
          <em>Assa Singh</em> also
                    involved the alleged unconstitutionality of an existing law. The applicant in
                    that case had argued that modification of the relevant law under Art 162(6)
                    of the Constitution of Malaysia was impossible because it would involve a
                    complete re-writing of that law. While the Federal Court of Malaysia agreed with
                    the applicant that the existing law in question was inconsistent with a
                    constitutional provision, the court unanimously found that modification was
                    possible. The relevant constitutional provisions were thus read into the
                    existing law to bring it into line with the Constitution of Malaysia. Therefore,
                    the court’s comments on the Art 4 issue were <em>obiter</em>. Ong Hock Thye CJ (Malaya) opined (at 35D) that
                    since Art 4 of the Constitution of Malaysia only spoke of laws passed after
                    Merdeka Day, “the validity or otherwise of the pre-Merdeka [law] w[ould]
                    have to be considered solely by reference to article 162”.
                    Ong CJ went on to affirm the distinction between Arts 4 and 162 of the
                    Constitution of Malaysia, namely, that Art 162 did not provide for the
                    voiding of unconstitutional laws (at 35E, quoting from the submissions of
                    the respondent in <em>Assa Singh</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As to post-Merdeka law, the Constitution [<em>viz</em>, the Constitution of Malaysia] is supreme and if any of
                        that law is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, to the
                        extent of such inconsistency that law shall be void –
                        article 4(1). But as regards pre-Merdeka law, such law shall continue
                        to be in force until repealed; in the meantime its continuity and
                        enforceability is subject to modi?cation, ?rstly, by a Legislative Act or
                        Enactment or, secondly, by process of judicial interpretation, the executive
                        order of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to modify the same having expired –
                        article 162(1) and (6). It must be noted that article 162 does not
                        use the expression that pre-Merdeka law shall be void to the extent of the
                        inconsistency but, instead, it expressly states that the law shall continue
                        to be in force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In so far as Ong CJ’s comments
                    relate to the differences between Arts 4 and 162 of the Constitution of
                    Malaysia, and how Art 162 does not <em>itself</em>
                    provide for the voiding of unconstitutional laws, we share his views. We note,
                    however, that while Ong CJ said that unconstitutional existing laws would
                    continue in force until and unless they were modified by the Legislature (under
                    Art 162(1)) or by the Judiciary (under Art 162(6)) where a
                    constitutional challenge was brought, he did not discuss the extent of the
                    court’s powers when faced with an unconstitutional existing law which
                        <em>could not be modified</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Suffian FJ echoed Ong CJ by stating
                    (at 40A of <em>Assa Singh</em>) that any existing law
                    prior to Merdeka Day would continue in force on and after Merdeka Day
                    “even if it [was] inconsistent with the Constitution [of
                    Malaysia]”. He referred to <em>Surinder Singh</em>
                    in support of this proposition, stating that the relevant legislation in
                        <em>Surinder Singh</em> had openly conflicted with the
                    Constitution of Malaysia, and yet, it had not been held to be void. As noted
                    above, the reason why the relevant existing law in <em>Surinder
                        Singh</em> was not held to be void was that this was not necessary
                    after the modification was effected. As such, we understand Suffian FJ to
                    be saying that existing laws which are inconsistent with the Constitution of
                    Malaysia will remain in force <em>until a constitutional
                        challenge is mounted against them</em>. Once such a challenge is
                    mounted, if the law is found to be unconstitutional, the courts must then remedy
                    the unconstitutionality by making the necessary modifications (see <em>Surinder Singh</em> at 171). Further, given that
                        <em>Surinder Singh</em> held that an action taken under
                    an unconstitutional law was void, Suffian FJ cannot be understood as saying
                    that actions taken under unconstitutional laws would be allowed to have effect.
                    We also note that Raja Azlan Shah J stated in <em>Assa
                        Singh</em> that while existing laws were not allowed to stand in the
                    way of the exercise of fundamental rights, such inconsistent laws “[were]
                    not wiped off the statute book” (at 46C) as to do so “would
                    be to give fundamental rights a retrospective effect which the law [held] they
                    [had] not” (likewise at 46C). Such inconsistent laws would instead
                    be unenforceable. We respectfully diverge from this view as we find that the
                    modification or voiding of an existing law which impinges on
                    constitutionally-protected fundamental rights does not give such rights a
                    retrospective effect so long as the action to modify or void that law is taken
                    after the Constitution in question comes into effect. Once a Constitution comes
                    into effect, the protection of the fundamental rights guaranteed by that
                    Constitution also comes into effect. There is nothing
                    “retrospective” about this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     
          <em>Assa Singh</em> was
                    applied in the later case of <em>Jamaluddin bin Mohd
                        </em><em>Radzi &amp; Ors v Sivakumar a/l Varatharaju
                        Naidu </em><em>(claimed as Yang Dipertua
                        </em><em>Dewan </em><em>Negeri
                        Perak Darul </em><em>Ridzuan), Election Commission,
                        intervener</em> [2009] 4 MLJ 593 (“<em>Jamaluddin</em>”). <em>Jamaluddin</em>
                    also involved an existing law, <em>viz</em>, a provision of
                    the Constitution of the Malaysian state of Perak. The Federal Court of Malaysia
                    referred to Ong CJ’s holdings in <em>Assa
                        Singh</em> (see above at [51]) in support of the finding (at [8] of
                        <em>Jamaluddin</em>) that “[p]re-Merdeka laws
                    [could] never be declared as void”. With respect, we find this conclusion
                    rather puzzling, given that Ong CJ did <em>not</em>
                    say in <em>Assa Singh</em> that pre-Merdeka laws could
                    never be declared to be void. What Ong CJ appeared to say was that
                    pre-Merdeka laws could not be voided <em>under the regime of
                        Art 162 of the Constitution of Malaysia</em>. Further, there is
                    difficulty reconciling the court’s stance in <em>Jamaluddin</em> with the unequivocal view expressed by the Privy
                    Council in <em>Surinder Singh</em> (see above at
                    [49]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In our view, apart from <em>Jamaluddin</em>, the Malaysian cases cannot be taken as support for
                    the AG’s contention that existing laws can never be voided under
                    Art 4. As we explained in the preceding paragraph, it appears that
                        <em>Jamaluddin</em> is itself out of kilter with the
                    approach adopted in earlier cases such as <em>Surinder
                        Singh</em> and <em>Assa Singh</em>. We align
                    ourselves with the latter two cases, and find that while those two cases hold
                    that modification of unconstitutional existing laws must be carried out, this is
                    only in so far as modification is possible. <em>Surinder
                        Singh</em> and <em>Assa Singh</em> leave open the
                    position which the courts should take where modification is impossible,
                        <em>viz</em>, whether the courts can then void the
                    unconstitutional existing law under Art 4. It is this question that we must
                    now turn to, looking at the Constitution of Singapore. Before we do so, we note
                    that our views correspond with those of the authors of the <em>Report of the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Commission</em>
                    (11 February 1957) (Chairman: Lord Reid) (“the Reid
                    Report”) and also with those of leading constitutional experts who have
                    studied the Constitution of Malaysia. The Reid Report at para 161
                    recommended the inclusion of fundamental rights in the Constitution of Malaysia
                    as only a Constitution, as the supreme law, was able to guarantee fundamental
                    rights:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The guarantee afforded by the Constitution [of Malaysia] <em>is the supremacy of the law</em> and the power and duty
                        of the Courts to enforce these rights and to annul any attempt to subvert
                        any of them whether by legislative or administrative action or otherwise.

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The same point was noted by Datuk Ahmad
                    Ibrahim (see “Interpreting the Constitution: Some General
                    Principles” in <em>The Constitution of Malaysia, Further
                        Perspectives and Developments: Essays in honour of Tun Mohamed
                        Suffian</em> (F A Trindade &amp; H P Lee eds)
                    (Oxford University Press, 1986) at p 19), who commented that the Reid
                    Report took the view that fundamental rights must be guaranteed by the
                    Constitution of Malaysia as the guarantee afforded by that Constitution was the
                    supremacy of the law. In the commentary on Art 162 of the Constitution of
                    Malaysia in Dato K C Vohrah, Philip T N Koh &amp; Peter
                    S W Ling, <em>Sheridan &amp; Groves: The Constitution
                        of Malaysia</em> (Malayan Law Journal, 5th Ed, 2004), <em>Surinder Singh</em> is cited (at p 708) for the
                    proposition that “inconsistent existing laws must give way to the
                    Constitution [of Malaysia] even where an Article or the Constitution [of
                    Malaysia] was expressed to be ‘subject to existing laws’”.
                    R H Hickling, <em>Malaysian Public Law</em>
                    (Pelanduk Publications, 1997) at p 50 also refers to <em>Surinder Singh</em> as upholding the supremacy of the Constitution of
                    Malaysia. The strongest statement of support for our view comes from Harry
                    E Groves, <em>The Constitution of Malaysia</em>
                    (Malaysia Publications, 1964), who wrote that the Constitution of Malaysia
                    continued existing laws “provided such laws were not inconsistent with
                    [that] Constitution” (at p 36), and that existing laws which were
                    inconsistent with the Constitution of Malaysia and which “[had] not been
                    modified in one of the available ways <em>must be held
                        void</em>” [emphasis added] (at p 37, citing <em>Surinder Singh</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The position in Singapore with regard to the Art 4
                issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     As mentioned earlier (see above at [47]), this
                    is the first time that the Art 4 issue has arisen for decision by our
                    courts. While our courts have modified existing laws to bring them into
                    conformity with the Constitution pursuant to Art 162, thus far, there have
                    not been any decisions on whether existing laws can be voided under
                    Art 4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     This is an important issue as Art 162 may
                    not provide an adequate remedy in every case. While Art 162 imposes a duty
                    on the courts to construe modifications, <em>etc</em>, into
                    unconstitutional existing laws, it is clear that there are <em>limits</em> to construction. It is a trite principle of statutory
                    construction that the interpretation adopted cannot be inconsistent with the
                    express statutory wording. The same goes for the construction of constitutional
                    provisions. In our view, Art 162 only directs that all laws be read in
                    conformity with the Constitution <em>as far as this is
                        possible</em>. Even so, it will be remembered that the Malaysian
                    courts’ power of “modification” under Art 162(6) of the
                    Constitution of Malaysia was given a wide scope in <em>Surinder
                        Singh</em> (see above at [50]). It seems to us that a similarly broad
                    reading of the power of modification under Art 162 should likewise be
                    adopted in Singapore, given that the distinction between “apply”
                    in Art 162(6) of the Constitution of Malaysia and “construed”
                    in Art 162 of the Constitution of Singapore is not a material one (see
                    above at [46]). Further, there are hints in our case law that a similar breadth
                    might be accorded to Art 162. For instance, in <em>Butterworth &amp; Co (Publishers) Ltd and others v Ng Sui Nam</em>
                    [1985–1986] SLR(R) 33, an existing statute was construed so as to be in
                    line with the Constitution even though this “[led] to a somewhat bizarre
                    result” (at [25]). As such, it may well be an exceptional case where the
                    necessary modifications, <em>etc</em>, cannot be effected
                    to bring an unconstitutional law into line with the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In the event that construing a modification
                    into an unconstitutional law is impossible, the supremacy of the Constitution
                    must continue to be upheld, and the offending legislation will be struck down
                    under Art 162 read harmoniously with Art 4. <em>To the
                        extent that any law does not conform to and cannot be reconciled with the
                        Constitution through a process of construction, it is void.</em>
                    Article 4 provides for the unconstitutional portion of the law to be
                    severed while retaining the remaining part of the law in the statute books. In
                    other words, the court’s power to void laws for inconsistency with the
                    Constitution under Art 4 <em>can</em> be interpreted
                    to include the power to void laws which <em>pre-date</em>
                    the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In our view, this interpretation of Art 4
                    is consistent with Art 162. A purposive approach towards the interpretation
                    of these two constitutional provisions should be adopted pursuant to s 9A
                    read with s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed).
                    Section 9A(1) provides that an interpretation which promotes “the
                    purpose or object underlying the written law … shall be preferred to an
                    interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object”, and
                    s 2 includes the Constitution in the definition of “written
                    law”. Article 4 provides for one of the most important features of
                    the Constitution, <em>viz</em>, that it is the supreme law
                    of Singapore. The supremacy of the Constitution is necessary for the purposes of
                    the Constitution to be protected as it ensures that the institutions created by
                    the Constitution are governed by the rule of law, and that the fundamental
                    liberties under the Constitution are guaranteed. Therefore, we find that the
                    supremacy of the Constitution cannot be dependent on when a law was enacted:
                    constitutional supremacy must apply equally both to laws which pre-date and laws
                    which post-date the enactment of the Constitution (see <em>Surinder Singh</em> above at [49]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     On our understanding, Art 4 and
                    Art 162 <em>share this overarching aim of upholding the
                        supremacy of the Constitution</em>. Nonetheless, the two Articles
                        <em>have different, although not conflicting, means of doing
                        so</em>. As stated above (at [52]), we agree with Ong CJ’s
                    observation in <em>Assa Singh</em> that there is a
                    difference between the two Articles, and that Art 162 does not itself
                    provide for the voiding of unconstitutional laws. Article 162 is clearly a
                    transitional provision which specifically deals with existing laws (in the
                    Constitution, Art 162 is found under Part XIV, which is headed
                    “Transitional Provisions”). The purpose of Art 162 was to
                    expressly provide for the continuity of existing laws in order to:
                    (a) prevent lacunas in the law from arising as a result of the doctrine of
                    implied repeal; and (b) eliminate the need to re-enact the entire corpus of
                    existing laws when Singapore became an independent republic. At the time when
                    the Constitution of Malaysia and the Constitution of Singapore were respectively
                    enacted, the two States already each had a system of law in place: an existing
                    corpus of legislation as well as the common law. While the respective
                    Constitutions vested the legislative power of the States in their respective
                    newly-constituted Legislatures, these new legislative organs could not, within a
                    reasonable period of time, provide the respective States with the complete
                    framework of law necessary for the functioning of the States. Therefore, it was
                    necessary to provide that the existing laws remained in force, and Art 162
                    was enacted in Singapore for this purpose. In addition to preserving existing
                    laws, Art 162 also provides for the supremacy of the Constitution to be
                    upheld by stipulating that all laws (including existing laws) shall be construed
                    in conformity with the Constitution. Given that Art 162 is concerned with
                    preserving existing laws while keeping them in line with the Constitution
                    through implementing the necessary modifications, <em>etc</em>, there is no need for it to also provide for the power to
                        <em>void</em> unconstitutional existing laws as this is
                    not within the ambit of its subject matter. The fact that Art 162 does not
                    itself provide for the voiding of unconstitutional existing law does not mean
                    that such law cannot be voided under another provision, <em>viz</em>, Art 4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     To hold otherwise, in accordance with the
                    AG’s argument, means that when the limits of statutory construction are
                    reached, a law will survive despite being in conflict with the Constitution.
                    While this appears to have been the view in <em>Assa
                        Singh</em>, as we have explained (see above at [52]–[53]), the
                    unconstitutional law will only survive <em>as long as</em>
                    the Legislature and/or the Judiciary do not take measures to bring the law into
                    line with the Constitution. We add that we find it counter-intuitive that the
                    Constitution would itself provide (via Art 162) that unconstitutional laws
                    which have existed in our statute books since before 9 August 1965 –
                    and which have infringed constitutional rights since that time – are
                    preserved in our statute books. This cannot be the case. We thus find that the
                    mere accident of vintage should not place an unconstitutional law which
                    pre-dates the Constitution beyond the potency of Art 4.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Additional support for our view is found in
                    the <em>Report of the Constitutional Commission</em>
                    (27 August 1966) (Chairman: Wee Chong Jin CJ) (“the Wee
                    Report”) and the parliamentary debates on the Wee Report. The Wee Report
                    recommended at para 73 that a constitutional supremacy clause should be
                    included in the Constitution:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the recommendations that we have made in the earlier Chapters of this
                        Report are to be meaningful and to be effective safeguards against the abuse
                        of majority power, then it is necessary that the Constitution must also
                        contain a provision which requires more than ordinary legislation for
                        altering any of its provisions. We also think it is desirable, <em>for the avoidance of doubts as to the status of the
                            Constitution as the supreme law</em>, to spell out in the
                        Constitution itself that it is the supreme law of Singapore and that if
                            <em>any other law is inconsistent with it, that other law
                            shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The supremacy clause is found today in Art 4. As can be seen, the
                    reason for the inclusion of the supremacy clause was to ensure that the
                    Constitution managed to perform its functions of, in the words of para 73
                    of the Wee Report, providing “meaningful” protection of
                    fundamental rights (the subject matter of the recommendations in the Wee Report)
                    and ensuring “effective safeguards against the abuse of majority
                    power”. This accords with our view (see above at [60]) that the supremacy
                    of the Constitution is necessary for the purposes of the Constitution to be
                    protected. We note that when the Wee Report was debated in Parliament, one
                    Member of Parliament, Mr Ho Kah Leong, expressed his understanding of the
                    report on this issue in the following manner (see <em>Singapore
                        Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (15 March 1967)
                    vol 25 at col 1305):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [Wee Report] has also advanced constructive recommendations such as
                        those relating to provisions which will ensure the Constitution as the
                        supreme law in the Republic of Singapore, and <em>any other
                            law</em> which contradicts the Constitution will be invalid.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, “any other law” is clearly broad enough to
                    cover existing laws. While there was no discussion in the parliamentary debate
                    on the Wee Report as to whether unconstitutional existing laws could be declared
                    invalid, we note that there were no proclamations to the contrary. If existing
                    laws had been thought to be an exception to the supremacy of the Constitution,
                    one would expect such an important point to have been debated specifically in
                    Parliament, particularly when the debate on the Wee Report spanned four days
                    (from 14 to 17 March 1967). It is also worth noting that although there was
                    debate on the <em>method</em> of entrenchment that should
                    be employed in the Constitution, there was unanimity over the need for
                    entrenchment. The reason for the entrenchment of constitutional provisions was
                    stated by the then Minister for Law and National Development,
                    Mr E W Barker, as follows: “<em>the
                        Constitution is to be the supreme law of the land and its status as such is
                        to be protected</em>” [emphasis added] (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (17 March
                    1967) vol 25 at cols 1438–1439).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We ought to add that <em>even
                        if</em> the AG is right such that Art 162 alone applies to any
                    issue relating to the constitutionality of s 377A on the basis that it is
                    an existing law, it is plain that the AG’s objection can be met by a
                    simple amendment to the Application. The AG’s case is simply that since
                    the Application makes no express reference to the modification, <em>etc</em>, sought under Art 162, it should be struck out.
                    We see absolutely no merit in this argument as a ground for striking out the
                    Application as it is an arid procedural objection. It is trite that a court will
                    not strike out proceedings if they can be procedurally remedied by an amendment
                    (see above at [21]). In this case, even assuming that Art 162 is the only
                    relevant route by which the constitutionality of s 377A can be challenged,
                    a court would readily give Tan leave to include a prayer based on Art 162
                    in the Application were it necessary to do so. In short, the AG’s
                    objection on this aspect of the Application is readily curable procedurally and
                    does not address the pith and substance of the matter. Therefore, even though we
                    find that Tan may rely on Art 4, it would not matter even if we had agreed
                    with the AG on the Art 4 issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     We turn now to Issue 2, <em>viz</em>, what test for <em>locus
                        standi</em> is to be applied in cases involving constitutional rights.
                    The determination of the applicable test for <em>locus
                        standi</em> in this specific context is logically a prior issue to the
                    determination of whether that test has been satisfied on the facts of this case
                    (which is Issue 3).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tan’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Mr Ravi submits that the <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em> test for
                    standing is satisfied on the facts of the present case. In the alternative, he
                    submits that even if the <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em> test is not satisfied, Tan still has standing by way of an
                    exception to the <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em> test. For the purposes of Issue 2, we are interested
                    in whether this alternative submission, which is set out in the next paragraph,
                    is open to Mr Ravi.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Mr Ravi interprets <em>Eng
                        Foong </em><em>Ho </em><em>and

                        </em><em>Ho</em>”) as laying down the
                    proposition that a <em>lower</em> threshold of standing is
                    applicable in constitutional cases by way of an exception to the <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em> test. He even
                    goes so far as to contend that Tan need not have suffered a violation of his
                    personal rights in order to have standing. Further or in the alternative, he
                    submits that applicants in constitutional cases who wish to challenge the
                    constitutionality of a particular law do not need to be prosecuted under that
                    law before they are found to have standing, citing <em>Colin
                        Chan</em> and a number of Commonwealth cases in support of his
                    submission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The AG’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Mr Abdullah argues that the test for
                        <em>locus standi</em> in constitutional challenges is
                    the <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em>
                    test. He contends that Tan’s submission of a lower threshold rests on a
                    misapprehension of <em>Eng Foong </em><em>Ho</em> and <em>Colin Chan</em>, and that there
                    was no indication in <em>Colin Chan</em> that a different
                    test of standing was being applied. He argues that far from obviating the
                    requirement of a violation of personal rights or a personal injury, <em>Colin Chan</em> instead stands for the proposition that the
                    threshold of “sufficient interest” must be met even in
                    constitutional challenges. Further, Mr Abdullah argues that the criterion
                    of “sufficient interest” stated at [14] of <em>Colin Chan</em> is a general concept which the court will need to
                    apply to the specific facts of each case, and it thus cannot be said that
                    “sufficient interest” is necessarily a more lenient standard than
                    that set out in <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our analysis and decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In <em>Government of Malaysia v
                        Lim Kit Siang</em> [1988] 2 MLJ 12 at 27, the majority
                    of the Malaysian Supreme Court ruled that to possess <em>locus
                        standi</em>, an applicant must show that he had a private right which
                    had been infringed. If a public right was involved, the applicant must show that
                    he had suffered special damage as a result of the public act being challenged
                    and that he had a genuine private interest to protect or further. It is not
                    disputed that in the present appeal, the rights concerned are not public rights.
                    To clarify the terminology used here, a public right is one which is held and
                    vindicated by public authorities, whereas a private right is one which is held
                    and vindicated by a private individual. Therefore, despite being a matter of
                    public law, a constitutional right is a private right as it is held and can be
                    vindicated by individuals on their own behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The crux of Issue 2 is whether the test
                    for <em>locus standi</em> in applications involving
                    constitutional rights is different from, and less strict than, the <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em> test. This is
                    an enormously significant matter as the courts have a heavy responsibility to
                    sieve the wheat of merit from the chaff of frivolity. That is to say, while
                    access to justice must not be impeded, the court’s processes must not be

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In <em>Karaha
                        </em><em>Bodas</em>, which involved two appeals,
                    the applicant sought a declaration under the then equivalent of O 15
                    r 16 of the Rules (<em>viz</em>, O 15 r 16
                    of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed)) that a
                    monetary debt be held by the respondent in the second appeal on trust for the
                    respondent in the first appeal, and an order that the former repay the said sum
                    to the latter in Hong Kong. It can be seen that the private rights involved in
                        <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em>
                    were not constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The <em>Karaha
                        </em><em>Bodas</em> test provides that the
                    following elements must be met in order for an applicant to possess <em>locus standi</em> to bring an action for a declaration under
                    O 15 r 16 of the Rules (“O 15 r 16”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_a"></a>(a)     the applicant must have a
                        “real interest” in bringing the action (at
                    [19]);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_b"></a>(b)     there must
                        be a “real controversy” between the parties to the action for
                        the court to resolve (at [19]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_c"></a>(c)     the declaration must relate to a right which is personal
                        to the applicant and which is enforceable against an adverse party to the
                        litigation (at [15], [16] and [25]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The relationship between <em>locus standi</em> and the “real controversy”
                    requirement will be examined under Issue 4, along with the issue of whether
                    there is a real controversy to be adjudicated on the facts of this case. For the
                    purposes of Issue 2 and Issue 3, we will focus on the “real
                    interest” requirement and the requirement that there must be a violation
                    of a right personal to the applicant. In respect of the latter requirement, it
                    should be noted that by “violation”, we mean an actual or arguable
                    violation, and the words “violation”, “violate” and
                    their derivatives as used hereafter should be understood in that light except
                    where there is express indication to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     We will now consider whether <em>Eng Foong </em><em>Ho</em> and <em>Colin Chan</em> (cases involving alleged violations of
                    constitutional rights) accepted and applied the <em>Karaha
                        </em><em>Bodas</em> test, or whether they set a

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether the test for standing in the context of constitutional rights
                differs from the Karaha Bodas test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     As stated above at [73], at present, we are
                    concerned with the requirement of “real interest” and that of a
                    violation of a right personal to the applicant. We turn to consider these
                        <em>seriatim</em>, beginning with the
                latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Whether a violation of a right personal to the applicant is
                a necessary requirement in constitutional cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In <em>Eng Foong
                        </em><em>Ho</em>, this court held as follows (at
                    [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With respect to the issue of <em>locus standi</em>,
                        the respondents have also argued that because the [applicants] have
                        proceeded by way of O 15 r 16 and not O 53 r 1 of the
                        Rules of Court [<em>viz</em>, the Rules as defined at
                        [2] above], they must satisfy a stricter test for <em>locus
                            standi</em> as decided by this court in <em>Karaha
                            </em><em>Bodas</em> … The argument
                        seems to be that a higher standard of <em>locus
                            standi</em> is required for an application under O 15
                        r 16 than that under O 53 r 1. This argument has no merit
                        whatsoever. <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em> was not concerned with the pursuit of constitutional
                        rights. In our view, it does not matter what procedure the [applicants] have
                        used. The substantive elements of <em>locus standi</em>
                        cannot change in the context of the constitutional protection of fundamental
                            rights<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1">Tan’s case is that the above passage lays down the proposition
                    that constitutional challenges form an exception to the <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em> test. Against this,
                    the AG contends that the only issue which the court was addressing in the above
                    passage was whether a different standard of <em>locus
                        standi</em> applied to cases brought under O 15 r 16, as
                    opposed to cases brought under O 53 r 1 of the Rules
                    (“O 53 r 1”). On this issue, we accept the AG’s
                    reading of <em>Eng Foong </em><em>Ho</em>, <em>ie</em>, the intent of the excerpt
                    above was to unify the threshold of <em>locus standi</em>
                    for cases brought under O 15 r 16 and cases brought under O 53
                    r 1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     We find that <em>Eng Foong
                        </em><em>Ho</em> does <em>not</em> support Tan’s case that applicants in constitutional
                    cases need not demonstrate a violation of their personal rights in order to be
                    granted standing. In <em>Eng Foong </em><em>Ho</em>, the applicants were granted standing as they had
                    demonstrated that their personal rights had arguably been violated. The
                    applicants in that case were devotees of a temple (“the Temple”)
                    who were seeking a declaration under O 15 r 16 that the compulsory
                    acquisition of the property on which the Temple stood (“the Temple
                    Property”) violated Art 12. The Temple was subject to a trust for
                    religious purposes (“the Trust”), and the trustees, who were the
                    legal owners of the Temple, were not parties to the case. Although the
                    applicants had no proprietary interest in the Temple Property, they were members
                    of San Jiao Sheng Tang Buddhist Association (“the Buddhist
                    Association”), which was the beneficiary of the Trust. It was held (at
                    [17]) that the applicants’
                    <em>membership</em> of the Buddhist Association gave them
                    standing to pursue the action for declaratory relief. In our view, although the
                    applicants’ membership of the Buddhist Association was crucial to the
                    finding that they had <em>locus standi</em>, such
                    membership did not go to the <em>existence</em> of the
                    applicants’ Art 12 rights, but rather, went to showing the arguable
                        <em>violation</em> of such rights (see below at [81]).
                    On the facts of <em>Eng Foong </em><em>Ho</em>, the applicants had a beneficial, although not a legal, right
                    to the Temple Property. It thus cannot be said that the court in <em>Eng Foong </em><em>Ho</em> obviated the
                    requirement that declaratory actions can only be brought in respect of a
                    violation of an applicant’s personal rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Therefore, in so far as Mr Ravi contends
                    that applicants in constitutional cases need not demonstrate a violation of or
                    an injury to their personal rights in order to be granted standing, this
                    argument must be rejected. No case in Singapore, including <em>Colin Chan</em>, has accepted such a far-reaching proposition. In
                    fact, <em>Colin Chan</em> implicitly accepted that a
                    violation of personal rights was necessary to establish standing, and focused on
                    the determination of <em>what</em> constituted such a
                    violation (at [13]–[14] <em>per</em>
                    M Karthigesu JA):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    … If a constitutional guarantee is to mean
                            anything, it must mean that any citizen can complain to the courts if
                            there is a violation of it. The fact that the violation would also
                            affect every other citizen should not detract from a citizen’s
                            interest in seeing that his constitutional rights are not
                                violated<em>. A citizen should not have to wait until
                                he is prosecuted before he may assert his constitutional
                                rights.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    There is thus no need for the [applicants] to show
                            that they are office holders in [the International Bible Students
                            Association (“the IBSA”)] or members thereof. Their right
                            to challenge Order 405/1994 [which prohibited the importation, sale
                            and distribution of the IBSA’s publications] arises not from
                            membership of any society. <em>Their right arises from
                                every citizen’s right to profess, practise and propagate his
                                religious beliefs</em>. If there was a breach of Art 15
                            [of the Constitution], <em>such a breach</em> would
                            affect the citizen <em>qua</em> citizen. <em>If a citizen does not have sufficient interest to see that
                                his </em><em>constitutional rights are not
                                violated, then it is hard to see who has.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As can be seen, the court in <em>Colin Chan</em> clearly stated at [13] that “any
                    citizen can complain to the courts <em>if there is a
                        </em><em>violation</em> of …
                    <em>his constitutional rights</em>” [emphasis
                    added]. The court thus accepted that an applicant for declaratory relief needs
                    to have suffered a violation of <em>his</em> constitutional
                    rights, <em>ie</em>, only a violation of a right personal
                    to the applicant will suffice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     We emphasise that the court in <em>Colin Chan</em> considered that constitutional rights are
                    personal to each citizen, as can be seen from its affirmation (at [14]) of
                        “<em>every citizen’s right</em> to
                    profess, practise and propagate <em>his</em> religious
                    beliefs” [emphasis added]. As such, a citizen whose constitutional rights
                    are violated can, without more, satisfactorily demonstrate a violation of rights
                    personal to himself as <em>every violation of constitutional
                        rights is a violation of personal rights</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Constitutional rights are personal to each and
                    every Singapore citizen by virtue of his or her citizenship, and are not
                    contingent on membership of any society. Therefore, in the event that there is a
                    violation of any constitutional right, a citizen’s right to bring a
                    constitutional challenge “arises not from membership of any
                    society” (see <em>Colin Chan</em> at [14]). Although
                    this seems to give rise to an apparent contradiction between <em>Colin Chan</em> and <em>Eng Foong </em><em>Ho</em>, we find that these two cases do speak with one
                    voice. <em>Colin Chan</em> is not to be understood as
                    laying down the proposition that membership of the group targeted by the
                    allegedly unconstitutional law or ministerial order is irrelevant; instead, it
                    simply holds that such membership is not necessary to demonstrate the <em>existence</em> of a personal right. The issue of membership
                    remains relevant at the later stage of determining whether there is a <em>violation</em> of the alleged right (see [93]–[94]
                    below). Even though the court in <em>Eng Foong
                        </em><em>Ho</em> seemed to suggest that the
                    applicants in that case were granted standing only because of their membership
                    of the Buddhist Association, the correct interpretation of that case is that the
                    applicants had Art 12 rights by virtue of their citizenship, but were only
                    able to demonstrate the arguable violation of their Art 12 rights through
                    their membership of the Buddhist Association, which was affected by the
                    compulsory acquisition of the Temple Property. In our view, on the facts of
                        <em>Eng Foong </em><em>Ho</em>, a
                    Buddhist who was not a member of the Buddhist Association would not have been
                    held to have sufficient standing to mount a similar challenge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It can be seen from the foregoing analysis
                    that the <em>mere fact of citizenship </em><em>in itself</em> does not satisfy the standing requirement for
                    constitutional challenges. We agree with the holding in <em>Colin
                        Chan</em> that an applicant must demonstrate a <em>violation</em> of <em>his</em> constitutional
                    rights before <em>locus standi</em> can be granted. This
                    will prevent “mere busybodies” whose rights are not affected from
                    being granted standing to launch unmeritorious constitutional challenges (see
                        <em>Regina v Greater London Council, Ex parte Blackburn and
                        Another</em> [1976] 1 WLR 550 at 559D). It is only
                    where a person’s rights have been or are threatened to be violated that
                    that person ceases to be a “mere busybody”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether a “real interest” is a necessary
                requirement in constitutional cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     We now come to the “real
                    interest” requirement. Pursuant to <em>Colin
                        Chan</em> at [13]–[14], the question of “sufficient
                    interest” must be judged in relation to the rights which are the subject
                    matter of the application. Given the importance of constitutional rights, a
                    citizen will <em>prima facie</em> have a “sufficient
                    interest to see that his constitutional rights are not violated” (see
                        <em>Colin Chan</em> at [14]). Therefore, the view
                    expressed in Kevin Y L Tan &amp; Thio Li-ann, <em>Constitutional Law in Malaysia and Singapore</em> (LexisNexis,
                    3rd Ed, 2010) at p 551 –
                    <em>viz</em>, that “[w]here
                    constitutionally-guaranteed liberties are at stake, locus standi is established
                    without the need to show sufficiency of interest” – is not entirely
                    accurate. Sufficiency of interest still needs to be shown, but this is <em>prima facie</em> made out once there is a violation of a
                    constitutional right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     In view of the above, the crux of the standing
                    requirement in constitutional cases is that there must be a violation of a
                    constitutional right. The key question is thus what constitutes a violation of a
                    constitutional right.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">What constitutes a violation of a constitutional right?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Whether constitutional rights can only be violated by a
                subsisting prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In the court below, the Judge relied on
                        <em>Colin Chan</em> for the proposition that a
                    subsisting prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law was not an
                    essential requirement to show a violation of constitutional rights (see the
                    Judgment at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The AG had argued that with the [s 377A] charge being dropped, Tan
                        was unable to prove his case. <em>This was a mistaken
                            view.</em> While the act of prosecution itself can be a violation
                        of one’s constitutional rights, <em>it does not follow
                            that a violation cannot occur without a prosecution</em>.
                        Karthigesu JA made this abundantly clear in <em>Colin
                            Chan</em> at [13], “A citizen should <em>not

                            constitutional rights”</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Tan’s case builds on <em>Colin Chan</em>, and he contends that apart from a subsisting
                    prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law, there are two additional
                    ways in which constitutional rights may be violated. First, a constitutional
                    right may be violated by the very existence of an allegedly unconstitutional law
                    in the statute books. Second, a constitutional right may be violated by a threat
                    of future prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The AG’s case, in contrast, is that the
                    finding in <em>Colin Chan</em> that the applicants had
                    standing to bring a constitutional challenge regardless of whether or not they
                    faced prosecution is confined to the facts of that case, and is not a
                    proposition of general application. Mr Abdullah submits that the general
                    principle remains that a person may only challenge a law as unconstitutional if
                    the Executive first expresses a definite intention to enforce the law against
                    that person. He further submits that in the context of a penal provision such as
                    s 377A, “enforcement” refers only to a prosecution.
                    Mr Abdullah argues that since the discretion to bring criminal prosecutions
                    is vested in the AG (pursuant to Art 35(8) of the Constitution), unless and
                    until this <em>executive discretion</em> is exercised,
                    there is no violation of an individual’s rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Mr Abdullah seeks, somewhat diffidently,
                    to distinguish <em>Colin Chan</em> on the basis that it
                    concerned an executive act (<em>viz</em>, a ministerial
                    order issued by the Minister for Information and the Arts (“the
                    Minister”)), whereas the instant case centres on a legislative act
                        (<em>viz</em>, a statutory provision). <em>Colin Chan</em> arose from a ministerial order which banned
                    the importation, sale and distribution of publications of a religious group to
                    which the applicants belonged (“the Ban”) (see <em>Colin Chan</em> at [1]). According to Mr Abdullah, the
                    ministerial order demonstrated the Minister’s <em>intention
                        to exercise his executive powers</em> to enforce the Ban, which
                    exercise no doubt directly affected the applicants as members of the targeted
                    religious group. Mr Abdullah distinguishes a ministerial order from a law
                    on the basis that the latter is “not intended to be invariably and
                    inflexibly enforced”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     With respect, we find the purported
                    distinction puzzling as it rests on an implicit suggestion that ministerial
                    orders are intended to be invariably and inflexibly enforced, which cannot be
                    the case. The enforcement of ministerial orders requires an act of executive
                    discretion. The decision to enforce a ministerial order in the event of its
                    breach and the decision to prosecute based on a breach of a law <em>both</em> rest on further exercises of executive discretion.
                    We thus fail to see how challenges to laws can be distinguished from challenges
                    to ministerial orders in this respect. Further, we note that the constitutional
                    challenge in <em>Colin Chan</em> was not based on the
                    enforcement of the ministerial order in question (<em>ie</em>, the Ban), but arose instead from the very existence of the
                    ministerial order itself. Karthigesu JA even went so far as to opine (at
                    [19] of <em>Colin Chan</em>) that the fact that the
                    applicants were facing prosecution for being in possession of prohibited
                    publications was “an irrelevant consideration in an application for leave
                    to issue <em>certiorari</em> proceedings” as the
                    applicants already possessed standing based on the alleged violation of their
                    constitutional rights to freedom of religion and expression brought about by the
                    implementation of the Ban. We agree with this view. The principle that a
                    prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional ministerial order is not a
                    necessary requirement for standing in an action to declare that ministerial
                    order unconstitutional is equally applicable to instant case, <em>ie</em>, a prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law should
                    not be a necessary requirement for standing in an action to declare that law
                    unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Perhaps, the argument based on the distinction
                    between ministerial orders and legislation relates more to the aspect of
                        <em>specificity of targeting</em>. Mr Abdullah
                    points out that <em>Eng Foong </em><em>Ho</em> arose from an executive order to compulsorily acquire land in
                    which the applicants had an interest, and emphasises that the compulsory
                    acquisition order was “specifically targeted at a plot of
                        land”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> As for <em>Colin Chan</em>, Mr Abdullah contends that although the
                    Ban was framed generally, it “necessarily and specifically impacted each
                    of the [applicants]’ ability to profess their religion”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    as they were members of the targeted religious group. With respect, this
                    submission overlooks the point that it is <em>precisely this
                        specificity of targeting</em> which Tan is relying on to support his
                    claim that s 377A violates his Art 12 rights, <em>viz</em>, that s 377A specifically targets practising male
                    homosexuals. We thus find that there is no relevant basis on which <em>Colin Chan</em> may be distinguished from the instant case,
                    and the finding in <em>Colin Chan</em> that a prosecution
                    is not necessary to found standing is applicable here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Further, as will be elaborated on at [151]
                    below, we find that violations of constitutional rights may occur not only at
                    the point in time when an accused person is prosecuted under an allegedly
                    unconstitutional law, but also when a person is <em>arrested
                        and/or detained and/or charged under an allegedly unconstitutional
                        law</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The proposition that constitutional rights may
                    be violated without a prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law is a
                    negative one which does not answer the question of what, then, is necessary to
                    show a violation of constitutional rights. Here, we come back to
                    Mr Ravi’s two submissions (see [86] above), <em>viz</em>, that a constitutional right may be violated by the very
                    existence of an allegedly unconstitutional law in the statute books and/or by a
                    threat of future prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional
                law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether the very existence of an allegedly unconstitutional
                law in the statute books suffices to show a violation of constitutional
                rights</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Every citizen has constitutional rights, but
                    not every citizen’s constitutional rights will be affected by an
                    unconstitutional law in the same way. For example, if there is a law which
                    provides that it is an offence for any person of a particular race to take
                    public buses, this law would clearly violate Art 12. It is uncontroversial
                    that such a law would affect the Art 12 rights of a person belonging to
                    that race in a way that would not apply to the Art 12 rights of a person of
                    another race. This does <em>not</em> detract from the fact
                    that constitutional rights, including Art 12 rights, are personal to
                        <em>all</em> citizens. However, the mere holding of a
                    constitutional right is insufficient to found standing to challenge an
                    unconstitutional law; there must also be a <em>violation</em> of the constitutional right. In this fictitious
                    scenario, the only persons who will have standing to bring a constitutional
                    challenge against the unconstitutional law for inconsistency with Art 12
                    will be citizens who belong to the race that has been singled out as only their
                    Art 12 rights will have been violated. Persons of other races will not have
                    suffered violations of their Art 12 rights and will thus have no standing
                    to bring a constitutional challenge in this scenario.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The fictitious scenario above illustrates that
                    while an applicant who wishes to challenge an allegedly unconstitutional law
                    must demonstrate that his constitutional rights have been violated by that law,
                    such violation may be more easily demonstrated where the law specifically
                    targets a group and the applicant is a member of that group. Whether the very
                    existence of an unconstitutional law in the statute books suffices to show a
                    violation of constitutional rights depends on what exactly that law provides. It
                    is conceivable that the very existence of an unconstitutional law in the statute
                    books suffices to show such violation (and, thus, to found standing) in an
                    extraordinary case, although we caution that no such case has ever been brought
                    to the attention of the courts here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Mr Ravi relies on cases from other
                    jurisdictions which have accepted that a prosecution under an allegedly
                    unconstitutional law is not necessary to found standing to challenge that law.
                    For instance, in <em>Croome and Another v The State of
                        Tasmania</em> (1996–1997) 191 CLR 119
                        (“<em>Croome</em>”), the applicants were
                    allowed to bring an application challenging the constitutionality of
                    Tasmania’s sodomy laws despite the fact that they had not been prosecuted
                    under the relevant provisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In <em>Leung</em>, the
                    applicant, a 20-year-old homosexual man, successfully challenged the
                    constitutionality of certain provisions in the Hong Kong Crimes Ordinance which
                    made “[h]omosexual buggery with or by [a] man under 21” [emphasis
                    in original omitted] an offence. The Hong Kong Court of Appeal found at [29(2)]
                    that a prosecution was not the only way to show a violation of the
                    applicant’s rights:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Notwithstanding the fact that a prosecution is <em>neither
                            in existence nor in contemplation</em> ... it is clear on the
                        facts that [the applicant] and many others like him have been seriously
                        affected by the <em>existence of the legislation under
                            challenge</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, the lack of a contemplated prosecution was not found
                    to be fatal by the court in <em>Leung</em>, which went on
                    to hold that the applicant’s rights were affected by <em>the existence of the legislation itself</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     The decision in <em>Leung</em> that a prosecution was not necessary for the applicant in
                    that case to have standing to challenge the legislative provisions in question
                    stemmed from the court’s concern that the applicant should not have to
                    break the law and trigger a prosecution before he could be granted standing to
                    challenge the law. If it were otherwise, “access to justice ... could
                    only be gained by the applicant breaking what [was] according to the statutory
                    provisions in question, the law” (at [29(2)]). The court then referred
                    approvingly to the opinion of Advocate-General F G Jacobs in <em>Union de Pequeños </em><em>Agricultores v
                        Council of the European Union (supported by Commission of the European
                        Communities)</em> [2003] QB 893 (“<em>UPA</em>”) at [43] that “[i]ndividuals clearly cannot
                    be required to breach the law in order to gain access to
                justice”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Although the decision of the European Court of
                    Justice (“the ECJ”) in <em>UPA</em> was not
                    referred to by the court in <em>Leung</em>, for
                    completeness’ sake, we should mention that the ECJ differed from
                    Advocate-General Jacobs on the requirement of “individual
                    concern” set out in Art 230(4) of the Treaty Establishing The
                    European Community (“the Treaty”). In brief, Art 230(4) of
                    the Treaty (available in <em>Official Journal of the European
                        Union</em> (29 December 2006) C321 at p E/146)
                    provides that an individual may institute proceedings to challenge the legality
                    of, <em>inter alia</em>, an executive decision which is
                    “of direct and individual concern” to him. Underlying the
                    divergence in approach between the ECJ and Advocate-General Jacobs in
                        <em>UPA</em> was the difference in view as to whether
                    the Treaty had established a complete system of legal remedies. The ECJ took the
                    view that the Treaty had established a complete system of legal remedies and
                    thus saw no need to relax the “individual concern” standing
                    requirement. Advocate-General Jacobs, on the other hand, was of the view
                    that individuals did not have adequate alternative remedies under the Treaty and
                    thus sought to relax the “individual concern” standing
                    requirement. It can be seen from this that <em>the availability
                        of adequate </em><em>alternative remedies</em> is
                    a factor to be considered in determining how broadly the standing requirements
                    should be cast. Where no adequate alternative remedies are available, this might
                    point in favour of relaxing the standing requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Further, we note that in applications for
                    judicial review, the exhaustion of alternative remedies is a factor that the
                    court takes into account in deciding whether to grant <em>locus
                        standi</em> (see <em>Kang Ngah Wei v Commander of
                        Traffic Police</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 14 at [19]–[20]).
                    As noted above at [76], we find that the threshold of <em>locus
                        standi</em> for applications under O 15 r 16 is the same as
                    that for applications under O 53 r 1, and, thus, it stands to reason
                    that similar factors can be taken into consideration for both types of
                    applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In the present case, the Judge was of the
                    view that Art 100 provided Tan with an adequate alternative remedy, and
                    thus found at [26(b)] of the Judgment that there was no need to relax the
                    standing requirements:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In Singapore, it is arguable that individuals are not compelled to resort
                        to such extremes [of breaking the law]. They can request the President to
                        refer the issue to the Constitutional Tribunal under Art 100 of the
                        Constitution. As there is an established procedure through which guidance
                        may be obtained in the absence of specific facts, there is no reason to
                        relax the “real controversy” requirement in order to avoid the
                        situation where individuals break the law in order to obtain
                        standing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The Judge’s reference to Art 100

                    Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China) does not
                    have an equivalent of this Article. The Judge thus reasoned that the pressing
                    need to relax the requirements of <em>locus standi</em> in
                    Hong Kong did not exist in Singapore.</p>

                    which individuals may utilise to raise constitutional issues. First, as the
                    Judge noted, one interpretation of Art 100, expressed by no less than Chan
                    Sek Keong CJ extra-judicially, is that it was enacted only for the purposes
                    of resolving actual and potential disputes <em>between
                        constitutional organs</em>, and is not intended to allow <em>individuals</em> to “obtain advisory opinions on
                    hypothetical cases from the courts” (see “Judicial Review –
                    From Angst to Empathy” (2010) 22 SAcLJ 469 at p 471). Second,
                    although individuals may petition the President to convene the Constitutional
                    Tribunal under Art 100, it is clear that individuals have no means of
                    compelling the President to do so. Third, reading Art 100 with reference to
                    Art 21 of the Constitution, it is clear that the President has no power to
                    convene the Constitutional Tribunal on his own initiative. Article 21(1)
                    directs the President, in exercising his functions, to “act in accordance
                    with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general
                    authority of the Cabinet”, unless expressly specified otherwise in the
                    Constitution. The power to convene the Constitutional Tribunal is not among the
                    expressly specified functions listed in Art 21(2) in respect of which the
                    President may act in his own discretion. Fourth, the findings of the
                    Constitutional Tribunal are <em>not binding</em> on the
                    Government. Therefore, even if an individual manages to trigger the Art 100
                    mechanism to convene the Constitutional Tribunal, and even if the Constitutional
                    Tribunal gives a favourable opinion, the practical impact of such an opinion
                    could be limited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    The absence of an adequate alternative
                    remedy in the present case is brought home by an examination of the decision in
                        <em>Croome</em>. According to Mr Abdullah, the
                    decision in <em>Croome</em> was premised on the
                    long-standing practice in Australia of the Attorney-Generals of the various
                    States seeking declarations of the constitutionality of various legislative
                    provisions. Mr Abdullah submits that it was “with one eye to that
                    reality that the Court [in <em>Croome</em>] adopted a
                        <em>quid pro quo</em> approach and arrived at the view
                    that individuals would be able to avail themselves [of] the
                        same”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> As no such
                    practice exists in Singapore, Mr Abdullah submits that this court should
                    not be as ready as an Australian court might be to grant Tan standing to bring
                    the Application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    While we accept that in Singapore, the AG
                    does not have the practice of seeking declarations on the constitutionality of
                    various legislative provisions, we find that this points <em>towards</em>, rather than away from, the adoption of the
                    court’s approach in <em>Croome</em>. As noted above
                    at [98], the absence of alternative remedies favours a relaxation of the
                    standing requirements, and given that the court in <em>Croome</em> relaxed the standing requirements in that case despite
                    the availability of an alternative remedy, the Singapore courts should <em>a fortiori</em> consider a relaxation of our standing
                    requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    We now turn to consider three arguments that
                    the AG has raised against the proposition that the very existence of an
                    allegedly unconstitutional law in the statute books can show a violation of
                    constitutional rights and thereby found standing to challenge the law in
                    question. The first argument is that the court would have to answer legal
                    questions in the abstract, where the answer would not affect the rights of any
                    person before the court. With respect, we find that this argument overlooks the
                    fact that in this scenario, an applicant will only be granted standing <em>if his rights have been violated</em> by the law alleged to
                    be unconstitutional. As such, the argument that no one’s rights will be
                    affected where the court answers a legal question in this scenario is a
                        <em>non sequitur</em>. We reiterate that it will be a
                    rare case where a person’s constitutional rights are violated by the very
                    presence of an allegedly unconstitutional law in the statute books without
                    more.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    The AG’s second argument is that if
                    the very existence of an allegedly unconstitutional law in the statute books can
                    show a violation of constitutional rights and thus found standing to challenge
                    the law in question, every piece of legislation could potentially come before
                    the court for a judicial imprimatur of validity before it is enforced, and such
                    judicial endorsement would come to seem necessary. We think that such concerns
                    should not be overstated. Singapore has adopted the model of parliamentary
                    sovereignty and has inherited the common law tradition of positivism – it
                    is a foundation of our legal system that laws declared by Parliament are valid
                    by virtue of their enactment. It is trite that such laws remain valid unless and
                    until they are declared void. There is thus no necessity for a judicial
                    pronouncement on the validity of legislation (and no one can seriously contend
                    that there is such a necessity) before legislation is accepted as being
                    valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Tied to the AG’s second argument above
                    is the third argument based on floodgates. Mr Abdullah contends that
                    “[t]he floodgates will be opened to capricious and whimsical
                    constitutional litigation”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> if applicants are able to bring
                    constitutional challenges based on the very existence of an allegedly
                    unconstitutional law in the statute books. This appears to us to be an undue
                    overstatement. We wish to make clear what the floodgates argument is <em>not</em> about. It does not imply that constitutional
                    litigation can be attributed to sheer belligerence on the part of applicants.
                    Where an applicant’s constitutional rights have been violated, he is
                    justified in bringing a constitutional challenge, and the fact that the alleged
                    violation would also affect a great number of other people, even “every
                    other citizen[,] should not detract from a citizen’s interest in seeing
                    that his constitutional rights are not violated” (see <em>Colin Chan</em> at [13]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Having said that, we are aware of the need
                    to ensure that granting some applicants greater access to justice by relaxing
                    the requirements for standing does not have the converse effect of restricting
                    access to justice for others. While we find that a deluge of constitutional
                    challenges is unlikely if the standing requirements are relaxed, we accept that
                    an increase in unmeritorious cases which does not amount to a
                    “deluge” may still have the effect of delaying access to justice
                    for other claimants. On the other hand, strict standing requirements will not
                    just delay access to the courts, but may <em>deny</em>
                    access altogether for some claimants. As such, keeping in mind the need for a
                    balance, we will <em>not</em> lay down a general rule that
                    the very existence of an allegedly unconstitutional law in the statute books
                    suffices to demonstrate a violation of an applicant’s constitutional
                    rights. Each case must turn on its own facts, and the courts must remain mindful
                    that lax standing rules could “seriously curtail the efficiency of the
                    Executive in practising good governance” (see “Judicial Review
                    – From Angst to Empathy” at p 481).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    At the same time, and for the avoidance of
                    doubt, we state conclusively that we also reject the proposition that a
                    subsisting prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law must be
                    demonstrated in every case before a violation of constitutional rights can be
                    shown. A law is either constitutional or it is not. The effects of a law can be
                    felt without a prosecution, and to insist that an applicant needs to face a
                    prosecution under the law in question before he can challenge its
                    constitutionality could have the perverse effect of encouraging criminal
                    behaviour to test constitutional issues. Even though a violation of
                    constitutional rights may be most clearly shown where there is a subsisting
                    prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law, we find that a violation
                    may also be established in the absence of a subsisting prosecution. In certain
                    cases, the very existence of an allegedly unconstitutional law in the statute
                    books may suffice to show a violation of an applicant’s constitutional
                    rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Whether there is a need for a real and credible threat of
                prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The need for a real and credible threat of
                    prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law can be seen as the midpoint
                    between Tan’s position and the AG’s position. Mr Abdullah
                    argues that even if this court is minded to accept that there is no necessity
                    for a subsisting prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law in order to
                    found <em>locus standi</em> to challenge that law, at the
                    very least, the court should institute a requirement that an applicant must face
                    a real and credible threat of prosecution under that law. As we have already
                    found that the existence of an allegedly unconstitutional legislation in itself
                    may in certain cases suffice to show a violation of an applicant’s rights,
                    we can dispose of this point quite briefly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In the court below, the Judge accepted that
                    “[t]he spectre of future prosecution” ([at 20] of the Judgment)
                    was sufficient for an arguable violation of Tan’s constitutional rights to
                    be found. She noted that this was accepted in <em>Croome</em> and <em>Leung</em>. In <em>Croome</em>, Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ
                    opined (at 127) that the applicants had engaged in homosexual conduct that would
                    render them “liable to prosecution … [and] [t]he fact that the
                    Director of Public Prosecutions [did] not propose to prosecute [did] not remove
                    that liability”. As noted earlier at [96] above, <em>Leung</em> goes even further and states that even if no prosecution
                    under an allegedly unconstitutional law is contemplated, an applicant may still
                    be granted standing provided that the law in question itself violates his
                    constitutional rights. We agree with the Judge in so far as a threat of future
                    prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law, where the threat is real
                    and credible and not merely fanciful, will suffice to show a violation of
                    constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    We add that while there is no right not to
                    be prosecuted, there is a right not to be prosecuted under an unconstitutional
                    law. Persons who act in ways that may cause them to be liable under an allegedly
                    unconstitutional law are in the unenviable position of waiting to see whether a
                    prosecution will be brought against them despite the alleged unconstitutionality
                    of the law. The waiting and the uncertainty in itself can be said to be a form
                    of suffering, as can be seen from the court’s acceptance in <em>Leung</em> at [29(2)] that the applicant in that case and
                    many others like him had been living under a “considerable cloud”
                    as a result of the legislative provisions in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    To summarise, if an applicant is able to
                    show that he is facing a real and credible threat of prosecution under an
                    allegedly unconstitutional law, this may suffice to show that his constitutional
                    rights have arguably been violated and that he should thus be granted standing
                    to vindicate his rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Summary of our ruling on Issue 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    In conclusion, in respect of Issue 2,
                    the test for <em>locus standi</em> in constitutional
                    challenges remains the <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em> test. As noted earlier at [72] above, <em>Karaha </em><em>Bodas</em> lays down three
                    elements which have to be satisfied in order to establish <em>locus standi</em>, namely: (a) a real interest in bringing the
                    action; (b) a real controversy between the parties concerned; and
                    (c) a violation of a personal right. The element of a real controversy,
                    however, goes to the court’s discretion and not jurisdiction (see below at
                    [137]). For the “real interest” requirement, we have found (at
                    [83] above) that sufficiency of interest is <em>prima
                        facie</em> made out once there is a violation of constitutional
                    rights. For the requirement that there must be a violation of a personal right,
                    as every constitutional right is a personal right, demonstrating that a
                    constitutional right has been violated will suffice (see above at [80]). We have
                    further found that a violation of constitutional rights <em>may</em> be brought about by the very existence of an allegedly
                    unconstitutional law in the statute books (see above at [110]) and/or by a real
                    and credible threat of prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law (see
                    above at [114]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 3</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    We will now turn to Issue 3, which
                    entails applying the test for <em>locus standi</em> (as set
                    out above at [115]) to the facts of the present case to determine if Tan meets
                    the threshold for <em>locus standi</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    It is common ground that Tan does not face a
                    subsisting prosecution under s 377A. Even so, we have decided (see above at
                    [110]) that a subsisting prosecution under an allegedly unconstitutional law is
                    not a necessary requirement to show a violation of constitutional rights. The
                    central issue here is whether it can be argued that Tan’s constitutional
                    rights were arguably violated on the facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Are there any constitutional rights at stake in this case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Tan’s case is that s 377A
                    violates his rights under Art 9, Art 12 and Art 14. We will
                    consider each of these constitutional provisions in turn, beginning with
                    Art 9.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Article 9</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    Article 9(1) provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in
                        accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    Mr Ravi has contended that the
                    protection accorded by Art 9 does not only cover “mere
                        existence”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and “must
                    extend to all those faculties by which life is enjoyed”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>
                    including “privacy, human dignity, individual autonomy and the human need
                    for an intimate personal sphere”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> However, as the Judge noted (at [15]
                    of the Judgment), “our courts have eschewed such wide
                    interpretations” of the terms “life” and “personal
                    liberty” in Art 9(1). The Judge referred to the High Court’s
                    decision in <em>Lo Pui Sang </em><em>and
                        others v Mamata </em><em>Kapildev Dave and others
                        (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and other appeals</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 754 (“<em>Lo Pui
                    Sang</em>”), where it was stated (at [6]) that “personal
                    liberty” in Art 9(1) referred “only to the personal liberty
                    of the person against unlawful incarceration or detention”. Although
                        <em>Lo Pui Sang</em> was overturned on appeal (see
                        <em>Ng Eng Ghee and others v Mamata </em><em>Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener)
                        </em><em>and another appeal</em> [2009]
                    3 SLR(R) 109), the constitutional issues were not considered on appeal
                    and the High Court’s <em>dicta</em> in <em>Lo Pui Sang</em> on the interpretation of Art 9(1) thus
                    remains good law. We affirm this interpretation of Art 9(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    For the above reasons, we find that
                    Tan’s rights under Art 9(1) are not engaged by the <em>very existence</em> of s 377A in the statute
                books.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    However, although the very existence of
                    s 377A in the statute books does not engage Tan’s Art 9(1)
                    rights, we find that those rights <em>were</em> engaged
                        <em>on the facts of this case</em> as Tan was
                    purportedly arrested and detained under s 377A. Even on the interpretation
                    of a right to personal liberty stated above at [120], an accused person has a
                    right not to be detained under an unconstitutional law. As we are of the view
                    that s 377A is <em>arguably</em> unconstitutional for
                    inconsistency with Art 12 (see below at [125]–[127]), it flows from
                    this that Tan’s right to personal liberty under Art 9(1) would have
                    been violated by his arrest and detention under s 377A if the same were
                    indeed unconstitutional (elaborated on below at
                [151]–[153]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Article 12</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    Article 12(1) provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection
                        of the law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    The test for constitutionality under
                    Art 12 was laid down in <em>Yong Vui Kong v Public
                        Prosecutor and another matter</em> [2010] 3 SLR 489 at [109],
                    where it was held that a differentiating measure prescribed by legislation would
                    be consistent with Art 12(1) only if:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_a"></a>(a)     the classification was founded on
                        an intelligible differentia; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_124-p2_b"></a>(b)     the differentia bore a rational relation to the object
                        sought to be achieved by the law in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Applying this test, the Judge found at [16]
                    of the Judgment that s 377A engaged Tan’s rights under
                    Art 12(1). Although s 377A satisfied the first limb of the test as it
                    was founded on an intelligible differentia (it applies to sexually-active male
                    homosexuals), she found it arguable that s 377A failed the second limb as
                    there was no obvious social objective that could be furthered by criminalising
                    male but not female homosexual intercourse. We concur that there is an arguable
                    case that s 377A engages Tan’s rights under
                Art 12(1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    It is uncontroverted that s 377A is a
                    law which specifically targets sexually-active male homosexuals. The plain
                    language of s 377A excludes both male-female acts and female-female acts.
                    Tan professes to be a member of the targeted group, and the AG has not disputed
                    this claim. Therefore, since we have found that s 377A arguably violates
                    the Art 12(1) rights of its target group, as a member of that group,
                    Tan’s rights have arguably been violated by the mere existence of
                    s 377A in the statute books (see above at [94]). We also accept that there
                    is a real and credible threat of prosecution under s 377A (see below at
                    [175]–[183]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    We emphasise that we are <em>not</em> deciding here that s 377A <em>is</em> inconsistent with Art 12 as that goes to the merits of
                    the Application, but are instead merely deciding that it is <em>arguably</em> so, which suffices for the present appeal on the
                    preliminary issue of whether the Application should be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Article 14</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    Article 14 will not be examined in
                    detail as Mr Ravi omitted to make any submissions on this ground. It
                    suffices to briefly state that for the reasons set out below at [130], we find
                    no merit in the argument that Tan’s Art 14 rights were engaged by
                    s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    Article 14(1) provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to clauses (2) and (3) —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    every citizen of
                                Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and
                            expression;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    all citizens of
                                Singapore have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>c</em>)    all citizens of
                                Singapore have the right to form associations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Section 377A does not violate any of
                    the three limbs of Art 14(1). Even if any Art 14(1) rights are engaged
                    by s 377A, these rights are expressly stated to be subject to the need to
                    preserve (<em>inter alia</em>) public order (see
                        Art 14(2)(<em>a</em>)–14(2)(<em>c</em>)). In so far as s 377A criminalises “gross
                    indecency” between males <em>in public</em>, the
                    public order rationale applies. The same rationale applies to preserve the
                    constitutionality of s 294(<em>a</em>), which
                    criminalises “any obscene act in any public place”. In so far as
                    s 377A also criminalises “gross indecency” between <em>male homosexuals </em><em>in
                        private</em> but does not criminalise the same between <em>female</em> homosexuals, this is more properly dealt with
                    under Art 12 rather than under Art 14.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    In conclusion, on Issue 3, as we have
                    found that s 377A is arguably inconsistent with Art 12, Tan’s
                    constitutional rights are at stake and Tan thus has <em>locus
                        standi</em> to bring the Application. As noted above at [19], in the
                    present case, the issue of certainty of failure pivots solely on the issue of
                        <em>locus standi</em>. As we have found that Tan has
                        <em>locus standi</em>, Tan’s case is not certain
                    to fail. Tan, however, will still need to establish that the facts of the case
                    disclose a real controversy to be determined, and it is to this issue (which is
                    Issue 4) that we now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 4</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The need for the existence of a real
                    controversy between the parties to an action stems from the function of the
                    courts to adjudicate on and determine disputes between parties. Without a
                        <em>lis</em>, the courts may find themselves being
                    called on to give advisory opinions on abstract, hypothetical and/or academic
                    questions instead of deciding on real disputes. In <em>Salijah
                        </em><em>bte </em><em>Ab
                        </em><em>Latef v Mohd </em><em>Irwan bin Abdullah Teo</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 80
                        (“<em>Salijah</em>”) at [57], the court
                    explained the rationale underlying the “real controversy”
                    requirement as follows (citing <em>Russian Commercial and
                        Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign Trade, Limited</em> [1921]
                    2 AC 438 at 448):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question must be a real and not a theoretical question; the person
                        raising it must have a real interest to raise it; he must be able to secure
                        a proper contradictor, that is to say, some one presently existing who has a
                        true interest to oppose the declaration sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court continued at [60] of <em>Salijah</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The editors of Zamir and Woolf [<em>The Declaratory
                            Judgment</em> (2nd Ed, 1993)] have identified one rationale
                        for the reluctance of the courts to deal with theoretical issues –
                        that it distracts the courts from deciding real, subsisting problems. A
                        stronger reason is that if there is in fact no real issue subsisting, then
                        the matter would not be <em>res judicata</em>, nor the
                        issue merged in judgment. In that event, it would be open for the issue to
                        be reopened again and again. The need for the existence of a contested
                        dispute is to ensure that there is finality in the court’s judgments
                        as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    In our view, the “real
                    controversy” requirement has been met in the present case. The facts
                    before us disclose that a <em>lis</em> has been constituted
                    in two ways, namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_133-p2_a"></a>(a)     Tan’s arrest, investigation,
                        detention and charge under s 377A; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_133-p2_b"></a>(b)     the real and credible threat of prosecution
                        under s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Does the “real controversy” requirement go to
                jurisdiction or discretion?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    Before launching into our analysis of
                    Issue 4 proper, we will first deal with the preliminary issue of whether
                    the “real controversy” requirement goes to the court’s
                        <em>jurisdiction</em>, or whether it is a factor that
                    the court takes into account in exercising its <em>discretion</em>. While this court has opined in <em>Salijah</em> at [59] that there is “little practical
                    difference between the two positions”, as the AG has argued that the
                    “real controversy” requirement goes to the court’s
                    jurisdiction, we will address this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    Jurisdictional requirements delimit the
                    power of the court to hear a case. If any of the jurisdictional requirements are
                    not met in a particular case, the court shall not hear that case. A court which
                    does so will be acting <em>ultra vires</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    On the other hand, if a factor goes to the
                    court’s discretion to hear a case, the court will consider all the
                    circumstances of the case and weigh the factors in favour of hearing the case
                    against those in favour of not hearing it. Therefore, if the existence of a real
                    controversy is a factor in favour of the court exercising its discretion to hear
                    a case, the absence of a real controversy may not be fatal as there may be other
                    factors in favour of the case being heard. While the court is obliged to take
                    all relevant considerations into account, the weight accorded to each factor
                    depends on the precise circumstances of each case. If good reasons can be shown
                    as to why a court should proceed to hear a case despite the absence of a real
                    controversy, a court which so proceeds will not be acting <em>ultra vires</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    This issue has been considered in <em>Zamir &amp; </em><em>Woolf</em>, and the
                    following is stated as a general principle at para 4-36:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It can now safely be said that even if a particular action for declaratory
                        relief <em>only involves hypothetical issues</em> this
                        does <em>not deprive the court of jurisdiction</em>,
                        and if declaratory relief is refused on the grounds that the issues are
                        hypothetical, the refusal is properly classified as being on <em>discretionary</em> grounds. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, the absence of a real controversy does not invariably
                    deprive the court of its jurisdiction, and the court may exercise its discretion
                    to hear hypothetical issues in appropriate cases. How the court determines what
                    constitutes a proper case for the exercise of its discretion in this regard will
                    be considered later (see [144]–[146] below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    That the courts have the power to hear cases
                    involving hypothetical issues has been authoritatively established by a line of
                    English authorities, which the learned editors of <em>Zamir &amp;
                        Woolf</em> have referred to. In <em>Regina v Secretary
                        of State for the Home Department</em>,<em>Ex parte
                        Salem</em> [1999] 1 AC 450 (“<em>Salem</em>”) at 456G, the House of Lords (<em>per</em> Lord Slynn of Hadley) held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]here there is an issue involving a public authority as to a
                        question of public law, your Lordships have a <em>discretion</em> to hear the appeal, <em>even
                            if</em> by the time the appeal reaches the House <em>there is no longer a lis to be decided which will directly
                            affect the rights and obligations of the parties inter se</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It can be seen that the House of Lords did not view the existence of a
                    real controversy as a jurisdictional requirement. Regardless of whether there is
                    a <em>lis</em> between the parties <em>inter
                        se</em>, the court can exercise its discretion to hear a case,
                    particularly where the issue to be decided is one of public law. Given that
                    constitutional law is a part of public law, the <em>dicta</em> in <em>Salem</em> is applicable to
                    the instant case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    In <em>Rolls-Royce plc v
                        Unite the Union</em> [2010] 1 WLR 318 (“<em>Rolls-Royce</em>”) at [44]–[46], Wall LJ referred
                    to <em>Birmingham City Council v R and others</em> [2007]
                    2 WLR 1130 and <em>Bowman v Fels (Bar Council and others
                        intervening)</em> [2005] 1 WLR 3083 (“<em>Bowman v Fels</em>”), and observed that the courts in those
                    cases had been prepared to grant declarations on academic but important points.
                    In <em>Bowman v Fels</em>, the fact that the point was one
                    of general importance was considered by the court as a factor pointing in favour
                    of its exercising its discretion to hear the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    These developments are not confined to the
                    English courts. In <em>Leung</em>, the Hong Kong Court of
                    Appeal directly considered the question of whether the courts had the
                    jurisdiction to grant relief in “cases which involve[d] future events
                    which [might] or [might] not occur and which [were] therefore sometimes said to
                    be hypothetical” (at [28]). Ma CJHC opined (likewise at [28]) that
                    in such cases, “<em>the court clearly has jurisdiction but
                        it must be carefully exercised</em>” [emphasis added].
                    Ma CJHC went on to analyse a line of cases where claimants had sought
                    declaratory relief on hypothetical matters, and expressed his conclusion at
                    [28(8)] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ultimately, I am persuaded that where academic or hypothetical issues are
                        involved, the question is not really one of jurisdiction but of
                        discretion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Even so, we note that not all of the common
                    law jurisdictions have been of one voice on this issue. In particular, we note
                    that American jurisprudence has developed in the other direction, <em>viz</em>, that the need for a real controversy goes towards
                    jurisdiction and not discretion. As mentioned at [134] above, this is also the
                    position taken by the AG in this appeal. In his submissions on this point,
                    Mr Abdullah referred to <em>Lujan, Secretary of the Interior
                        v Defenders of Wildlife et al</em> 504 US 555 (1992), where the
                    US Supreme Court held at 560 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he core component of standing is an essential and unchanging
                        part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III [of the
                        Constitution of the US]. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Over the years, our cases have established that the irreducible
                        constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements. First, the
                        plaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact” – an
                        invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and
                        particularized, … and (b) “actual or imminent, <em>not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical
                            …’</em>” ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As no one would argue that standing is anything but a jurisdictional
                    requirement (as opposed to being a factor that the court can take into account
                    in exercising its discretion), and as standing is viewed as a function of
                    controversy in the US, it follows that the existence of a real controversy is an
                    element that goes to the US courts’ jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    The view that the “real
                    controversy” requirement is an element of jurisdiction in the US is
                    undergirded by the express references to “Cases” and
                    “Controversies” in s 2 of Art III of the Constitution of
                    the US, which sets out the scope of the judicial power in the US. As the very
                    delineation of the scope of the judicial power in the US imports the requirement
                    of a controversy, it is clear that the judicial power of the US courts cannot be
                    exercised in the absence of a controversy. In contrast, Art 93 of the
                    Constitution of Singapore, which vests the judicial power of Singapore in our
                    courts, does not make express reference to controversies. For this reason, we do
                    not find the American cases on this issue persuasive. We are unable to agree
                    with the AG that this distinction is
                        “inconsequential”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The courts should be slow to read in
                    jurisdictional requirements which limit the sphere of their judicial power as
                    such requirements restrict access to justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    We agree instead with the analysis in
                        <em>Zamir &amp; Woolf</em> at para 4-98:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The courts will not grant declarations which are of no value but, if a
                        declaration will be helpful to the parties or the public, the courts will be
                        sympathetic to the claim for a declaration <em>even if the
                            facts on which the claim is based or the issue to which it relates can
                            be described as theoretical.</em> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Where the circumstances of a case are such that a declaration will be
                    of value to the parties or to the public, the court may proceed to hear the case
                    and grant declaratory relief even though the facts on which the action is based
                    are theoretical. We do not necessarily see this as an exception to the
                    “real controversy” requirement as we are of the view that it can
                    logically be said that where there is a real <em>legal</em>
                    interest in a case being heard, there is a real controversy to be determined.
                    Further, as noted above at [17], a declaration by the court which determines the
                    controversy between the parties is <em>res judicata</em>.
                    “Legal” interest is used here in contradistinction to a mere
                    socio-political interest, and may be said to arise where there is a novel
                    question of law for determination, as in the present case. While a legal
                    interest may suffice to satisfy the “real controversy”
                    requirement, mere socio-political interest will <em>not</em> suffice in itself. The court is well placed to determine
                    legal questions but not socio-political questions. The court’s function is
                    instead to ensure, as the guardian of the Constitution, that the Constitution is
                    upheld inviolate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    We emphasise that we are in no way stating
                    that the court will always hear cases even where there is no <em>lis</em> between the parties <em>inter se</em>,
                    but merely that the court may exercise its discretion to do so in a proper case.
                    We now come to the issue of <em>how</em> the court should
                    exercise its discretion in this regard and what factors it should take into
                    account in deciding what constitutes a proper case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    In <em>Salem</em> at
                    457A, Lord Slynn sagaciously cautioned that even in the area of public law,
                    the courts should be circumspect in exercising their discretion to hear
                    hypothetical issues, and should not do so “unless there is a good reason
                    in the <em>public interest</em> for so doing”
                    [emphasis added]. As can be seen, the key factor in favour of the court hearing
                    an academic issue is that it is in the public interest for the court to do so.
                    This key concern was echoed in <em>Michael Victor Gawler v Paul
                        Raettig</em> [2007] EWCA Civ 1560 at [37], where the English Court of
                    Appeal’s approach to the exercise of its discretion was expressed as
                    follows (<em>per</em> Sir Anthony
                    Clarke MR):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All will depend upon the facts of the particular case and … I do
                        not intend to be too prescriptive. However, such cases are likely to have a
                        number of characteristics in addition to <em>the critical
                            requirement that an academic appeal is in the public
                        interest</em>. They include the necessity that all sides of the
                        argument will be fully and properly put: see eg <em>National
                            Coal Board v Ridgeway</em> [[1997] 3 All ER 562], per
                        Bingham LJ at page 604f and <em>Bowman v
                            Fels</em> at [12] and [15]. It seems to me that in the vast
                        majority of such cases, this must involve counsel being instructed by
                        solicitors instructed by those with a real interest in the outcome of the
                        appeal. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    The need for caution was also emphasised in
                        <em>Rolls-Royce</em> at [59], where Wall LJ
                    expressed concern that the court was “being asked to decide an issue
                    which [was] likely to affect a large number of people who [would] have had no
                    say in [the court’s] decision”. For this reason, the English Court
                    of Appeal approached the matter on a narrow basis in that case (see <em>Rolls-Royce</em> at [60]). We add a similar caveat to the
                    present appeal. It cannot be overstated that each case turns on its particular
                    facts, and we adopt a similar narrow basis in our approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relevant facts in the present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    With that, we now turn to consider the facts
                    of the present appeal. The two key facts before us are that: (a) Tan was
                    arrested, investigated, detained and subsequently charged under s 377A; and
                    (b) the s 377A charge was later substituted with a charge under
                        s 294(<em>a</em>). We will deal with each of these
                    facts <em>seriatim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The arrest, investigation, detention and charge under s 377A </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Tan’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    Tan’s case is that his arrest and
                    detention were expressly made pursuant to s 377A, and there was no
                    indication that a s 294(<em>a</em>) charge was even
                    considered to be appropriate until much later when the original s 377A
                    charge was substituted. There was therefore no indication that there was a
                    concurrent investigation under s 294(<em>a</em>).
                    Mr Ravi further submits that the existence of an alternative legitimate
                    ground for depriving Tan of his personal liberty (<em>viz</em>, s 294(<em>a</em>)) did not make
                    the purported deprivation of personal liberty under s 377A lawful. Further
                    or in the alternative, Mr Ravi submits that the deprivation of personal
                    liberty under each provision is not identical or interchangeable.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The AG’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    The AG’s case is that the mere fact
                    that Tan was initially arrested and detained for the purposes of investigations
                    into his conduct on 9 March 2010 did not create a <em>lis</em> and did not furnish him with <em>locus
                        standi</em> to bring the Application. Mr Abdullah highlights that
                    at the preliminary stage of the investigations, all that the police did was to
                    investigate Tan’s conduct to determine if any offence had been disclosed.
                    Mr Abdullah emphasises that investigations are a fact-finding exercise
                    which do not always result in sufficient evidence for a charge to be preferred,
                    or for another charge to be preferred in place of the original charge for which
                    the investigations were carried out. According to Mr Abdullah, the very
                    nature of police investigations means that while investigations are ongoing,
                    there can be no firm indication that the suspect has committed any specific
                    offence. While investigations were ongoing in Tan’s case, there would have
                    been a whole range of possible offences that Tan could have been charged with,
                    including the offence under s 294(<em>a</em>). While
                    Mr Abdullah accepts that there is a need to <em>identify</em> one or more of the offences that a suspect might have
                    committed, he characterises this as being done for the purpose of <em>classification</em>, and asserts that even though a suspect
                    may be informed that he is being investigated for a particular offence, any such
                    intimation is necessarily provisional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    The AG thus argues that the s 377A
                    charge against Tan only crystallised when Tan was charged in court. However,
                    even if we accept this argument, we have difficulty seeing how this furthers the
                    AG’s case as it is clear that Tan <em>was indeed charged
                        under s 377A</em>. With respect, the argument that there was no
                        <em>lis</em> at the time when Tan was charged under
                    s 377A is unconvincing. In fact, Mr Abdullah has stated that if there
                    was a real controversy at the point of Tan being charged under s 377A, the
                    matter should have been raised at that point. It is clear to us, however, that
                    Tan did just that by bringing the Application for declaratory relief after he
                    was charged under s 377A. If this had been the end of the matter in the
                    present case, we would have no difficulty finding that the “real
                    controversy” requirement has been satisfied. However, it is equally clear
                    that the s 377A charge against Tan was subsequently substituted by the
                        s 294(<em>a</em>) charge, a point which we will
                    deal with below at [165]–[172].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Our analysis and decision </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_151"></a>151    We are unable to agree with the AG that
                    violations of constitutional rights only occur when a person is prosecuted under
                    an allegedly unconstitutional law. <em>It is clear that
                        violations of constitutional rights may occur earlier</em>,
                        viz<em>, when an accused is arrested and detained under an
                        allegedly unconstitutional law.</em> When a person is arrested and
                    detained, he is deprived of his Art 9(1) right to personal liberty.
                    However, if such deprivation is done “in accordance with law”,
                    there is no breach of Art 9(1). For ease of reading, Art 9(1) is
                    reproduced as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty <em>save in accordance with law</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_152"></a>152    The wording of Art 9(1) makes it clear
                    that every detention must be effected under a valid law. In our view, it is
                    plain that “law” under Art 9(1) cannot be interpreted as
                    encompassing an unconstitutional law. It is absurd to read Art 9(1) as
                    sanctioning unconstitutional deprivations of personal liberty as to do so would
                    be to render the protection offered by Art 9(1) nugatory, with the result
                    that it would be a “misuse of language to speak of law as something which
                    affords ‘protection’ for the individual in the enjoyment of his
                    fundamental liberties” (see <em>Ong Ah Chuan
                        </em><em>and another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [1979–1980] SLR(R) 710 at [26]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_153"></a>153    In short, while a person has no right not to
                    be detained under a law which has been validly passed, he has a right not to be
                    detained under an unconstitutional law. As stated earlier at [125]–[127],
                    we find that there is an arguable case that s 377A is inconsistent with
                    Art 12. Therefore, Tan’s right to personal liberty under
                    Art 9(1) would have been violated by his arrest and detention under
                    s 377A if s 377A were indeed unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_154"></a>154    Although we accept Mr Abdullah’s
                    point that while investigations into a suspect are ongoing, there are a range of
                    possible offences that may be considered, there was no indication by the
                    Attorney-General’s Chambers (“the AGC”) in this case that a
                    charge under s 294(<em>a</em>) was even considered to
                    be appropriate at the time of Tan’s arrest, investigation and detention.
                    We note that all the documents relating to Tan’s arrest and bail expressly
                    indicated s 377A – the tag that was used to identify Tan’s
                    belongings after he was detained at the police station indicated that he had
                    been detained in respect of a possible s 377A charge, and the document for
                    police bail indicated that bail was likewise for a s 377A charge. We thus
                    find that even though Tan eventually posted police bail, he was detained while
                    investigations under s 377A were pending. The fact that the s 377A
                    charge against Tan was subsequently replaced approximately six weeks later by
                    the s 294(<em>a</em>) charge cannot negate the crucial
                    historical fact that Tan was at the outset detained, investigated and then
                    charged under s 377A. To state otherwise would be to bury the
                facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_155"></a>155    
          <em>However</em>, the
                    quirk here is that even though Tan <em>was</em> arrested,
                    investigated and detained under s 377A, the same <em>could
                        have been</em> effected under s 294(<em>a</em>). As such, the power to detain could have been lawfully
                    exercised had it proceeded under s 294(<em>a</em>),
                    the constitutionality of which cannot be impugned. If a law is constitutional
                    and validly passed, it is clear that the police may arrest, investigate and
                    detain suspects under that law. The issue is thus whether the existence of
                        <em>alternative legitimate means</em> under which a
                    detention could have taken place negates any unconstitutionality that the
                    detention might suffer from. If the Executive is legally empowered to take the
                    relevant action in any case through alternative legitimate means, it is arguable
                    that the fact that an illegal procedure happened to be utilised may not give
                    rise to cause for complaint. On the facts of the present appeal, although
                    Tan’s detention under s 377A might have violated his Art 9(1)
                    rights, the detention could equally have proceeded under s 294(<em>a</em>), with the corollary that Tan’s constitutional
                    rights would not have been affected. In other words, Tan would have been
                    detained <em>regardless</em> of whether the detention

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_156"></a>156    As the parties did not address this point,
                    we asked for further submissions on the following question:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that there is an arguable
                        case <em>apropos</em> the constitutionality of
                        s 377A of the [current] Penal Code, can it nevertheless be said that
                        [Tan] has no cause for complaint since some other legitimate means of
                        legally investigating, apprehending, charging and convicting [him] were
                        concurrently extant (e.g. under s 294(a) of the [current] Penal Code)?
                        Counsel are requested to consider <em>inter alia</em>
                        the case of <em>Regina (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the
                            Home Department (JUSTICE and another intervening)</em> [2011]
                        2 WLR 671.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Counsel are advised that this is a distinct issue from that of the alleged
                        extinguishment of the real controversy by the substitution of the
                        s 377A charge with [the charge under] s 294(a) of the [current]
                        Penal Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_157"></a>157    One of the issues that arose for
                    determination in <em>Regina (Lumba) v Secretary of State for the
                        Home Department (JUSTICE and another intervening)</em> [2011]
                    2 WLR 671 (“<em>Lumba</em>”) was whether
                    the tort of false imprisonment was committed by the UK Home Secretary’s
                    unlawful exercise of the power to detain, given that it was “certain that
                    the claimant could and would have been detained if the power had been exercised
                    lawfully” (at [71]). The majority of the Supreme Court of the United
                    Kingdom held that where a public law authority made a decision to detain that
                    was tainted by a public law error, it was not a defence to an action for false
                    imprisonment to show that a lawful decision to detain the claimant in question
                        <em>could and would have been made</em>.
                    Lord Dyson JSC, who delivered the leading judgment for the majority,
                    concluded as follows at [71]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the detainer is a public authority, it must have the power to detain
                        and the power must be lawfully exercised. <em>Where the power
                            has not been lawfully exercised, it is nothing to the point that it
                            could have been lawfully exercised. If the power could and would have
                            been lawfully exercised, that is a powerful reason for concluding that
                            the detainee has suffered no loss and is entitled to no more than
                            nominal damages. But that is not a reason for holding that the tort [of
                            false imprisonment] has not been committed</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_158"></a>158    The AG has submitted that the
                    majority’s findings in <em>Lumba</em> are confined to
                    an exposition of whether the elements of the tort of false imprisonment were
                    made out in that case as “a technical matter”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and cannot be subjected to wider
                    application. Although <em>Lumba</em> arose from a breach of
                    a public law duty by the UK Home Secretary, the case concerned a civil law
                    action for damages for false imprisonment and did not involve a decision on
                    standing in a public law action. On this basis, the AG seeks to distinguish
                        <em>Lumba</em> from the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_159"></a>159    We accept the AG’s submissions in so
                    far as they relate to the distinctions between the factual matrices of <em>Lumba</em> and the present appeal, <em>viz</em>, <em>Lumba</em> was primarily concerned
                    with a private law claim for the tort of false imprisonment, whereas the present
                    appeal concerns the standing requirements in an application for declaratory
                    relief which involves constitutional rights. We express <em>no
                        view</em> on whether Tan can successfully maintain any action for the
                    tort of false imprisonment <em>vis-à-vis</em> his arrest
                    and detention under s 377A if that section is indeed
                    unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_160"></a>160    Even so, we respectfully disagree with the
                    AG that the principles elucidated in <em>Lumba</em> should
                    be so narrowly confined. The issue of causation which was analysed in <em>Lumba</em> –
                    <em>viz</em>, whether the unlawful nature of a deprivation
                    of personal liberty is lost when the deprivation could have proceeded in a
                    lawful manner – is applicable to the present case. As Lord Dyson
                    stated at [62] of <em>Lumba</em>, the issue of whether a
                    defence of causation should be recognised is a <em>common
                        issue</em> in both the tort of false imprisonment and public
                    law:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The introduction of a causation test in the tort of false imprisonment is
                        contrary to principle both as a matter of the law of trespass to the person
                        and <b><em>as a matter of administrative
                            law</em></b><em>. </em><b><em>Neither body of law recognises any defence of causation</em></b> so
                        as to render lawful what is in fact an unlawful authority to detain, by
                        reference to how the executive could and <em>would
                            have</em> acted if it had acted lawfully, as opposed to how it
                            <em>did in fact</em> act. [emphasis in original in
                        italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, while the elements of unlawful detention under the tort of
                    false imprisonment may not be identical to the elements of unconstitutional
                    deprivation of personal liberty in breach of Art 9(1), the former elements
                    pitch the issue of causation at a higher level of generality, and we find that
                    they are applicable to the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_161"></a>161    We now go on to examine the principles
                    elucidated in <em>Lumba</em> on the issue of whether the
                    unlawful nature of a deprivation of personal liberty is lost when the
                    deprivation could have proceeded in a lawful manner. Lord Kerr of
                    Tonaghmore JSC, as part of the majority, expressed views on this issue
                    which are instructive (at [239]–[243]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">239    ... The fact that a person <em>could have been</em> lawfully detained says nothing on the
                            question whether he <em>was</em> lawfully
                            detained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">240    ... An ex post facto conclusion that, had the
                            proper policy been applied, the [applicants] would have been lawfully
                            detained cannot alter that essential fact [that the proper law was not
                            so applied].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">241    The inevitability of the finding that the
                            detention was unlawful can be illustrated in this way. If, some hours
                            after making the decision to detain the [applicants] (based on the
                            application of the unpublished policy), it was recognised that this did
                            not constitute a legal basis on which they could be held, could their
                            detention be said to be lawful before any consideration was given to
                            whether the application of the published policy would have led to the
                            same result? <b><em>Surely, at the moment that it became
                                clear that there was no lawful authority for the detention and
                                before any alternative basis on which they might be detained was
                                considered, their detention was unlawful.</em></b></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">242    It is, I believe, important to recognise that
                            lawful detention has two aspects. First the decision to detain must be
                            lawful in the sense that it has a sound legal basis and, secondly, it
                            must <em>justify</em> the detention. This second
                            aspect has found expression in a large number of judgments, perhaps most
                            succinctly in the speech of Lord Hope in <em>R
                                </em><em>v </em><em>Governor of Brockhill Prison Ex p Evans (No 2)</em>
                            [2001] 2 AC 19, 32D where he said “it is of the essence of
                            the tort of false imprisonment that the imprisonment is without lawful
                            justification”. It seems to me to be self evident that the
                            justification must relate to the basis on which the detainer has
                            purported to act, and not depend on some abstract grounds wholly
                            different from the actual reasons for detaining. As Mr Husain
                            [counsel for one of the applicants] put it, the emphasis here must be on
                            the right of the detained person not to be detained other than on a
                            lawful basis which justifies the detention. <b><em>Detention cannot be justified on some putative basis, unrelated to
                                the actual reasons for it, on which the detention might
                                retrospectively be said to be warranted.</em></b> Simply because
                            some ground for lawfully detaining may exist but has not been resorted
                            to by the detaining authority, the detention cannot be said, on that
                            account, to be lawful.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">243    ... As Professor Cane put it in “The
                            Temporal Element in Law” (2001) 117 LQR 5, 7
                            “imprisonment can never be justified unless <em>actually</em> [as opposed to hypothetically] authorised by
                            law”. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_162"></a>162    As can be seen from the above extract,
                    Lord Kerr focused on the fact that a lawful decision to detain was
                        <em>not</em> in fact made in <em>Lumba</em>, and it was this crucial fact of unlawful detention that
                    gave rise to the necessity of the grant of a remedy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_163"></a>163    We agree with the foregoing analysis, and
                    add that it is not right to say that the detention which Tan faced was the
                        <em>same</em> regardless of whether it proceeded under
                    s 377A or s 294(<em>a</em>). The critical
                    difference lies in the <em>legality</em> of the actual
                    detention. Further, it is only through a strained process of <em>ex post facto</em> rationalisation adopted by the AG that one can say
                    that an alternative lawful avenue for detaining Tan was available at the
                    material time, and that had it been utilised, there would have been no violation
                    of Tan’s constitutional rights. This process of <em>ex post
                        facto</em> rationalisation does not negate the fact that assuming,
                        <em>arguendo</em>, that s 377A is
                    unconstitutional, <em>there was an actual violation of
                        Tan’s constitutional rights</em> at the time of his detention
                    under that section.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_164"></a>164    We thus find that there was a <em>lis</em> at the point when Tan was detained under
                    s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The substitution of the s 294(a) charge for the s 377A
                charge</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_165"></a>165    We come to the second key fact of this case,
                        <em>viz</em>, that a s 294(<em>a</em>) charge was subsequently substituted for the s 377A
                    charge against Tan. Mr Abdullah’s submissions before this court
                    centre on the fact of this substitution, and on the fact that Tan <em>pleaded guilty</em> to the substituted charge. However, we
                    find that the focus on Tan’s plea of guilty to the s 294(<em>a</em>) charge is a red herring. When questioned on whether
                    the AG would have pursued the “no real controversy” argument if
                    Tan had claimed trial to the s 294(<em>a</em>) charge
                    instead of entering a plea of guilty, Mr Abdullah rightly acknowledged that
                    the AG would have raised the same argument regardless of the plea of guilty.
                    Therefore, our focus will not be on Tan’s plea of guilty to the
                        s 294(<em>a</em>) charge, but on the substitution
                    of the original s 377A charge itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_166"></a>166    As to the substitution of the s 377A
                    charge, the AG’s case is that since the decision sought to be impugned
                        (<em>ie</em>, the decision to charge Tan under
                    s 377A) has been substituted by a fresh decision (<em>ie</em>, the decision to charge Tan under s 294(<em>a</em>)), it is the latter decision that forms the subject
                    matter of review because a challenge to the initial decision becomes
                        “pointless”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> In support of this position,
                    the AG has cited the cases of <em>R v Secretary of State for the
                        Home Department, ex parte Turgut</em> [2001] 1 All ER 719
                        (“<em>Turgut</em>”) and <em>The Queen on the Application of </em><em>Rathakrishnan v Secretary of State for the Home Department</em>
                    [2011] EWHC 1406 (Admin) (“<em>Rathakrishnan</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_167"></a>167    The fundamental difficulty that we have with
                    the AG’s contention is that it is not the AG’s decision to proceed
                    with a s 377A charge against Tan which is being impugned here. This case
                    has never been about a challenge to the exercise of the AG’s prosecutorial
                    discretion. Instead, what is being impugned here is s 377A
                itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_168"></a>168    Further, we find that neither <em>Turgut</em> nor <em>Rathakrishnan</em>
                    are applicable to the present case. In <em>Turgut</em>, the
                    court was asked to consider the correct approach to a challenge against a public
                    law decision which had been replaced by a further subsequent decision. The court
                    concluded at 735–736 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where however the second decision is to the same effect as the first
                        decision and the applicant challenges the legality of the second decision
                        the question then arises as to what is the proper approach of the court.
                        Further litigation on the first decision will generally be pointless. In
                        general it will be convenient to substitute the second decision for the
                        first decision as being the decision challenged in the proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, the second decision in <em>Turgut</em> had the <em>same effect</em> as the
                    first decision. We understand “effect” to mean the legal effect of
                    the decisions. As the two decisions in issue in <em>Turgut</em> had the same effect, the applicant was not prejudiced by
                    the substitution of the second decision for the first decision in the judicial
                    review proceedings. We find no difficulty with the ruling in <em>Turgut</em>. However, it is not applicable to the present case as the
                    legal effect of s 377A and that of s 294(<em>a</em>) are not the same, given that the former is arguably
                    unconstitutional while the latter is undoubtedly constitutional.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_169"></a>169    
          <em>Rathakrishnan</em>
                    involved a challenge to a refusal to grant asylum. The procedural history of the
                    case is crucial to a proper understanding of the decision which the court
                    arrived at. In <em>Rathakrishnan</em>, the
                    applicant’s initial claim for asylum was rejected, and following this
                    rejection, he made fresh representations. The UK Secretary of State declined to
                    treat the applicant’s fresh representations as a fresh claim for asylum,
                    and the applicant challenged that decision (“the impugned
                    decision”) by way of judicial review proceedings. After the judicial
                    review proceedings were commenced, the UK Secretary of State decided that she
                    would no longer rely on the impugned decision as she acknowledged that she might
                    indeed have failed to properly consider the substance of all the points raised
                    by the applicant in his representations. The UK Secretary of State invited the
                    applicant to agree to the court disposing of the judicial review proceedings by
                    quashing the impugned decision and ordering her (the UK Secretary of State) to
                    reconsider his representations. The applicant was unwilling to agree and instead
                    sought to have the judicial review proceedings stayed. It appeared that his
                    thinking was that if the judicial review proceedings were merely stayed instead
                    of disposed of conclusively by the court, then in the event that the UK
                    Secretary of State’s fresh decision on his asylum claim was unfavourable
                    to him and thus (from his perspective) arguably unlawful, that fresh decision
                    could be challenged within the same judicial review proceedings (see <em>Rathakrishnan</em> at [5]). The court declined to allow the
                    judicial review proceedings to remain on foot for the reason that if the UK
                    Secretary of State’s error were to be repeated in her reconsideration of
                    the applicant’s representations, it could be the subject matter of fresh
                    judicial review proceedings (see <em>Rathakrishnan</em> at
                    [15]). The court’s concern was that judicial review proceedings might
                    again be initiated after the UK Secretary of State delivered her pending fresh
                    decision on the applicant’s asylum claim following her reconsideration of
                    his representations. In that scenario, if the existing judicial review
                    proceedings were not terminated, there would be two sets of judicial review
                    proceedings <em>vis-à-vis</em> the applicant’s asylum
                    claim: the existing judicial review proceedings in respect of the impugned
                    decision, and new judicial review proceedings in respect of the UK Secretary of
                    State’s fresh decision on the asylum claim. In the court’s view,
                    “[t]o have two decisions that [were] the subject of challenge on partly
                    the same and partly different grounds [led] to muddle” (see <em>Rathakrishnan</em> at [15]). The court thus held (at [17])
                    that “where a fresh decision ha[d] yet to be made and [was] going to be
                    made, the existing proceedings should normally end”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_170"></a>170    We find that the ruling in <em>Rathakrishnan</em> is not applicable to the present case as
                    there is no pending fresh decision to speak of here. The court’s concern
                    in that case – namely, to avoid a situation where two judicial review
                    proceedings are launched on “partly the same and partly different
                    grounds” (see <em>Rathakrishnan</em> at [15])
                    against two decisions involving the same subject matter (<em>viz</em>, the applicant’s asylum claim in <em>Rathakrishnan</em>) – does not apply to the present
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_171"></a>171    Furthermore, what is being challenged in the
                    present case is neither the original decision (to charge Tan under s 377A)
                    nor the fresh decision (to charge Tan under s 294<em>(a</em>) instead). As noted above at [167], what is being challenged
                    is the constitutionality of s 377A itself<em>.</em>
                    Assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that s 377A is
                    unconstitutional, we have found that the very existence of s 377A in the
                    statute books arguably violates Tan’s constitutional rights <em>without</em> the need for any violation through executive
                    action (see above at [126]). It is here that the difference between challenging
                    an executive decision and challenging a law can be seen. <em>Rathakrishnan</em> was concerned with the constitutionality of an
                    executive decision, while the present case is concerned with the
                    constitutionality of a law. A law exists on a different plane from an executive
                    decision. Executive decisions are taken under laws and, thus, are subject to
                    legal limits (see <em>Chng </em><em>Suan
                        </em><em>Tze </em><em>v Minister
                        for Home Affairs and others and other appeals</em> [1988]
                    2 SLR(R) 525 at [86]). All prosecutions are instantiations of the
                    AG’s executive decisions. Where a prosecution is brought under an
                    unconstitutional law, all decisions to prosecute under that law will also be
                    unconstitutional. The unconstitutionality of the law is not derived from the
                    unconstitutionality of the prosecutions brought under it; instead, it is the
                    other way around. We pause to add that the unconstitutionality of a prosecution
                    may also arise apart from the unconstitutionality of a law (see <em>Ramalingam </em><em>Ravinthran v
                        Attorney-General</em> [2012] 2 SLR 49 (“<em>Ramalingam </em><em>Ravinthran</em>”) at
                    [17]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_172"></a>172    We are here faced with a third situation
                    distinct from that in <em>Turgut</em> and that in <em>Rathakrishnan</em>. In the present case, there has been a
                    fresh decision, and this fresh decision had a different legal effect from the
                    initial decision. <em>If</em> the fresh decision
                    extinguished the initial decision, the initial decision would no longer be open
                    to challenge as it would have ceased to have any effect. <em>However</em>, where the initial decision had <em>real
                        consequences</em> during the interim between the initial decision and
                    the fresh decision, and where those consequences were not ameliorated or
                    extinguished by the fresh decision, the initial decision would remain open to
                    challenge. <em>In the present case, while the s 377A charge
                        against Tan can be said to have been extinguished by the substitution of the
                        s 294(</em>a<em>) charge in the sense that the
                        s 377A charge ceased to exist from the time the substituted charge was
                        preferred, the violation of Tan’s Art 9(1) rights in the interim
                        period before the substituted charge was preferred was not remedied by the
                        mere fact of the substitution in itself.</em> As the violation of
                    Tan’s constitutional rights has not been and is not capable of being
                    excised or extinguished by the preferring of the substituted charge anymore than
                    it is capable of being excised by the fact that Tan’s arrest and detention
                    under s 377A could have lawfully proceeded under s 294(<em>a</em>) (see above at [163]), we find that the <em>lis</em> created by the initial decision to charge Tan under
                    s 377A remains in existence despite the substitution of the s 377A
                    charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Is there a real and credible threat of prosecution under
                s 377A?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_173"></a>173    On behalf of Tan, Mr Ravi submits that
                    as long as s 377A exists, the police are at liberty to arrest based on it
                    and the AGC is at liberty to charge based on it. Therefore, “no amount of
                    non-binding reassurance from the executive about the non-enforcement will be
                        sufficient”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Mr Ravi
                    notes that there has not been any executive order to the effect that s 377A
                    must not be used to charge consensual private acts between male homosexuals.
                    Further, during the hearing before this court, Mr Ravi stated that there
                    had been two recent cases where the police issued stern warnings under
                    s 377A for private consensual sex between male homosexuals after arresting
                    the individuals concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_174"></a>174    The AG’s case is that there is no real
                    and credible threat of prosecution under s 377A for the sphere of acts that
                    Tan is interested in, <em>ie</em>, private consensual
                    sexual acts between two adult males. Even if there is a threat of prosecution,
                    this is a mere spectre. As for the instances where stern warnings under
                    s 377A were issued, Mr Abdullah submits that after stern warnings are
                    issued, the police do not check for continued compliance with the warnings and
                    the persons concerned are, for all intents and purposes, left alone. We note
                    that Mr Abdullah, however, has not refuted Mr Ravi’s statement
                    that there have been cases of arrests resulting in stern warnings under
                    s 377A for consensual sexual acts conducted in private (see above at [173]
                    as well as below at [183]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_175"></a>175    Just as individuals have a right not to be
                    arrested, investigated and detained under an unconstitutional law, they also
                    have a right not to be prosecuted under an unconstitutional law. In <em>Ramalingam </em><em>Ravinthran</em>, it
                    was held by this court at [17] that “a prosecution in breach of
                    constitutionally-protected rights would be unconstitutional”. Individuals
                    who act in ways that may render them liable under unconstitutional laws ought
                    not be placed in the unenviable position of waiting for an unconstitutional
                    sword of Damocles to fall upon their fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_176"></a>176    The AG’s arguments as to the threat of
                    prosecutions under s 377A being merely fanciful was also raised by the
                    respondent in <em>Leung</em> (<em>viz</em>, the Hong Kong Secretary for Justice) in the following
                    manner (at [26]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The applicant may or may not in the future be prosecuted but that is a
                        purely hypothetical situation which may never occur and the Court ought not
                        grant declarations relating to hypothetical events in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_177"></a>177    To this, the Hong Kong Court of Appeal
                    curtly responded by stating at [28] that it “clearly [had] jurisdiction
                    but [jurisdiction] must be carefully exercised”. The court held that even
                    though future events or proposed conduct was involved, in “exceptional
                    cases” (at [28(2)]), it would grant the appropriate relief. The court
                    went on to refer to <em>Airedale NHS Trust v Bland</em>
                    [1993] AC 789, where, notwithstanding that the declarations sought dealt with
                    the legality of future conduct, Lord Goff of Chieveley opined as follows
                    (at 862H–863A):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would, in my opinion, be a deplorable state of affairs if no
                        authoritative guidance could be given to the medical profession in a case
                        such as the present, so that a doctor would be compelled either to act
                        contrary to the principles of medical ethics established by his professional
                        body or to risk a prosecution for murder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_178"></a>178    It can thus be seen that one of the reasons
                    why a real and credible threat of prosecution may be seen as giving rise to a
                        <em>lis</em> is that individuals should not be
                    compelled to act against what is, on the face of it, the law, and thereby risk
                    the actualisation of the threat of prosecution. This was acknowledged in
                    Lord Woolf &amp; Jeffrey Jowell, <em>de </em><em>Smith, Woolf &amp; </em><em>Jowell: Judicial
                        Review of Administrative Action</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                    5th Ed, 1995) at para 18-002 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A declaration] is increasingly being used to pronounce upon the legality
                        of a future situation and in that way the occurrence of illegal action is
                        avoided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We add that the notion that individuals cannot be required to breach
                    the law in order to gain access to justice (expanded on above at
                    [96]–[105] in the context of standing) is broad enough to encompass both
                    breaches of the law which do and breaches of the law which do not result in
                    prosecutions. The decision to bring a prosecution is at the sole discretion of
                    the AG and lies outside an individual’s control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_179"></a>179    Further, if a law is unconstitutional,
                    selective prosecution under that law is not an answer as no prosecutions
                    whatsoever should be brought under an unconstitutional law. Although the
                    existence of a <em>lis</em> is clearer when a prosecution
                    has been brought under an allegedly unconstitutional law, the very fact of a
                    real and credible threat of prosecution under such a law is sufficient to amount
                    to an arguable violation of constitutional rights, and this violation gives rise
                    to a real controversy for the court to determine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_180"></a>180    There have been ministerial statements in
                    Parliament indicating that the Government’s policy towards s 377A is
                    that this provision will not be “proactively” enforced (see
                        <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (23 October 2007) vol 83 at col 2401; see
                    also <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official
                        Report</em> (21 July 2008) vol 84 at col 2923).
                    However, “no proactive enforcement” is, in our view, of a totally
                    different complexion from “no enforcement”. No Minister has gone
                    so far as to state that there will be no enforcement of s 377A. The phrases
                    “active”/“proactive”/“vigorous”
                    enforcement are broad phrases which can comfortably bear a spectrum of meaning.
                    At one end of the spectrum, the lack of active enforcement may suggest that the
                    police will not charge consenting adult males who engage in homosexual
                    activities in private, whatever the circumstances. At the other end, it may
                    simply mean that the police will not purposely seek out adult males who carry
                    out such activities with a view to charging them, but if they happen to come
                    across such activities being committed or if they receive complaints of such
                    activities, they will then arrest and charge the relevant persons under
                    s 377A. One can conceive of a situation where a neighbour of a homosexual
                    couple calls the police to lodge a complaint that offences under s 377A are
                    being committed in the privacy of that couple’s home. In such a situation,
                    if the police respond to the call and proceed to arrest and charge the couple
                    under s 377A, would this be “active” enforcement, or
                    “reactive” enforcement? If it is the latter, it will not be
                    covered by the statements in Parliament.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_181"></a>181    An even more fundamental point ought to be
                    raised. As acknowledged by Mr Abdullah, ministerial statements do <em>not have the force of law</em> and do not bind the AG, who
                    exercises his prosecutorial discretion independently. While we are confident
                    that the AG will consider general governmental policy in exercising his
                    discretion, this cannot be a fetter on his exercise of that discretion.
                        <em>Before this court, it was made abundantly clear that no
                        binding assurance could be given that no future prosecutions would ever be
                        brought under s 377A.</em> Moreover, even if an assurance from
                    the AGC were forthcoming, as demonstrated in <em>Public
                        Prosecutor v Knight Glenn Jeyasingam</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1165
                        (“<em>Glenn Knight</em>”), a
                    representation by an incumbent Attorney-General cannot bind future
                    Attorney-Generals. In <em>Glenn Knight</em>, where it was
                    revealed that the then Attorney-General had decided to commence a prosecution
                    against the respondent in that case despite a purported letter promising him
                    immunity from future prosecution, the court held that that decision could not be
                    impugned due to “the almost inviolable discretion of the AGC to
                    prosecute” (at [70]) (for a more in-depth analysis of the constitutional
                    status of the prosecutorial discretion and its limitations, see <em>Ramalingam </em><em>Ravinthran</em>,
                    especially at [27], [28], [44], [45] and [51]–[53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_182"></a>182    Further, there is nothing to suggest that
                    the policy of the Government on s 377A will not be subject to change. Just
                    as the AG cannot fetter his discretion on policy matters, the Executive cannot
                    fetter its discretion on the same. Ministerial statements in Parliament on
                    policy matters do not invariably bind a future or even the same government. The
                    Executive’s discretion to determine policy remains unfettered and it has
                    the right to change its policy with regard to the enforcement of s 377A.
                    Therefore, as long as s 377A remains in the statute books, the threat of
                    prosecution under this section persists, as the facts of this case amply
                    illustrate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_183"></a>183    We also find that the threat of prosecution
                    under s 377A is not merely fanciful, even for the type of conduct that Tan
                    professes to regularly participate in,namely, private consensual sexual acts
                    between two adult males. As noted earlier at [173] above, stern warnings have
                    been issued by the police under s 377A for such conduct. As stern warnings
                    are only issued after investigations have been carried out with regard to the
                    offence in question, the individuals who have received stern warnings under
                    s 377A would have been arrested and detained under an arguably
                    unconstitutional law. When Mr Abdullah was asked about the stern warnings
                    issued by the police under s 377A, he stated that there is sometimes a
                    necessity for suspects to be investigated even though their sexual acts seem
                    consensual. This might occur where suspects have been arrested for another
                    criminal offence (<em>eg</em>, drug consumption) and the
                    facts also disclose a possible s 377A offence. In such cases, while the
                    police are aware of the facts giving rise to a possible s 377A charge, they
                    may decide not to proceed with that charge if the sexual activities were between
                    consenting adult males. We find that the fact that stern warnings have been
                    issued under s 377A for private consensual acts between adult males
                    suggests that there is not just a mere spectre of prosecutions under that
                    provision. A stern warning is a way of informing the individual who is warned
                    that if he continues to indulge in the type of conduct circumscribed by
                    s 377A, leniency may no longer be forthcoming in future and he may well be
                    charged under s 377A if he is found engaging in such conduct in the future.
                    Further, there is a real possibility that the individual police officer or
                    Deputy Public Prosecutor handling a case may decide not to proceed with a stern
                    warning, but to instead prefer a charge under s 377A. That appears to be
                    precisely what has happened here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_184"></a>184    Without going into the merits of the
                    Application, we want to acknowledge that in so far as s 377A in its current
                    form extends to private consensual sexual conduct between adult males, this
                    provision affects the lives of a not insignificant portion of our community in a
                    very real and intimate way. Such persons might plausibly assert that the
                    continued existence of s 377A in our statute books causes them to be
                    unapprehended felons in the privacy of their homes. The constitutionality or
                    otherwise of s 377A is thus of real public interest. We also note that
                    s 377A has other effects beyond criminal sanctions. One unwanted effect of
                    s 377A is that it may also make criminals out of victims. We will list
                    three illustrations to highlight this point. First, a man who suffers domestic
                    abuse at the hands of his male partner may be reluctant to report it to the
                    police as police investigations may reveal that he (<em>ie</em>, the victim of domestic abuse) is guilty of an offence under
                    s 377A. Second, if a man who has been sexually assaulted by another man
                    reports this to the police, he may lay himself open to a s 377A charge as
                    s 377A is silent on consent. While a charge in such a scenario may be
                    unlikely, the fear of being charged may be sufficient to deter some victims from
                    coming forward. Third, lest it is thought that these scenarios are fanciful, we
                    refer to a reported incident where a man who was robbed after having sex with
                    another man reported the theft to the police and received a warning under
                    s 377A (see “This teacher was caught having sex in public, police
                    tells school”, <em>The New Paper</em>
                    (21 February 2005)).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The issues in controversy in the present case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_185"></a>185    To end our analysis and discussion of
                    Issue 4, we frame the following arguable issues for the court below to
                    determine on the merits:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>whether s 377A violates
                        Art 12 in terms of:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_185-p2_ii-p3_a"></a>(a)       whether the
                            classification is founded on an intelligible differentia;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_185-p2_ii-p3_b"></a>(b)       whether the differentia bears a rational relation to the object sought
                            to be achieved by s 377A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_186"></a>186    In the result, we affirm the Judge’s
                    determination (albeit on different grounds) that Tan has <em>locus standi</em> to make the Application (see [125]–[127]
                    above). The way in which this case has been argued ties the issues of <em>locus standi</em> and certainty of failure together, and,
                    thus, we find that the Application is not certain to fail, given that Tan has
                        <em>locus standi</em> to pursue it. Further, we also
                    find that that there is an arguable case on the constitutionality of s 377A
                    that ought to be heard in the High Court (see [185] above). We emphasise that
                    our finding of the existence of a real controversy to be determined in this case
                    arises from a combination of two factors. Firstly, Tan was at the outset
                    arrested, investigated, detained and charged exclusively under s 377A. This
                    squarely raises the issue as to whether Tan’s initial detention and
                    prosecution were “in accordance with law” within the meaning of
                    Art 9(1) as s 377A was the only provision relied on by the
                    investigators and the Prosecution at all material times prior to the
                    substitution of the s 377A charge with the s 294(<em>a</em>) charge. The subsequent substitution of the s 377A charge
                    only after the Application was filed could not excise any earlier
                    “wrong” which might have been committed <em>vis-à-vis</em> Tan (see [163] and [172] above). Secondly, there is a
                    real and credible threat of prosecution under s 377A (see [173]–[183]
                    above). Our finding that there is a real controversy to be adjudicated in this
                    case removes the anomaly referred to at [15] above as now, Tan, an applicant who
                    has <em>locus standi</em> based on a finding of an arguable
                    violation of his constitutional rights, will be allowed to vindicate his rights
                    before the courts. The principle of access to justice calls for nothing
                    less.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_187"></a>187    We thus allow the present appeal and grant
                    Tan leave to amend the Application to include a prayer that he ought not to have
                    been arrested, investigated, detained and charged under s 377A, as well as
                    to make the appropriate references to Art 162 for the sake of completeness.
                    We hold that Tan has standing to pursue his claim for declaratory relief subject
                    to the requisite amendments to the Application being made. For the avoidance of
                    any doubt, we reiterate (see also above at, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, [3] and [127]) that we are <em>not</em> deciding here that s 377A <em>is</em> inconsistent with Art 12 as that goes to the merits of
                    the Application. We are merely deciding that it is <em>arguably</em> so, which suffices for the present appeal on the
                    preliminary issue of whether the Application should be struck out.</p>

<p><strong>SUPREME COURT SINGAPORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>21 August 2012</strong></p>
<p><strong>Media Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tan Eng Hong v Attorney-General<br/>
<em>Civil Appeal No. 50 of 2011</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Decision of the Court of Appeal (delivered by V K Rajah JA)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Facts <br/>
</strong><br/>
(1) On 9 March 2010, Tan Eng Hong (“Tan”) and another male person (“the co-accused”) were arrested for engaging in oral sex in a cubicle in a public toilet of a shopping complex. Both parties are adult males in their forties. Tan and the co-accused were then separately charged under s 377A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) with the commission of an act of gross indecency with another male person.<br/>
<br/>
(2) On 24 September 2010, Tan brought an application (“the Application”) under O 15 r 16 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) to ask the court to declare s 377A of the Penal Code (“s 377A”) unconstitutional under the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) ( “the Constitution”). Tan alleged that s 377A was inconsistent with Arts 9, 12 and 14 of the Constitution (“Art 9”, “Art 12” and “Art 14” respectively) and was therefore void by virtue of Art 4 of the Constitution (“Art 4”). <br/>
<br/>
(3) On 15 October 2010, the Prosecution informed Tan that the s 377A charge against him had been substituted with one under s 294(a) of the Penal Code (“s 294(a)”) for the commission of an obscene act in a public place. The charge against the co-accused was similarly substituted. <br/>
<br/>
(4) Tan subsequently pleaded guilty to the substituted charge under s 294(a) on 15 December 2010, and was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $3,000. The co-accused had earlier pleaded guilty, and had similarly been convicted and sentenced to a fine of $3,000. <br/>
<br/>
(5) Soon after the substitution of the s 377A charge against Tan with the s 294(a) charge, the Attorney-General (“the AG”) applied to strike out the Application pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court. An assistant registrar (“the AR”) struck out the Application on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action, was frivolous or vexatious and/or was an abuse of the process of the court.<br/>
<br/>
(6) On appeal by Tan against the AR’s decision, the High Court judge (“the Judge”) held that an had locus standi, and that his claim was not certain to fail and in fact raised many novel constitutional issues that deserved more detailed treatment. However, the Judge concluded that there was no real controversy to be adjudicated as there was nothing at stake for Tan, given that he had already pleaded guilty to and been convicted of the s 294(a) charge. The AR’s striking-out order was therefore upheld. The present appeal is Tan’s appeal against the Judge’s decision. </p>
