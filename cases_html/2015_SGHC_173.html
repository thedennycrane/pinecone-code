<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Between 2003 and 2005, the
                                        plaintiffs entrusted US$111m<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> to the first and
                                        second defendants to be invested on the plaintiffs’
                                        behalf in 15 private equity (“PE”)
                                                funds<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and five direct
                                                investments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> These investments
                                        were held through a web of special purpose vehicles
                                        (“SPVs”) controlled by the first and second
                                        defendants but established and maintained by them using the
                                        plaintiffs’ funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In this action the plaintiffs seek
                                        the following principal relief against the
                                                defendants:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     The transfer to the
                                                plaintiffs of ownership and control of all of the

                                                be due upon the taking of the account and for
                                                judgment to be entered for the said sums together
                                                with interest (“the payment

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendants accept that the 15 PE
                                        funds, the five direct investments and the majority of the
                                        SPVs through which the plaintiffs’ entire portfolio is
                                        held belong to the plaintiffs. Yet, they oppose entirely all
                                        of the relief which the plaintiffs seek. In addition, the
                                        defendants advance a counterclaim against the plaintiffs for
                                        US$18m said to be management fees and related expenses due
                                        to the defendants in connection with having managed the
                                        plaintiffs’ investments for these several
                                        years.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I have given judgment for the
                                        plaintiffs in the following terms:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>

                                                  premature.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> This does not
                                                preclude the plaintiffs from pursuing tracing or
                                                other appropriate relief once the account has been
                                                  taken.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     I have dismissed<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>
                                                the entirety of the defendants’ counterclaim
                                                save that I have ordered the plaintiffs to pay to
                                                the defendants, as expressly agreed, management fees
                                                of US$450,000 per annum from the year
                                                2009–2010 until the date on which the
                                                defendants transfer to the plaintiffs the PE funds
                                                which form the subject-matter of the
                                                  agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiffs and the defendants
                                        have both appealed against parts of my decision. I now give
                                        my grounds of decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The plaintiffs are all ultra high
                                        net worth individuals. The first plaintiff is the mother of
                                        the second and third plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The first and second defendants are

                                        The third defendant is a Singapore company which the second
                                        defendant incorporated in September 2005<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> to provide

                                        defendant but has rendered services to it since October 2005
                                        pursuant to a consultancy agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The plaintiffs did not name the
                                        third defendant as a defendant when they commenced this
                                        action. It became a defendant on its own application some
                                        months later.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> All three
                                        defendants adopt a common position in this litigation and
                                        are jointly represented.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Although the first plaintiff is a
                                        joint owner of the money which the plaintiffs entrusted to
                                        the first and second defendants, she plays only a residual
                                        role in the underlying facts. So too, it is my finding that
                                        the third defendant operated as the first and second
                                        defendants’ vehicle and did not have any legally
                                        significant role in the underlying facts separate from that
                                        of the first and second defendants. For ease of exposition,
                                        therefore, I shall use the collective term “the
                                        parties” to refer only to the second and third
                                        plaintiffs on the one hand and first and second defendants
                                        on the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The relationship between the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The second defendant’s
                                        relationship with the plaintiffs is a long-standing
                                                one.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> She was the

                                        a trusted family friend.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> After the first
                                        plaintiff’s husband passed away in 1992, the second
                                        defendant’s professional relationship with the
                                        plaintiffs came to an end, but she continued to keep in
                                        touch with them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The first defendant’s
                                        relationship with the plaintiffs began for present purposes
                                        in 2003 through the second defendant’s
                                                introduction.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> At
                                        that time, the first defendant worked for the Government of
                                        Singapore Investment Corporation (“GIC”) as a
                                        senior vice-president of GIC Special Investments Pte Ltd, a
                                        position he had held since 2000.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> GIC Special

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Although the second and third
                                        plaintiffs are, and were in 2003, sophisticated investors,
                                        they were then unfamiliar with PE funds as an asset class.
                                        The first defendant introduced them to world of PE funds. He
                                        told them of the “obscene” profits which this
                                        asset class offered investors.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> They wanted to know
                                        more. The first defendant obliged. Over the course of 2003
                                        and 2004, he schooled them on PE funds. He taught them how
                                        PE funds are structured and how fund managers and investors
                                        make their profits. He told them of his expertise in
                                        investing in PE funds and of the close personal
                                        relationships he had forged during his 14-year career with
                                        GIC with the key principals at the world’s leading PE
                                        fund managers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> He offered to introduce
                                        the plaintiffs to these fund managers so they could invest
                                        directly in PE funds rather than through intermediaries,
                                        thereby eliminating an unnecessary layer of fees. The second
                                        and third plaintiffs were impressed by the first
                                        defendant’s knowledge and fascinated and intrigued
                                        with the prospect of investing in PE funds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_30" id="Ftn_30_1"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> They saw him as their

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The WWW concept</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     By early 2004, the first defendant
                                        had hit upon what he called “the WWW
                                                concept.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_32" id="Ftn_32_1"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> The WWW
                                        concept was, in essence, a way for the plaintiffs and the
                                        first defendant to combine the first defendant’s
                                        considerable industry knowledge and personal relationships
                                        with the plaintiffs’ considerable capital and healthy
                                        appetite for risk to enable all of them to profit from PE
                                        investments <em>both</em> as a fund
                                        manager <em>and</em> as an
                                        investor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The ultimate goal of the WWW
                                        concept was for the second and third plaintiffs and the
                                        first defendant to find fledgling fund managers, provide
                                        them seed capital to start a new fund and assist them in
                                        finding investors for the fund. The WWW concept would also
                                        finance the customary investment which each fund manager
                                        would make in its new fund to align the fund manager’s
                                        incentives with the investors’ and to signal the fund
                                        managers’ personal commitment to the fund’s
                                        success.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The WWW concept would thereby
                                        entitle the second and third plaintiffs and the first
                                        defendant, through their stake in the fund manager, to a
                                        share of the fund manager’s total profit arising from
                                        all of the various one-off and recurring fees it would earn
                                        over the life of the fund and also to a share of the fund
                                        manager’s profit as an investor in its own
                                        fund.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiffs’ first PE investments </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The WWW concept was a long-term
                                        vision that the parties had a common intention to work
                                        towards. Because it was a long-term vision, rather than an
                                        immediate executable plan, and because of the close personal
                                        relationship of trust and confidence that subsisted between
                                        the parties at that time, the parties did not have a binding
                                        agreement in the contractual sense – whether oral,
                                        written or arising from conduct – governing their
                                        rights and obligations in connection with the steps they
                                        would take towards the WWW concept and what would happen if
                                        it failed. That fact does not, however, detract from the
                                        importance of the WWW concept as the factual framework
                                        within which the parties took the steps that they
                                        did.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The first step which the parties
                                        took to get the WWW concept off the ground was to build a
                                        track record for themselves in PE investments. Without a
                                        track record, they would have no credibility with the
                                        fledgling fund managers they hoped to invest in, or with the
                                        investors whom they hoped to attract and introduce to the
                                        fledgling fund managers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     To establish that track record,
                                        the second and third plaintiffs and the first defendant
                                        began to work towards setting up their own PE fund. The
                                        plaintiffs were to provide all the necessary capital for the
                                        fund. The first defendant was to provide the industry
                                        expertise and relationships and to oversee and manage the
                                        fund’s investments. This initial fund was to be a fund
                                        of funds. In other words, the asset class chosen for this
                                        initial fund to invest in was other PE funds. Once the fund
                                        had a history of good performance, it was to become the
                                        first fund under the WWW concept and the plaintiffs would
                                        sell down part of their investment to external
                                        investors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Some time in late 2004 or 2005,
                                        the first defendant brought to the plaintiffs investment
                                        opportunities in PE funds managed by some of the
                                        world’s leading PE fund managers.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_33" id="Ftn_33_1"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Using the
                                        plaintiffs’ SPV Sky Genius Investments Ltd
                                        (“Sky Genius”), the plaintiffs made an initial
                                        investment of US$30m in five PE funds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_34" id="Ftn_34_1"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> I shall call this amount
                                        the “Initial PE Investment” and these first
                                        five funds “the Initial PE Funds”. The Initial
                                        PE Funds were meant to be the plaintiffs’ personal
                                        fund of funds, outside the WWW concept.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is common ground that the
                                        plaintiffs agreed to pay the first defendant a management
                                        fee of 1.5% of the Initial PE Investment, or US$450,000, per
                                        annum, for managing the Initial PE Funds. However, the
                                        plaintiffs never agreed to pay the first defendant any fee
                                        for introducing these five PE funds to the
                                                plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Indeed, the first and
                                        second defendants never even discussed an introduction fee
                                        with the plaintiffs.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Over the ensuing months, the first
                                        defendant brought ten more PE funds to the second and third
                                        plaintiffs. This led to the plaintiffs’ investing an
                                        additional US$100m in 10 additional funds.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> I will call this
                                        additional amount of US$100m the “Additional PE
                                        Investment” and these next ten funds “the
                                        Additional PE Funds”. These ten funds were held, not
                                        through Sky Genius, but through a limited partnership
                                        managed by a general partner. This structure is the typical
                                        PE fund structure save that the plaintiffs were, for the
                                        time being, the only investor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     It is common ground that the
                                        second and third plaintiffs’ agreement to pay the
                                        first defendant a management fee of 1.5% per annum for
                                        managing the Initial PE Funds did not extend to the
                                        Additional PE Funds. In any event, as in the case of the
                                        Initial PE Funds, there was never any discussion, let alone
                                        agreement, for the plaintiffs to pay the first defendant any
                                        introduction fee for the Additional PE Funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In addition to the 15 PE funds
                                        (comprising the Initial PE Funds and the Additional PE
                                        Funds), the first defendant introduced five further ventures
                                        to the plaintiffs which they agreed to invest in. The
                                        plaintiffs made each of these five investments directly, by
                                        acquiring an equity stake in the venture itself, through an

                                        was designed to mimic how a PE fund would hold these

                                        part of the plaintiffs’ interest in these investments

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The personal relationship deteriorates</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For various reasons, partly to do
                                        with the global financial crisis in 2008/2009, the parties
                                        came to a dead end with the WWW concept. The long-term
                                        vision proved unachievable. The parties’ personal and
                                        professional relationships became increasingly
                                        strained.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     By November 2011, the plaintiffs
                                        had decided to wind down and divest all of their holdings in
                                        all of the investments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> In December 2011, the
                                        plaintiffs demanded that the first and second defendants
                                        transfer to the plaintiffs all rights, title and interest in
                                        their investments, including control of all the SPVs that
                                        held the plaintiffs’ investments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     By the beginning of 2012, the
                                        parties’ relationship was irretrievably fractured. On
                                        15 February 2012, the plaintiffs demanded a full accounting
                                        and reconciliation of their investment in the Initial PE
                                        funds, the Additional PE Funds and the five direct
                                                investments.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> No account had been
                                        provided by April 2012. The plaintiffs felt that they had no
                                        choice but to commence this action. They did so on 19 April
                                        2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiffs’ claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff’s claim raises
                                        six issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, who is liable
                                                for the relief which the plaintiffs seek? The
                                                plaintiffs contend that it is the first and second
                                                defendants who are personally liable. The defendants
                                                contend that it is only CSP who is
                                        liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, are the defendants in a
                                                relationship with the plaintiffs sufficient to
                                                warrant the equitable remedy of an
                                        account?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     Third, are the plaintiffs entitled to
                                                an account of their investments? Or have the
                                                defendants complied with any such obligation by
                                                rendering the 12 May 2012 file read in light of the
                                                expert evidence exchanged in this
                                        action?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_d"></a>(d)     Fourth, if the plaintiffs are
                                                entitled to the remedy of an account of their
                                                investments, should the court take that account on
                                                the standard basis or on the wilful default
                                                basis?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_e"></a>(e)     Fifth, are the defendants obliged to
                                                transfer the plaintiffs’ investments, and the
                                                SPVs holding those investments, to the
                                                plaintiffs?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_f"></a>(f)     Finally, are the plaintiffs entitled
                                                to the tracing order which they
                                seek?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As neither the plaintiffs nor the
                                        defendants have appealed against any part of my decision on
                                        the plaintiffs’ claim, it suffices for me to provide
                                        only an outline of my decision on these six
                                issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">First issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     On the first issue, I have found
                                        that, if anyone is liable for the plaintiffs’ claims,
                                        it is the first and second defendants who are personally
                                        liable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The legal relationship which is
                                        relevant to the relief which the plaintiffs seek is a
                                        relationship which was forged in 2003 and 2004 directly
                                        between the three plaintiffs on the one hand and the first
                                        and second defendants on the other. That relationship was
                                        already settled and in place before CSP was incorporated in
                                        September 2005. CSP thereafter functioned merely as the
                                        vehicle through which the first defendant and the second
                                        defendant acted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Second issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     On the second issue, I have found
                                        that the first and second defendants owe fiduciary duties to
                                        the plaintiffs, either as trustees for the plaintiffs under
                                        a presumed resulting trust; or, at the very least, as the
                                        plaintiffs’ agents in making and holding the
                                        investments in question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is common ground that the
                                        plaintiffs had no intention to make a gift to the first and
                                        second defendants of the money which the plaintiffs
                                        transferred to them or of the investments which the first
                                        and second defendants purchased with that money. The
                                        inevitable consequence of the admitted lack of donative
                                        intent is that the plaintiffs’ money and investments
                                        – or the shares in the SPVs which held and therefore
                                        represented them – were held on a presumed resulting
                                        trust for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The defendants argue that, even
                                        so, they were nothing more than a bare trustee<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> and
                                        therefore owed the plaintiffs no fiduciary duties arising
                                        from their trusteeship.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> I reject this
                                        submission for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The first and second defendants
                                        were not passive trustees, merely holding what was
                                        transferred to them. They invested the plaintiffs’
                                        monies on their behalf and managed and administered those
                                        investments. Those acts were carried out in their capacity
                                        as fiduciaries and carry fiduciary
                                consequences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     Given my finding that the first
                                        and second defendants hold the monies and other property
                                        entrusted to them as resulting trustees for the plaintiff,
                                        it is not necessary for me to analyse further whether they
                                        were also agents for the plaintiffs. If it had been
                                        necessary for me to decide those points, I would have had no
                                        hesitation in holding that they were.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Third issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On the third issue, I find that
                                        the first and second defendants have a personal liability to
                                        keep and render to the plaintiffs a proper and complete
                                        account of all the assets received by them and for all the
                                        investments made by them on the plaintiffs’ behalf. I
                                        also hold that the 12 May 2012 file is insufficient to
                                        comply with this duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The liability to account is a
                                        necessary consequence of the first and second
                                        defendants’ fiduciary relationship with the
                                        plaintiffs, whether as trustee under a presumed resulting
                                        trust or as the plaintiffs’ agent. The first and
                                        second defendants are under a personal liability to account
                                        even if they are correctly characterised as bare trustees. A
                                        trustee’s duty to account is so fundamental to a trust
                                        that it has been described as being part of the
                                        “irreducible core of a trust”. In other words,
                                        it is one of the essential duties incumbent on all trustees
                                        which cannot be excluded and whose absence or exclusion
                                        would be inimical to the very existence of a trust:

                                        I find that the first and second defendants have been in

                                        account will identify what has become of the
                                        plaintiffs’ money. To the extent that that discloses
                                        that the plaintiffs’ money is now represented by

                                        the transfer order, the plaintiffs are at liberty to seek
                                        separately to trace into those assets.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It is clear beyond doubt that the

                                        of the SPVs to the plaintiffs or as the plaintiffs direct.
                                        The first and second defendants concede that that the person
                                        who paid the expenses of each SPV is the owner of that
                                                SPV.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> It is not
                                        disputed that the incorporation, set-up and annual

                                        plaintiffs’ funds. I reject the first

                                        to transfer the seven disputed SPVs to the plaintiffs arises
                                        from nothing more than a desire to hold these SPVs hostage

                                                  It’s, I think, in tab 209 in my AEIC.

                                                  we ever received from Sylvia, okay, and it was
                                                  dated as of 25 April 2012. So if you look at the
                                                  first line, Japan Fund, you move down the third

                                                  in brackets, 2005. So again, I see that there is a
                                                  – there’s a discrepancy between this

                                        substantially similar to the first section of the June 2007

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">What is the difference between

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Again, the house fund is
                                                  supposed to belong to the Wee family, whereas the
                                                  third party fund is supposed to form the private

                                                  differentiating factor. So here it’s clear
                                                  that there’s this understanding from [the

                                                  the third party funds, and then to attract LPs to
                                                  come to sign to the WWW FOF, so that the GPs at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">MR JEYARETNAM: That, then, is a little puzzling

                                        accept the first defendant’s oral evidence that he was
                                        mistaken when he said contemporaneously in his email that

                                                2005–2006.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_141" id="Ftn_141_1"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span> It also appears to
                                        me to be reasonable that these management fees (save for the
                                        first payment) were paid in advance rather than in arrears.
                                        That would explain why the first two annual payments both
                                        came in the calendar year 2006. They were a payment in
                                        arrears for 2005–2006 and a payment in advance for

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     If the defendants have a
                                        contractual right to be paid $450,000 per annum, that right
                                        continues to subsist until that right expires, is determined
                                        in accordance with the terms of the parties’ agreement
                                        or until the parties’ agreement as a whole is brought
                                        to an end. There is no evidence before me of any such event
                                        having taken place. The right being contractual, it is
                                        unaffected by the defendants’ failure to ask for
                                        further management fees after the last payment on 7 August
                                        2008 covering the period up to August 2009. In the absence
                                        of any unequivocal representation by the defendants of an
                                        intention to disclaim those fees or any detrimental reliance
                                        by the plaintiffs on any such a representation, neither of
                                        which is suggested, the defendants are not precluded by any
                                        estoppel from claiming those fees now, by way of
                                        counterclaim in this action, merely because they failed to
                                        ask for those fees earlier. In any event, any such estoppel
                                        would not extinguish the defendants’ right to the fees
                                        in question but would merely entitle the plaintiffs to
                                        reasonable notice before the defendants insisted on
                                        enforcing their strict legal rights.</p>

                                        the defendants, that does not suffice to give rise to a
                                        legal entitlement to payment. The plaintiffs cannot be
                                        compelled to pay for these services unless they agreed
                                        expressly or impliedly to do so or unless, despite the
                                        absence of an agreement, they are obliged by the law of
                                        restitution to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">No entitlement to additional management fees on an
                                implied agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The defendants’ case is that
                                        although there was no express agreement for these additional
                                        fees, the defendants are entitled to management fees of 1.5%
                                        of the commitment amount for the additional PE funds under
                                        an implied agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_144" id="Ftn_144_1"><sup>[note: 144]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I find that there is no basis for
                                        any such implied agreement. Insofar as it arises from the
                                        admitted agreement to pay fees of 1.5% per annum in respect
                                        of the Initial PE Investment, the implied agreement
                                        advocated by the defendants contradicts the terms of that
                                        express agreement and is unsustainable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     I find it impossible also to spell
                                        out a separate agreement to that effect, arising from the
                                        parties’ conduct. Indeed, the parties’ conduct
                                        contradicts any such implied agreement. The defendants asked
                                        for management fees to be paid on four occasions (10
                                        February 2006, 22 August 2006, 24 August 2007 and 7 August
                                        2008). On each occasion, those fees were calculated as 1.5%
                                        of US$30m. That is so even though the requests in August
                                        2007 and August 2008 came after the commitment amount had
                                        been increased from US$30m to US$129m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The suggestion that the
                                        parties’ express agreement was open-ended, permitting
                                        the defendants to claim fees beyond 1.5% per annum of the
                                        initial US$30m, or that they entered into a separate
                                        agreement by conduct are both disingenuous afterthoughts. I

                                        alternative claim for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     First, the evidence supports a
                                        finding that in regard to the Additional PE Funds, the
                                        defendants performed their services speculatively, in
                                        anticipation of being compensated out of the profit in their
                                        overall venture, <em>ie</em> the WWW
                                        concept. As such, the defendants were taking the risk that
                                        that prospect of future compensation would not materialise.
                                        Having knowingly and voluntarily taken that risk, they
                                        cannot now claim a restitutionary remedy as compensation for
                                        the consequences of that risk.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Second, there is no room now for
                                        the defendants to be remunerated for these additional
                                        services on an entirely different basis from that
                                        contractually agreed. The plaintiffs and the defendants
                                        agreed contractually that the defendants would earn a
                                        management fee fixed at 1.5% of the Initial PE Investment of
                                                US$30m.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_146" id="Ftn_146_1"><sup>[note: 146]</sup></a></span> Any extension or
                                        modification to that contractual agreement to permit the
                                        defendants’ current claim would itself have to be
                                        contractual.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Third, the defendants had every
                                        opportunity to make clear any expectation regarding
                                        remuneration contemporaneously with the services
                                                rendered.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_147" id="Ftn_147_1"><sup>[note: 147]</sup></a></span> It was completely open
                                        to them to clarify matters in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008; and
                                        indeed all the way up to 2012.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_148" id="Ftn_148_1"><sup>[note: 148]</sup></a></span> They failed to do
                                                this.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_149" id="Ftn_149_1"><sup>[note: 149]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Fourth, the defendants have not
                                        adduced any independent expert evidence of the market
                                        practice on which they rely to justify the entitlement to
                                        fees or the quantum of fees.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_150" id="Ftn_150_1"><sup>[note: 150]</sup></a></span> The
                                        defendants’ evidence on this question was given by the
                                        first and second defendants’ daughter, Elizabeth Eng,
                                        as opinion evidence. Her evidence is neither expert evidence
                                        nor independent evidence. It is not expert evidence because
                                        the sum total of her expertise in the world of private
                                        equity comes in the form of a 1 month
                                                internship.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_151" id="Ftn_151_1"><sup>[note: 151]</sup></a></span> Her evidence is also
                                        not independent evidence because of her family relationship
                                        to the first and second defendants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_152" id="Ftn_152_1"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The plaintiffs’ expert
                                        evidence on this issue came from Mr Richard Harris, who was
                                        both an expert and independent. The defendants did not
                                        challenge his expertise or independence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_153" id="Ftn_153_1"><sup>[note: 153]</sup></a></span> He disagreed with
                                        Elizabeth Eng on her basis of charging. I accept his
                                        evidence as having by far the greater weight.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_154" id="Ftn_154_1"><sup>[note: 154]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     At trial, the defendants sought to

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, the
                                                defendants have not pleaded that they were entitled
                                                to or claiming an introducer’s
                                                  fee.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_156" id="Ftn_156_1"><sup>[note: 156]</sup></a></span> They are therefore
                                                precluded from advancing that as the basis for the
                                                  fee;<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_157" id="Ftn_157_1"><sup>[note: 157]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     Second, Richard
                                                Harris’s evidence in his affidavit<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_158" id="Ftn_158_1"><sup>[note: 158]</sup></a></span> and at trial is that
                                                it is typically not an investor who pays an
                                                introducer a fee for finding a fund for the
                                                investor. Instead, it is the principal of the fund
                                                who pays the introducer a fee for finding the
                                                investor. And even then, an introduction fee is
                                                usually a one-off fee rather than a recurring,
                                                annual fee:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_159" id="Ftn_159_1"><sup>[note: 159]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">Then I go down to the term
                                                  "Introducer". Just to get your understanding of
                                                  it, essentially this is someone or an entity that
                                                  introduces a client to an investment opportunity
                                                  and would typically charge an introduction fee,

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">Correct.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">Again, you put that at
                                                  typically -- I get this from paragraph 53 -- 0.5
                                                  to 1 per cent and/or a trail fee of 0.2 to 0.5 per
                                                  cent per annum for a period of years, so it could
                                                  be a one-off fee or it could be a one-off fee with
                                                  a trail fee, correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">That's correct.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">I suppose it would be possible,
                                                  if there was someone who was regularly introducing
                                                  investments to you, it might be possible to also
                                                  charge this as an annual fee?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">No, I don't think so. I think
                                                  that it would be regarded as a commission for an
                                                  introducer. The other big difference that one
                                                  should be aware of is an introducer often works
                                                  for the fund management company, introducing the
                                                  fund to the client. So the introducer might
                                                  actually be paid not necessarily by the client but
                                                  by the fund management company.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">Q.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">That is so, but without going
                                                  into who pays, I was coming back to my question
                                                  that it might be incorporated an annual fee, and
                                                  you didn't agree with me. I just wondered whether
                                                  I could cross over to page 30 of your report, and
                                                  just to give you the context -- I will come back
                                                  to this, it is just that I am trying to follow up
                                                  on this particular point -- at page 29 you were
                                                  giving your comments on 1.3.2, "Fund of Funds
                                                  fees", and I wanted to show the context. If you
                                                  come back to page 30 at paragraph (f), you say:
                                                  "In this sense the word 'introducing' would also
                                                  imply advising on or recommending a fund, which
                                                  would happen if, as here, the client does not have
                                                  another regulated intermediary between himself and
                                                  the fund. In a MFO, it would not be unusual for an
                                                  annual fee to incorporate all of this
                                                  transactional work; as mentioned at paragraph 90
                                                  above could be part of the MFO
                                                duties.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">It really depends how the client wishes to agree fee
                                                levels as discussed in advance." I was asking you
                                                generally, not specifically in relation to this,
                                                that if you had someone who was, say, acting in an
                                                advisory role and regularly bringing you investment
                                                opportunities -- and I think you mentioned in that
                                                statement at page 30 that in a sense when you
                                                introduce it, you are also advising or recommending
                                                it. It might be possible or it might be the case
                                                that you pay that person an annual fee, rather than
                                                each time an introduction fee based on a percentage
                                                of the commission. That is all I was asking.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">The answer is no. I think if
                                                  you are introducing, you are introducing and you
                                                  are paid a fee. The fee typically would be smaller
                                                  than an adviser because an introducer typically
                                                  doesn't have to be regulated. In a sense, an
                                                  introducer sits in that space where they might be
                                                  assisting a regulated entity to advise a client.
                                                  That might be the fund management
                                                company.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The plaintiffs were not unjustly
                                        enriched at the expense of the defendants – the
                                        defendants knew and voluntarily accepted the risk inherent
                                        in the WWW concept. The nature and extent of the risk
                                        voluntarily assumed by a claimant in a claim for <em>quantum meruit</em> is a material
                                        consideration in determining whether an enrichment is
                                        unjust. In <em>Stephen Donald Architects Ltd
                                                v Christopher King</em> [2003] EWHC 1867, the
                                        parties were friends. The defendant did not have the means
                                        to pay fees for redevelopment of the property until
                                        completion of the project. Mr Richard Seymour QC, sitting as
                                        a Judge of the High Court, held that the parties had no
                                        contract under which the architect could recover his fees.
                                        He then examined the alternative claim on a <em>quantum meruit</em>. He observed that
                                        a claim for <em>quantum meruit</em> was
                                        conceptually a claim in restitution. He considered that the
                                        nature and the extent of the risk assumed by the party
                                        claiming payment on a <em>quantum
                                                meruit</em> in relation to the abortive
                                        transaction was a material consideration in determining
                                        whether an enrichment has been unjust. There was nothing
                                        unjust about being visited with the consequences of a risk
                                        which one has consciously run. That is the position that the
                                        defendants now find themselves in.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    The plaintiffs also resist the

                                        by suggesting that the plaintiffs have not been enriched by
                                        the services rendered by the defendants because those
                                        services were worth nothing to the plaintiffs or were not
                                        worth to the plaintiffs the market value of those services.
                                        In the language of the law of restitution, this is the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The critical distinction is between money and benefits
                                                in kind. Where the defendant received money, it will
                                                be impossible on all ordinary facts for him to argue
                                                that he was not enriched. For money is the very
                                                measure of enrichment. By contrast benefits in kind
                                                are less unequivocally enriching because they are
                                                susceptible to an argument which for convenience can
                                                be called ‘subjective devaluation’. It
                                                is an argument based on the presmiss [<em>sic</em>] that benefits in kind
                                                have a value to a particular individual only so far
                                                as he chooses to give them value. What matters is
                                                his choice. The fact that there is a market in the
                                                good which is in question, or in other words that
                                                other people habitually choose to have it and thus
                                                create a demand for it, is irrelevant to the case of
                                                any one particular individual. He claims the right
                                                to dissent from that demand. Market value is not his
                                                value. Suppose that without his knowledge his car
                                                has been serviced or his roof mended. There is a
                                                market in car servicing and roof mending. It is easy
                                                to find the market value of work of that kind, what
                                                the going rate is between reasonable people. But he
                                                says that he had decided to go in for do-it-yourself
                                                or to take the risk of disaster by doing nothing.
                                                Indeed to make his point he does not even have to
                                                say that he had actually decided, let alone prove
                                                that he had decided, to dissociate himself from the
                                                particular demand. For his point is sufficiently
                                                made by saying that he has a continuing liberty to
                                                choose how to apply his particular store of value
                                                and that in the case of this car-servicing or
                                                roof-mending he simply had not made his
                                                choice.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold and in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    It appears to me that the
                                        plaintiffs’ argument of subjective devaluation is a
                                        self-serving afterthought. It is true that Project Plaza was
                                        an abysmal commercial failure. But the failure of Project
                                        Plaza was due in large part if not exclusively to: (a) the
                                        plaintiffs’ conscious decision to entrust part of the
                                        task of overseeing this construction project to the
                                        defendants, persons who had no experience in overseeing
                                        construction projects at all and who never held themselves
                                        out as having such experience; and (b) the first
                                        plaintiff’s flighty and wholly impractical design
                                        choices and his inability or unwillingness to accept that
                                        they could be translated into reality only with difficulty,
                                        delay and expense.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_171" id="Ftn_171_1"><sup>[note: 171]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    If the defendants had not been
                                        risk-runners in extending services and incurring expenses in
                                        connection with Project Plaza, therefore, I would have held
                                        that it was open to them, in principle, to recover
                                        compensation for those services and expenses on a <em>quantum meruit</em>. But, for the
                                        reasons I have set out above, the defendants were risk
                                        runners. The risk that the defendants ran was the risk of
                                        the WWW concept failing to come to fruition and yielding the
                                        anticipated riches. Project Plaza being part of the WWW
                                        concept, the risk of Project Plaza failing for the reasons I
                                        have set out above at [106] fell within the risk which the
                                        defendants ran in extending their services and incurring
                                        expenses speculatively, without a prior overarching

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    With that, I have dealt with all
                                        aspects of the claim and counterclaim. I must say in
                                        conclusion that I was unimpressed by many aspects of the
                                        evidence and the conduct of both the second and third
                                        plaintiffs on the one hand and of the first and second
                                        defendants on the other. Each of those four individuals
                                        showed themselves, in the historical events in question,
                                        quite capable of misleading others for their personal
                                        benefit. All four of them also showed themselves, in their
                                        evidence before me, of being quite capable of attempting to
                                        mislead me in order to succeed in this litigation. The
                                        principal difference between the two groups – and the
                                        factor which explains the outcome of this action – is
                                        that the first and second plaintiffs’ attempts to
                                        mislead were in relation to matters not connected to the
                                        issues which I had to resolve in this action.</p>

                                        order these costs on the indemnity basis. Although the
                                        defendants’ position on the plaintiffs’ claim
                                        has been to resist on slight grounds what might otherwise
                                        appear to be the obvious outcome, and to do so as leverage
                                        for their counterclaim, I do not consider that it has
                                        crossed the threshold to justify an order for indemnity
