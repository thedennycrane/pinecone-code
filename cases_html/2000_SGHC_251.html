</blockquote>
<p><u><i><b> </b></i></u></p>
<p align="justify">Prosecution Case</p>
<p align="justify">2. The facts adduced in evidence by the prosecution which were not

disputed were that on or about 11 April 2000 the Accused was residing alone in Blk 6 Jalan

Minyak #12-362 (flat #12-362). At about 5.45 p.m. a surveillance party from Central

Narcotic Bureau (CNB) kept watch over the flat and its vicinity. At 5.40 p.m. the Accused

and one Abdul Rahman Bin Mohd Noor (‘Abdul Rahman’) were seen by CNB officers

emerging from the lift landing of Blk 6. The Accused was seen carrying a brown paper bag

by Senior Staff Sergeant Henry Tan Yian Chye (‘SSSgt Henry Tan’). He identified

the brown bag with the wording ‘CAPTIONS’ across it as <b>Exh. P63</b>. The

Accused and Abdul Rahman met up with one Zamri Bin Mohd Ali (‘Zamri’) who was at

the void deck. Moments later Zamri and the Accused boarded the motor-lorry YD 8173P parked

in front of Blk 6. The driver of the lorry was Rumli Bin Sarib. Zamri sat in the front

cabin of the lorry next to the driver and the Accused sat on his right next to the left

door of the lorry. There were already two other passenger seated in the rear carriage of

the lorry namely, Ng Sick Yong (‘Ng’) and Jaseni Bin Latip (‘Jaseni’).

The lorry then drove off travelling down York Hill and turning into Chin Swee Road

followed by CNB officers. Shortly after that one Abdul Rahman Bin Mohamad Noor who had

been left behind inadvertently was seen boarding the lorry along Chin Swee Road.</p>
<p align="justify">3. At about 6.05 p.m. the lorry was intercepted by CNB officers along

Kallang Bahru near a JTC flatted factory. Insp Herman Bin Mohamed Hamli (‘Insp

Herman’) from the Special Task Force of the CNB and other CNB officers arrested all

the six persons travelling in the lorry including the driver. SSSgt Henry Tan on

inspecting the front cabin of the lorry saw the brown paper bag which he had earlier seen

being carried by the Accused. It was resting in the floor board in front of the seat which

had been occupied by the Accused. At 6.40 p.m. the lorry was driven to the JTC flatted

factory car park. SSSgt Ang Onn Tho (‘Jimmy Ang’) on the instructions of Insp

Herman opened the brown paper bag. In it were found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) 4 white envelopes believed to contain heroin</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) a red plastic bag containing one sachet of heroin</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) a wrapped newspaper containing 4 white envelopes believed to

  similar heroin</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">4. Subsequently the Investigating officer Soh Thiam Loon examined the

said exhibits and found that each of the 4 envelopes lying in the brown bag had 10

sachets. There were another 10 sachets of the same kind of substance in each of the 4

envelopes found in the newspaper making a total of 81 sachets.</p>
<p align="justify">4.1 A bunch of 3 keys including the key to the Accused’s flat were

seized among other belongings of the Accused such as, handphone and cash of $1702 at the

scene. Cash of $2758.60 belonging to the Accused was also recovered from the

Accused’s sisters house making the total cash recovered S$4460.60 at (<b>Exh. P89</b>).</p>
<p align="justify">5. At 7.55 p.m., Insp Herman and a team of CNB officers arrived at flat

#12-362 belonging to the Accused. The front door of the Accused’s flat was padlocked

and also key locked. The door was opened with the keys (<b>Exh. P88</b>) seized from the

Accused by Insp Herman. In the bedroom of the flat the Accused indicated to Insp Herman to

the area between the dressing table and the wardrobe. Insp Herman recovered a white

plastic bag with the word ‘Maxim Cakes’ (<b>Exh. P85</b>) from the said area.

The said plastic bag was found to contain</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(i) 2 transparent plastic packets of substance believed to be heroin;</p>
<p align="justify">(ii) 2 envelopes one containing 10 sachets and the other containing 2

  sachets of substance also believed to be heroin;</p>
<p align="justify">(iii) a ‘TANITA’ digital weighing scale;</p>
<p align="justify">(iv) two candles;</p>
<p align="justify">(v) two metal spoons;</p>
<p align="justify">(vi) two used envelopes;</p>
<p align="justify">(vii) a stack of 9 envelopes and</p>
<p align="justify">(viii) envelopes and a stack of 346 empty satchets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">5.1 In a carton in the cupboard near to the bed a white plastic bag

(exhibit P85) was recovered with five stacks of empty sachets totalling 2320 such sachets.

The Investigating officer testifying said that the empty sachets were used for trafficking

the drugs by repacking small quantity of heroin in them of about 8 grams from the big

packets and the candles were used for heat sealing the sachets after repacking. The spoons

were used to scoop up heroin from the big packets and put into the sachets. The digital

weighing scale was to measure the amount of heroin put in each sachet.</p>
<p align="justify">6. Dr Lee Tong Kooi (Dr Lee) a Scientific Officer attached to the

Department of Scientific Services (DSS) examined and qualitatively and quantitatively

analyzed the 81 sachets of granular/powdery substance found in the brown bag on the floor

board of the lorry opposite the seat where the Accused was sitting (the subject matter of

the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge). He determined the substance to contain heroin and the total

weight of the heroin was not less than 24.4 grams as per his Certificates (<b>Exhs. P40 to

P48</b>) issued under S16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 (‘MDA’).</p>
<p align="justify">6.1 Dr Lee similarly analyzed the granular/powdery substance in the two

transparent plastic packets with gross weight of 425.0 grams and 425.1 grams each and the

12 sachets with a gross weight of 88.23 grams all of which were found in the white plastic

bag with the wording ‘Maxim Cakes’ in the Accused bedroom (the subject matter of

the 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge). He determined the substance to contain heroin and the total

weight of the heroin was not less than 77.40 grams (<b>Exhs. P49 to P52</b>).</p>
<p align="justify">6.2 Dr Lee also found the two spoons to be stained with heroin.</p>
<p align="justify">6.3 The Accused’s urine was tested and found negative for

morphine, a by-product of diamorphine.</p>
<p align="justify">7. The Accused gave a number of statements on various dates to the

police. He did not challenge the admissibility of the statements. He conceded through his

counsel that they were voluntarily made. Nevertheless, I satisfied myself of their

voluntariness by requesting the prosecution to adduce <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the

same. The Accused’s Counsel did not question any witness nor did the Accused proffer

to give evidence. I therefore admitted that the statement in evidence as I was satisfied

for they were voluntarily made.</p>
<p align="justify">7.1 The statements admitted with a brief description of their content

were:</p>
<blockquote>
<b><p align="justify">P56</p></b> - Contemporaneous Statement recorded by Insp Herman on 11

  April 2000 at 6.30 pm at JTC flatted factory carpark in Kallang Bahru.

  <p align="justify">The Accused admitted to Insp Herman after being questioned and that at

  the scene of his arrest the brown bag was his; that in the bag there were 80 sachets. When

  asked from whom he got the heroin the Accused answered that he got it from a male Chinese

  named ‘Ah Mike’ at Geylang Lorong 37. When asked what he was going to do with

  the heroin his answer was that he wanted to give it back to Ah Mike at Geylang Lorong 37.

  He also acknowledged that the 3 keys in his possession were to his flat #12-362.</p>
<b><p align="justify">P56A</p></b> - Contemporaneous Statement recorded by Insp Herman on 11

  April 2000 at 8.00 pm in flat #12-362

  <p align="justify">The Accused admitted to questions by Insp Herman that the white plastic

  bag found next to the cupboard in the bedroom was his and it contained ‘heroin,

  envelope, weighing machine and empty plastic bag’. When asked what he would do with

  the heroin his reply was ‘I will repack into small plastic bag and sent to ‘Ah

  Mike’’.</p>
<b><p align="justify">P57</p></b> - Contemporaneous Statement recorded by the Investigating

  Officer on 11 April 2000 at 9.00 pm in flat #12-362

  <p align="justify">To questions by the Investigating Officer after his arrest at flat

  #12-362 the Accused again admitted that the brown paper bag seized from the lorry

  contained heroin; that it belonged to him and that he got it from ‘Ah Mike" in

  the morning at Geylang Lorong 37. Further he admitted the white plastic bag with the word

  ‘Maxims Cakes’ had heroin in it, that it belonged to him and that he got it from

  ‘Ah Mike’, same place, that the empty plastic bags were to fill heroin in

  ‘the big one to make small one’ and thereafter to send the small plastic bags to

  ‘Ah Mike’ in return for money – ‘Singapore dollars one thousand’.</p>
<b><p align="justify">P58</p></b> - Cautioned Statement concerning the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge

  recorded by the Investigating Officer on 12 April 2000 at 3.25 am in CNB

  <p align="justify">The Accused stated ‘I have nothing to say’.</p>
<b><p align="justify">P59</p></b> - 2<sup>nd</sup> Cautioned Statement concerning the 2<sup>nd</sup>

  Charge recorded by the Investigating Officer on 12 April 2000 at 3.47 am in CNB

  <p align="justify">The Accused stated ‘Nothing to say’.</p>
<b><p align="justify">P60</p></b> - Long Statement recorded by the Investigating Officer on 14

  April 2000 at 9.55 am in CNB

  <p align="justify">The Accused’s statement was that on 11 April 2000 at about 10.00

  a.m. as a result of a phone call from Malaysia he understood that a person would bring

  heroin from Malaysia [Para 5]. At 11.00 a.m. two Chinese males came in a car. He opened

  the back door and took out a brown paper bag – the same bag was seized from the lorry

  later in the day [Para 6]. He said he took the brown paper bag home. At 4.00 p.m. the same

  person spoke to him to bring the 8 envelopes to the same place at about 6.00 p.m. meaning

  Geylang Lorong 37. He opened the brown bag and saw 8 envelopes containing small packets of

  heroin. He also saw a plastic bag containing 2 big packets. There were also one or two

  envelopes inside the plastic bag. He took out and put the plastic bag next to the wardrobe

  [Para 7]. At about 6.00 p.m. he left the house carrying the brown paper bag with another

  male Malay (Abdul Rahman) and at the void deck he asked for a lift in a lorry from a

  friend Zamri back from work as a lorry had came to pick them up [Para 9]. Thereafter he

  took a lift in the lorry. He sat in the passenger cabin and kept the brown paper bag

  between his legs [Para 10 and 11]. The lorry was intercepted by CNB officers and he and

  the others were arrested [Para 12 and 13].</p>
<b><p align="justify">P61</p></b> - Further Long Statement recorded by the Investigating

  Officer on 17 April 2000 at 9.25 am in CNB:

  <p align="justify">Extracts:</p>
<p align="justify">‘15. In the brown paper bag, there were 81 small packets of heroin

  as well as a Red Bull, a Marlboro cigarette and a newspaper…</p>
<p align="justify">16. … The caller from Malaysia who spoke in Malay with a Chinese

  accent is called Ah Mike… …<b>Ah Mike called me to bring the 8 envelopes to

  Geylang Lorong 37…</b></p>
<p align="justify">17. So far I had dealings with Ah Mike twice… … The last

  time I was paid Singapore dollars 1000. This time I expected about the same amount. I do

  not know what they intended to do with the heroin.</p>
<p align="justify">18. I refer to para 7. I took a plastic bag containing two big packets

  of heroin and put it on the floor next to the wardrobe. Inside were also 2 envelopes

  containing heroin but I did not know how much… … I do not know what Ah Mike

  intends to do with all these things. I assume Ah Mike wanted me to repack the big packets

  into smaller plastic packets. In my oral statement to the recording officer on the night

  of my arrest, when I said the big packets would be packed into smaller packets, I meant

  this is what I thought would happen.</p>
<p align="justify">20. In the wardrobe of my room, the officers recovered a plastic bag

  inside which was a brown wrapper containing a lot of plastic bags. They were part of what

  was contained in the plastic bag of our previous deal. I put it in the wardrobe. In the

  previous deal, the plastic bag contained 2 plastic bag. One was this plastic bag that

  contained the many small plastic bags. The other one contained heroin. Ah Mike told me to

  give the one with the heroin to someone in Lorong 37 Geylang…’</p>
<b><p align="justify">P62</p></b> - Further Long Statement recorded by the Investigating

  Officer on 22 June 2000 at 11.35 am in Queenstown Remand Prison:

  <p align="justify">Extract:</p>
<p align="justify">‘29. When I was re-packing the heroin, as instructed by Ah Mike, I

  did not wear gloves. I just packed with my bare hands.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<u><b>
<p align="justify">Prima Facie Case</p></b></u>
<p align="justify">8. On the witness’ evidence adduced by the prosecution and on the

admissions of the Accused as set out in his various police statements which I have set out

earlier I was <i>prima facie</i> satisfied that the prosecution had proven that both the

brown bag (<b>Exh. P63</b>) he carried in the motorlorry YD 8173P and the white plastic

bag (<b>Exh. P85</b>) recovered in the Accused’s bedroom in flat #12-362 had not less

than 24.47 and 77.40 grams of diamorphine as analyzed and deposed to by Dr Lee the

Scientific Officer. Under Chapter S 17 (s) of the Misuse of Drugs Act possession of more

than 2 grams of diamorphine raised the presumption that the possession of diamorphine was

for the purpose of trafficking. I was further satisfied that the prosecution had <i>prima

facie</i> proved that the above amounts of diamorphine in each case were in the possession

of or control of the Accused. The Accused was seen bringing down the brown bag (<b>Exh.

P63</b>) from his flat #12-362 in which 24.47 grams of diamorphine were found. On his own

admission in his statement, <b>Exh. P60</b>, he said he brought down the brown bag (<b>Exh.

P63</b>) and thereafter sat in the front passenger cabin and kept the said bag between his

legs. After his arrest he also admitted that the said brown bag contained diamorphine and

that he had obtained it from one Ah Mike and that he understood he was given the

diamorphine to be repacked into the small sachets and thereafter he was to return the

repacked heroin to the aforesaid Ah Mike for which work he would be paid S$1000. </p>
<p align="justify">9. The Accused explanation in respect of the 77.40 grams of diamorphine

found in his bedroom was the same. He explained that he had received the two amounts of

diamorphine together in the morning of 11 April 2000 and he had separated them i.e.

putting aside the 77.40 grams of diamorphine contained in the white plastic bag <b>Exh.

P85</b> (2 transparent plastic packets and 2 envelopes) in between a wardrobe and the

dressing table. </p>
<p align="justify">10. All these facts went to prove that the Accused had knowledge that

the contents of the aforesaid two bags concerning each of the charges was diamorphine and

that he was in control of such diamorphine. It was also <i>prima facie</i> proved by his

admissions when read as a whole that the Accused had such possession for the purpose of

trafficking as he intended to repackage the diamorphine and had partially repackaged the

diamorphine and was on his way to deliver some of that diamorphine, the subject matter of

the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge as requested by Ah Mike. Drug related paraphernalia was found in

the flat for repacking of the diamorphine consisting of heat sealing and more than 2,500

empty sachets and a weighing scale including diamorphine stained spoon all indicating that

the Accused had repackaged diamorphine. Complementing the proof were the presumptions

under the MDA. Apart from the presumption of S.17 as stated above the presumption in S

5(2) of the MDA stipulated that a person commits the offence of trafficking in a

controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. </p>
<p align="justify">11. Therefore both on proof and presumption I was <i>prima facie</i>

satisfied that the Accused was trafficking in the amount of heroin set out in each of the

two charges. It was for the Accused to prove otherwise on a balance of probabilities. In

the circumstances, I called upon him to enter his defence.</p>
<p><u><i><b> </b></i></u></p>
<p align="justify">Defence</p>
<p align="justify">12. On the Accused defence being called the Accused elected to remain

silent.</p>
<p><u><i><b> </b></i></u></p>
<p align="justify">Decision</p>
<p align="justify">13. Counsel for the Defence submitted at the conclusion of the case

that only a case of possession of drugs was established against the Accused and the

Accused should only be found guilty of the lesser acts of possession in respect of each

charge. He went on to submit that the actual purpose of possession was repackaging the

diamorphine in question and for the repackaged diamorphine to be returned to Ah Mike or

his agent. He submitted that when the MDA referred to the purpose of possession it must be

the dominant purpose. The dominant purpose was repacking and the secondary purpose was the

return of the repackaged drugs to its owner. The Accused would not know what the owner

would want to do with the repackaged drugs. As such, there was no trafficking by the

Accused.</p>
<p align="justify">13.1 I found the submission both novel and ingenious. I rejected the

same. The law was plainly set out in s 5(2) of the MDA and enunciated in<i><b> Sze Siew

Luan</b></i> <i><b>P P </b></i>[1997] 2SLR 522 at 525 in which Yong C J stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">" It is settled law that possession of drugs for the purpose of

  returning them to the owner is possession for the purpose of trafficking, for the bailee

  would eventually have to transfer possession back to the bailor." </p>
<p align="justify">This was held by the Court of Appeal in <i><b>Lee Yuan Kwang &amp; Ors

  v P P</b></i> [1995] 2SLR 349 at 368:</p>
<p align="justify">Adopting the court’s interpretation of ‘deliver’ in Goh

  Hock Huat, he could not succeed in rebutting the presumption of possession of the drugs

  for the purpose of trafficking on the basis of the argument that ‘returning’ the

  drugs to Lee was not trafficking. By a future act which would transfer possession of the

  drugs to Lee, Yakoob would be admitting, in effect, that he would deliver the drugs to

  Lee, albeit at a subsequent time. The fact that this time had not yet arrived was

  immaterial because of s 5(2), the insertion of which was intended to clarify

  Parliament’s intention that once the presumption of trafficking was invoked,

  ‘there was no need to show the overt act of trafficking which he had intended to

  do."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">14. It was clear from the Prosecution’s evidence adduced that by a

future act, the Accused would be transferring possession of the repackaged diamorphine to

Ah Mike and the Accused was admitting as such that he had <i>offered to deliver</i> and <i>would

deliver</i> such diamorphine in respect of each charge to Ah Mike - in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup>

charge almost immediately and in respect of the other charge subsequently when asked to by

Ah Mike. Such an intended delivery of the diamorphine on the part of the Accused evinced

that the Accused’s intention of having the diamorphine in his possession was for the

purpose of trafficking and the repacking into retail sized sachets of about 8 grams each

accentuated not diminished the purpose. The intended eventual delivery was not of

secondary significance and inconsequential to trafficking as submitted by Defence Counsel

but was in my opinion the culminating act of trafficking.</p>
<p align="justify">15. There was also no further evidence for me to consider that the

Accused was not trafficking in the said amount of diamorphine, the Accused having remained

silent. I also drew an adverse inference against the Accused upon his refusal to take the

stand under s 196(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"If the accused after being called upon by the court to give

  evidence or after he or the advocate representing him has informed the court that he will

  give evidence, refuses to be sworn or affirmed, the court, in determining whether the

  accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inferences from the refusal as

  appear proper." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">15.1 On a review of the whole evidence, I was satisfied that there was

no contrary indication that the presumption under s 5(2) of the MDA should not apply. The

evidence of the Prosecution not being controverted, I found the Accused had failed to

prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not traffic in the diamorphine in respect

of each of the charges upon which he was tried.</p>
<p align="justify">16. I therefore found him guilty in respect of each charge and

convicted him accordingly and sentenced him according to law.</p>
