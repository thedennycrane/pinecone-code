<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The parties were married in January 1994 and
                    have one child (“the Child”), born in 1996. I will refer to AOH
                    and AOI as “the Wife” and “the Husband”
                    respectively. The Wife commenced divorce proceedings in September 2006 and was
                    granted interim judgment in November 2006. The hearings before me of the
                    ancillary matters concerned (a) the division of the matrimonial assets; (b) the
                    maintenance to be paid by the Husband; and (c) the custody, care and control of,
                    as well as access to, the Child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       After hearing counsel for both parties and
                    reviewing an Accountants Report (“the Report”), I made the
                    following orders on 26 November 2010:</p>

                            Matrimonial Property”), <em>ie</em>,
                            $3,350,299.61, were to be divided 52% and 48% between the Wife and
                            Husband respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The net balance of the sale of shares in [B] Pte

<p class="Judg-1">The Husband was to pay the Wife 35% of the sum of $11,317,217.50 as
                    part of the division of matrimonial assets with interest thereon at the rate of
                    3% per annum from 1 January 2010 to the date of full payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Parties were to retain all other
                        assets in their own names.</p>

            <u>Maintenance</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       By consent, the Husband was
                            to pay maintenance for the Child at $2,000 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The Husband was to pay
                            maintenance of $1 per year for the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <u>Custody, care and
                            control and access</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       Parties were to have joint
                            custody of the Child.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The Wife was to have care and control of the
                            Child. This was without prejudice to any fresh application by the
                            Husband to have care and control.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_2-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       The Husband was to have access to
                            the Child as stipulated in two orders each dated 7 December 2007 of
                            a District Judge and as varied by Justice Tay Yong Kwang
                            (“Tay J”) (for one of such orders), with the
                            additional variation that the Husband was to have equal access to the
                            Child during the mid-year and year-end school holidays starting from
                            2011 and two weeks access for the 2010 year-end holidays. Parties were
                            to work out the details of such access. Also, there was no need for
                            one-night access to be at the Child’s paternal grandparents’
                            place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I ordered the Husband to pay the costs
                    (to be agreed or taxed) of the ancillaries to the Wife, including the fees and
                    expenses of the accountant. The Husband has appealed against that part of my
                    decision pertaining to the division of matrimonial assets, <em>ie</em>, the net proceeds of sale of the Matrimonial property and the
                    net balance of the sale of shares in [B] and my decision on costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Grounds of decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Division of matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       As regards the division of matrimonial assets,
                    the dispute was in respect of two assets, <em>ie</em>, the
                    sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Property and the sale proceeds of shares in
                    [B]. However, the Wife urged me to take into account the Husband’s
                    non-disclosure of some matrimonial assets in making my determination on the
                    division of the sale proceeds of shares in [B]. A brief history of the
                    parties’ acquisition and disposal of the main disclosed matrimonial assets
                    is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     In August 1993, before the marriage,
                        the parties bought a property (“the first property”) in their
                        joint names. The first property was purchased for $550,000. The first
                        property was sold for $890,000 in 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     In July 1996, [B] was incorporated. In June 2000,
                        [C] Ltd (“[C]”) acquired 180,000 shares in
                    [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     In 1999, the
                        parties bought another property (“the second property”) for
                        $2.25 million. The second property was sold in 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     In September 2000, the parties bought
                        the Matrimonial Property. They rebuilt the property between April 2001 and
                        August 2003. The Matrimonial Property was sold in December 2006 and the net
                        sale proceeds were held by solicitors pending the outcome of the
                        ancillaries.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_e"></a>(e)     On
                        5 August 2010, the Husband entered into an agreement to sell to [C]
                        320,000 shares in [B] for $1,250,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The parties also
                    maintained a joint bank account with DBS bank (“the DBS Joint
                    Account”). The DBS Joint Account was opened in January 1994. The Wife and
                    Husband contributed $1,000 and $1,500 respectively to the DBS Joint Account on a
                    monthly basis until the account was closed in September 2006 but there were also
                    ad hoc contributions as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       To assist with the division of matrimonial
                    assets, the parties appointed M/s Kong Lim &amp; Partners to carry out an
                    investigation and make a report on the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <u>The Matrimonial
                            Property</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       To identify the profit made
                            from the sale of the Matrimonial Property and the monetary contributions
                            made by the Wife and the Husband and moneys paid out from the DBS Joint
                            Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       To identify the sale and purchase price of the Matrimonial
                            Property and to verify the related expenses with regards to the
                            Matrimonial Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     
            <u>[B]</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2">To identify
                        the purchase price paid by [C] for the sale of 180,000 shares in
                    [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <u>Funds in the DBS Joint Account</u>
</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       To identify monetary
                            contributions made into the DBS Joint Account by the Wife and the
                            Husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       To ascertain the outflow of the funds taken by the Wife and the
                            Husband from the DBS Joint Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I referred
                    to the Report in my broad-brush determination of the value of the matrimonial
                    assets and the proportion of each party’s financial contribution to such
                    assets, bearing in mind the issues raised by both parties regarding certain
                    figures in the Report. As is evident from my orders (see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above), I treated the two assets for division separately,
                    rather than grouping them together and thereafter dividing them, because the
                    proportion of the direct contributions of the parties in acquiring and improving
                    each asset was likely to be quite different.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The division of the net sale proceeds of the Matrimonial
                property</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The parties purchased the Matrimonial Property
                    in their joint names in September 2000. In 2006, the Matrimonial Property was
                    sold and, according to the Report (at p 6), the net sale proceeds was
                    $3,350,299.61 (subject to adjustment pending confirmation on the final
                    redemption amount payable on completion).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Report (at pp 8, 11 and 29) found that the
                    moneys paid towards the Matrimonial Property consisted of the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     a total of $852,563.95 from the Wife
                        consisting of $693,956.86 from the Wife’s personal bank account and
                        $158,607.09 from the Wife’s contribution to the DBS Joint
                        Account;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     a total
                        of $1,342,579.41 from the Husband consisting of $409,796.91 from the
                        Husband’s personal bank account and $932,782.50 from the
                        Husband’s contribution to the DBS Joint Account;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_c"></a>(c)     a sum of $315,866.49 from the DBS Joint
                        Account which the Report did not identify as being the contributions of the
                        Husband or the Wife;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_d"></a>(d)     a sum of $22,198 from the parties’ joint bank account with POSB
                        which the Report did not identify as being the contributions of the Husband
                        or the Wife; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_e"></a>(e)     a sum of $129,254.28 from the proceeds of sale of previous
                        properties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The parties sought to apportion the contribution
                    of $315,866.49 from the DBS Joint Account (see [6(c)] above) as well as the sum
                    of $22,198 derived from the parties’ joint bank account with POSB (see
                    [6(d)] above) based on the ratio of the parties’ total deposits into (less
                    their withdrawals from) the DBS Joint Account. However, each party arrived at a
                    different ratio depending on the time frame adopted in the calculation of how
                    much each party had deposited into or withdrawn from the DBS Joint Account. The
                    Husband looked at the parties’ total deposits into (less their withdrawals
                    from) the DBS Joint Account between 2000 (when the Matrimonial Property was
                    purchased) and 2006. He submitted that the sums of $315,866.49 and $22,198
                    should be apportioned between the Husband and Wife in the ratio 60:40
                    respectively. On the other hand, the Wife adopted the figures stated at
                    p 29 of the Report, which looked at the parties’ deposits into (less
                    their withdrawals from) the DBS Joint Account between 1997 and 2006. She
                    submitted that the sums of $315,866.49 and $22,198 should be apportioned between
                    the Husband and Wife in the ratio 37:73 respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       With regard to the sum of $129,254.28 from the
                    proceeds from sale of previous properties, the Wife argued that this should be
                    divided equally between the parties as all previous properties were held by the
                    parties as joint tenants and that any moneys from the Husband’s father
                    were gifts to the married couple. On the other hand, the Husband argued that the
                    sum of $129,254.28 should be paid to the Husband’s father as repayment of
                    an alleged loan of $400,000 from the Husband’s father to the parties to
                    purchase the first property. $379,905.19 was verified at p 9 of the Report
                    as being payments made towards the first property by [D] Pte Ltd and the
                    Husband’s father. In the alternative, the Husband claimed that the sum of
                    $129,254.28 should be attributed to him as his contribution towards the
                    Matrimonial Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Based on their respective submissions at
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> and <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above and taking into account items (a) and (b) of <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above, the Husband submitted that the direct
                    financial contributions towards the purchase of the Matrimonial Property should
                    be divided between the Wife and the Husband in the ratio 36.3:63.7 respectively
                    whilst the Wife submitted that it should be in the ratio 44:56
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     I noted that the calculation of the
                    parties’ contributions to the DBS Joint Account by both parties did not
                    include the monthly contributions of $1,500 and $1,000 by the Husband and Wife
                    respectively (see <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> above and p 24 of
                    the Report). I was of the view that these monthly contributions were a better
                    gauge of the parties’ direct financial contributions to the acquisition of
                    matrimonial assets generally, and in particular, the Matrimonial Property.
                    Accordingly, I concluded that the Wife and the Husband had made direct financial
                    contributions to acquire the Matrimonial Property in the ratio of,
                    approximately, 40:60 respectively. This was not very different from their
                    respective submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I come now to the indirect contributions. In
                    the Wife’s first affidavit filed on 24 January 2007, the Wife
                    described her indirect contributions. According to her, she took on sole
                    responsibility for household matters such as hiring and supervising domestic
                    helpers and attending to repairs of household appliances etc; looked after the
                    Child whilst the Husband travelled frequently and entertained business
                    associates at night; spent time with and nurtured the Child between March 2001
                    and October 2003 when she was not in the work force; planned for and enrolled
                    the Child in enrichment and tuition activities as well as organised the
                    Child’s birthday parties; arranged for masseuse and foot reflexologists to
                    provide massages at home to relieve the Husband’s alleged stress at work;
                    arranged the Husband’s surprise 40th birthday party; and took charge of
                    the project to demolish and build the parties’ family home by liaising
                    with architects and contractors etc and supervising the construction
                    works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On the other hand, in his affidavit filed on
                    24 September 2007 (“the Husband’s Second Affidavit”),
                    the Husband claimed that he had helped out in the researching, interviewing and
                    choosing of architects and contractors for the project to build the family home;
                    shared in the household chores such as the supervision of domestic help and the
                    grocery shopping; tutored and supervised the Child; cooked dinners for the
                    family at least two or three times a week; supervised contractors and carried
                    out minor repair work around the house; installed and maintained the
                    parties’ two home entertainment systems; worked with real estate agents
                    for the potential rental and sale of the Matrimonial Property; jointly organised
                    family holidays with the Wife; and bought toys, clothes and food for the Child.
                    Nevertheless, the Husband admitted (at para 38 of the Husband’s Second
                    Affidavit) that the parties had agreed for the Wife to liaise with the
                    architects and contractors with regard to the project to build the family home.
                    He further acknowledged (at para 39 of the Husband’s Second
                    Affidavit) that he had been working almost 12 to 14 hour days for several years
                    (1996 – 2003) and did not spend much time with the Child during that
                    period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Whilst both parties may have contributed
                    indirectly to the acquisition of the Matrimonial Property through their
                    contributions to the family, it appeared to me that the Wife’s
                    contributions to the family were substantially more than the Husband’s. As
                    such, I was of the opinion that the ratio of the Wife’s to the
                    Husband’s overall contributions to acquire the Matrimonial property should
                    be adjusted from the ratio of 40:60 based on their direct financial
                    contributions only, to the ratio of 52:48 to take into account their <em>indirect</em> contributions as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the circumstances, I ordered that the net
                    sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Property be divided 52% and 48% between the
                    Wife and Husband respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The division of the sale proceeds of shares in [B]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The history of [B]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     [B] was incorporated with 100,000 shares at $1
                    per share in July 1996. The Husband and Wife held 99,999 shares and one share
                    respectively. Thereafter, as set out at p 12 of the Report, the following
                    events took place:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Husband was allotted an
                        additional 100,000 shares at $1 per share on 28 November
                    1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        Husband’s father was allotted 100,000 shares at $1 per share on
                        28 November 1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     A total of 180,000 shares were transferred to [C] for a
                        declared consideration of $13,800,000 on 29 June 2000 in the following
                        manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       the Husband’s 79,999
                            shares in [B] were transferred for a consideration of
                            $6,133,256.66;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       the Husband’s father’s 100,000
                            shares in [B] were transferred for a consideration of $7,666,666.67;
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       the Wife’s one share in [B] was transferred for a
                            consideration of $76.67.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     On 29 June 2000, [B] issued 500,000 shares of $1
                        each for a consideration of $4 per share:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_d-p3_i"></a>(i)       the Husband was allotted
                            200,000 shares for a total consideration of $800,000 via capitalisation
                            of loans payable to a director; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_15-p2_d-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       [C] was allotted 300,000 shares for a
                            total cash consideration of $1,200,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_e"></a>(e)     As stated at p 28 of the Report,
                        on 5 August 2010, the Husband entered into a sale and purchase
                        agreement to sell his remaining 320,000 shares in [B] to [C] as well as a
                        global settlement of a dispute arising from the previous sale of 180,000
                        shares to [C] (see (c) above). The dispute on the sale of 180,000 shares on
                        29 June 2000 was globally settled at $11,600,000 and the
                        Husband’s remaining 320,000 shares were sold to [C] for $1,250,000.
                        The total sale proceeds of shares in [B] was therefore
                    $12,850,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     According to the Husband, he no longer
                    retains, nor had he kept aside, any part of the proceeds of sale of shares in
                    [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Firstly, the Husband claimed that his father
                    was the legal and beneficial owner of 100,000 of the shares in [B] on 29 June
                    2000 when the 180,000 shares in [B] were sold to [C]. Therefore, the
                    Husband’s father was entitled to $6,444,444.50 being his proportionate
                    share of the settlement price of $11,600,000. On the other hand, the Wife
                    submitted that the Husband’s father was the Husband’s nominee for
                    the 100,000 shares and that there was therefore no basis for any part of the net
                    sale proceeds of [B] shares to belong to the Husband’s father except
                    perhaps for the repayment of loans amounting to $600,000. The Husband had
                    claimed that he had started [B] with personal loans amounting to $600,000 taken
                    between November 1997 and March 2000 from his father (see para 16 of
                    the Husband’s affidavit filed on 12 February 2007). The Wife pointed
                    out that the allocation of 100,000 shares to the father on 28 November 1997
                    appeared to correspond with a personal loan of $100,000 that the Husband had
                    allegedly taken from his father on 26 November 1997. The date and amount of that
                    loan was written by hand together with dates and amounts totalling the remaining
                    $500,000. These handwritten notes were found in a typed note to acknowledge a
                    total loan of $600,000 by the Husband’s father to the Husband and
                    exhibited at p 32 of the Husband’s affidavit of 12 February
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Secondly, the Husband claimed that he had paid
                    $6,700,000 of the sale proceeds as fees and commissions to third parties to
                    facilitate business contacts and potential businesses for [B] in countries such
                    as Brunei, Thailand and Indonesia as well as for various investments. The fees
                    and commissions were paid first to his father who then paid certain middlemen
                    (whom the Husband named) and who in turn then paid the brokers entitled to the
                    same (see Husband’s affidavit filed on 14 November 2007 at paras
                    20–22).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Thirdly, the Husband claimed to have utilized
                    the remainder of the sale proceeds to support the family, buy the family cars,
                    repay his father the $600,000 which his father had lent him between November
                    1997 and March 2000 to start up the company (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above), pay for household and renovation costs, to
                    contribute to the DBS Joint Account and as part payment of the Matrimonial
                    Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Apart from the sums of $932,782.50 (being a
                    sum which the Husband channelled towards the purchase of the Matrimonial
                    Property) and $600,000 which I was prepared to accept as a loan that the Husband
                    had taken from his father to start up the company, I declined to make any
                    further deductions from the sale proceeds when determining the net balance that
                    was held by the Husband or in his control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Firstly, I was of the view that the sum of
                    $600,000 given to the Husband by his father was in the nature of a loan rather
                    than as the purchase price for an equity stake in [B] and that the
                    Husband’s father was the Husband’s nominee for the 100,000 shares
                    registered in the Husband’s father’s name. Therefore, the sale
                    proceeds attributable to the 100,000 shares in the Husband’s
                    father’s name ought to be considered as the Husband’s.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Secondly, as noted at p 17 of the Report,
                    the Husband’s claim that he had paid $6,700,000 (through his father) to
                    third parties was not supported by documentary evidence substantiating the
                    reasons for paying out these amounts. It was insufficient for him to produce
                    cheque images of various sums of money payable to his father between 2000 and
                    2003, petty cash vouchers and a note of payments to certain named persons, when
                    these documents did not have adequate information regarding the reasons for
                    payment. Furthermore, according to the Wife, the named middlemen were related to
                    the Husband. I decided that the Husband’s claim that these were payments
                    necessary to secure deals for [B] should not be accepted</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Thirdly, in the absence of better evidence, I
                    did not accept the Husband’s bare claim that he had utilized the remaining
                    sale proceeds to support the family or for any of the purposes mentioned in
                        <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I therefore found the net balance of the sale
                    of [B] shares to be:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As regards the Wife’s share of the net
                    balance of the sale of [B] shares, the Husband initially suggested that she
                    should get at most $64.40 for her one share in [B] which was sold. He claimed
                    that whilst the Wife was a director of [B] and had one share in the company, she
                    made no contribution towards the start up and running of the company. He
                    contended that any involvement by the Wife in the company was more disruptive
                    than helpful. Nevertheless, in the course of oral arguments, the Husband’s
                    counsel informed me that the Husband was prepared to offer 10% (of the net
                    balance of the sale of the shares) to the Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On the other hand, the Wife claimed that she
                    had made substantial contributions to the company, both directly (through the
                    Husband’s withdrawal of moneys that the Wife had deposited into the DBS
                    Joint Account) and indirectly (through her professional input into the company).
                    In her affidavits filed on 24 January 2007, 20 August 2007 and
                    19 October 2007, the Wife stated that she was involved, as a director of
                    [B], in the signing of agreements and contracts of [B] from the inception of the
                    company; had sought to introduce new contacts and clients to [B]; managed and
                    participated in the development of wealth management application prototypes for
                    [B]; and attended conferences and company events. In her affidavits, the Wife
                    exhibited e-mail between the parties in which the Husband had asked for the
                    Wife’s assistance on a presentation and had represented to third parties
                    that the Wife was assisting in [B]’s business ventures. I also noted that
                    the Wife had acted as a guarantor for a $1.701 million United Overseas Bank
                    (“UOB”) mortgage of [B]’s properties in 1999 and was also a
                    guarantor of $500,000 overdraft facilities from UOB for [B] in 1999. The Wife
                    claimed 35% of the net balance of the sale of shares in [B] for these
                    contributions and another 15% for her efforts in respect of the family and
                    household etc (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above) and the
                    Husband’s non-disclosure of matrimonial assets. Her total claim for this
                    net balance was 50%.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I was of the opinion that the Wife did
                    contribute to [B] through the Husband’s use of the DBS Joint Account and
                    her own participation in the affairs of the company as she had claimed. The
                    Husband had involved her in the company but in matrimonial proceedings he sought
                    to claim that she was more disruptive than helpful. Nevertheless, it was clear
                    that the Husband was the primary person who started and ran [B]. I was of the
                    view that 15% of the net balance of the sale of shares should be allocated to
                    the Wife for her contributions to [B].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     However, I also concluded that the Husband had
                    not made full disclosure of some of his assets which were part of matrimonial
                    assets as elaborated in paras 26 to 32 of the skeletal submissions for the
                    Wife. In view of that and her contributions to the family, (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above), I was of the view that she should be
                    allocated another 20% making a total of 35% of the net balance of the sale
                    proceeds of [B], <em>ie</em>, 35% of $11,317,217.50. I so
                    ordered. I also awarded the Wife interest thereon at the rate of 3% per annum
                    from 1 January 2010 to the date of full payment as the Husband has had the
                    benefit of most of the sale proceeds for a considerable time (the first sale of
                    shares being in June 2000).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The division of the other matrimonial assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     I have already taken into account the
                    Husband’s non-disclosure of other matrimonial assets. For the assets which
                    were disclosed the parties were not seeking a distribution of the same except
                    for those I have mentioned. Therefore, I was of the opinion that the parties
                    ought to retain those other matrimonial assets in their own names.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance, custody, care and control and access </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For completeness, I will elaborate on my
                    decision on maintenance, custody, care and control and access although these are
                    not the subject of the Husband’s appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Maintenance of the Child</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The parties agreed that the Husband would pay
                    maintenance for the Child at $2,000 per month.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Maintenance of the Wife</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In view of the fact that the Wife was
                    gainfully employed and drawing a substantial salary, she was awarded maintenance
                    at $1 per year.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Custody, care and control and access</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The parties were agreeable to joint custody of
                    the Child. Pursuant to an application by the Husband in Summons No 7190/2007 for
                    interim access to the Child, the District Judge made the following orders
                    regarding access as stated in an Order of Court dated 7 December
                    2007:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On 30 January 2008, Tay J varied the
                    7 December 2007 orders made by the District Judge in Summons No 7190/2007
                    to give the Husband additional access to the Child as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_34-p2_a"></a>(a)     One week during the June and one

                        2008.” According to counsel for the Husband, Tay J had deleted
                        the reference in para 5(1)(g) of the Order of Court dated
                        7 December 2007 to the Husband not bringing any female friend along
                        during access periods. Counsel for the Wife was unable to comment on this
                        point as neither he nor his instructing solicitor was present at the hearing
                        before Tay J.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The District Judge also made the following
                    orders relating to access in an Order of Court, also dated 7 December 2007,
                    in respect of the Husband’s application in Summons No 17073/2007 for
                    access to the Child during the mid-year and year-end school holidays:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     At the hearing before me on 25 November
                    2010, counsel for the Husband indicated that the Husband was prepared to follow
                    the existing orders on access to the Child with the exception that he sought
                    access for half of the duration of the June and November/December school
                    holidays. However, the Husband indicated that he had been denied access to the
                    Child by the Wife in spite of the existing interim orders on access made by the
                    District Judge and Tay J and that, factually, he was only getting access to
                    the Child between 6.45pm and 8.30pm on Monday and Wednesday evenings. As such,
                    the Husband sought care and control of the Child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I noted that the Husband’s complaint
                    that the Wife had failed to comply with the interim orders on access as set out
                    at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>–<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above was a recurring one that had been brought up at
                    hearings of the ancillary maters since 2008. Whilst I granted care and control
                    of the Child to the Wife, I would emphasise that this is without prejudice to
                    any fresh application by the Husband to have care and control of the
                    Child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I ordered that the Husband was to have access
                    to the Child as stipulated in the Order of Court of the District Judge dated
                    7 December 2007 in Summons No 7190/2007 as varied by Tay J (see
                        <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>–<a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> above) and the Order of Court of the District Judge dated
                    7 December 2007 in Summons No 17073/2007 (see <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above), with the additional variation that the Husband was
                    to have equal access to the Child during the mid-year and year-end school
                    holidays starting from 2011 and two weeks access for the 2010 year-end holidays.
                    The parties were to work out the details regarding access to the Child.
                    Additionally, there was no need for one-night access to be at the Child’s
                    paternal grandparents’ place.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     As mentioned, the Husband is also appealing
                    against my decision on costs. At the hearing before me, his counsel agreed that,
                    in principle, the Husband should be liable for costs of the ancillaries as the
                    divorce was granted on the Wife’s statement of claim. However, his counsel
                    submitted that both should bear the fees and expenses of M/s Kong Lim &amp;
                    Partners equally as some of the Wife’s allegations were not justifiable. I
                    was of the view that since their work was necessitated by the divorce and
                    because the Wife had not been unreasonable in her allegations on the
                    ancillaries, when viewed in an overall context, the Husband should also be
                    solely liable for their fees and expenses. I so ordered.</p>
