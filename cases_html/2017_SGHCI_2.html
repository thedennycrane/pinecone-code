The merger has been acted upon in France: BNPSA was duly substituted for BNPWM in the French proceedings brought by the second defendant and her companies against BNPWM.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The application for substitution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On 27 October 2016, BNPSA filed the present application to be substituted as plaintiff in place of BNPWM, as transferee of the interest of BNPWM, pursuant to O 15 r 7(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 The defendants opposed the application on two bases, which we will shortly describe. Their written submissions included that since BNPWM no longer existed, the proceedings had abated and substitution of BNPSA was academic. We do not think that the defendants persisted in this submission, which in any event we would not accept.  Succession to the assets and liabilities of BNPWM, if effective, would have preserved the cause of action and substitution of plaintiff would be available (see <span class="font-italic">Toprak</span><span class="font-italic"> Enerji Sanayi AS v Sale Tilney Technology plc</span> [1994] 1 WLR 840). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The first basis of opposition</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The defendants’ first argument rested upon the statements in Article 4.1A and B of the Merger Agreement that BNPSA “shall be generally subrogated” and “shall be subrogated” (“sera subrogée”) in the rights and obligations (as more fully described) of BNPWM. They submitted that the parties to the Merger Agreement had thereby chosen to carry out the transfer of assets and liabilities by the particular mechanism of subrogation. As an entity subrogated to the rights of another entity must sue in the name of that entity, it was argued that BNPSA could only sue in the name of BNPWM; but BNPWM no longer existed, so there was no entity in whose name BNPSA could sue. They referred to <span class="font-italic">MH Smith </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd (Plant Hire) Ltd v DL Mainwaring (T/A Inshore) </span>[1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 244, in which it was held that proceedings brought by an insurer in its insured’s name in the exercise of subrogated rights could not be maintained because the insured had been dissolved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 BNPSA did not seek to sue in BNPWM’s name, and the argument could perhaps more briefly be expressed that subrogation did not entitle it to sue in its own name. In our view, however, the argument should not be accepted. It assumes that the subrogation referred to in Article 4.1A and B was the same as the common law (equitable) concept of subrogation. That is plainly not so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 There was no expert evidence of subrogation in French law. An affidavit of Christophe Lachaux, filed on behalf of the defendants, explained that under French law a receivable was transferred by a sale (“cession”), a subrogation (“subrogation”) or a delegation (“délégation”).

</div>
</div> This was not an explanation of subrogation, which was expressed in the Merger Agreement to operate in relation to both rights and obligations. It did not explain <span class="font-italic">how</span> subrogation operated (according to the argument) as a mechanism for the wholesale transfer of assets and liabilities; it also did not suggest that a concept other than transfer – or any other concept requiring suing in the name of another – was involved. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 The defendants referred to the second sentence of Article 4.1B and to Article 4.1E as support for their argument, but we do not think that the articles refer to the common law concept of subrogation. The terms of the Merger Agreement are squarely against the argument. Whatever may be meant by subrogation in Article 4.1A and B, it could not be necessary that BNPWM continue to exist in order that BNPSA could effectively succeed to its assets and liabilities or maintain the right to sue in relation to those assets and liabilities. As provided by Article L.236-3 of the Code, the merger was to lead to the dissolution of the absorbed company and the universal transfer of its assets to the absorbing company, and the Merger Agreement so provided. Those consequences co-existed; it could not be that one was to be defeated by the other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Further, the common law does not include subrogation to a liability, so in referring to subrogation in obligations and commitments (note “in” not “to”) the Merger Agreement could not conceivably be expressing the common law concept of subrogation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The primary description of the operation of the merger in the Merger Agreement is as a universal transfer of assets and liabilities (see Section I, Article 1.1; Section III), specifically with BNPSA having the full power to bring or defend any legal proceedings in progress or which might be brought “in the place of” BNPWM (Article 4.2). It may safely be assumed that such an important document was prepared in conformity with French law, and the universal transfer is not consistent with a mechanism by which BNPWM had to continue to exist for the exercise of BNPSA’s rights as transferee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Counsel for the defendants sought to respond to these matters. He submitted that in the absence of evidence of French law it should be taken to be the same as Singapore law, citing <span class="font-italic">Shaker v</span><span class="font-italic"> Mohammed Al-Bedrawi and others</span> [2002] EWCA Civ 1452. There are numerous exceptions to that principle, which is not applied inflexibly, and we do not think it has any application in ascertaining the meaning and effect of the references to subrogation in the Merger Agreement. He claimed that the exercise of subrogated rights could have been accommodated by delaying the dissolution of BNPWM until after the Closing Date, but that would scarcely be a practical course or congruent with the merger by the absorption of BNPWM which entailed the dissolution of BNPWM: indeed, the fact that the parties did not take it underlines that they did not intend by the references to subrogation to embrace the need for the continued existence of BNPWM. As to subrogation to a liability, counsel for the defendants appeared to acknowledge the difficulty but suggested that subrogation to a liability could be effective under French law but otherwise with the same ingredients as the common law concept. In our opinion, his responses did not satisfactorily address the matters to which we have referred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 It may be noted that, in the related proceedings in France which have been brought by the defendants, BNPSA has been substituted for BNPWM as the defendant, which suggests that no impediment was seen to the transfer of BNPWM’s liability to the defendants to BNPSA in the prior dissolution of BNPWM; although of course we know little about what exactly occurred in those proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The second basis of opposition</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The defendants’ second argument was principally founded on s 55B of Singapore’s Banking Act (Cap 19, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). The provision is contained in Division 1 of Part VIIA of the Act and relevantly provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Voluntary transfer of business</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">55B. — </span>(1) A transferor may transfer the whole or any part of its business (including its non-banking business) to a transferee which is licensed to carry on banking business in Singapore, if —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) where the transferor is a bank incorporated in Singapore, the Minister has consented to the transfer or has certified that his consent is not required;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) where the transferor is a bank incorporated outside Singapore, the business to be transferred is reflected in the books of the transferor in Singapore in relation to its operations in Singapore;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) the transfer involves the whole or part of the banking business of the transferor; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) the Court has approved the transfer.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Subsection (1) is without prejudice to the right of a bank to transfer the whole or any part of its business under any law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Section 55A contains definitions, including that “transferor” means a bank in Singapore, the whole or part of the business of which is or is proposed to be transferred under the Division. Section 55C governs application to the Court for approval, including that by the order approving the transfer, the Court may provide for the transfer of the whole or part of the business and other matters such as the continuation of legal proceedings and the dissolution without winding up of the transferor (s 55C(7)). The order may be made even if the transferor does not have capacity to transfer the business (s 55C(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)), and the business or part thereof is transferred “by virtue of the order” (s 55C(9)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 BNPWM was a bank in Singapore within the definition of “transferor” in s 55A. BNPSA acknowledged that the merger involved a transfer of part of BNPWM’s business and accepted that, unless s 55B(2) applied, court approval to the transfer was required. Court approval had not been obtained. BNPSA contended, however, that s 55B was merely “facilitative”, that is, it prescribed a means of transfer but, through s 55B(2), left other means available.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As the arguments evolved, the issue became whether the transfer pursuant to the merger was “under [a] law” within s 55B(2). The defendants submitted that it was not, and that in the absence of court approval the transfer was ineffective in Singapore. Initially it was said that the conditions precedent in the Merger Agreement required compliance with Singapore laws relating to the transfer of banking assets and liabilities. That appeared to fall away with the acknowledgement that the merger was effective in France, and the submission evolved into an argument that recognition in Singapore of the succession to BNPWM’s assets and liabilities would involve illegality and should not be given effect by the substitution of BNPSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 In our opinion, s 55B(2) applies and it was not necessary that court approval be obtained.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Part VIIA of the Act was introduced by the Banking (Amendment) Act 2007 (No 1 of 2007). From the Parliamentary debates (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report </span>(22 January 2007) vol 82 (Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Minister for Trade and Industry)) and the Explanatory Statement to the Banking (Amendment) Bill (No 13 of 2006) (“the Bill”), it can be gleaned that the purpose of the amendment was to enhance the role of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“the MAS”) in bank resolution, including providing a mechanism by which a private sector resolution could be carried out in respect of a distressed or insolvent bank. The origin of s 55B(2) can be seen in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Division 1 of Part VIIA provides for the voluntary transfer of the business of a bank in Singapore. A bank may transfer the whole or part of its business (including its non-banking business) to another bank if the provisions in Division 1 are complied with and the approval of the High Court is obtained for the transfer. <span class="font-italic">Division 1 does not affect the voluntary transfer of any business of a ban</span><span class="font-italic">k under other written law or under an agreement.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 What is the reach of “law” in s 55B(2), and does the phrase “under any law” exclude an underlying agreement between transferor and transferee? Each party sought to gain comfort from the italicised words. The defendants relied on the words “written law” in the Explanatory Statement which they said, through the definition of “written law” in s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1997 Rev Ed), meant Singapore legislation; thus, it was said, “law” in s 55B(2), meant a Singapore statute. The defendants also submitted that the transfer was by the Merger Agreement, a voluntary transfer rather than under a law. By contrast, BNPSA relied on the phrase “under an agreement” which it said showed that the Merger Agreement did not take the transfer of assets and liabilities outside s 55B(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Section 55B is not confined to the transfer of the business of a distressed or insolvent bank, and s 55B(2) uses the expression “under any law” rather than “other written law” as was used in the Explanatory Statement. In our view, the different expression used in the Act detracts from the assistance to be gained from the Explanatory Statement. When the legislature did not take up the defined expression “written law”, but rather used the wide expression “any law”, it would not be correct to restrict the latter expression to a Singapore statute. On the other hand, the legislature chose not to refer to a transfer under an agreement, but confined the saving provision to transfer “under any law”. It is those operative words which must be applied.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Section 55A encompasses banks incorporated outside Singapore and subject to foreign laws, and the words “any law” amply extend beyond a Singapore statute and to a foreign law which will be recognised in Singapore as giving the right to transfer. In <span class="font-italic">JX Holdings </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and another v Singapore Airlines Ltd </span>[2016] 5 SLR 988, out of international comity, the court recognised the transfer of assets and liabilities of a foreign corporation through a process of universal transfer under its law of incorporation (at [43]–[44]). BNPWM and BNPSA are companies which were incorporated in France. The succession to corporate personality in the merger of French incorporated companies being governed by French law, the Code is hence such a law and the transfer thereunder will be recognised by this court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 It may be accepted that the Merger Agreement was a necessary element in the merger between BNPSA and BNPWM, and that the merger was a voluntary act between them. But there was more than a commercial agreement between a vendor and a purchaser of a business, having effect through the making of the agreement and carrying it out, in this case. The Merger Agreement was effected through Article L.236-3 of the Code, which is concerned with the particular event of merger. The article provides a means by which there can be a merger whereby the assets of one company are automatically transferred to another company. There are requirements by way of filing and publication, and the filing of a declaration of conformity is specifically “[i]n order for the operation to be valid” (Article L.236-6). The merger, and the transfer of assets and liabilities involved in it, take their force from the Code; without it, a merger agreement would have to be given effect by, and only to the extent possible as, particular transfers. In our opinion, the universal transfer of assets and liabilities in the merger was under the Code, and under a law for the purposes of s 55B(2).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 This interpretation is supported by ss 14A–C of the Act. Section 14A(1) provides for approval by the Minister of the mergers of a bank and one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and by s 14A(2) the issue of a certificate of approval under s 14A(1) “merges the banks that are parties to the merger agreement on which the application for the certificate of approval is based”. By s 14C, provisions in the Second Schedule to the Act then have effect. They include that the existing bank’s undertaking shall by virtue of s 14C be transferred to and vested in the successor bank, and that any action or proceedings shall not abate and may be continued by or against the successor bank.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The operation of these provisions overlaps with that of ss 55A–C, in that a merger as referred to in the former provisions will generally involve a transfer as referred to in the latter provisions. For consistency within the Act, the transfer involved in a merger pursuant to ss 14A–C must be permitted as a transfer under a law within s 55A(2); and it must be a transfer under a law notwithstanding that the merger is a voluntary act and involves a merger agreement. For ss 14A–C of the Act and the Code alike, the merger takes its force from the relevant legislation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 We add for completeness that the defendants also submitted that the transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to the merger infringed s 14A of the Act. We do not agree. There is nothing to indicate that a merger must take place in the manner dealt with in ss 14A–C; they offer a means of merging which may be employed. From the Minister’s speech at the Second Reading of the Banking (Amendment) Bill (No 22 of 1993) (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report </span>(30 August 1993) vol 61 col 448 (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau, Minister for Finance)), the provisions were introduced to facilitate merger between a bank and its subsidiaries in a more simple manner than under the Companies Act. BNPSA and BNPWM were not obliged to use it, and did not purport to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Although it cannot govern our decision, we note that the MAS was informed of the merger, and that there was no indication that it considered that court approval had been required.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 We do not accept either of the bases for the defendants’ opposition to the substitution. No other reason was suggested, or appears, for declining to substitute BNPSA as plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 We make the following orders: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) BNP Paribas SA is substituted as plaintiff in place of BNP Paribas Wealth Management with effect on and from 1 October 2016.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Leave is given for the name of the plaintiff in the writ of summons filed on 27 November 2015 to be amended to BNP Paribas SA, the amended writ of summons to be filed and served within three working days from the date of this order.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) All other documents filed thus far in the proceedings are taken to have been amended to substitute BNP Paribas SA for BNP Paribas Wealth Management with effect on and from 1 October 2016.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The defendants are to bear 80 per cent of the costs of this application, most of which was occasioned by the unsuccessful arguments raised by the defendants in opposition of the application.

The application was opposed by the defendants. BNPWM was previously a multi-national private bank incorporated in France and a wholly owned subsidiary of BNPSA, also a French incorporated bank. It acted in Singapore through a Singapore branch and was registered in Singapore as a foreign company. On 25 February 2016, BNPSA and BNPWM executed a merger agreement (“the Merger  Agreement”), which was effected on 1 October 2016 pursuant to the French Commercial Code (“the Code”). It was common ground that a merger so made takes effect by the doctrine of universal succession under French law, resulting in the transfer of all assets and liabilities of BNPWM to BNPSA. It was also common ground that all necessary steps had been taken as required by French law and the merger was effective in France. BNPWM’s surrender of its banking licence in Singapore was notified in the Government Gazette on 3 October 2016 and its French registration was struck off on 12 October 2016. </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">2 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">In its judgment, the Court granted the application for BNPSA to be substituted for BNPWM as plaintiff in the Suit. In doing so, it rejected the defendants’ argument that the parties to the Merger Agreement had chosen to carry out the transfer by the particular mechanism of subrogation, which in turn allowed BNPSA to sue only in the name of BNPWM. This argument rested on statements in Article 4.1A and B of the Merger Agreement that BNPSA shall be “subrogated” in the rights and obligations of BNPWM. In the Court’s view, this argument erroneously assumed that the subrogation referred to in Article 4.1A and B was the same as the common law (equitable) concept of subrogation. Although there was no expert evidence of subrogation in French law, the terms of the Merger Agreement were squarely against this argument: the merger was to lead to the dissolution of BNPWM and involved subrogation in obligations. The Merger Agreement also specifically gave BNPSA full power to bring or defend any legal proceedings “in the place of” BNPWM. </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">3 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">The Court also rejected the defendants’ second argument that the transfer of BNPWM’s business in Singapore to BNPSA should not be given effect because, in breach of s 55B of the Banking Act (Cap 19, 2008 Rev Ed), court approval for the transfer had not been obtained. BNPSA’s response was that s 55B was merely “facilitative”, that is, it prescribed a means of transfer but, through s 55B(2), left other means available. Section 55B(2) provided that the mechanism of transfer in s 55B(1) was “without prejudice to the right of a bank to transfer the whole or any part of its business under any law”. The Court was of the opinion that s 55B(2) applied and it was not necessary that court approval be obtained. Section 55A also governs banks incorporated outside Singapore and subject to foreign laws, and the words “any law” in s 55B(2) amply extend beyond a Singapore statute and to a foreign law which will be recognised in Singapore as giving the right to transfer. The succession to corporate personality in the merger of French incorporated companies being governed by French law, the Code is a law for the purposes of s 55B(2) and the transfer thereunder will be recognised by this Court out of international comity. </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">4 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Accordingly, the Court granted the application.     </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s judgment.
