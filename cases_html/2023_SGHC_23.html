Near the end of 2017, Mr Luo was observed by staff to be unduly interested in operations that lay outside of his scope of work. Rumours began circulating that Mr Luo and Dr Duan, who had left by then, were working together. Dr Wang was informed at the beginning of 2018. Subsequently, Tritech discovered Dr Duan had incorporated another company, Dreamem, on 1 March 2017, before he resigned from Tritech. In June 2018, Tritech conducted a trap purchase of Dreamem’s products. Mr Luo represented Dreamem on that occasion, where Tritech obtained products which are alleged to be identical or substantially similar to Tritech’s. Tritech followed on to commence a suit in the PRC Guangdong Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court. Court preservation proceedings were conducted on Dreamem’s premises on 31 August 2018. Mr Luo was summarily dismissed for misconduct on the same day.

Two categories are pertinent to this case: hollow fibre membranes and flat sheet membranes. Typically, hollow fibre membranes are used for the process of ultrafiltration. Flat sheet membranes, on the other hand, are used for nanofiltration, forward osmosis (“FO”) and reverse osmosis (“RO”).

</div> As part of a plan to set up a commercial production line for FO membranes (the “FO Project”), Dr Wang invited Dr Duan to be the expert to lead the Tritech team. An agreement was reached with Dr Duan to allow him to complete his work with the NUS-Tritech collaboration before joining TWT as an employee. Dr Wang obtained Prof Ng’s permission for Dr Duan to start work on the FO Project during the interim period when he was still at NUS. Tritech paid him an allowance each month during this interim period.

Dr Duan responded that “the one in Dalian [was] basically rejected” and “[t]he Wuxi one … did not show a sincere desire to cooperate” and while “they probably have the best design and machining capabilities”, they had not given Tritech a basic sketch so one could not tell what their real processing capabilities were. As for Shanghai Dahe, Dr Duan said that their offer price was too high, but “[i]f they can quote a realistic price, [he thought] it would be ideal for them to do it” because “they [had] some experience in design and machining and have made some similar equipment”.

Mr Luo had also asked members of the production team various technical questions. Because of Mr Luo’s seniority within Tritech, the production employees initially answered his queries. Eventually, they grew suspicious and thus reported Mr Luo’s behaviour to Dr Tan.

Statements of opinion are themselves not actionable (see <span class="font-italic">Goldrich</span><span class="font-italic"> Venture Pte Ltd and another v Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd </span>[2015] 3 SLR 990 at [107]), but statements of opinion can involve implied statements of fact.

Nor is there any expert evidence to show that a person of Dr Duan’s capabilities would have concluded that Shanghai Dahe was not suitable.

</div> There was then a plausible basis to consider that Shanghai Dahe would be suitable to supply related technology, in the light of the other checks that were made. The first representation is not shown to be false. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The second alleged representation pertains to whether or not the FO Production Line was technically feasible. Again, this is a matter of fact. However, Tritech has not established that the FO Production Line was not technically feasible. What they have established is that the FO Production Line was completely non-functional <span class="font-italic">after</span> attempts were made to use it, and that it failed to meet a number of the technical requirements specified by Tritech. This does not necessarily mean that the technical requirements were impossible to meet, or that Shanghai Dahe was incapable of meeting the technical requirements <span class="font-italic">from the outset</span>. It simply means that Shanghai Dahe ultimately failed to do so. Nor is there evidence before the court to suggest that, even if the technical requirements for the FO Production Line had been met, the FO Production Line would not be able to function. The provision of a defective FO Production Line by Shanghai Dahe does not mean that the FO Production Line, as designed, was not “technically feasible”. Thus, Tritech has not shown that the second alleged misrepresentation is false.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The third representation comprises two distinct parts, that the FO Production Line met Tritech’s technical requirements and that the FO Production Line could produce FO membranes. These concern facts that are undisputed, that the FO Production Line did not meet Tritech’s technical requirements and could not produce any FO membrane. The third representation alleged is therefore the only potentially actionable misrepresentation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The issue that follows is whether Dr Duan made these representations.

</div> After his second pre-delivery inspection in May 2012, Dr Duan informed Dr Wang that “the equipment is manufactured exactly according to the design drawings; the equipment is capable of meeting the technical requirements set out in the design …”.

</div> However, he began the e-mail by telling Dr Wang that he had been unable to test the production line for various reasons provided by Shanghai Dahe (see [12] above). He also mentioned that the equipment was not completely assembled yet. He further concluded the quoted statement above with “but the accuracy of the control can only be tested during commissioning.” Dr Duan was clear that he had not tested the equipment. His conclusion was simply based on comparing the drawings with what he saw. Given the nature of the “technical requirements” of the FO Production Line, this cannot have been a representation that they were met. I explain by reference to some examples of the technical requirements that the FO Production Line did not meet, as identified in the 7 November 2016 List.

</div> This requirement was not met because of “the lack of precision in the manufacture of the drive rollers themselves, the drive rollers cannot be adjusted precisely and the tension control system is not perfect, resulting in obvious wrinkling of the film when winding, which does not meet the production requirements”.

</div> Evidently, this technical requirement related to the <span class="font-italic">operation</span> of the FO Production Line. To assess whether this technical requirement was fulfilled, one would have to attempt winding, and to check whether the film produced wrinkles. Another example is that the temperature inside the oven was required to be uniform and not to fluctuate by more than one degree.

</div> Certainly, one could only determine that this was the case after turning on the oven, and testing it for some time. I do not see how one could determine that these problems existed simply by reference to the drawings. Dr Duan was clear that he had not done any testing at the pre-delivery inspection. Thus, when his update to Dr Wang is read in totality, he was <span class="font-italic">not</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>representing that all the technical requirements were met. He would have no way of knowing this until the equipment was tested. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 At best, he was representing to Dr Wang that there was nothing that could be gleaned from a simple comparison of the drawings and the FO Production Line that would suggest that the technical requirements were not met. Tritech has not adduced evidence to show that a comparison of the drawings and the state of the FO Production Line in May 2012 would have suggested that the technical requirements were not met. All that Tritech has is the testimony of Mr Gong that, when the FO Production Line was delivered in September 2012, it contained various external defects. The first issue is that this was some four months after Dr Duan’s pre-delivery inspection. The second issue is that these external defects were essentially scratches, dents, grease stains and corrosion.

</div> However, that does not mean that these external defects showed that the technical requirements were not met. It is Tritech’s case that Dr Duan would have been aware of many of these defects at the second pre-delivery inspection in May 2011, and Dr Duan could not have been honest when he notified Dr Wang by email that he had “checked every part from start to finish”. It was not, however, clear why, if there were so many defects that could not be rectified, Mr Gong, who photographed them, did not raise any alarm. Dr Duan’s case at trial was that these were caused by oil and dust at the Shanghai Dahe factory because of the delay in delivery that was caused by the tardy completion of the construction of Factory Three.

</div> While Dr Duan raised this for the first time at trial, the fact remains that there is no objective evidence as to the state of the products at the pre-delivery inspection, and the evidential onus on this issue is on Tritech.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Further, Dr Duan’s e-mail must be taken in the context of what he had said following his first pre-delivery inspection, which was three months prior. On 5 March 2012, shortly after he carried out his first pre-delivery inspection of the FO Production Line on 28 February 2012, he informed Dr Wang that “[b]asically, the equipment is manufactured according to the drawings we have discussed. The structure of the frame is relatively firm, and there should be no jerry-built ones.”

</div> This was a qualified statement. He said that the equipment <span class="font-italic">basically</span> had been built according to the drawings and that there <span class="font-italic">should </span>be no poorly built ones. That this statement was qualified is brought home by what Dr Duan said in the next line, which was that “[t]he structure of the membrane scraping machine is very complicated, and the actual situation is a bit beyond my expectations”.

</div> He then stated that “[t]he upper end of the device is fully covered with rollers and brackets.

</div> This was not a representation that the FO Production Line complied with Tritech’s technical requirements. It was clear to everyone at Tritech that the FO Production Line could not produce FO membranes. When the full list of technical defects was finally compiled and sent to Mr Gong on 7 November 2016, no one complained that they were caught by surprise. Dr Wang gave evidence that he decided to pursue the RO Production Line because “there were so many issues with the FO Production Line and there was little hope of them being rectified in a short period of time”.

</div> Thus, by 2014, Dr Wang was aware of serious problems with the FO Production Line. While Dr Wang may not have known the precise nature of the problems, it is clear that Tritech was not labouring under the misapprehension that the FO Production Line complied with <span class="font-italic">all</span> the technical requirements and could produce FO membranes. There was no misrepresentation of this sort from Dr Duan. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Was there a failure to exercise reasonable care and skill in the performance of his duties?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Tritech does not succeed on the misrepresentation claims.

For reasons that follow, I find that between 25 October 2013 and 7 November 2016, Dr Duan continued to “work” on a project that he knew was bound to fail, with his employer none the wiser. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Following installation at Factory Three in December 2012, Dr Duan began commissioning the FO Production Line in early 2013. Defects emerged which Dr Duan did not promptly disclose to Tritech. Instead, from 22 April 2013, he started communicating privately with Shanghai Dahe. Tritech’s premise for the claim concerning the FO Production Line was a discovery after these proceedings began that Dr Duan was constantly in private communication with Shanghai Dahe’s Mr Chen regarding serious defects with the FO Production Line that he concurrently hid from Mr Gong. Most of this correspondence was not copied to anyone else at Tritech. The first such e-mail was sent by Dr Duan to Mr Chen on 22 April 2013.

</div> On 16 August 2013, Dr Duan sent a list of defects (the "16 August 2013 List") arising from the August commissioning process. Many items were serious or basic, such as rust, motors that stopped suddenly, the absence of equipment manuals, mechanical or electrical drawings. Discussions took place between 16 August to 27 September 2013, with Mr Chen and technicians attending at the Factory Three. Tritech submits that Dr Duan did not involve Tritech in his communications with Mr Chen because he did not want the true state of the FO Production Line to come to light.

While some of the contents of the emails could reflect an employee trying to troubleshoot problems on his own, such as the initial 22 April 2013 email about installing an air knife, that was not Dr Duan’s explanation. When confronted with the question as to why he kept these emails private, Dr Duan’s response was that he did <span class="font-italic">not</span> keep defects secret from Tritech and that Mr Gong was aware of the problems with the FO Production Line because he regularly visited Factory Three.

</div> Tritech’s submission is that, in the 25 October 2013 List, Dr Duan whitewashed the defects in the FO Production Line.

Currently, there is a small amount of spilled grease, when the wear increases in the future, oil contamination will become a major problem and will lead to poor bearing lubrication. Is it possible to find an oil-free bearing alternative?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This description of the issue was quite different from reality. The true severity of the issue can be seen from Dr Duan’s private (and earlier) communications with Mr Chen regarding the same. On 26 July 2013, Dr Duan told Mr Chen that there was “oil leaking from another roller of the bearing inside the membrane scraping water tank … causing oil to remain on the surface of the water, which made it impossible … to scrape the membrane” and asked him to provide a solution as soon as possible.

If the oil leaks and there is no oil lubrication in the future, the bearings will wear out fast. After the oil seeps out, firstly, it cannot be guaranteed that the oil will float on the water surface. Secondly, the membrane at both ends of each water tank will come out of the water and pass through the pressure roller, where the oil will stick onto the surface of the membrane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Crucially, Dr Duan was explaining that the oil leak would lead to problems with the membranes themselves, in that oil would stick to their surface. This echoed what he had said on 26 July 2013 about the impossibility of “scraping” the membranes. Dr Duan accepted during cross-examination that this was unacceptable and the issue of the oil leaks from the bearings was a serious problem.

</div> There is a failure to explain, however, how this became obvious to him only in May 2016, and why he still tarried thereafter until Mr Gong prompted him in November 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The inference to be drawn from the above is that, between 22 April and 25 October 2013, Dr Duan formed the view that the FO Production Line that had been supplied by Shanghai Dahe was not viable. It was for this reason that he started a long chain of private communication with Mr Chen. While he was still taking steps to rectify issues, his concealment of serious defects from Tritech reflected a growing certainty that the FO Production Line was not viable. On 25 October 2013, he updated Mr Gong with a list that was not accurate. If Dr Duan were exercising reasonable care, he would have at the minimum kept Mr Gong properly informed through that list.  Instead, he gave Tritech the impression that the issues with the FO Production Line could be resolved, and that there was a chance that the commissioning process would eventually be successful. This allowed him to continue working on the FO Production Line project for another three years, until he finally gave the full picture to Tritech on 7 November 2016. Dr Duan’s conduct amounted to a failure to perform his duties as the engineer in charge of the FO Production Line project with reasonable diligence, skill and care. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The assessment of damages arising from his failure to discharge his duty to exercise reasonable care and skill should therefore start from 25 October 2013. Tritech has sought to impose liability from the time that Shanghai Dahe was chosen. There is, nonetheless, insufficient evidence that Dr Duan was not taking reasonable care up to that point. It is not disputed that there was, at the time that Dr Duan commenced work with Tritech, no known FO production line producer in China, and the only known producer in the world was a company based in the US.

</div> This aspect of the need for cutting edge innovation was not disputed. From Dr Wang’s point of view, he was taking a reasonable risk, because the NUS laboratory-scale production line worked; Dr Duan was the person responsible for that pilot; and he was able to task the same person to commercialise the pilot.

</div> This was consistent with Dr Wang’s assumption throughout, despite the lack of success of the FO or RO Production Lines, that Dr Duan was indeed trying his level best. It was only after the private communication with Mr Chen emerged showing Dr Duan’s state of mind, and subsequent events such as the bribery conviction, that Dr Wang suspected a different set of circumstances.

</div> On a related note, the bribery conviction described at [21] above was not Dr Duan’s only bribery conviction. There was another conviction involving a bribe from a vendor, Qingdao Danjia, where the PRC Criminal Court found that Dr Duan had received a kickback of RMB 100,000 on 26 January 2017. In 2016, Dr Duan had recommended Qingdao Danjia to TEG, and TEG had entered into three contracts with them. With the benefit of hindsight, Dr Wang was suspicious that, similarly, a bribe from Shanghai Dahe may have resulted in its selection. This is plausible. It is equally plausible, however, that the kickbacks, if any, started in the 22 April to 25 October 2013 period, rather than at the outset of Shanghai Dahe’s selection. Dr Wang relies on incidents after 25 October 2013 when explaining his suspicions:

</div> I am sceptical that the NUS laboratory version was produced by hand. This deception on Dr Duan’s part would have been difficult in the light of the NUS supervision and specific oversight of Prof Ng. The formula that was said to have been used in the NUS laboratory production line was also verified by NUS and the subject of an exclusive licence agreement between Tritech and NUS. Because this contention was not pleaded, Tritech had no opportunity to address the allegation. Nor was it put to Tritech’s witnesses in cross-examination. I accept Dr Wang’s evidence that he was told the NUS laboratory-scale version was a working production line that possessed potential to be built on a commercial-scale; in his words, a “complete prototype” to “size-up, or commercialise”.

Nevertheless, Dr Duan was the Director of Factory Three. His role would have given him a measure of discretion in exercising his responsibility. While Mr Gong criticised some measures taken by Dr Duan as “stopgap”, such as a 28 June 2013 suggestion to use a vacuum pump, there was no expert evidence on the specific ad-hoc measures that Dr Duan employed to rectify issues as they arose. Dr Duan was expected to resolve issues on the ground and did not need to report every issue to management.

Dr Wang’s assumption was that Dr Duan had conducted a proper inspection, which cross-examination has shown Dr Duan wholly failed to do.

A reasonable employee in Dr Duan’s position would have been well aware of the risk that the MR Machines would also be non-functional. Despite this, Dr Duan chose to conduct the peremptory inspection that he did and thereafter to send the 18 December E-mail. While I have found that, strictly speaking, this e-mail was not factually inaccurate, it certainly conveyed the impression that the MR Machines were acceptable.

</div> Mr Gong’s evidence is that in 2018, in anticipation of litigation with Zhejiang Shengshi, he discovered that the funds in Zhejiang Shengshi’s bank account were almost zero, Zhejiang Shengshi did not own any land, and its factory premises were leased. Further, its factory was an old simple steel structure workshop that was unsuitable for manufacturing production line equipment such as the RO Production Line. The processing equipment there was also very simple. This was the factory that Dr Duan had visited twice: once before the contract with Zhejiang Shengshi was signed, and once more for the pre-delivery inspection.

</div> Thus, this sets the RO Production Line apart from the FO Production Line. I accept that when Dr Duan visited Zhejiang Shengshi’s premises, he would have become aware that it was not going to be able to supply a viable RO Production Line. This means that, in July 2014, he misrepresented to Dr Wang that Zhejiang Shengshi had the capacity to design, manufacture and install a production line to produce RO Membranes on a commercial scale.

In his e-mail dated 1 December 2014 to Dr Wang, Dr Duan confirmed that the “appearance and structure [of the water tank and drying tank] comply with the requirements described in the Contract.”

</div> Nonetheless, like in his e-mail after the FO Production Line pre-delivery inspection, Dr Duan explained that he had not been able to test the machinery and that there were some issues with it. On the whole, I find that this amounted to a representation by Dr Duan that the water and drying tank of the RO Production Line complied with the contractual requirements. The only qualification to this was that he was unable to check if the correct material was used. As became evident once Dr Duan left Tritech, the water and drying tank did <span class="font-italic">not</span> meet the specifications in the contract – specifically, the thickness of the water tank was 2.75mm rather than the stipulated 4mm and the tank could deform under force.

</div> However, in his e-mail, he made a clear statement that the “structure” of the water tank complied with specifications. A reasonable interpretation of this statement was that “structure” would include the thickness of the walls. He did not expressly qualify his statement by saying that he was unable to check the thickness of the water tank, nor would this qualification be apparent from the rest of this e-mail. When Dr Duan represented that the water tank met the contractual requirements, he thus represented that the thickness of the water tank walls was 4mm. This was not true. Further, it is telling that, in this suit, Dr Duan does not even attempt to justify his statement by highlighting the contractual specifications that he checked and found the RO Production Line to comply with. Dr Duan’s defence was that he was not in charge of the RO Production Line, that he “worked under [Wang Bo]” in the context of the RO Production Line and was his “assistant”.

</div> This was a repetition of a similarly absurd assertion made in the context of the FO Production Line.

However, I find that he did not care whether it was true or false. In my view, it is telling that Dr Duan specifically attended the pre-delivery inspection alone despite the suggestion from Mr Wang Bo to bring an electrical engineer along because the equipment “has electrical and mechanical processing”.

</div> Having seen what he had seen on his first inspection, Dr Duan knew that he could not bring an electrical engineer in the light of the report he would thereafter make. This is confirmed by the fact that Dr Duan’s report after the pre-delivery inspection was indeed inaccurate. He was not concerned with the truth of his report, but simply with securing Tritech’s acceptance of the RO Production Line.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Tritech also highlights that Dr Duan hid the defects in the RO Production Line from it for a significant period of time. Despite commissioning beginning in January 2015, he only made known some of the serious defects more than a year later in April 2016. After that, he falsely assured Dr Wang that “trial production was smooth” and that the RO Production Line was in a “relatively stable state” despite the fact that the RO Production Line was not producing membranes of good quality.

</div> I do not accept this new explanation. It wholly contradicts the 18 August 2016 e-mail, which makes no reference to a formula or Mr He. It also contradicts the PRC Criminal Court judgment, which reflects agreed facts that the RMB400,000 was paid for “technical support”. This reflects that Dr Wang approved the payment of RMB400,000 for consultancy services for Tritech. It is not disputed that the transaction involved a significant secret commission for himself. Dr Duan’s lawyer stated at trial that Dr Duan was in principle prepared to return the RMB149,000 commission.

</div> This rendered his use of the RMB400,000 a breach of his duty of good faith and fidelity. It was dishonest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Thus, Dr Duan used Tritech’s RMB400,000 for an unauthorised purpose. But for Dr Duan’s misappropriation, Tritech would still have this sum. There is no evidence that Tritech obtained anything of value in return for this RMB400,000 spent by Dr Duan. Consequently, Dr Duan’s breach of the implied term in his employment contract caused loss to Tritech amounting to RMB400,000.

Photographs taken at the evidence preservation process in Dreamem’s factory showed similarities between the production line at Factory One and Dreamem.

The defendants called as an expert witness Dr Yang Xinhao (“Dr Yang”).

He did not conduct any tests, and the test reports (from an unknown third party source) enclosed within his affidavit are not self-explanatory.

Under the O 40A r 3 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed), there are various requirements that an expert report must fulfil. These requirements include providing details of any literature or other material which the expert has relied on in making the report, and, crucially, confirming that the expert recognises that his duty is <span class="font-italic">to the court</span>, and that he complies with that duty. Dr Yang’s expert report is lacking on both these points. When it was put to Dr Yang that he is required to give details of the literature he relied on, he responded that he was “not obliged to support evidences” and he “can give [his] contribution according to [his] professional knowledge in these membrane products”.

</div> While an expert report could be premised on stipulated facts furnished by his instructions, the purpose of an expert would be to assess the conclusions to be drawn from those facts, and not to merely repeat them. Dr Yang’s evidence was therefore entirely unhelpful. The defendants do not attempt to explain Dr Yang’s performance on the stand in their closing submissions. Instead they state that Dr Yang “attested that the manufacturer or producer can commence business operation to manufacture membrane product within a short period of time if the said manufacturer or producer can buy the formula and production machines from a third party.”

</div> I have rejected Mr Luo’s explanation that he asked for these documents and sent them to his personal e-mail address for Tritech work-related reasons. His taking of these documents therefore remains completely unexplained.

</div> Mr Luo was clearly involved in Dreamem even before he was dismissed by Tritech; he was the one who liaised with Ms Guo during the trap purchase.

In addition, when viewed holistically, the defendants’ case lacks logical coherence. The assertion that Dreamem's products were wholly different from Tritech's was inconsistent with the argument that they were able to manufacture products similar to Tritech’s through the purchase of production line information and formula from third parties. At the same time, no attempt was made to render these two arguments consistent with the assertion that the products sold in the trap purchase were procured from yet another third party. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Wrongful gain; wrongful loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Tritech frames its case as being one involving both the wrongful loss interest and the wrongful gain interest.
