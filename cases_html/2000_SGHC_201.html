<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Grounds of Judgment</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. This appeal from the decision of an

assistant registrar on assessment of damages for personal injuries suffered by the

plaintiff raises a point as to loss of amenities as an item of loss or damage. For general

damages the assistant registrar allowed $80,000 for loss of amenities. I allowed the

appeal. I allowed $21,500 and varied the award accordingly. The plaintiff has given notice

of appeal by leave granted by the Court of Appeal and these are my written grounds.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. The assistant registrar has helpfully

given reasons for the award in her note of the proceedings before her. She said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"General Damages:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Loss of amenities - $80,000.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Notwithstanding that plaintiff is now in

    persistent vegetative state, the case authorities show that an award can still be made for

    loss of amenities, as opposed to for pain and suffering (see, <i>inter alia, Lim v Camden

    AHA</i>). I have however taken into account plaintiff’s age in deciding on the amount

    which should be awarded under this head (<i>NutBrown v Sheffield HA</i>)."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Other than for the cost of future care no

other amount was allowed for general damages. She also allowed other sums for special

damages making a total of $215,803.47 and awarded the plaintiff half of that in terms of

the judgment. This appeal concerns only the item of loss of amenities and the resulting

interest.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. The plaintiff was knocked down by a

motor cycle driven by the defendant on 24 September 1996. She was then about 67 years of

age. She was brought to the Singapore General Hospital and admitted the same day. The

medical report dated 13 November 1997 states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Examination on admission showed that</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">1) She was drowsy with a Glasgow Coma

  Scale of 10 (E<sub>2</sub> V<sub>3</sub> M<sub>5</sub>). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">2) The pupils were equal and reactive.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">3) Her blood pressure was 182/84 mmHg.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">4) There was a small occipital scalp

  laceration.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">5) She was able to move all limbs.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">6) An urgent CT brain scan showed a left

  frontal brain contusion with fronto-temporo-parietal acute subdural hematoma.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">7) Cervical spine X-rays showed no

  fracture.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">8) Chest X-rays showed no fracture.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">She underwent an immediate craniectomy and

  evacuation of the acute subdural hematoma."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The plaintiff subsequently underwent a

number of other surgical procedures and medical treatment.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. A score of 9 to 12 on the Glasgow Coma

Scale indicates moderate brain injury as opposed to severe brain injury indicated by a

score of 8 or less and mild brain injury indicated by a score of 13 to 15. "E<sub>2</sub>"

means eyes opening on pain stimulation, "V<sub>3</sub>" means verbal response

which can be understood by the examiner but is inappropriate to the questions asked and

"M<sub>5</sub>" means the patient localises pain or knows where the pain is

inflicted. The plaintiff’s condition would have deteriorated until the operation was

carried out.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. The medical evidence was that from the

time of the first operation which was carried out immediately on the day of admission the

plaintiff was unable to respond to visual and verbal stimulation. She could respond to

pain but was not aware of it. As a result of the injury sustained she had a reduced life

expectancy of two to five years and while she might live beyond five years she would not

live 10 years. As the assistant registrar found the plaintiff was in a persistent

vegetative state.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. The defendant brings this appeal on the

basis that the plaintiff was unconscious from the day of the accident and that general

damages should not be allowed for pain and suffering and for loss of amenities of life or

alternatively that only a "small sum" should be allowed. Mr Low suggested

$6,000. He referred to <i>Low Yoke Ying &amp; Anor v Sim Kok Lee &amp; Ors</i> <nobr>[1990] SLR 1258</nobr> and <i>Sim Hau Yan v Ong Sio Beng &amp; Anor </i>(Unreported. Judgment of Goh Joon

Seng J dated 6 November 1996 in Suit No 511 of 1996).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. In <i>Low Yoke Ying</i> the plaintiffs

as administrators of the estate of the deceased brought the action for the benefit of the

estate and the dependants. The deceased was involved in a collision between the car he was

driving and a lorry driven by the first defendant. He was pronounced dead an hour later

and there was no evidence that he was conscious in that time. No award was made <i>for

pain and suffering</i>. <i>Sim Hau Yan</i> was also an action brought for the benefit of

the estate and the dependants. The deceased was knocked down by a van driven by the first

defendant and died three days later. The court found that he was unconscious in that time

and made no award <i>for pain and suffering</i>. Both cases were not concerned with

damages <i>for loss of amenities</i> and I do not think they are of any particular

assistance to the defendant in this case.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. Mr Kang said that $80,000 was allowed

for the injuries as well but from the learned assistant registrar’s note it is clear

that it was for loss of amenities but I accept that loss of amenities can also result from

injuries other than the brain injury. I was referred to <i>Toon Chee Meng Eddie v Yeap

Chin Hon</i> <nobr>[1993] 2 SLR 536</nobr>, <i>Ng Song Leng v Soh Kim Seng Engineering &amp; Trading

Pte Ltd &amp; Ors</i> (Unreported. Judgment of Lai Kew Chai J dated 6 November 1997 in

Suit No 1760 of 1994) and <i>Ahmad Daman Huri</i> <i>bin Hussein v Koo Chin Yau</i> <nobr>[1990] 3 MLJ 53</nobr>. It was submitted that $80,000 for loss of amenities was not excessive. I was

also referred to <i>H West &amp; Son</i> <i>Ltd &amp; Anor v Shephard</i> [1964] AC 326. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. Damages which are awarded for a

wrongful act are those "which, so far as money can compensate, will give the injured

party reparation for the wrongful act and for all the natural and direct consequences of

the wrongful act". See <i>Admiralty Commissioners v S.S. Susquehanna</i> [1926] AC

655 at p 661. In <i>H West &amp; Son Ltd &amp; Anor v Shephard</i> Lord Morris of

Borth-y-Gest said at p 349:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"If someone has been caused pain then

  damages to compensate for the enduring of it may be awarded. If, however, by reason of an

  injury someone is made unconscious either for a short or for a prolonged period with the

  result that he does not feel pain then he needs no monetary compensation in respect of

  pain because he will not have suffered it."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">He will endure no pain and there will be

no suffering on account of the pain. In such cases no award will be made for pain and

suffering.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. In that case the plaintiff who was 41

years of age was knocked down by a lorry driven by the second defendant. She sustained

severe head injuries resulting in cerebral atrophy and paralysis of all four limbs. In the

action for damages the trial judge awarded 17,500 for general damages. In arriving at

this sum the judge referred to the award of 15,000 in <i>Wise v Kaye &amp; Anor </i>[1962] 1 QB 638 (where the plaintiff remained in an unconscious state) and considered that the

present plaintiff’s case was worse since she must have some knowledge of her

condition; he also took into account the fact that she might die within five years. The

Court of Appeal held that there was no error in the assessment and dismissed the appeal.

The defendants appealed to the House of Lords. Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest went on to say

at p 349:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Apart from actual physical pain it

  may often be that some physical injury causes distress or fear or anxiety. If, for

  example, injuries include the loss of a leg there may be much physical suffering, there

  will be the actual loss of the leg (a loss the gravity of which will depend upon the

  particular circumstances of the particular case) and there may be (depending upon

  particular circumstances) elements of consequential worry and anxiety. One part of the

  affliction (again depending upon particular circumstances) may be an inevitable and

  constant awareness of the deprivations which the loss of the leg entails ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The fact of unconsciousness is therefore

  relevant in respect of and will eliminate those heads or elements of damage which can only

  exist by being felt or thought or experienced. The fact of unconsciousness does not,

  however, eliminate the actuality of the deprivations of the ordinary experiences and

  amenities of life which may be the inevitable result of some physical injury."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Turning to the case before the House His

Lordship said at p 351:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Accepting the estimate as to the

  plaintiff’s expectation of life, damages were to be given to cover a period of over

  seven years. At the age of 41 everything that life held for her was taken away from her.

  For a period of about seven years instead of having life’s activities and amenities

  she will have mere existence but little else, save that, to the extent that I have

  described, she may have the torment of a realisation of her helplessness. If in some

  degree she has processes of thought she has the agony and frustration of being unable to

  convey her thoughts or to give them expression. All these matters constitute grave and

  sombre deprivations for which in my view she is entitled to receive substantial

  compensation."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">While the fact of unconsciousness will not

eliminate the actuality of the deprivations of the amenities of life it is, with respect,

difficult to see that the loss or damage suffered by the plaintiff as a result of these

deprivations will not to a great extent be affected by the fact of unconsciousness. And it

does appear that some of the matters which were taken into account and which constituted

grave and sombre deprivations can only exist by being felt or thought or experienced.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. In the same case Lord Devlin said at p

354:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"This deprivation may bring with it

  three consequences. First, it may result in loss of earnings and they can be calculated.

  Secondly, it may put the victim to expense in that he has to pay others for doing what he

  formerly did for himself; and that also can be calculated. Thirdly, it produces loss of

  enjoyment, loss of amenities as it is sometimes called, a diminution in the full pleasure

  of living. This is incalculable and at large. This deprivation with its three consequences

  is something that is personal to the victim ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">What has to be considered in the present

  case is the method of compensation for the third of these consequences, loss of enjoyment

  or pleasure …. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">There are two ways in which this loss of

  enjoyment can be considered. It can be said that from beginning to end it is really all

  mental suffering. Loss of enjoyment is experienced in the mind and nowhere else. It may

  start with acute distress at the inability to use a limb in games or exercise as before or

  just in getting about, and may end with a nagging sense of frustration. If this is the

  true view, then total unconsciousness as in <i>Wise v Kaye</i> relieves all mental

  suffering and nothing can be recovered for a deprivation which is not being experienced.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The other way to look upon the deprivation

  of a limb is as the loss of a personal asset, something in the nature of property. A limb

  can be put both to profitable use and to pleasurable use. In so far as it is put to

  profitable use, the loss is compensated for by calculating loss of earnings and not by

  assessing mental pain. On the same principle, it can be said, a sum must be assessed for

  loss of pleasurable use irrespective of whether there is mental suffering or not ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">My Lords, as might be expected, English

  law has not come down firmly in favour of either of these two ways to the exclusion of the

  other. It favours a compound of both, as was agreed in argument and as I shall show later

  by reference to the authorities. The elements to be compounded have been called the

  objective and the subjective. The loss of property element is objective; it requires some

  sort of valuation that is in no way dependent on the victim’s sense of loss. The

  other element is subjective because it depends entirely on mental suffering actually

  experienced. Is the main - or at least a very substantial – element in the compound

  the objective so that an evaluation must be made of it with an addition for mental

  suffering when proved? Or is the main element mental suffering laid upon an objective

  bedrock, so that some sum is always recoverable even where there is no mental suffering at

  all?"</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Lord Devlin considered the authorities and

said at p 362:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"I think that deprivation should be

  measured mainly, if not wholly, by the sense of loss."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. By a slim majority the House of Lords

(Lord Reid and Lord Devlin dissenting) dismissed the appeal. Lord Tucker agreed with Lord

Morris of Borth-y-Gest. Lord Pearce said at p 368:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The loss of happiness of the

  individual plaintiffs is not, in my opinion, a practicable or correct guide to reasonable

  compensation in cases of personal injury to a living plaintiff."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">And at p 369:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"I venture to think that an

  alteration of the current principles of assessing damages for personal injury would be an

  embarrassment to a practice which in spite of its difficulties does in the main produce a

  just result."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">He agreed that the appeal should be

dismissed. Lord Reid said at p 341:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"… I would think that

  compensation should be based much less on the nature of the injuries than on the extent of

  the injured man’s consequential difficulties in his daily life ….</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">If that is so, then I think it must follow

  that if a man’s injuries make him wholly unconscious so that he suffers none of these

  daily frustrations or inconveniences, he ought to get less than the man who is every day

  acutely conscious of what he suffers and what he has lost."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. In <i>Wise v Kaye &amp; Anor </i>the

plaintiff then a 20 year old woman suffered serious brain injuries in a car accident

caused by the negligence of the defendants. She became unconscious and there was no

prospect of recovery. The court awarded 15,000 for general damages. The Court of Appeal

(Sellers and Upjohn LJJ, Diplock LJ dissenting) held that general damages must be assessed

on an objective basis and should be in the nature of compensation for the injury suffered

so far as money was appropriate. Sellers LJ said at p 654:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"It was further submitted that

  because the plaintiff has been throughout unconscious and has so far no knowledge of her

  condition and, as far as can be foreseen, never will have any knowledge of the wreck that

  she is, no damages or very limited damages should be awarded. In these circumstances there

  is no room for an award for pain and suffering but otherwise I regard it as an untenable

  submission." </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Diplock LJ said at p 668: "that

consciousness of deprivation is, if not the sole at least a major causative factor in the

unhappiness resulting from a disabling injury".</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. The decision in <i>H West &amp; Son

Ltd &amp; Anor v Shephard</i> has not been well received by at least one well known

textbook writer. <i>McGregor On Damages</i> (16th Ed, 1997) states at para 1709:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"This decision of the House of Lords

  is one which is to be regretted, and the hope was expressed in the 13th edition of this

  work that the House would one day be prepared to adopt the approach taken by Lord Reid and

  Lord Devlin in their cogent dissents, and perhaps even to return to the pre-1950 position

  by discarding loss of amenities of life not indeed as an element – and a most

  important element – of loss but as a separate head of damage. But that such a day is

  unlikely to come is attested to by the House’s refusal in <i>Lim Poh Choo v Camden

  and Islington Area</i> <i>Health Authority</i> [1980] AC 174 to depart from <i>West v

  Shephard</i>. Lord Scarman, in a speech with which the other members of the House agreed,

  considered that any reversal of <i>West v Shephard</i> would, in the first place,

  ‘cause widespread injustice’ since both settlements and judicial awards had

  proceeded for nearly 20 years on the basis of the decision, and, in the second place,

  ‘should be done not judicially but legislatively within the context of a

  comprehensive enactment dealing with all aspects of damages for personal

  injury’."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">See at p 189. Earlier at p 188 Lord

Scarman said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The effect of the two cases (<i>Wise

  v Kaye</i> being specifically approved in <i>H West &amp; Son Ltd v Shephard</i>) is

  two-fold. First, they draw a clear distinction between damages for pain and suffering and

  damages for loss of amenities. The former depend upon the plaintiff’s personal

  awareness of pain, her capacity for suffering. But the latter are awarded for the fact of

  deprivation – a substantial loss, whether the plaintiff is aware of it or not."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">With respect I think this sets out

succinctly the position in England but so far as I am aware this position has not been

adopted in Singapore.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. In <i>Skelton v Collins</i> (1966) 115

CLR 94 the plaintiff suffered multiple injuries including severe injury to the brain which

left him totally unconscious. The High Court of Australia (Kitto, Taylor, Windeyer and

Owen JJ, Menzies J dissenting) held that in assessing damages for loss of amenities to a

plaintiff who had been rendered permanently unconscious regard must be had to the fact

that he was insensible of his deprivation. <i>Wise v Kaye &amp; Anor</i> and <i>H West

&amp;</i> <i>Son Ltd &amp; Anor v Shephard</i> were not followed. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. Kitto J referred to the speech of Lord

Morris of Borth-y-Gest and said at p 103:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"… in relation both to death and

  to unconsciousness surely it is true that what ought to affect the quantum of damages is

  not the actuality of the deprivations but their value: what would ‘the ordinary

  experiences and amenities of life’ (in the future) have added up to, if the plaintiff

  had not been cut off from them? The trouble is not just that the assessment of

  compensation is difficult; it is that there is simply no way of forming any reliable idea,

  any ‘confident estimate’, as to what the thing would have been like for which

  the compensation is to be assessed; and therefore an award so substantial as necessarily

  to imply that the judge (or jury) has in fact formed such an idea must be

  unsupportable."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Taylor J said at p 113:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"The expression ‘loss of the

  amenities of life’ is a loose expression but as a head of damages in personal injury

  cases it is intended to denote a loss of the capacity of the injured person <i>consciously</i>

  to enjoy life to the full as, apart from his injury, he might have done."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Menzies J in his dissenting judgment said

at p 124:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Loss of capacity – total or

  partial, permanent or temporary – to live the life that could otherwise have been

  lived is, apart from damages for pain and suffering, the fundamental loss for which

  general damages for personal injury are awarded. <i>It is from this</i> <i>loss that other

  losses stem</i> (Italics added)."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">I think the "other losses" would

have included the awareness of the loss of capacity and the resulting frustration,

distress and suffering. The task of the court is then to find the relationship or balance

between the loss of capacity – the objective element – and the other losses

– the subjective element.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. The plaintiff in the case before me

has been reduced to a "persistent vegetative state". I have read the medical

evidence and I have seen the photographs. There were photographs of her with her family

taken before she was knocked down by the defendant and there were photographs taken after.

They can only tell part of the horror that the accident has caused in the life of this

lady and in the lives of members of her family who daily have to attend to her and to see

the wreck that has become of her. When the medical expert examined her on 11 May 1999 she

was not aware of her surrounding, she could not speak and occasionally she could only

respond to her relatives by staring blankly at them. She was not aware of pain. Her life

expectancy has been reduced to two to five years. What damages so far as money can

compensate will give this 67 year old lady – not her family or anyone else –

reparation for the wrongful act of the defendant?</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. I think loss of amenities as a head of

damages means loss of the capacity to enjoy the amenities of life. The injured person has

been deprived of the means of enjoying life to the full that he would be able to but for

the injury or deprivation. With respect I agree with Lord Devlin in <i>H West &amp; Son

Ltd &amp; Anor v Shephard</i> that in assessing damages under this head both the objective

and the subjective elements must be considered and that deprivation should be measured

mainly by the sense of loss. Where as in this case the injured person is unaware of the

loss and is spared the frustration, distress and suffering resulting from an awareness of

the loss damages should only be moderate and conventional.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. The assistant registrar has allowed

$80,000 for loss of amenities in this case. I think she has proceeded on a wrong principle

and assessed this head of damages without any or sufficient regard for the fact that the

plaintiff is unaware of the deprivation. In my judgment loss of amenities should be seen

as a mix of the objective element – the loss of the means to enjoy life as fully as

the plaintiff could but for the injuries sustained – and the subjective element

– the sense of frustration, distress and suffering.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. If the victim dies as a result of the

injuries received and is not only reduced to the human wreck as the plaintiff has been an

award used to be made for loss of expectation of life. Death deprives the victim of

everything including the capacity to enjoy life. The deprivation is total. A conventional

award of about $5,000 used to be made for loss of expectation of life. Since 1987 an

action for damages for a wrongful act causing death may include a claim for damages for

bereavement but such a claim can only be made for the benefit of a class of persons who

survive the victim. Such damages are fixed at $10,000. Mr Low suggested that the

conventional sum for loss of amenities should be $6,000 following the sum arrived at in <i>Skelton

v</i> <i>Collins</i>. I cannot agree with that. I think such a sum should not be less than

$10,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. In <i>Toon Chee Meng Eddie v Yeap Chin

Hon</i> $160,000 was awarded for pain and suffering and for loss of amenities but without

apportionment between the two heads. The plaintiff was a young boy of about 7 when the

injuries were inflicted on him including injury to the brain. With the best nursing care

he could be expected to live up to 40. The evidence of the neurologist adduced by the

plaintiff was:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"[The plaintiff’s] functional

  level is similar to a six-month to one-year-old child. It is my professional opinion that

  he can feel the emotions of joy, anger, frustration and happiness – mainly in

  response to bodily needs and their satisfaction but also to a minor degree in human

  interaction with his mother. I do not think he is able to fully appreciate the extent of

  his injuries and disability. This is in part due to the severity and extent of these

  injuries but also in part due to the young age at which he suffered these injuries."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Although much of what the neurologist said

was not specifically referred to by the learned judge in his summary of the

plaintiff’s disabilities I think the subjective element over the remainder of his

life expectancy of 40 years was a substantial factor that was taken into consideration.

There was no appeal to the Court of Appeal as regards damages for pain and suffering and

for loss of amenities.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22. In <i>Peh Diana &amp; Anor v Tan Miang

Lee</i> <nobr>[1991] SLR 341</nobr> the plaintiff suffered brain injury in a road accident. She was

then a 14 year old girl. Her residual disabilities included intellectual impairment to the

extent of borderline mental retardation, personality change with a tendency to be

aggressive and a slight slurring in her speech. Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) said at p

347:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Considering the precedents referred

  to above, in my judgment, the appropriate compensation payable to the first plaintiff for

  the head injury and the consequential disabilities that resulted therefrom, and taking

  into account inflation, should not exceed $70,000."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The precedents referred to have been

conveniently summarised in the judgment. With the exception of $160,000 in <i>Toon Chee

Meng Eddie </i>$45,000 to $100,000 have been awarded for pain and suffering and for loss

of amenities without apportionment in brain injury cases. See at pp 346, 347. In all these

cases the injured party was and would have been aware of the state he or she was in for

the remainder of his or her life.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23. Taking $70,000 as a starting point I

would think that a substantial part would have been for pain and suffering and for the

subjective element in loss of amenities. I have to do the best I can to find a sum that

would represent the objective element. It cannot be less than $10,000. It cannot be as

much as $70,000 as that would include pain and suffering and the subjective element. In

the circumstances of this case I would disregard the plaintiff’s age and her life

expectancy as she has no awareness of the loss. They are relevant as regards other heads

of damages for which sums have been awarded and which are not concerned in this appeal and

they would also be relevant in assessing damages for pain and suffering and the subjective

element in loss of amenities. On the whole I think $20,000 would be appropriate. There

were other minor injuries and there has been a loss of consciousness which have

contributed to the loss of amenities with some measure of overlap and for all of these I

would allow another $1,500. In my judgment the damages for loss of amenities should be

reduced to $21,500 and I accordingly allowed the appeal.</font></p>
