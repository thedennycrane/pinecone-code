Similarly, having been appointed receiver for the assets of Harjani, Ewe was able to transfer Harjani’s assets into a bank account for which he was an authorised signatory. Upon being engaged to manage the bank account of TPI Singapore Branch, Ewe was made an authorised signatory of the bank account. Even though two signatories were required to make any transfers from the bank account, Ewe stated that he had asked Morii to pre-sign cheques and transfer forms, which therefore allowed Ewe to unilaterally make transfers. Ewe therefore had dominion over the moneys in TPI Singapore Branch’s bank account. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Ewe had dishonestly misappropriated the moneys which he was entrusted with dominion over</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 It is also clear from the SOAF that Ewe had dishonestly misappropriated the moneys which he was entrusted with. The SOAF repeatedly states that Ewe had used the moneys that he had been entrusted with to gamble, to repay his own gambling debts, or to reinstate the amounts that he had removed from other companies’ accounts previously. It is also stated in the SOAF that none of the amounts which were taken from each company were used to pay the expenses of that particular company. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Ewe was entrusted with the moneys in the way of his business as a professional agent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The sole element of the offence that is in dispute is whether Ewe had been entrusted with the moneys which he dishonestly misappropriated <span class="font-italic">in the way of his business as an agent</span> within the meaning of s 409 of the Code. In my view, the manner in which Ewe was entrusted with the moneys in his various roles as liquidator, receiver and manager for the bank accounts of TPI Singapore Branch, represents the quintessential case of an individual who has been entrusted with moneys in the way of his business as a professional agent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The scope and definition of the phrase “in the way of his business as … an agent” in s 409 of the Code was recently considered by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and others </span>[2018] 1 SLR 659 (“<span class="font-italic">Lam Leng Hung</span>”). The Court of Appeal concluded at [286] that both the text and context of s 409 indicate that “in the way of his business as a banker, a merchant, a factor, a broker, an attorney or an agent” only encompasses persons who are entrusted with property or dominion over it in the course of the commercial activities of their trusted trades or professions – including those who are in the business of agency (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, professional agents). The Court of Appeal further defined a professional agent as “a person who offers, as his trade, profession or business, agency services to interested clients in return for remuneration” (at [126]) or “one who professes to offer his agency services to the community at large and from which he makes his living” (at [285]). Therefore, in order to make out this element of the offence under s 409 of the Code, the Prosecution would have to prove (a) that Ewe’s various roles as liquidator, receiver, and manager for the bank account of TPI Singapore Branch were those of a “professional agent”, and (b) that he had been entrusted with the moneys in the course of his business as a professional agent.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Ewe’s various roles can be regarded as those of a professional agent</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In my view, Ewe’s roles as liquidator for the 21 companies, receiver for the assets of Harjani, and manager of the bank accounts of TPI Singapore Branch all fall squarely within the meaning of a professional agent as defined in <span class="font-italic">Lam Leng Hung</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Based on the definition provided by the Court of Appeal, there appear to be three requirements that have to be fulfilled for an individual to be regarded as a professional agent:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The individual offers <span class="font-italic">agency services</span>;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The individual offers the said services to the <span class="font-italic">community at large</span>; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The individual <span class="font-italic">receives remuneration</span> for the said services.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In this regard, I note the Defence’s argument that an “agent” within the meaning of s 409 of the Code only refers to agents that are similar to insurance agents or property agents. Therefore, given that Ewe was at all material times practicing as a CPA, he did not practice as a professional agent nor did he make himself out to be one (see above at [34]). With respect, this argument is untenable. The definition of a “professional agent” as stated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lam Leng Hung</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is not restricted only to agents that are similar to insurance agents or property agents. In my view, as long as the three requirements set out at [45] above are met, an individual would be regarded as a professional agent even if the other aspects of his duties are dissimilar to that of an insurance agent or property agent. Further, while it is true that Ewe had been practicing as a CPA at all material times, the Defence neglects to mention that Ewe had also been practicing as a liquidator, receiver, and manager for the bank accounts of TPI. Indeed, it is the Prosecution’s case that Ewe was operating as a professional agent in his various roles as liquidator, receiver, and manager for the bank account of TPI, which I now turn to consider.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Whether Ewe had provided <span class="font-italic">agency services</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In his roles as liquidator, receiver, and manager for the bank account, Ewe had provided the 21 companies, Merrill Lynch, and TPI Singapore Branch respectively with agency services. In <span class="font-italic">Ong Han Ling and another v American International Assurance Co Ltd and others</span> [2018] 5 SLR 549, it was stated at [214] that “[t]he classic definition of an agent is one authorised to create contractual relations with third parties on behalf of the principal.” Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Then Khek Koon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other suits</span> [2014] 1 SLR 245, the court stated at [113] that “the irreducible core of any principal/agent relationship is a principal who consensually confers actual, implied or ostensible authority upon the agent and an agent who has the ability, by acting within the scope of his authority, unilaterally to engage the principal’s civil liability.”</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As liquidator of the 21 companies, Ewe was conferred with actual authority to create contractual relations with third parties on behalf of these companies, thereby making him an agent of these companies. It is settled law that once a company is in liquidation, the board of directors is effectively <span class="font-italic">functus officio </span>and the power to run the company vests with the liquidator: see <span class="font-italic">Walter Woon on Company Law</span> (Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Revised 3rd Ed, 2009) at para 17.134. Indeed, as stated in the SOAF, Ewe’s main responsibilities as a liquidator were to investigate into the affairs and assets of the companies, recover and realise the companies’ assets in the most advantageous manner, and ensure an equitable distribution of the companies’ assets to the creditors. In order to carry out his function as liquidator, Ewe would,<span class="font-italic"> inter alia</span>, have to make contracts with would-be purchasers of the companies’ assets, commence suits on behalf of the companies to recover payments or transfers which were wrongfully made, and make and receive payments on behalf of the companies. Indeed, Ewe admitted during cross-examination that upon the commencement of liquidation, control of the company’s assets would rest solely in the hands of the liquidator.

</div> These actions would invariably bind the companies vis-à-vis third parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Similarly, as receiver for the assets of Harjani, Ewe was conferred with actual authority by Merrill Lynch to realise Harjani’s assets for its benefit. This therefore made him an agent of Merrill Lynch. Ewe explained that when a creditor bank (such as Merrill Lynch) had a debenture over an entity which allowed it to appoint a receiver and manager in the event of a default, and when that entity subsequently defaulted, the creditor bank would then appoint him as a receiver.

</div> Hence, Ewe effectively had control over TPI’s bank account and could make cheque withdrawals and fund transfers unilaterally.

This was on the basis that it was ELP that was appointed to provide the liquidation and receivership services, and EM that was appointed to provide the bank account management services. With respect, I disagree. First, in relation to the Defence’s contentions that it was ELP that was appointed as liquidator/receiver, the documentary evidence shows that on the contrary, it was Ewe who was personally appointed as liquidator/receiver. The Defence itself cites the court order for the appointment of liquidators for the winding up of Grandlink Group Pte Ltd, which states:

</div> Specifically, in relation to the receivership of Harjani’s assets on behalf of Merrill Lynch, Ewe stated that he was first approached by M/s Drew &amp; Napier LLC (“Drew &amp; Napier”). When asked about how Drew &amp; Napier had found out that ELP provided receivership services, Ewe stated that it could be because ELP was an approved liquidator and they would have the licence to do receiverships. Ewe further stated that Drew &amp; Napier had approached ELP for a fee quotation, which ELP duly provided.

</div> In my view, by holding itself out to be an approved liquidator which had the license to perform insolvency related services such as liquidation and receivership, ELP, and Ewe himself, were offering these services to the community at large.

Further, there can be no dispute that Ewe had been entrusted with the moneys in the course of providing these professional agency services. Indeed, it was central to Ewe’s roles as liquidator, receiver, and bank account manager for him to be entrusted with dominion over the moneys. Therefore, the final element of the offence under s 409 <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Ewe was entrusted with dominion over the moneys in the way of his business as an agent, has been made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For the aforementioned reasons, I am satisfied that the 50 charges against Ewe have been made out beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore, it is only where the public has utmost faith in the integrity of these professional agents that the system can function and flourish. I am of the view that the financial services which Ewe had provided all fall squarely within the exact type of mischief that s 409 was intended to curtail.
