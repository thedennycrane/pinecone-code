</div>
</div> In any case, I find, in view of the Deposit Invoice and Mison’s evidence (see [43]–[44] above), that there is no such express term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I also find that there is no such implied term. In <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”), Sundaresh Menon CJ (“Menon CJ”), in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal (“the CA”), laid down the following three-stage test for the implication of terms at [101]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. <span class="font-italic">Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) At the second step, <span class="font-italic">the court considers whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. T<span class="font-italic">his must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract</span>. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my view, the term that the plaintiff contends for does not meet the second step of the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> test. The commercial purpose of agreements such as the Holding Deposit Agreement is plain. It is to ensure that the recipient of the deposit takes an asset off the market, while the counterparty decides whether to contract for it. In the interim, the recipient forgoes the freedom of entering into equivalent transactions with others in relation to the asset. Such deposits are generally non-refundable in that, if the party decides not to contract for the asset, and the recipient has not breached the agreement, he or she may not recover the deposit. The non-refundable nature of the deposit ensures that, in such a case, the recipient is compensated for the opportunity cost incurred in taking the asset off the market. Thus, in this light, implying the term that the plaintiff contends for would, far from giving the Holding Deposit Agreement efficacy in the business or commercial sense, flout its commercial purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Secondly, in my view, the plaintiff’s reliance on the general rule that a pre-contractual deposit is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> recoverable, if the prospective contract in anticipation of which it was made does not come into existence (see [33] above),  is misplaced. For the reasons given at [58]–[60(b)] below, I agree that the €1m Deposit was a pre-contractual deposit in the sense that it was made before Cip contracted to purchase either of the Azimut 100 yachts. But I do not think that it was a pre-contractual deposit in the sense that it was paid on the basis that such a contract would subsequently come into existence; such that, if no contract was eventually made, the basis of the payment would have failed and the €1m Deposit would be recoverable. Pre-contractual deposits are generally understood in this latter sense: see Charles Mitchell, Paul Mitchell &amp; Stephen Watterson, <span class="font-italic">Goff &amp; Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment</span> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2016) at para 14–06. However, not all pre-contractual deposits are of this nature. In <span class="font-italic">United Artists Singapore Theatres Pte Ltd and another v Parkway Properties Pte Ltd and another</span> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 791, Belinda Ang JC (as she then was), having stated the general rule, recognised this point at [76]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As to whether a payee is entitled to retain a pre-contract payment <span class="font-italic">depends in each case upon the construction of the document or correspondence under which that payment is made</span>. … [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In <span class="font-italic">Supercars </span><span class="font-italic">Lorinser Pte Ltd and another v Benzline Auto Pte Ltd</span> [2016] SGHC 281, Aedit Abdullah JC (as he then was) observed as follows at [38]–[41]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38 … But a payment in the form of a deposit, may also be paid before a contract is concluded.

Classifying the payment as a pre-contractual deposit or otherwise is not determinative in itself. The precise basis on which the payment was made must be identified so as to ascertain whether the basis has (totally) failed, in which case the payor may sue in unjust enrichment for restitution of the sum, on the ground of (total) failure of consideration (also known as failure of basis).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the basis of the payment must be identified objectively by construing the relevant documents and correspondence pursuant to which the payment was made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In this case, the evidence (see [43]–[45] above) is that the €1m Deposit was paid on the following basis (and I have so found at [42] above):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) it would secure the Azimut 100 yachts until 15 May 2013; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) thereafter, it would become the initial down payment on one of those yachts, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, the yacht that Cip chose to buy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">If the €1m Deposit had secured the Azimut 100 yachts until 15 May 2013, and Cip had then decided not to purchase either yacht, Cip would not have been entitled to recover the €1m Deposit. For in that scenario, the basis upon which Cip made the €1m Deposit would not have totally failed. But in this case, the €1m Deposit did not secure the Azimut 100 yachts until 15 May 2013 for Cip to choose between them, because Azimut sold one of the two yachts on around 30 April 2013 (see [8] above). There was therefore a total failure of consideration or failure of basis. For this reason, other things being equal, Cip was entitled to recover the €1m Deposit after 30 April 2013 (see [62] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Thirdly, the defendant argues that the Deposit Invoice incorporated cll 1.7 and 4.1 of the T&amp;C: the parties therefore expressly agreed that the €1m Deposit would not be refundable under any circumstances (see [25(a)] above). Clauses 1.7 and 4.1 state:

</div> However, as I explain at [58]–[60(b)] below, I do not agree with the defendant. In any case, cl 1.7 envisions the purchase of a specific yacht, given the use of the phrase “the yacht”, and not a contract to purchase either of two yachts. </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Moreover, cl 4.1 states that the deposit “will be due on the Contract Date”, which is defined in cl 1.4 as “the date of signing of the second signature on the Order Form of the Buyer or Seller whichever is later in time”.

</div> But the parties could not have intended that the €1m Deposit be due on the Contract Date, for its purpose was to hold the Azimut 100 yachts off the market while Cip decided which yacht to buy. On the Contract Date, the €1m Deposit would have been otiose because Cip would have already decided to buy a specific yacht by that date.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Furthermore, cl 4.1 provides that the Deposit will not be returned to “the Buyer” which is defined in cl 1.1 as “the legal person who accepts the Seller’s written quotation for sale of the Craft or whose written order for the Craft is accepted by the Seller”. The “Craft”, which is a singular term, is defined in cl 1.2 as “the yacht and any other components or items which the Seller is to provide in accordance with the Contract”; and cl 1.3 defines “the Contract” to include the “Order Contract”. But it is not in dispute that there was no Order Contract for either of the Azimut 100 yachts. Accordingly, the references to “the Contract”, “the Craft” and “the Buyer” have no application. Ultimately, this point illustrates the more general point made at (a) above that the T&amp;C envision the conclusion of a contract to purchase a specific yacht from the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Additionally, the express words of incorporation used in the Azimut 64 Contract are absent from the Deposit Invoice.

</div> I disagree. I have found that a term to the opposite effect should not be implied into the Holding Deposit Agreement, for it would flout the commercial purpose of such agreements (see [48] above). But equally, I do not think that the term which the defendant proposes is necessary in the business or commercial sense. It is too broad. In particular, it does not distinguish between (1) a case where Cip chose not to purchase either yacht, of his own volition, with the €1m Deposit having served its purpose as a holding deposit and (2) a case like the present, where the primary aim of the €1m Deposit was not achieved. In my judgment, in situation (2), refunding the holding deposit is in line with commercial sense. In this regard, I note that two of the defendant’s factual witnesses, Mison and Grange, conceded that, after the Azimut 100G #12 was sold, Cip was entitled to a refund of the €1m Deposit.

First, Mison drew a distinction between buying one of two boats, and committing to buying one of two boats (in the third italicised sentence in the extract above). Secondly, Mison could not maintain that there were complete contracts to buy one or two boats. He could only state that Cip had “complete quotations” for the Azimut 100 yachts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Thirdly, on an objective ascertainment of the parties’ intentions, I do not think they entered into a contract to purchase either of the Azimut 100 yachts on 26 April 2013. I find that, when the Holding Deposit Agreement was signed, the parties envisioned and intended that they would subsequently enter into a contract of sale for a specific yacht, one of the Azimut 100 yachts. The parties contemplated that that further contract would govern their rights and duties as buyer and seller, not the agreement on 26 April 2013. In my judgment, the latter agreement is best construed as, in part, an agreement to agree, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an agreement to enter into a contract of sale for one of the Azimut 100 yachts. (To be clear, I say “in part” because the Holding Deposit Agreement was also an agreement that the Azimut 100 yachts would be held off the market for Cip to choose between them.) The following two points indicate that the agreement on 26 April 2013 was not a contract of sale:<span class="font-italic"> </span> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) On 26 April 2013, the price of the Azimut 100 yachts had not been agreed.

Mison explained that this provision meant that the prices in the quotations were subject to final approval at the time of the Order Contract for the relevant yacht.

</div> I do not find this argument persuasive. A price which is “indicative only” and “subject to final confirmation and approval” is one that has not been agreed. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The differences between the Deposit Invoice and the Azimut 64 Contract, which Cip signed on the same day, belie the defendant’s case that, by signing the former document, Cip contracted to purchase either of the Azimut 100 yachts.

</div> But I note that the defendant did not adduce documentary evidence of any such instruction, which might have contained a record of what Cip had agreed to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In my judgment, the lack of a written record evidencing the alleged agreement or representation is critical for two reasons. First, the defendant is a commercial party in the business of dealings in yachts. It therefore seems likely that the defendant would have recorded agreements or representations about significant sums of money in writing. The Deposit Invoice, which recorded the Holding Deposit Agreement, and the various communications that Mison sent to Cip that reflected their agreements or understandings bear this point out. Secondly, and significantly, on 4 May 2013, Cip asked for the €1m Deposit to be returned and Mison agreed to do so (see [45] above). In the circumstances, if Cip had agreed or represented that the €1m Deposit should be paid as a non-refundable deposit barely four days later, it is highly likely that the defendant would have recorded the same in writing. But no such written record was produced. This indicates that there was no such agreement or representation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Secondly, in August 2013, Cip sent several emails to Mison in which he stated that he was entitled to a refund of the €1m Deposit. I shall refer to three examples. The first is an email dated 11 August 2013:

However, I cannot safely infer from this alone that €1m was sent to Azimut because Cip agreed or represented that €1m would be paid as a non-refundable deposit during the 8 May 2013 Meeting.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In my view, the same logic applies to what Cip allegedly agreed on 8 May 2013. The defendant relies on the fact that it sent €1m to Azimut on 9 May 2013 to contend that Cip agreed, the day before, that this sum be sent to Azimut as a non-refundable deposit. But the fact that the defendant sent €1m to Azimut is a matter between the defendant and Azimut. It does not necessarily follow that Cip agreed that the defendant should send the monies as a non-refundable deposit. It may be that there was a gap in the agreements between the parties. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) As noted at [65] above, the defendant has not produced any internal documents or correspondence between its Singapore and Hong Kong offices to evidence the facts and circumstances surrounding the remittance of the €1m to Azimut on 9 May 2013. The defendant has also not produced any correspondence with Azimut on this matter. This is despite the fact that Cip sent an SMS to Mison on 4 May 2013 instructing him not to send the €1m Deposit to Azimut, to which Mison replied, on the same day, stating that it would be returned to Cip “right away” (see [45] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) For the reasons given at [65]–[67] above, the evidence strongly suggests that Cip did not agree the €1m Deposit should be paid to Azimut as a non-refundable deposit. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Therefore, I find on balance that Cip did not agree or represent, during the 8 May 2013 Meeting, that the €1m Deposit should be paid to Azimut as a non-refundable deposit to reserve the Azimut 100L #15 and the Azimut 100G #15.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The 31 July 2013 Meeting</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The defendant’s case is that, during the 31 July 2013 Meeting, apart from entering into the Compromise Agreement, Cip agreed to use the €500k Remainder to buy a Larger Yacht before the end of August 2014, failing which the €500k Remainder would be forfeited. The defendant pleads that there was an express verbal agreement, or an agreement by incorporation or an implied term to this effect (see [25(c)] above). I shall address these contentions in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 I do not accept the defendant’s claim that, during the 31 July 2013 Meeting, Cip verbally agreed to use the €500k Remainder to buy a Larger Yacht by August 2014, failing which the €500k Remainder would be forfeited. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 First, in my judgment, putting the oral evidence to one side for the moment, the truth of what the parties agreed during the 31 July 2013 Meeting can once again be found in the contemporaneous documents.

Importantly, the second email of 1 August 2013 suggests that Cip was also considering an Azimut 100 Grande yacht.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, I find that Cip did not verbally agree, during the 31 July 2013 Meeting, to use the €500k Remainder to buy a Larger Yacht before the end of August 2014, failing which the €500k Remainder would be forfeited. I find that Cip agreed that, if he chose to purchase a Larger Yacht, the €500k Remainder would be applied to its purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Secondly, the reasoning at [66] above applies <span class="font-italic">mutatis mutandi</span><span class="font-italic">s</span> to the defendant’s case on what was agreed during the 31 July 2013 Meeting. In short, in August 2013, Cip sent several emails to the defendant in which he demanded the return of the €500k Remainder; yet, the defendant did not promptly reply to Cip’s demands to state that Cip had agreed, during the 31 July 2013 Meeting, that the €500k Remainder would be non-refundable. Again, when Grange replied to Cip’s demands on 3 September 2013, he did not refer to the 31 July 2013 Meeting at all. Moreover, in my judgment, the reasoning at [66] above applies <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> because when Cip made his demands in August 2013, the 31 July 2013 Meeting had just been concluded. That the defendant did not raise the alleged agreement in response to Cip’s demands, when it had purportedly been made just days or weeks before, indicates that there was no such agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Thirdly, the following three considerations taken together indicate that Cip would not have made the agreement that the defendant contends for:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Prior to the 31 July 2013 Meeting, the relationship between Cip and Mison had begun to deteriorate, with Cip indicating that he did not wish to have further dealings with the defendant. This is manifest in Cip’s communications with Mison; in particular, Cip sent the following SMS to Mison on 7 July 2013:

</div>
</div>
</div> Thus, I find it unlikely that Cip would have made the agreement that the defendant contends for. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I also find that there was no agreement by incorporation that the €500k Remainder would be used to buy a Larger Yacht by August 2014, failing which it would be forfeited. Here, the defendant presses the same argument that it raised in submitting that the €1m Deposit would not be refundable under any circumstances. I have rejected this argument at [51]–[55] above; those reasons apply here too. In my judgment, the parties did not intend to incorporate cll 1.7 and 4.1 of the T&amp;C into what was agreed on 31 July 2013 as the T&amp;C apply to sales of specific yachts and the parties made no such contract of sale on 31 July 2013. The parties also did not use the express words of incorporation found in the Deposit Invoice to indicate their intention to incorporate cll 1.7 and 4.1 into what they agreed during the 31 July 2013 Meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Finally, applying the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine </span>test (see [48] above), I do not accept that there was an implied term to the effect that the €1m Deposit would be forfeited if it was not used to purchase a Larger Yacht by the end of August 2014. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, there is insufficient evidence for me to find that, on 31 July 2013, the parties did not contemplate the possibility that Cip would not purchase a Larger Yacht at all, and thus left a gap in their agreement to be filled by an implied term. It may well be that the parties considered this scenario, but did not provide for it because they could not agree on how the €500k Remainder would be dealt with then. If this is right, no term should be implied to fill the gap in the parties’ agreement: see <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> at [95]. However, since the evidence is equivocal, I make no positive finding that this is in fact what transpired. It suffices to dispose of the defendant’s argument that I do not find that the gap in the parties’ agreement arose because they did not contemplate it. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the term that the defendant contends for is not necessary in the business or commercial sense. Importantly, the €500k Remainder was not a holding deposit (for (a) specific yacht(s)). Hence, the reasons given at [48] above, for why it is consistent with commercial sense that holding deposits are generally non-refundable, do not apply. Therefore, the second stage of the <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span> test is not made out.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, in any event, I find that the term that the defendant contends for does not satisfy the officious bystander test. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In summary, I find that Cip did not agree, during the 31 July 2013 Meeting, that the €500k Remainder would be used to purchase a Larger Yacht and that, if it was not so applied, it would be forfeited. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 On 30 April 2013, Cip was entitled to recover the €1m Deposit. It was undisputed that he agreed that half of the €1m Deposit would be applied towards the purchase price of the Azimut 64 yacht. But Cip did not agree, during the 8 May or 31 July 2013 Meetings, that the €1m Deposit or the €500k Remainder would be non-refundable in that it would be forfeited if he did not buy either the Azimut 100L #15 or the Azimut 100G #15, or a Larger Yacht. Therefore, Cip remained entitled to the €500k Remainder. Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff’s claim for the €500k Remainder succeeds.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Azimut 64 Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The plaintiff submits that the defendant repudiated the Azimut 64 Contract by failing to hand over the Azimut 64 yacht to Cip, and that Cip accepted this repudiation. In relation to the defendant’s failure to hand over the Azimut 64 yacht, the plaintiff argues that Cip was entitled to reject the handover of the yacht (“the Handover”) in view of the following matters:

There is no trace of these averments in the statement of claim, where the plaintiff simply pleads that the defendant repudiated the Azimut 64 Contract by failing to hand over the Azimut 64 yacht and by selling it to a third party (see [22] above).
