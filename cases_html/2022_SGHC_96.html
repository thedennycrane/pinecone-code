He was waiting for instructions from Dinesh as to where and to whom he should deliver the remaining bundles in his motorcycle box (which included the Bundles).  It may be the case that he had to bring those bundles back to Malaysia to be returned to Dinesh.  It all depended on what Dinesh’s instructions were.  The accused also claims that he did not know that the Bundles contained methamphetamine.  He was told by Dinesh that they were “shisha” (as were the rest of the bundles) and he believed that to be true.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issues       </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In order to make out the charge of trafficking under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA, it is well-established law that the Prosecution must prove that the accused (see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad Ridzuan </span><span class="font-italic">bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters </span>[2014] 3 SLR 721 at [59]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) was in possession of a controlled drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to ss 18(1) or 18(4) of the MDA; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b)  had knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug, which may be proved or presumed pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) possessed the controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking which was not authorised, which may either be proved or presumed pursuant to s 17 of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 From the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s cases, it is common ground that element of the charge set out at [27(a)] above is not in dispute.  The accused accepts that he was in possession of the Bundles, which were in his motorcycle box, at the time of his arrest.  The accused also does not challenge the fact that he had “knowing possession” (see <span class="font-italic">Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 2 SLR 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Adili</span>”) at [31]-[34]) of the Bundles, in that he knew that the Bundles were placed in his motorcycle box by Dinesh, who had asked him to take them into Singapore for delivery to persons there. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 It is clear to me that the central issue in dispute between the parties is in relation to the element of the charge set out at [27(b)] above.  That issue is whether the accused knew that the Bundles in his possession contained methamphetamine.  In this regard, the Prosecution’s case is that (a) the accused had actual knowledge that the Bundles contained methamphetamine; or, alternatively, (b) he has failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA; or, in the further alternative, (c) he was wilfully blind to the nature of what was contained in the Bundles.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 A person “knows” a certain fact if he is aware that it exists or is almost certain that it exists or will exist or occur; actual knowledge therefore entails a high degree of certainty (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Koo Pui Fong </span>[1996] 1 SLR(R) 734 at [14]).  However, short of a clear admission of knowledge on the part of the accused person (which will, in the nature of things, be extremely rare), inferences drawn from the precise facts and circumstances of the case are the only material available to the court to ascertain whether or not actual knowledge exists (<span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng</span>”) at [104]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Given the limited material on which the court can make a finding of actual knowledge, as well as the fact that accused persons are hardly likely to admit to knowledge or can easily disavow such knowledge even if it existed, the Prosecution would often face practical difficulties in discharging its burden of proof on actual knowledge (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng </span>at [104]).  The presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA therefore works to mitigate these difficulties (see <span class="font-italic">Tan Kiam Peng </span>at [54]).  Pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA, which applies in this case because it is accepted that the accused has been “prove[n] … to have had a controlled drug in his possession” (see [28] above), the accused is presumed to have known the nature of that controlled drug found in his possession.  As mentioned earlier, the Prosecution relies on this presumption in the alternative to establish that the accused knew that the Bundles contained methamphetamine.  As such, one of the key questions before the court is whether the accused has rebutted that presumption of knowledge as to the nature of the contents of the Bundles.  To rebut the presumption of knowledge, the burden is on the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that he did <span class="font-italic">not </span>know the nature of the drugs in his possession (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi a/l Avedian </span><span class="font-italic">v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>”) at [57] and [65]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As for the term “wilful blindness”, it is important to bear in mind that it can be used in two distinct senses (see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([28] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [44]).  The first may be described as the “evidential sense” of the term, that is, where the accused person’s suspicion and deliberate refusal to inquire are treated as evidence which, together with all the other relevant evidence, might sustain a factual finding or inference that the accused person had <span class="font-italic">actual knowledge</span> of the fact in question (see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> at [45]).  In other words, when wilful blindness is referred to in this sense, it is nothing more than a convenient shorthand for an inference that the accused actually did know the truth (see <span class="font-italic">Adili</span> at [45]-[46]).  However, there is also an “extended conception” of wilful blindness, which describes a mental state that <span class="font-italic">falls short of actual knowledge</span> but nevertheless is held to satisfy the <span class="font-italic">mens rea </span>of knowledge because it is the <span class="font-italic">legal equivalent</span> of actual knowledge (see <span class="font-italic">Adili </span>at [47]; <span class="font-italic">Gobi </span>at [54]).  It describes the state of mind of an accused person who does <span class="font-italic">not</span> in fact know the true position but sufficiently suspects what it is and deliberately refuses to investigate in order to avoid confirmation of his suspicions, and so he is treated as though he <span class="font-italic">did </span>know what the true position was (see <span class="font-italic">Adili </span>at [47] and [48]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I now turn to consider the Prosecution’s case on knowledge to identify the issues which are thrown up for this court’s determination.  I start with its second alternative case that the accused was wilfully blind as to the nature of the contents of the Bundles. In that regard, the Prosecution relies on the extended conception of wilful blindness. This may be gleaned from the following questions which the Prosecution put to the accused (in respect of its alternative case on wilful blindness) towards to the conclusion of its cross-examination:

This is because, as explained by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, knowledge that is presumed under s 18(2) of the MDA is confined to <span class="font-italic">actual knowledge </span>of the nature of the drugs in the accused person’s possession and does not encompass knowledge of matters to which the accused is said to be wilfully blind, which is a state of mind falling short of, but is nevertheless treated as the legal equivalent of, actual knowledge (at [56]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([31] above), the Court of Appeal, without expressing a conclusive view, stated that it may be possible in principle for the Prosecution to run <span class="font-italic">alternative </span>cases of actual knowledge and wilful blindness, subject to there being no prejudice to the accused person (at [55]).  One instance of prejudice contemplated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span> is where the accused person is placed in the position of having to run a potentially inconsistent defence in an attempt to address allegations of both actual knowledge and wilful blindness (at [55]).  Given the Court of Appeal’s observations in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span>, I say no more about whether it had been permissible for the Prosecution to run the case which they had advanced, and it suffices to say that I was satisfied that there had been no prejudice to the accused in this case.  The accused’s defence is that he had been told by Dinesh that the bundles placed in his motorcycle box (which included the Bundles) were “shisha” and he believed that to be true (see [26] above).  In other words, his defence is based on what he thought the Bundles were.  This state of knowledge or belief which the accused asserts is consistent with him claiming to have no actual knowledge that the Bundles contained methamphetamine, and also consistent with his claim that he believed that the Bundles contained “shisha” and so he could not have had any grounds to think that they contained anything else.  There was therefore no prejudice occasioned to the accused as he can attempt to refute the Prosecution’s cases on actual knowledge and wilful blindness on a single and consistent defence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Returning to the Prosecution’s case on actual knowledge, it contends that the evidence demonstrated the following, which it says supports its case that the accused knew that the Bundles contained methamphetamine:

In other words, the Prosecution should not rely on contentions which more properly go towards establishing the accused’s failure to rebut the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA to make out a case based on the accused’s actual knowledge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In this case, the Prosecution’s submissions on actual knowledge appear to be more of a contention that the accused’s claim that he believed the Bundles (or bundles) to be “shisha” should not be believed.  That is self-evident with respect to the arguments at [36(a)] and [36(b)].  With respect to the argument at [36(c)], the import of the Prosecution’s contention is that, because the accused had delivered <span class="font-italic">drugs </span>(of a non-specific nature) on previous occasions for Dinesh and in exchange for which the accused had received substantial monetary reward, his claim that Dinesh asked him to deliver “shisha” (instead of drugs) on 16 April 2018 should be disbelieved.  Finally, for the argument at [36(d)], the Prosecution’s contention appears to be that those surreptitious circumstances would have alerted the accused that he was involved in gravely unlawful transactions on 16 April 2018, and so he would have known that the bundles contained something other than “shisha”.  In this regard, I add that the Prosecution cannot seriously contend that the accused would have known from those circumstances <span class="font-italic">alone</span> that the Bundles contained methamphetamine; the bundles that had been placed into the accused’s motorcycle box by Dinesh on 16 April 2018 (which the accused claims were “shisha” and of which the Bundles were part) comprised cannabis and diamorphine as well (they were found in the bundles which the accused delivered to Seet and/or Okubo).  At best, the surreptitious circumstances can only suggest that the accused <span class="font-italic">knew </span>that the bundles contained controlled drugs, and that was a state of knowledge inconsistent with his asserted belief at the material time that the bundles were merely “shisha”. I thus find that the Prosecution’s submissions are directed at establishing deficiencies in the accused’s claim that he believed the bundles to be “shisha”.  In my judgment, these submissions are more properly analysed in considering if the accused has rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA, and I therefore proceed on this basis. I should add that this course occasions no prejudice to the Prosecution because its case also enlists the assistance of the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 As for the element of the charge set out at [27(c)] above, s 2(1) of the MDA defines “traffic” as meaning to sell, transport or deliver.  It is for the Prosecution to prove that the accused possessed the Bundles for one or more of these acts which constitute trafficking under the MDA.  In most cases, short of an admission from the accused, the Prosecution will have to prove that an accused person possessed the drugs for the purpose of trafficking from all the circumstances of the case.  For instance, it can invite the court to draw such an inference based on the quantity of controlled drugs in the possession of the accused (see <span class="font-italic">Mohammad Rizwan bin Akbar Husain v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters </span>[2020] SGCA 45 (“<span class="font-italic">Rizwan</span>”) at [80]-[81]).  In <span class="font-italic">Rizwan</span>, the Court of Appeal considered such an inference justified based on the sheer quantity of the drugs, which weighed more than 25 pounds and contained 301.6g of diamorphine, more than 20 times the quantity of 15g that would attract the death penalty under the MDA (at [80]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40  To prove that the accused possessed the controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking in this case, the Prosecution in this case cannot rely on s 17(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the MDA, which provides that a person “who is proved to have had in his … possession more than 25 grammes of methamphetamine ... shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking”.  This is because the Prosecution is already relying on the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA in this case to establish that the accused had actual knowledge that the Bundles contained methamphetamine.  As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin Hamad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1119 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainal</span>”), the presumption in s 17 of the MDA may only be invoked where the fact of <span class="font-italic">possession</span>, as well as the fact of <span class="font-italic">knowledge </span>of the nature of the item that is in the possession of an accused person, are <span class="font-italic">prove</span><span class="font-italic">n</span> by the Prosecution (at [38] and [47]).  Although the wording of s 17 states that the presumption of trafficking therein can be invoked where the fact of possession is proved, a person cannot be found to be trafficking without knowledge of the nature of the drugs in question.  Yet, s 17 does not contemplate the proof of the latter element before it may be invoked.  A purposive interpretation of s 17 therefore means that the premise upon which the s 17 presumption may be invoked must extend to <span class="font-italic">both</span> the fact of physical possession and the element of knowledge (see <span class="font-italic">Zainal </span>at [46]-[50]). It follows that the presumption in s 17 of the MDA cannot be invoked alongside the presumptions in s 18 of the MDA (including the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA); where it is necessary for the Prosecution to rely on either or both of the presumptions in s 18 of the MDA, it must follow that the fact of possession and/or knowledge has not been <span class="font-italic">proven </span>and the premise for invoking s 17 of the MDA has not been satisfied (see <span class="font-italic">Zainal </span>at [49]; <span class="font-italic">Rizwan </span>at [81]; <span class="font-italic">Ramesh a/l Perumal v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 1 SLR 1003 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span>”) at [58]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In any event, the Prosecution does not seek to rely on the presumption in s 17(<span class="font-italic">h</span>) of the MDA to prove that the accused was in possession of the Bundles for the purpose of trafficking.

</div>  The Prosecution’s case is that the accused had admitted in his statements that he had brought in the Bundles into Singapore to be delivered to persons in Singapore, on the instructions of Dinesh.  In fact, the Prosecution says that the accused had admitted that he was waiting for the instructions of Dinesh as to where and to whom he should deliver the Bundles at the time when he was arrested.  This is not accepted by the Defence, who takes the position that the accused might well have been asked by Dinesh to bring the Bundles back to Malaysia to be returned to Dinesh himself, and hence there is a reasonable doubt that the accused was in possession of the Bundles for the purposes of trafficking. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 For completeness, I should add that there is no question that methamphetamine is a controlled drug under the MDA, and also that the accused was not authorised under the MDA to have in his possession the methamphetamine that was contained in the Bundles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Give the abovementioned positions taken by the Prosecution and the Defence, the issues that I have to decide are therefore:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the accused has rebutted the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA that he had actual knowledge that the Bundles contained methamphetamine;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) if the answer to (a) is “no”, whether the accused was wilfully blind to the contents of the Bundles; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if the answer to <span class="font-italic">either</span> (a) or (b) is “yes”, whether the accused was in possession of the Bundles for the purpose of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is to these issues that I now turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the accused has rebutted the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 To rebut the presumption of knowledge, the burden is on the accused to show on a balance of probabilities that he did not know the nature of what was contained in the Bundles (see [31] above).  The applicable principles were distilled by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([31] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>as follows (at [57]-[61] and [64]-[65]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The starting point is for the accused person to give an account of what he thought or believed the thing in his possession was.  Whether the presumption of knowledge has been rebutted involves a subjective inquiry into the accused person’s state of mind or knowledge.  The court will assess the veracity of the accused person’s assertion as to his subjective state of mind against the objective facts and examine his actions and conduct relating to the item in question in coming to a conclusion on the credibility of his assertion.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It is incumbent on the accused person to adduce sufficient evidence disclosing the basis upon which he claims to have arrived at that subjective state of mind.  It is however not necessary for the accused person to establish that he held a firm belief as to, or actually knew, what the thing in his possession specifically was; the inquiry is whether the accused person did <span class="font-italic">not </span>in fact know that the thing in question was the specific drug in his possession. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The presumption of knowledge will be rebutted where the court accepts that the accused person formed a <span class="font-italic">positive</span> belief that was incompatible with the knowledge that the thing which he was carrying was the specific drug in his possession.  However, the accused person need not establish a positive state of knowledge as to the contents of the items found in his possession.  Instead, he is only required to establish a <span class="font-italic">negative</span>, namely, that he did not believe that the items in his possession were drugs of the particular nature.   </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) It will not suffice for the accused person to simply claim that he did not know what he was carrying, or if he had been “indifferent” about what the thing in his possession was (namely, where he was in a position to verify or ascertain the nature of what he was carrying but chose not to do so).  In those circumstances, the accused person cannot rebut the presumption of knowledge because he cannot be said to have formed <span class="font-italic">any</span> view as to what the thing in his possession is or is not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As I have stated earlier, I found the submissions relied on by the Prosecution for its case on actual knowledge to be aimed at establishing deficiencies in the accused’s claim that he believed the Bundles to be “shisha” and hence I consider them to be more relevant to the issue of whether the accused has rebutted the presumption of knowledge (see [38] above). These submissions throw up the following issues for consideration: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether it is credible that the accused believed that he was carrying “shisha”; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether the accused knew that the Bundles were of substantial value and thus could not be “shisha”; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) whether the accused had delivered drugs for Dinesh on other occasions prior to his arrest on 16 April 2018; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) whether the surreptitious circumstances under which the accused delivered the bundles were such that he must have known that the Bundles contained drugs and not “shisha”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I will deal with these issues in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The accused’s belief that he was carrying “shisha”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46  The Defence submits that the accused honestly held the belief that all the bundles (of which the Bundles were part) that had been placed by Dinesh in his motorcycle box contained “shisha”.  This is premised on what the accused says he was told when he phoned Dinesh after finding the bundles in this motorcycle box in the early hours of 16 April 2018 (see [17] above).  The accused felt assured when Dinesh told him that at most, if he was caught with the bundles, he would just get a fine for illegally bringing “shisha” into Singapore.

He also said that he sniffed one of the Bundles and they smelt pleasant.  So, all this was consistent with what Dinesh was telling him over the phone.  That the accused believed what Dinesh said, the Defence argues, can be seen by the fact that he made no attempt to conceal the bundles that were in the motorcycle box.

If that is what he truly believed, it is not clear to me why the accused did not say this in his contemporaneous statement which was recorded shortly after he was arrested, at around 6.30pm on 16 April 2018.  In that statement, which was recorded by Staff Sergeant Muhammad Fardlie Bin Ramlie (“SSgt Fardlie”), the accused said “I do not know” when SSgt Fardlie pointed to the Bundles and asked him “[w]hat is this?”.

</div>  The accused would have appreciated the seriousness of the situation he was in by the time the contemporaneous statement came to be recorded.  It would therefore have been the most natural thing for the accused to have answered SSgt Fardlie’s question by saying that he was told that the Bundles were “shisha”, if that was indeed what he had been told by Dinesh.  After all, in that same statement, the accused had identified Dinesh (which had been spelt as “Dinish” by SSgt Fardlie) as the person who was giving him instructions as to where he should deliver those bundles that were found in his motorcycle box at the time of his arrest.

</div>  That contradicts the accused’s evidence in court that he sniffed one of the Bundles (see [18] above), which is a point that I will come to later in this judgment (see [57] below).  Second, the accused stated that he had called Dinesh immediately to ask him about the bundles.  Specifically, he stated that he had asked Dinesh “if the things will cause me to be arrested”.

</div>  Dinesh’s reply, as recorded in the first long statement, is that the bundles were not “illegal”, and that the accused would not be arrested. Dinesh also told the accused that “he would not give [him] the things to deliver so openly if they were illegal”.

</div>  Similarly, as in the case of the contemporaneous statement, there was also no mention in the first long statement of the fact that Dinesh had told the accused that the bundles were “shisha”.  The accused’s account in his first long statement is also somewhat inconsistent with his evidence in court, which is that Dinesh had told him that the bundles were contraband items, and which would attract a fine if he were caught in Singapore with them (see [46] above).

After all, he was explaining to the Investigation Officer, Inspector Yeo Wee Beng (“IO Yeo”) what precisely he had been told by Dinesh about the bundles.  If Dinesh had indeed told the accused that the bundles were “shisha”, then having been told that they were <span class="font-italic">not</span>, and coupled with the severity of the penalty that he might face as a result of being in possession of those bundles, the most natural thing would have been for the accused to give an account of what he had been informed by Dinesh about the bundles.

</div>   While he did challenge his contemporaneous statement as being involuntary because of an alleged threat, I had found, after an ancillary hearing, that there was no basis for his allegation of a threat, and that his contemporaneous statement was voluntarily given (see [99]-[105] below).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I find that the accused’s evidence in court that he believed that the bundles (which included the Bundles) contained “shisha” is not credible because, if it were indeed true that this is what Dinesh had told him, it would have been mentioned in his contemporaneous statement, or at the latest, in the second of his two long statements.  I find that the accused’s claim that Dinesh told him that the bundles contained “shisha flavour” was an afterthought that first emerged in the accused’s cautioned statement of 12 November 2018 in relation to the Charge, which was recorded under s 23 of the CPC almost six months after his arrest.

</div>
</div>
</div>  In my view, this claim that Dinesh had told him that the bundles were “shisha” was then embellished upon in the accused’s evidence in court.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 A court is not always entitled to draw an adverse inference against an accused person for his failure to disclose a material fact in his long statements because an accused person is allowed by s 22(2) of the CPC to withhold mentioning any fact or circumstance which, if disclosed, may incriminate him (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi </span>[2015] SGCA 33 at [57]).  However, if the fact or circumstance that is withheld will exculpate the accused person from an offence, a court may justifiably infer that it is an afterthought and untrue, unless the court is persuaded that there are good reasons for his omission to mention it earlier (see <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor </span>[2021] 1 SLR 67 at [152]).  An exculpatory fact or circumstance also has more credibility if it was disclosed to an investigating officer at the earliest opportunity after arrest (<span class="font-italic">Kwek Seow Hock v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 3 SLR 157 at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In this case, by the time the contemporaneous statement and the long statements came to be recorded, the accused knew that he was facing a serious charge of trafficking that carries the death penalty as a result of his possession of the Bundles at the time of his arrest.  The accused’s account about having been told by Dinesh that the bundles (which included the Bundles) were merely “shisha” was a fact that stood to exculpate him from that serious charge.  Yet, the accused omitted to mention it either in the contemporaneous statement or in his long statements. Further, the account which the accused provided in his long statements, namely, that Dinesh never told him, and so he did not know, what the Bundles contained, was <span class="font-italic">inconsistent </span>with this exculpatory fact.  The Defence was not able to point to any sensible explanation in the evidence for the accused’s failure to mention this exculpatory fact in his statements and why the account which the accused did provide in those statements contradicted the exculpatory fact that he now seeks to rely on.  Given the circumstances, the accused’s evidence about being told by Dinesh that the bundles were “shisha” must be rejected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I must add that the same difficulty afflicts the accused’s evidence in court that there had been a pleasant smell when he opened the motorcycle box in the early hours of 16 April 2018 after Dinesh had placed the raincoat and the bundles in his motorcycle box, and that one of the Bundles smelt like “fruit” when he picked it up and sniffed it (see [18] above).  In my view, the accused came up with the story that the bundles gave off a pleasant smell when he checked them so as to make his account that Dinesh had told him that the bundles contained “shisha” appear more believable.  This crucial detail was similarly an exculpatory fact because it would suggest that the accused thought or believed the Bundles to be something other than methamphetamine, and lend weight to his claim that they were “shisha”. Yet, it was not mentioned at all in his contemporaneous statement and long statements. The accused only mentioned this for the first time in his cautioned statement of 12 November 2018, where he stated that he sniffed one of the Bundles, and they had a pleasant smell.  Again, the Defence was not able to offer any credible explanation for why the accused had not mentioned this exculpatory fact earlier.  Further, this detail was also contradicted by the account which the accused gave in his long statements, namely, that he did not handle or check the bundles at all because it never occurred to him to do so (see [50] above).  As such, I did not accept the accused’s evidence that he smelt the Bundles.  On the contrary, I find that the account put forth by the accused in the accused’s first long statement of 20 April 2018 is more likely to be the truth (namely, that he did not handle or check the bundles at all).

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I should add that there is another aspect of the accused’s evidence about believing the bundles were “shisha” which does not withstand scrutiny.  His evidence in court was that he was “scared” when Dinesh had told him that the bundles left in the motorcycle box and which he was to deliver to persons in Singapore contained “shisha” (see [18] above).  However, the accused said he felt assured when Dinesh told him that, even if he was caught with the bundles of “shisha”, all he would face is a fine, and that Dinesh would pay the fine for him (see [46] above).  In other words, his evidence is that he believed Dinesh that the bundles were only “shisha”.  If all this were true, the accused would have perceived the bundles as being relatively innocuous, and would not have had any reason for withholding his account about the bundles being “shisha” from the recorders of his contemporaneous statement and long statements. As such, on the accused’s own evidence, there can be no credible explanation for his failure to mention the bundles being “shisha” at the earliest instance possible. Further, if it indeed had been the accused’s belief and understanding that he would merely get a fine for carrying the bundles, he would have been in a state of grave alarm when he was informed of potentially facing the death penalty for being found in possession of those bundles recovered from his motorcycle box on his arrest.  That makes his failure to mention the bundles being “shisha” as Dinesh had told him all the more incomprehensible.  The only logical inference that the court can draw is that the accused’s evidence about being told that the bundles (which included the Bundles) were “shisha” was an afterthought concocted as a defence to the Charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The accused’s knowledge that the Bundles were of substantial value     </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The accused’s evidence in court is that he had been instructed by Dinesh to deliver these bundles of “shisha” to various persons in Singapore (see [17] above).  In addition to that, Dinesh had also instructed him to collect moneys from various persons in Singapore because Dinesh was a loan shark, and presumably these persons owed moneys to Dinesh (see [17] above).  In the case of Okubo and Seet, the accused’s evidence is that he did not count the moneys that were handed over by them (see [21] and [23] above).  The Defence argues that the accused thus did not know that this was a transaction for the sale of the bundles, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, he did not know that the moneys he received from Okubo and Seet were in exchange for the bundles.  All the accused thought was that he was collecting moneys that were owed to Dinesh, while at the same time, delivering certain bundles to Okubo and Seet, as instructed by Dinesh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 I find the accused’s evidence in this regard to be rather tenuous.  This is for several reasons.  First, there is an inherent implausibility that the accused would not have made a connection between the bundles he was handing over and the moneys he was receiving, and thus realise that he was delivering the bundles <span class="font-italic">in exchange</span> for the moneys he was receiving from Okubo and Seet.  That, in my view, would have been obvious to any person in the position of the accused.  It was especially so in the case of the delivery to Okubo, where Dinesh had instructed the accused to hand over the bundles to Okubo only after the accused’s confirmation that he had collected the moneys from Okubo (see [23]-[24] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Second, the accused’s evidence that Dinesh had also given him the task of collecting moneys from persons in Singapore on 16 April 2018 because of his loan shark business was never mentioned at all in the accused’s two long statements (see [49] and [52] above) when he described his dealings with Okubo and Seet on 16 April 2018.  There was no mention by the accused that he thought that the moneys he collected from Okubo or Seet were moneys owed by them to Dinesh, which he had been asked to collect on behalf of Dinesh.  In fact, in his first long statement, the accused recounted in some detail his encounters with both Seet and Okubo, but he did not say that he was collecting moneys from them for Dinesh’s loan shark business.  Instead, he describes how in each case, moneys were handed over to him before he parted with possession of the bundles.

In their investigation statements recorded under s 22 of the CPC, both Okubo and Seet stated that the accused had<span class="font-italic"> </span>counted the moneys that they handed over, before he handed over the bundles to them.

Thus, the Prosecution submits that the accused knew that this was a transaction involving the sale of the bundles, and the accused knew that the bundles were of “high value”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Defence attacks the Prosecution’s reliance on the statements of Okubo and Seet.  They argue that both Okubo and Seet had been called as Prosecution witnesses and both of them had given unreliable evidence.  Okubo had given testimony to the effect that he could not remember many details of the events on the day of his arrest, given that his arrest was two-and-a-half years ago (see [69] below).  Seet’s evidence in court was that he could not remember anything about the events on the day of his arrest because he is now under medication (see [70] below).  Some preliminary issues which I had to deal with in connection with this point is whether Okubo’s and Seet’s credit ought to be impeached by virtue of their former inconsistent statements, and whether those statements were to be admitted as their evidence in court, and if so, the weight to be attached those statements.  It is to these issues that I first turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The impeachment of Okubo’s and Seet’s credit by their former inconsistent statements</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Section 157(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”) provides that the credit of a witness may be impeached by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted.  The “credit” of a witness refers to his character and moral reliability, as distinguished from his “credibility”, which in turn refers to his mental capacity and power to be a witness of veracity (see <span class="font-italic">Kwang Boon Keong </span><span class="font-italic">Peter v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 211 (“<span class="font-italic">Kwang Boon Keong</span>”) at [18]).  The credit or discredit of a witness relates to his credibility, and so to impeach a witness’s credit is to disparage or undermine his character and moral reliability and worth, in order to undermine his <span class="font-italic">credibility </span>by showing that his testimony in court should not be believed because he is of such a character and moral make-up that he is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on (<span class="font-italic">Kwang Boon Keong </span>at [19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The procedure for the proof of the former inconsistent statement by which the witness’s credit is to be impeached pursuant to s 157(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”) is found in s 147 of the EA. The relevant provisions in s 147 of the EA reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">147.—(1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question in in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined; but if it is intended to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) If a witness, upon cross-examination as to a previous oral statement made by him relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined and inconsistent with his present testimony, does not distinctly admit that he made such statement, proof may be given that he did in fact make it; but before such proof can be given, the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular occasion, must be mentioned to the witness, and he must be asked whether or not he made such statement. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.  </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Section 147(1) of the EA provides for a witness to be cross-examined as to his previous statements in writing for the purposes of impeaching his credit.  It is invoked where the court is of the opinion that the difference in the witness’s former statement and his testimony is so serious or material as probably to amount to a discrepancy affecting his credit (<span class="font-italic">Kwang Boon Keong </span>at [21]).  The witness is then asked whether he made the alleged statement.  If the witness denies having made it, then the statement must be proved pursuant to s 147(2) of the EA.  After the witness is proved to have made the statement (or if he admits to making it), the two conflicting versions must be carefully explained to him, and the witness must have a fair and full opportunity to explain the difference.  If the witness’s explanation is satisfactory, then his credit is saved, though there may be some doubt as to the accuracy of his memory.  If the witness is unable to provide a satisfactory explanation, then he will be impeached (see <span class="font-italic">Kwang Boon Keong </span>at [21]).  By virtue of s 147(3) of the EA, in addition to the impeachment of the witness’s credit, the witness’s former inconsistent statement shall also be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein (see <span class="font-italic">Kwang Boon Keong </span>at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The Defence argues that the Prosecution has not established that Okubo and Seet had deliberately lied when they testified in court that they could not remember the events on the day of their arrest (16 April 2018), and hence the court should not allow their previous statements to be admitted in order to impeach their credit.

</div>  Following from this, the Defence argues that the court also cannot be certain whether Okubo and Seet gave their statements voluntarily. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 From my review of the evidence of both Okubo and Seet, and more significantly, how they gave their oral testimony in court, there is no doubt in my mind that both these witnesses had come to court with the intent of trying to feign ignorance or loss of memory as to the events on the day of their arrest.  Both of them have been imprisoned for drug offences relating to the bundles which they took delivery from the accused, and they showed obvious discomfort at being called as Prosecution witnesses in the trial of a capital offence against the accused.   In the case of Okubo, he started off with his evidence by declaring that he did not want to testify, and he does not recall the incident with the accused that took place on the day of his arrest.

In other examples, Seet claimed that he could not remember why he was arrested and said that he did not know why he was in prison, if he had a sister by the name of “Lily”, his own identity card number, his age, his date of birth, or what his own signature looked like.

I find that, for many of the questions posed to them, Okubo, and more particularly Seet, chose not to answer the questions truthfully, but instead claimed that they could not remember anything at all.  But, even if the court is to accept that Okubo and Seet had suffered major memory lapses, I do not think that this assists the Defence’s submission that I should accord no weight to their investigation statements.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Formal investigation statements are taken by the police under a set of strict procedures, which are to be strictly observed by an officer well-trained in investigative techniques, and such statements come with it an aura of reliability that result in them often being given more weight by finders of fact as compared to most other kinds of evidence (see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 3 SLR 1205 at [58]).  Properly recorded investigation statements also have evidential value because they accurately record in writing what accused persons and potential witnesses can remember about the incident at a time when their memory is still fresh.  Even if the witness subsequently becomes unable to remember the details of the incident, that in no way undermines the reliability of that statement; it is precisely the function of statement recording to preserve the witness’s account while his memory is still fresh and avoid the inaccuracies which can arise if the court is limited to relying on his witness testimony, which may be given, in some cases, only years later.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 That is the situation which we are met with in this case.  I find that Okubo’s and Seet’s account of their interactions with the accused has been captured in the investigation statements that had been recorded from them at a time not long after their arrest.  That was when their memory was fresh, and the accounts in the statements would necessarily be more accurate than any oral testimony given in court more than two-and-a-half years later.  In fact, Okubo himself accepted in his testimony that his memory of the material events that took place on 16 April 2018 would have been fresher at the time he gave his three investigation statements, which were all within two weeks of his arrest.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 At the trial, after Okubo and Seet testified that they could not remember what had happened on 16 April 2018, the Prosecution applied to refresh their memory using their investigation statements under s 161 of the EA.  However, Okubo and Seet maintained their evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In determining if a witness’s statements are inconsistent so as to give rise to a material discrepancy, the court does not insist on absolute oppositeness; a previous statement will be inconsistent if a witness has provided a detailed account of events in that statement but claims that he is unable to remember the events stated in his previous statement even after it has been shown to him to refresh his memory (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Heah Lian Khin </span>[2000] 2 SLR(R) 745 at [30] and [32]).  Accordingly, I found that Okubo’s and Seet’s inability to give any evidence on their interactions with the accused on 16 April 2018, despite having their memory refreshed, constituted material discrepancies with those portions of their investigation statements in which they provided a detailed account of how they handed over the monies to the accused in exchange for the bundles (see [62] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Okubo and Seet could muster no explanation for the inconsistency in their testimony and investigation statements, save for maintaining their inability to recall the events that happened at the material time.  As explained earlier, I do not accept their explanation and I find them to be deliberately obstructive witnesses who wanted to avoid giving any evidence at all in these proceedings (see [69] above). I therefore accepted that their credit should be impeached and those portions in their statements should be admitted into evidence in place of their court testimony pursuant to s 147(3) of the EA.  When the applications were made during the course of the trial by the Prosecution for Okubo’s and Seet’s investigation statements to be admitted for the purposes of impeaching their credit and also in substitution of their evidence in court, the Defence did not take the position that Okubo’s and Seet’s credit was not to be impeached, or that their investigation statements should not be admitted pursuant to s 147(3) of the EA.  But, in their closing submissions, the Defence urges me to reject those previous statements of Okubo and Seet as carrying no weight.  It is to this issue that I next turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The weight to be attached to Okubo’s and Seet’s former inconsistent statements </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The weight to be attached to a statement that has been rendered admissible by s 147(3) of the EA is determined by the factors stipulated in s 147(6) of the EA: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In <span class="font-italic">Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 619, the Court of Appeal provided guidance on the factors to be considered in determining the weight to be accorded to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of s 147(3) of the EA (at [71]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, the contemporaneity of a statement with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated is important for it guards against inaccuracy, though the degree of contemporaneity required will vary with the facts in question. … Second, there can be little guidance on the possibility of misrepresentation by the maker of the statement but the court must be astute in spotting such instances.  Third … the weight to be accorded to a prior inconsistent statement will be affected materially by an explanation of the inconsistency and why that statement is an inaccurate representation of the facts.  Fourth, regard should be had to the context of the statement. [Section 147(6)] does not restrict consideration to only the making of the statement but requires consideration of all the circumstances affecting its accuracy. Thus the court must consider the context of the inconsistent portions, which requires that the whole of the statement be examined.  … Finally, the cogency and coherence of the facts relied upon has to be noted. An ambivalent statement does not attract much weight.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) The voluntariness of the statements</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As already mentioned, the Defence argues that the statements are not reliable because they may not have been made voluntarily.  However, the evidence before the court does not support such a submission.  In the case of Okubo, he testified in examination-in-chief that his contemporaneous statement of 16 April 2018 and his three investigation statements of 27, 28 and 30 April 2018, which the Prosecution seeks to rely on, were all voluntarily made by him.

</div>  The Defence did not cross-examine Okubo on the voluntariness of his remaining two statements. Having failed to cross-examine Okubo on the basis that his two remaining statements were not given voluntarily, the Defence had impliedly accepted Okubo’s evidence that they were given voluntarily.  This was the effect of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn </span>(1893) 6 R 67, which requires that contradictory facts be put to a witness during cross-examination to give him an opportunity to respond, and any testimony left unchallenged may be treated by the court as undisputed and therefore accepted by the opposing party (see <span class="font-italic">Yeo Kwan Wee Kenneth v Public Prosecutor </span>[2004] 2 SLR(R) 45 at [34]-[36]).

</div>  The Defence submits that this meant that the accuracy of Okubo’s contemporaneous statement of 16 April 2018 might have been affected by his consumption of methamphetamine on the day of his arrest, and his three investigation statements of 27, 28 and 30 April 2018 might have been affected by drug withdrawal symptoms that manifested themselves only during that period of time, which was 11 to 14 days after his arrest.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I have some difficulty with the Defence’s submissions about the accuracy of Okubo’s statements being possibly affected by his consumption of methamphetamine.  This is for two main reasons.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 First, in my view, it is not sufficient to rely on Dr Nathan’s evidence that Okubo’s ability to give a statement on 16 April 2018 might possibly be affected because he had consumed methamphetamine that day.  This is too general a statement.  There are no specifics as to how Okubo’s ability to give a statement might be impacted.  For example, it is not clear to me whether Okubo’s memory might be affected that day, or whether he might not be able to concentrate or focus on the questions he was asked during the recording of his contemporaneous statement.  In short, I am left wondering how Okubo’s ability to give a statement might possibly be affected.  While it is true that Okubo did say that he was not in the right state of mind when he gave his contemporaneous statement,

</div> there were no details as to what he meant by that.  Under cross-examination by the Defence, Okubo said that he could not remember <span class="font-italic">now</span> whether <span class="font-italic">he did give the answers recorded in the contemporaneous statement</span> because he was then under the influence of drugs.

</div>
</div>  However, this is quite different from saying that, on 16 April 2018, he could not remember his interactions with the accused on that day and from the past because he was under the influence of drugs, so that the account which he did provide in his contemporaneous statement was possibly inaccurate.  All of that takes on more significance when seen in the light of my earlier finding about Okubo’s testimony having little credibility given that it was evident that he was feigning ignorance and memory loss to avoid testifying against the accused (see [69] above).   In short, I find that the Defence has not been able to provide sufficient evidence for me to conclude that Okubo’s cognitive abilities were impaired on the day of his arrest because of his consumption of methamphetamine that day, and that as such, he could not give an accurate account of events in his contemporaneous statement recorded that day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Second, I find that the submission that Okubo might have been suffering from drug withdrawal when he gave his three investigation statements on 27, 28 and 30 April 2018 to be pure conjecture.  Dr Nathan had only said that he had seen cases where the drug withdrawal symptoms appear a week to ten days after the last consumption of methamphetamine.  But, for Okubo, he displayed no such symptoms on 20 and 21 April 2018, which was the fourth and fifth day after his arrest, and there are no records from Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre that Okubo subsequently developed drug withdrawal symptoms and had to be examined by doctors there.  In his evidence, Okubo himself did not testify to having suffered from any drug withdrawal at the time of the recording of his investigation statements.  When cross-examined by the Defence, Okubo was also not asked any question about whether he was suffering from drug withdrawal from 27 to 30 April 2018.  In fact, those two dates fell within the 11th- to 14th-day period after his arrest, and would in any event fall outside the ten-day period described by Dr Nathan as to when drug withdrawal symptoms in relation to methamphetamine might possibly manifest themselves.  I thus find that the Defence has not been able to show that Okubo suffered from drug withdrawal symptoms from 27 to 30 April 2018, and that the accuracy of Okubo’s investigation statements recorded during this period should be called into question.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 As for the case of Seet, the Defence argues that the accuracy of his statements must be affected too as he was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms.  I find that there was no real evidential basis for the Defence to make this contention in their closing submissions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88  Given the way that Seet had given his evidence in court (see [70] above), there was initially some concern as to whether he was simply pretending to have memory loss, or whether he was suffering from some mental condition that genuinely affected his ability to recall facts.  As a consequence, the Prosecution called one Dr Jerome Goh Hern Yee (“Dr Goh”) to give evidence.  He had previously been the Senior Consultant and Chief of the Department of General and Forensic Psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health and, in that role, he had examined Seet on three occasions in May 2018.  Dr Goh prepared a medical report dated 22 May 2018 in relation to Seet.

</div>  These were points which the Defence did not raise in their cross-examination of Dr Goh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I was surprised that this submission was even made by the Defence.  When the recorders of Seet’s statements, SI Quek and IO Yeo, were called, the Defence did not suggest to them that Seet appeared to be experiencing any discomfort and was suffering at that time from the effects of drug withdrawal.  SI Quek recorded Seet’s contemporaneous statement on the day of his arrest, 16 April 2018, and his evidence was that Seet had behaved and communicated normally (see [80] above).  SI Quek’s evidence in this regard was not challenged.   IO Yeo recorded investigation statements from Seet on 23 and 24 April 2018, and his evidence was that Seet had no difficulties communicating with him (see [81] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The Defence did not even suggest to the statement recorders that Seet appeared to be suffering from the effects of drug withdrawal when his statements were recorded.  Given SI Quek’s and IO Yeo’s testimony that Seet’s demeanour during the statement recording was normal and was able to understand and answer questions normally (see [80]-[81] above), the Defence’s failure to suggest the contrary to them during cross-examination would have amounted to an implied acceptance of their evidence by virtue of the rule in <span class="font-italic">Browne v Dunn</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([79] above).

</div>   Dr Nathan’s evidence also does not provide any basis for a submission that Seet was affected by drug withdrawal symptoms on 23 and 24 April 2018, when his investigation statements were recorded by IO Yeo.  If Seet’s drug withdrawal symptoms were mild and did not affect his cognitive abilities in the initial period of observation on 20 April and 21 April 2018 (see [92] above), then it is likely that the case would remain the same in the period thereafter.  In the first place, it was not even suggested by the Defence to Dr Nathan that Seet’s drug withdrawal symptoms would likely become worse on 23 and 24 April 2018, which was two to three days after Seet was last examined by Dr Nathan on 21 April 2018, or how, if it indeed became worse, those symptoms could affect Seet’s ability to give an accurate account of the facts in his statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Weighing all the evidence as a whole, I find the Defence has failed to show that Seet’s statements to the CNB officers should not be relied upon because they were likely to lack accuracy due to Seet’s alleged drug withdrawal symptoms when the statements were recorded.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Significance of the accused’s knowledge that the Bundles were of substantial value</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 On the evidence before the court, I find that the accused had counted the moneys before he passed over the bundles to Seet and Okubo (see [62] above).  He must have known that the moneys he received was in exchange for the bundles he was handing over.  Even if it is true that Dinesh had told the accused that he also had to collect moneys from persons in Singapore because of Dinesh’s loan shark activities, which might explain the collection of moneys by the accused from LW Techno (see [20] above) and also from an elderly Malay-looking man on the day of his arrest (see [22] above), given the near-simultaneous exchange of cash and bundles between Seet and Okubo on the one hand and the accused on the other on 16 April 2018, it cannot be seriously argued that the bundles handed over to Seet and Okubo were not in return for the cash he received from the two of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 If the accused knew to count the monies that he had received in exchange for the bundles, then he must have anticipated or expected the amount of money that he was to receive in exchange for the bundles handed over.  Even if the accused had acted on the instructions of Dinesh in counting the monies, it defies logic that Dinesh would not have informed him beforehand as to how much money could be expected from the counterparty that was to take delivery of the bundles.  The accused would likely have been briefed in detail as to what he was to expect to ensure that the clandestine operation went as smoothly as possible.  As such, the accused knew that the one black bundle he handed over to Seet was worth about $2,500, and the three bundles he handed over to Okubo were worth $7,300.  In the accused’s evidence, he drew no distinction between the bundles handed over to Seet and Okubo and those which were found remaining in his motorcycle box on his arrest.  Also, the import of the accused’s evidence (namely, that <span class="font-italic">all</span> the bundles were “shisha”) was that he did not consider any of the bundles which Dinesh had placed in his motorcycle box as different from the others.  In these circumstances, any knowledge which the accused had about the value of the bundles handed over to Seet and Okubo can therefore be extended to <span class="font-italic">all </span>of the bundles.  That being so, I accept the Prosecution’s submission that the accused knew that the bundles (of which the Bundles were part) that he was to deliver on behalf of Dinesh on 16 April 2018 were items of substantial value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The fact that the accused knew the Bundles to be of substantial value undermines the credibility of his asserted belief that they were merely “shisha”. The accused did not testify on what he thought the value of “shisha” was, but on his own evidence, it surely would not have been as substantial in value as the bundles which he delivered on 16 April 2018.  According to the accused, he was informed by Dinesh that the “shisha” bundles were contraband items which would only have attracted a fine in the event that he was caught in Singapore with them (see [46] above).  The accused’s characterisation of “shisha”, as he understood the same from Dinesh, was therefore of it being a relatively trivial (albeit still illegal) item, given that it only attracted a monetary penalty at worst.  However, if that were indeed the case, it was not consistent with the substantial value which the bundles had.  To put things in context from the accused’s perspective, the value of the bundles far exceeded the daily wages of $60-$70 which the accused was to receive for his employment as a cook at the food court in Tuas (see [14] above).   As such, given the accused’s knowledge of the value of the bundles, coupled with what he understood “shisha” was, even if Dinesh had assured him that those bundles were “shisha”, I find that the accused could not have believed that to be true. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The accused’s delivery of bundles in Singapore on occasions prior to his arrest </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98  In his evidence in court, the accused denied that he had delivered any “shisha” or bundles for Dinesh to persons in Singapore on any other occasion other than the day of his arrest (16 April 2018).  I did not accept this evidence as I found it to be contrary to what the accused had informed the recording officer when his contemporaneous statement was recorded, shortly after his arrest.  In that statement, the accused stated that he had been working for Dinesh for about two weeks, “but only five times”.

The number of calls between the parties, as well as the duration of the calls intensified during the time when the accused was present in Singapore.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Significance of the accused’s prior deliveries of similar bundles in Singapore</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 Given the state of the evidence, I am driven to the conclusion that the accused had made previous deliveries of bundles similar to those which he delivered on 16 April 2018 for Dinesh to persons in Singapore.  The deliveries on 16 April 2018 were therefore not the first time that the accused delivered bundles into Singapore on the instructions of Dinesh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The accused’s prior deliveries of bundles in Singapore is significant in that it undermines the accused’s entire account as to how he came to be assured by Dinesh on 16 April 2018 that the bundles were “shisha”.  On the Defence’s case, 16 April 2018 was the first time that Dinesh had asked the accused to deliver bundles of any nature into Singapore.  That was why the accused had been clueless as to what the bundles were when he discovered them in his motorcycle box in the early hours of 16 April 2018, and so called up Dinesh to clarify, who then informed him that they were “shisha”.   However, if the accused had already performed deliveries of similar bundles prior to 16 April 2018, then it stood to reason that the accused would not have been surprised by those bundles being in the motorcycle box that morning, and he would not have rung Dinesh up to clarify what those bundles were.  Put simply, none of those steps which purportedly led to Dinesh’s assurance would have taken place if the delivery on 16 April 2018 was not the first time that the accused was delivering bundles on Dinesh’s instructions in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The accused’s receipt and delivery of the bundles in highly surreptitious circumstances </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 On this issue, I find that the circumstances under which the accused received the bundles from Dinesh in the early hours of 16 April 2018 are entirely consistent with the fact that these were bundles of controlled drugs.  Dinesh placed these bundles in the accused’s motorcycle box in the early hours of 16 April 2018.  This was without first telling the accused, if his evidence is to be believed, that such bundles would be put into the box together with the raincoat.  As for the intended recipients of the bundles in Singapore, the accused was not told who they were until just before they were to collect the bundles from him.  He was only told by Dinesh to go to specific locations at specific times and to wait for these persons to show up.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In his evidence, the accused could not give any convincing explanation as to why he believed all these precautions were needed by Dinesh, save that he believed that he was delivering “shisha”,

</div>
</div> and that he knew that it was illegal to do so in Singapore.  Given that I have already rejected the accused’s evidence that he was told that the bundles contained “shisha” (see [56]-[58] above), I have to conclude that the accused has not given any satisfactory evidence to explain the need for all the subterfuge in relation to the receipt and delivery of the bundles.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 In any case, given these surreptitious circumstances, even if Dinesh did assure the accused that the bundles contained “shisha”, the accused could not have believed him.  As mentioned earlier, the accused’s own characterisation of “shisha” (which he understood from Dinesh) was that it was a contraband item that would at most land him with a fine if he were caught with it in Singapore (see [97] above).  However, that appears to very much inconsistent with the clandestine operations that had been undertaken to facilitate the accused’s receipt and delivery of the bundles.  The circumstances in which the accused came to receive the bundles, and in which he was instructed to deliver the bundles, would have led him to disbelieve any assurance that Dinesh had provided him. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge in s 18(2) of the MDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Applying the principles as set out at [44] above to the evidence before the court, I find that the accused has failed to rebut the presumption in s 18(2) of the MDA that he knew that the Bundles contained methamphetamine.  In this regard, I have taken into account the accused’s contradictory positions in his testimony and recorded statements as to whether he was told that the bundles contained “shisha”.  I have also considered the entirety of the evidence including the surreptitious circumstances surrounding the receipt and delivery of the bundles, and the accused’s lack of coherent explanation as to why he thought such conduct was necessary.  Significantly, I have also considered the accused’s own admission in his contemporaneous statement that he had made deliveries of similar bundles for Dinesh on prior occasions and was paid RM 1,000 to RM 2,000 for each time he did so.  The evidence of Okubo and Seet that the accused had counted the moneys that they handed over, before handing over the bundles, and the amounts of money involved, also showed the accused knew that the bundles placed by Dinesh in his motorcycle box (which included the Bundles) were of substantial value, and not “shisha”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 In my judgment, there are two reasons for the accused’s failure to rebut the presumption.  First, the contention on which he relies to rebut the presumption is not even borne out by the evidence. The accused seeks to rebut the presumption of knowledge on the basis of his belief that the Bundles were “shisha” because Dinesh had told him so.  However, as I have found earlier, his account that Dinesh had told him that the bundles were “shisha” is a mere afterthought that was subsequently concocted as a defence to the Charge (see [56]-[58] above).  Further, given that the delivery on 16 April 2018 was not the first time he delivered bundles on behalf of Dinesh, the circumstances in which the accused claimed he came to be assured by Dinesh that the bundles were “shisha” would not have even taken place at all (see [114] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Second, the accused’s asserted belief about the bundles being “shisha” is not credible in the light of the objective facts.  Even if the accused’s account about Dinesh telling him that the bundles were “shisha” is to be believed, the circumstances were such that the accused could not have believed Dinesh.  Given the accused’s knowledge that the bundles were of substantial value and his understanding of what “shisha” was, he could not have believed that the bundles were simply “shisha” (see [97] above).  The clandestine manner in which the accused received and delivered the bundles were also suggestive that they were other illegal substances of greater enormity than “shisha” (in the sense which the accused understood what that was) and the accused could not have believed Dinesh’s assurance (see [117] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Taking into account all the evidence, I cannot accept the Defence’s submission that the accused has rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the accused had been wilfully blind as to the contents of the Bundles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The Prosecution’s alternative case is that, even if the accused did not have actual knowledge of the nature of what was contained in the Bundles, he was wilfully blind as to the truth.  Given my finding that the accused has failed to rebut the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA, the legal conclusion must be that the accused had actual knowledge of what was contained in the Bundles.  As such, strictly speaking, it is not necessary for me to determine whether the accused would be regarded in law as wilfully blind as to the nature of what was contained in the Bundles, which is an inquiry that is only relevant if he is assumed to have no actual knowledge of the nature of those drugs found in his possession.  Nonetheless, let me briefly set out my analysis on this question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In order to establish that the accused was wilfully blind to the nature of what was contained in the Bundles, the Prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([31] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [79]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the accused had a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion that what he was told or led to believe about the nature of what was contained in the Bundles was untrue; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) there were reasonable means of inquiry available to the accused which, if taken, would have led him to discover the truth, namely, that his suspicion that he was carrying something other than what he was told the Bundles were or believed the Bundles to be, was well-founded; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the accused deliberately refused to pursue the reasonable means of inquiry available to him to establish the truth as to what he was carrying because he wanted to avoid any adverse consequences of being affixed with knowledge of that truth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Even if the court were to accept the accused’s account that Dinesh had assured him, in the early hours of 16 April 2018, that the bundles placed in his motorcycle box were merely “shisha” that would at most have landed him with a fine if he were caught with them in Singapore, I find that the accused would nevertheless have harboured a suspicion that he had not been told the truth.  The surreptitious circumstances in which the accused received and delivered the bundles, coupled with what he knew about the value of the bundles, would have provided the accused with good reason to believe that the bundles were not as innocuous as Dinesh made them sound to be (see also [97] and [117] above).  In other words, the accused would have developed a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion that those bundles were not “shisha”.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 It also cannot be seriously disputed that there were reasonable means of inquiry available to the accused which, if taken, would have led him to discover that those bundles were not “shisha”.  The accused claimed that he knew<span class="font-italic"> </span>what “shisha” was - it was “like a cigarette” that is to be “put in a bottle” or some other equipment that is used to smoke the “shisha”.

On the accused’s own evidence, after inspecting the contents of the motorcycle box and talking to Dinesh on the phone (during which he was assured that the bundles were “shisha”), he had time to take a shower before starting his journey to Singapore to report for work at a food court in Tuas.

</div>  He therefore had some time between when he discovered the bundles and when he had to leave his home in Johor Bahru for his journey to Singapore.  Within that period of time, he could have easily inspected the contents of the bundles, for example, by bringing the motorcycle box to his bedroom and inspecting the bundles in a private space.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 Further, on the basis of the accused’s evidence, he would have known that Dinesh was involved in criminal activity in Malaysia (the accused says he had been told to collect moneys on behalf of Dinesh from persons in Singapore as part of Dinesh’s illegal moneylending business).  In those circumstances, the more strongly he would have suspected that the bundles were not simply “shisha”, and the more he would be expected to inquire into the truth of what he suspects (see <span class="font-italic">Gobi</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([31] above)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [92]).  Hence, all the more would one expect the accused to have taken up the opportunity to inspect the bundles in greater detail before leaving for Singapore, instead of merely sniffing them as he claimed he did.  In these circumstances, the accused’s failure to perform a more than cursory examination of the bundles, which would have led him to discover that they were not “shisha”, in spite of the ease with which a more thorough examination of the bundles could have been performed, leads to the irresistible inference that he deliberately refused to pursue those means of inquiry because he wanted to avoid the adverse consequences of being affixed with the knowledge of the truth of what he was carrying. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 As such, I find that, even if the accused was told by Dinesh that the bundles were only “shisha”, the circumstances were such that he ought to have suspected that they were <span class="font-italic">not</span>, and he also had reasonable means of inquiry by which he could have discovered that truth.  The only inference that can be drawn from the accused’s failure to examine the contents of the bundles was that he had deliberately refused to pursue a means of inquiry which would have led him to discover what the bundles (and in turn, the Bundles) actually contained.  The accused should therefore be affixed with the very knowledge which he seeks to avoid, and I find that he is wilfully blind to the fact that the Bundles contained methamphetamine.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the accused was in possession of the Bundles for the purpose of trafficking    </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129  The Prosecution relies on the accused’s own evidence and his statements that he was awaiting instructions from Dinesh, at the time he was arrested, as to where and to whom he should deliver the remaining bundles in his motorcycle box (which included the Bundles).  The Defence argues that the accused might well have been asked by Dinesh to bring the Bundles back to Johor Bahru to be returned to Dinesh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 Section 2(1) of the MDA defines “traffic” to include transport or send. What constitutes “trafficking” is the <span class="font-italic">act </span>of transporting or sending; it is immaterial that the <span class="font-italic">purpose </span>of that act was for the return of the drugs to the original sender or for anything else.  It also suffices that the accused had received instructions for transporting or sending the drugs, and carried out those acts of transportation or sending, while he was in Singapore.  As such, even if the accused had been instructed to bring the remaining bundles in his motorcycle box at the time of arrest (which included the Bundles) back to Dinesh in Johor Bahru after he had completed the deliveries to Okubo and Seet on 16 April 2018, it would still constitute the transportation or sending of the drugs to someone in Malaysia, and amount to an act of trafficking for the purposes of the MDA.  As such, I do not believe it can be seriously disputed that the accused was in possession of the Bundles for the purpose of trafficking. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 For completeness, I would add that the fact that the accused was instructed to bring the remaining bundles back to Johor Bahru does not make him a “bailee” of those bundles, namely, a person who takes custody of drugs with no intention of parting them other than to return them to the person who originally deposited those drugs with him (see <span class="font-italic">Ramesh</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([40] above) at [110]; <span class="font-italic">Roshdi bin Abdullah Altway v Public Prosecutor and another matter </span>[2021] SGCA 103 at [106]).  This is because it had been common ground that the accused had received the bundles (including the Bundles) with the intention of delivering them to persons in Singapore on Dinesh’s instructions (and not for returning them to Dinesh); the accused would only return those Bundles <span class="font-italic">if and when</span> Dinesh instructed him to do so.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 Given that all the elements of the offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA have been shown to be established, I convict the accused of the Charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 I will hear the parties now on the question of sentencing.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Nicholas Lai Yi Shin, Sheryl Yeo Su Hui and Colin Ng Guan Wen (Attorney-General's Chambers) for the prosecution;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">A Revi Shanker s/o K Annamalai (ARShanker Law Chambers) and Elengovan s/o V Krishnan (Elengovan Chambers) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
