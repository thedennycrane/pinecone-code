        V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of decision of
                the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Shortly after we delivered judgment in <em>Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    [2011] SGCA 32 (“<em>Kadar</em>”), the
                    Prosecution requested (by way of a letter dated 8 July 2011) the temporary
                    suspension, for six months, of the operation of [99]–[121] of <em>Kadar</em> (“the relevant passage”) which
                    concerned our findings on a common law criminal disclosure regime for unused
                    material in the hands of the Prosecution. The stated reason was to allow the
                    Attorney-General more time to study the full impact of <em>Kadar</em> for the purposes of advising the government whether to
                    legislatively amend its effect or to change the operating procedures of the
                    Prosecution and police. We directed that the Prosecution file and serve a
                    Criminal Motion for us to formally hear and decide on the issues raised in open
                    court. Pursuant to this direction, the Prosecution filed Criminal Motion
                    No 57 of 2011 (CM 57/2011). This motion contained two prayers: the
                    first was for the court to clarify the scope of the Prosecution’s duty to
                    disclose unused material as set out at the relevant passage of <em>Kadar</em> in the manner set out in an affidavit filed with
                    the motion. The second was for the six-month suspension of the relevant passage
                    with effect from the date of our judgment in <em>Kadar</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 19 August 2011, we heard the
                    Prosecution’s submissions in this matter and those of counsel for Ismil
                    bin Kadar (the second appellant in Criminal Appeal No 8 of 2009 and the
                    second respondent in CM 57/2011). Counsel for Muhammad bin Kadar (the first
                    appellant in Criminal Appeal No 8 of 2009 and the first respondent in
                    CM 57/2011) were present at the hearing but did not make submissions. In
                    the Prosecution’s submission, the relevant passage was capable of two
                    interpretations: the broader interpretation suggested that the
                    Prosecution’s duty of disclosure includes a duty to review <em>all material</em> gathered by the police and law enforcement
                    agencies in the course of investigations and evaluate that material for the
                    purposes of disclosure. The narrower interpretation suggested that the
                    Prosecution is only under a duty to disclose material that the prosecutor is
                        <em>actually aware of</em> without the additional duty
                    to review all material gathered in investigations. The Prosecution also
                    indicated that it would not proceed with the second prayer if the narrow
                    interpretation was confirmed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       At the conclusion of the hearing we expressed
                    our views on the issues raised and informed counsel that we would elaborate on
                    these in writing. We now issue these supplemental grounds to explain our reasons
                    for giving the clarifications sought by the Prosecution as well as to restate
                    the matters clarified.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Inherent jurisdiction and power of this court to clarify its own
                previous judgments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Prosecution’s first prayer was for a
                    clarification of a previous judgment of this court. We therefore had to consider
                    at the outset whether we had the jurisdiction to hear such an application and
                    make the requested clarification, a question that this court had not answered
                    before. Although no directly relevant authorities could be found, all counsel
                    accepted that the Court of Appeal had an inherent jurisdiction and power to
                    clarify its own previous judgments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       A judgment, once given in criminal proceedings,
                    cannot be <em>altered</em> save as provided for in
                    s 301 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Act 15 of 2010)
                    (“CPC 2010”). This section provides for the rectification of
                    clerical errors at any time and of other errors by the next working day after
                    delivery of the judgment. But it does not follow from this that the court is
                    immediately <em>functus officio</em> after it has given its
                    judgment. There remain a few circumstances where a court may either revisit its
                    prior decision or clarify certain aspects of it. As the issue of clarification
                    has not been provided for in the CPC 2010, we believed that s 6 of the
                    CPC 2010 applied permitting us to adopt any procedure as the justice of the
                    case may require that was not inconsistent with the CPC 2010 or any other
                    law. In relation to the concept of <em>functus officio</em>
                    we fully agreed with the observations of the High Court in <em>Godfrey Gerald QC v UBS AG and others</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R)
                    411 at [18]–[19]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    The Latin term
                                <em>functus officio</em> is an abbreviated
                            reference to a facet of the principle of finality in dispute resolution.
                                <em>Functus officio</em> means that the office,
                            authority or jurisdiction in question has served its purpose and is
                            spent. A final decision, once made, cannot be revisited. In dispute
                            resolution, this principle may manifest itself in the guise of <em>res judicata</em>, <em>functus
                                officio</em> or issue estoppel. This principle of finality is
                            intended to embody fairness and certainty. It is not to be invoked
                            merely as a sterile and mechanical rule in matters where there are minor
                            oversights, inchoateness in expression and/or consequential matters that
                            remain to be fleshed out. Given that the court is always at liberty to
                            attend to such axiomatic issues, various judicial devices such as the
                            “slip” rule and the implied “liberty to
                            apply” proviso are invoked from time to time to redress or
                            clarify such issues. <b><em>In short, both the High Court
                                and the Court of Appeal retain a residual inherent jurisdiction even
                                after an order is pronounced, to clarify the terms of the order
                                and/or to give consequential
                            directions</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    That
                            such inherent jurisdiction exists, has never been doubted. In point of
                            fact, it is regularly invoked and exercised by the court: see O 92
                            r 4 of the [Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev
                            Ed (“RSC”)] and the helpful and incisive conspectus in
                            Professor Jeffrey Pinsler's article “Inherent Jurisdiction
                            Re-Visited: An Expanding Doctrine” [2002] 14 SAcLJ 1 and the
                            commentary in <em>Singapore Court Practice
                                2003</em> at paras 1/1/7 and 1/1/8. <b><em>This
                                inherent jurisdiction is a virile and necessary one that a court is
                                invested with to dispense procedural justice as a means of achieving
                                substantive justice between parties in a matter. The power to
                                correct or clarify an order is inherent in every court</em></b>.
                            This power necessarily extends to ensuring that the spirit of court
                            orders are appropriately embodied and correctly reflected to the letter.
                            Indeed, to obviate any pettifogging arguments apropos the existence of
                            such inherent jurisdiction, the RSC was amended in 1995 to include
                            O 92 r 5, which expressly states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Without prejudice to Rule 4, the Court may make or give such
                            further orders or directions incidental or consequential to any judgment
                            or order as may be necessary in any case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By dint of this rule, the court has an unassailable broad discretion and
                        jurisdiction to give effect to the intent and purport of any relief and/or
                        remedy that may be necessary in a particular matter. Admittedly, while the
                        rule sets out in stark terms the court's wide inherent jurisdiction in this
                        area of procedural justice, <b><em>I should add for
                            completeness, that the power to “make or give such further orders
                            or directions incidental or consequential to ...” does
                            not</em></b> prima facie<b><em> extend to correcting
                            substantive errors and/or in effecting substantive amendments or
                            variations to orders that have been perfected</em></b>. This is
                        plainly not such a case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       While these observations were made in the
                    context of orders made by the High Court in the exercise of its civil
                    jurisdiction, we think the same position applies to a court, including the Court
                    of Appeal, stating the law in the hearing of a criminal matter. This is because
                    the inherent power of the court flows from its inherent status regardless of the
                    subject matter of the case being heard.  To decide otherwise would be to
                    needlessly impose the fog of ambiguity and the injustice of uncertainty on all
                    within the legal system who have to abide by a decision that may lack clarity.
                    It is axiomatic that the law must be made clear enough to allow all persons
                    subject to it to order their affairs with certainty. Nothing in the
                    CPC 2010 alters this inherent right of a court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In settling on this view, we were conscious of
                    the general dangers of releasing more than one set of grounds of decision. These
                    include the possibilities of inconsistency, undermining of judicial credibility
                    and <em>ex post facto</em> justification: see S Chandra
                    Mohan, “Remarks, More Remarks and a Grounds of Decision: One Judgment too
                    Many? <em>T T Durai v Public Prosecutor</em>
                    Magistrate’s Appeal No 126 of 2007” (2009) 21 SAcLJ 591
                    at para 20. Nevertheless, it also bears mention that ss 298(3), (4)
                    and (5) of the CPC 2010 now permit a court to give supplemental reasons for
                    its decision in certain circumstances. This, however, is not to be taken as a
                    statutory <em>carte blanche</em> for the courts to engage
                    in piecemeal justification. For these reasons, the Court of Appeal will
                    generally only use its inherent jurisdiction to issue a clarification of a
                    statement of law in a previous judgment where the following conditions are
                    present:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     the judgment contains a patent
                        ambiguity;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        clarification of this ambiguity is necessary in the public interest to
                        ensure that the judgment can be correctly implemented in practice, and then
                        only to the extent necessary;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     the application for a clarification is made within a
                        reasonable time; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     the clarification sought is a genuine clarification and not an
                        attempt to re-open litigation, meaning that the clarification should not
                        affect the orders already made in the main judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       There is some interaction between
                    requirements (a) and (b) in the sense that some judgments require a greater
                    degree of certainty to practically implement than others. This is particularly
                    so, in a case such as this, where a court restates the legal position on an
                    important area of law that will have significant consequences for the
                    administration of justice. Where this court is convinced that in a particular
                    case there is little or no room for ambiguity, this will influence its decision
                    as to whether requirement (a) has been met. If the court is persuaded that
                    the public interest necessitates that a legal issue be made absolutely clear,
                    this might be done even if there is only an apparent ambiguity. It will be noted
                    that requirement (c) is really a corollary of requirement (b): if the
                    application for a clarification is not made within a reasonable time, this will
                    be compelling evidence that the clarification was not necessary for the
                    practical implementation of the judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision in CM 57/2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In CM 57/2011, the Prosecution was
                    primarily concerned to clarify whether a prosecutor’s duty (which it
                    accepted as both institutional and individual) to evaluate unused material for
                    disclosure in criminal cases extended to calling for and scrutinising material
                    pertaining to the case that he or she had not already been made aware of (see
                        <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above). This was in the light of the
                    large amount of such material gathered by law enforcement agencies in the course
                    of criminal investigations. Not all of this material is always made available to
                    the Prosecution (because of its irrelevance to the charge(s) preferred or for
                    operational reasons). In addition, the Prosecution wished to clarify whether the
                    timeline for disclosure of unused material falling under ss 196 and 166 of
                    the CPC 2010 would be the timelines prescribed in those sections. Counsel
                    for the second respondent accepted that the judgment in <em>Kadar</em> did not impose an obligation on the Prosecution to search
                    for material not in its possession but asserted that the duty was not confined
                    to only the prosecutor having carriage of the trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On a strict application of the test above at
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>, we did not see this as a
                    particularly compelling case in terms of requirement (a).We did not find
                    the Prosecution’s arguments on the purported ambiguity in the
                    Prosecution’s duty of disclosure as outlined in <em>Kadar</em> particularly convincing. When queried which particular
                    paragraphs in the Judgment had given rise to such an ambiguity the Prosecution
                    responded that it was the broad thrust of the views expressed therein rather
                    than any particular passage. We were also doubtful about the existence of an
                    ambiguity necessitating the second clarification, considering that this court
                    does not have any power to depart from the express requirements of written law
                    such as that contained in ss 196 and 166 of the
                CPC 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     However, the Prosecution also submitted that
                    the continued viability of a great deal of investigative and prosecutorial
                    practice turned on a definitive resolution of the doubts they had raised.
                    Specifically, if prosecutors had a duty to search through everything the
                    investigators gathered in the course of their work, this would necessitate very
                    substantial changes in the conduct of both investigations and prosecutions. The
                    judgment in <em>Kadar</em>, it appears from the
                    Prosecution’s submissions, had far-reaching consequences because it
                    mandated a sea change in the previously settled view of the Prosecution’s
                    duty of disclosure (which rested on the now rejected view of the High Court in
                        <em>Selvarajan James v Public Prosecutor</em> [2000]
                    2 SLR(R) 946). The Prosecution maintained that it was most anxious to
                    ensure that it properly understood what was henceforth expected of it by the
                    courts in the conduct of criminal proceedings. We found this particular concern
                    more persuasive. Despite the absence of a patent ambiguity, we recognised that
                    any reasonable misapprehension entertained about our views on the duty expressed
                    in <em>Kadar</em> might lead the relevant agencies to
                    undertake a significant overhaul of their practices even though it might not be
                    immediately warranted. As such, we felt that this was indeed an exceptional
                    occasion that justified the clarification requested even though the relevant
                    passage contained (on the reading most generous to the Prosecution) only an
                    apparent ambiguity. We also found that the other requirements stated above at
                        <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> were met.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     For context it would be helpful if we set out
                    here a crucial part of what we stated in <em>Kadar</em>
                    under the heading “Scope of the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure
                    under the common law of Singapore” at [113]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>In our view, it is not necessary, for
                            present purposes, for us to attempt a comprehensive statement of what
                            the law of Singapore should be in this area. There is still ample scope
                            for the development of the fine details in subsequent cases or by
                            legislative intervention. It suffices for us to say that we agree with
                            the Prosecution that the duty of disclosure certainly does not cover all
                            unused material or even all evidence inconsistent with the
                            Prosecution’s case</em></b>. However, the Prosecution must
                        disclose to the Defence material which takes the form of:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    any unused material that is likely to be
                                admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and
                                relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    any unused material that is likely to be
                                inadmissible, but would provide a real (not fanciful) chance of
                                pursuing a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to
                                be admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and
                                relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This will not include material which is neutral or adverse to the accused
                        – it only includes material that tends to undermine the
                        Prosecution’s case or strengthen the Defence’s case. To ensure
                        congruence with the statutory scheme for disclosure this material should
                        initially be disclosed no later than seven days before the date fixed for
                        the committal hearing for High Court trials or two weeks from the CCDC for
                        Subordinate Court trials (corresponding to the timelines in
                            ss 176(3)(<em>b</em>) and 161(2) of the
                        CPC 2010 respectively). Where under s 159 of the CPC 2010 the
                        statutory criminal case disclosure procedures do not apply, the common law
                        disclosure described here should take place at the latest before the trial
                        begins. The obligation of disclosure (as the Prosecution has correctly
                        acknowledged in its further submissions) is a continuing one and only ends
                        when the case has been completely disposed of, including any appeal.
                        Throughout this period, the Prosecution is obliged to continuously evaluate
                        undisclosed material <b><em>in its possession</em></b> to see
                        if it ought to be the subject of further disclosure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The following is clear from the entirety of
                    the above passage. First, there was no attempt by this court in <em>Kadar</em> to comprehensively state the law on this issue.
                    Second, “the duty of disclosure certainly does not cover all unused
                    material or even all evidence inconsistent with the Prosecution’s
                    case”. Third, our judgment in <em>Kadar</em> does
                    not frame any duty in relation to the work of investigators and how they ought
                    to interact with the Prosecution. That issue did not arise on the facts before
                    us. Fourth, we referred to the duty imposed on the Prosecution as applying
                    continuously to undisclosed material “in its possession”, that is
                    to say, within its knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     We therefore clarified that the
                    Prosecution’s duty of disclosure as stated at [113] of <em>Kadar</em> certainly does not require the Prosecution to search for
                    additional material. This view was also plainly indicated by the factual context
                    of <em>Kadar</em>, where the statements that were disclosed
                    late by the Prosecution were actually unused material within the knowledge of
                    the Prosecution (as opposed to material outside their initial knowledge that
                    they had to search for). The Prosecution’s explanation for non-disclosure
                    (which we rejected) was based on the credibility of the statements (see
                        <em>Kadar</em> at [198]). No suggestion had been made
                    that the Prosecution did not know about those statements at the relevant time.
                    There was absolutely no issue for us to consider as to whether the Prosecution
                    had failed to ascertain the existence of those statements. In addition, none of
                    the authorities we referred to from various common law jurisdictions suggested
                    that the Prosecution’s common law duty of disclosure extended to material
                    outside of the Prosecution’s knowledge. <em>Surely, the
                        Prosecution cannot be expected to disclose what it does not know
                        of?</em> Where such an issue has been addressed, it has been addressed
                    outside the scope of judge-made law: see for example the English Crown
                    Prosecution Service Disclosure Manual
                    &lt;http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/disclosure_manual/&gt; (accessed on
                    25 August 2011) at ch 2, para 2.2 (describing the duty of the
                    investigator to inform the prosecutor as early as possible whether any material
                    weakens the case against the accused) and ch 3 (containing detailed roles
                    and responsibilities for investigators in relation to disclosure as set out in
                    the relevant statutory Code of Practice). We do not know of a power under
                    Singapore law that empowers a court to <em>compel</em>
                    investigative agencies (which are executive bodies) to adopt a code of practice
                    purely by way of judicial pronouncement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     We also clarified that where material falls
                    within the scope of ss 196 or 166 of the CPC 2010, such material
                    should be disclosed within the timelines provided for in those sections, while
                    all other disclosable material should be provided in accordance with the timings
                    set out in [113] of the judgment in <em>Kadar</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Prosecution indicated that with such a
                    clarification, it would no longer be pursuing an application for a temporary
                    suspension of the relevant passage of <em>Kadar</em>. We
                    therefore made no order in relation to the second prayer in CM 57/2011,
                    although we indicated to the Prosecution that we were doubtful that such an
                    order could have been made in any case given the prevailing
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other observations </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Although our actual clarification was confined
                    to the matters set out at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> and <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above, we also took note of a further point
                    mentioned in the Prosecution’s submissions. The Prosecution submitted that
                    the disclosure obligation should be subject to public interest requirements for
                    confidentiality, such as statutes requiring non-disclosure of certain types of
                    information. These include s 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) and s 127 of the Evidence Act
                    (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”), both of which
                    contain regimes for non-disclosure of information relating to the commission of
                    certain criminal offences. Also mentioned were ss 125 and 126 of the
                    Evidence Act: these restrict the giving of evidence as to affairs of State and
                    communications made in official confidence respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     It is a trite proposition a court does not
                    have the power to depart from or vary the requirements of statute law. We
                    therefore state, purely for the avoidance of doubt, that our judgment in
                        <em>Kadar</em> does not affect the operation of any
                    ground for non-disclosure recognised by any law (<em>eg</em>, the MDA or Evidence Act). The procedure for such
                    non-disclosure will be as contemplated in the respective laws, and where the
                    procedure requires it, the Prosecution will have to make the necessary
                    application to the court to show that the case falls within the scope where
                    non-disclosure applies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Counsel for the second respondent was
                    concerned that the duty of disclosure should not be limited to the particular
                    prosecutor conducting a criminal trial (see <a href="#p1_9">[9]</a> above). In the same paragraph, we noted that the Prosecution
                    accepted that its duty of disclosure was institutional as well as personal.
                    However, the Prosecution did express a concern that certain material might be
                    possessed by the Public Prosecutor’s office generally (<em>eg</em>, material in the file relating to a different prosecution)
                    without it being known to any specific prosecutor that such material was
                    relevant and possibly disclosable in a specific case. To quote counsel for the
                        Prosecution<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[W]hat we are trying to say is that … whatever is in the
                        [Investigation Paper] that a prosecutor should know, so insofar as whatever
                        information is in the [Investigation Paper], in that sense, the prosecution
                        as a whole should know what’s in the [Investigation Paper]. Our
                        concern was with situations where there’s a need to connect the dots
                        to other information beyond the prosecutor and for example, other
                        [Investigation Papers] in other cases or in the investigation agencies or
                        some other information within the government. We were … concerned
                        about that. Because as an institution, we are fairly large now and we were
                        concerned that there might be linkages that we were expected to follow up
                        on. That was our primary concern, your Honour. So, in that sense, if the
                        prosecution is equated with whoever touches the [Investigation Paper] and is
                        involved in that case, we---we, your Honour, would say that those persons
                        are all under an obligation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     For the sake of clarity, we observe that if a
                    prosecutor cannot be expected to disclose material that he <em>does not know of</em> in a <em>known case</em>
                    (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above), he also cannot be expected
                    to disclose material if he <em>does not know</em> of a
                        <em>case</em> where it should be disclosed. However, if
                    a prosecutor knows of material <em>and</em> knows of a case
                    where it should be disclosed, he is under a duty to arrange for the disclosure
                    of that material even if he is not directly assigned to conduct that case. This
                    is included in the Prosecution’s institutional duty of disclosure, which
                    at its most basic level is a duty to comply with the spirit of the
                    Prosecution’s disclosure obligation rather than the mere letter. We are
                    heartened that the Prosecution seems willing to fulfil this institutional
                    duty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We would emphasise that the primary purpose of
                    the disclosure obligation set out in <em>Kadar</em> is not
                    to embarrass or inconvenience the Prosecution: it is to ensure a fair trial and
                    that miscarriages of justice are avoided (see [86] and [98] of <em>Kadar</em>). We would draw attention to [120] of <em>Kadar</em>, where it was emphasised that “not all
                    non-disclosures will be attributable to fault on the part of the Prosecution (or
                    a lack of <em>bona fides</em>)”. We then elaborated
                    that such inadvertent non-disclosures might nevertheless lead to a conviction
                    being unsafe. With this in mind, we would like to see the Prosecution
                    proactively making continuous disclosure of material that was inadvertently not
                    disclosed at an earlier stage of proceedings without undue fear of criticism.
                    This would be in line with the spirit of the disclosure obligation. If the
                    Public Prosecutor deems it appropriate, measures could be taken to minimise the
                    risk of such inadvertent non-disclosure (<em>eg</em> better
                    sharing of knowledge among prosecutors working on different cases involving
                    related matters or parties).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For the reasons stated we have clarified the
                    scope of the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure as stated in our judgment in
                        <em>Kadar</em> and made no order in relation to the
