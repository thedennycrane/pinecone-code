</div> However, when the Service Agreement was signed, the plaintiff thought the Service Agreement was, in substance, a tenancy agreement as expressed in the LOI which was a template completed and filled in by the defendant’s real estate agent. The Service Agreement was also prepared by the defendant. The plaintiff was unaware of the sinister motive of the defendant in calling it a Service Agreement to avoid seeking approval from JTC to sublet the Service Area to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The focus of an analysis in identifying the nature of an agreement is one of substance and not form. From a reading of the Service Agreement, it is, <span class="font-italic">in substance</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> a tenancy agreement. There are tell-tale signs that the Service Agreement was a tenancy agreement. This is most clear from the manner in which the Service Agreement describes the subject matter in question, as well as the nature of the obligations. For instance, the Service Area was referred to as the “rental premises” (see para 3(d)), “Demised Premises” (see para 3(l)), “DEMISED SERVICE AREA” (see para 3(n)), with no unauthorised subletting (see para 3(t)). Further, the plaintiff’s responsibilities in paragraphs 3(l), (m), (o), (q)–(s) and (aa) and the defendant’s duties in paragraphs 4(a) and (b) suggest that the Service Agreement was in substance a tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Further, it looks like the only service provided by the defendant in the Service Agreement was to allow the plaintiff to use the Service Area for the storage of the Assets. The physical arrangement at the Premises pursuant to the Service Agreement also echoes this finding. I shall deal with the specific clauses of the Service Agreement and the physical arrangement at [98]–[107] below. Even taking the defendant’s case, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that this was a service agreement, I do not see the defendant providing any form of service other than an area for storage. Indeed, the counsel for the plaintiff points out in his oral closing submissions that the only purported “service” that the defendant offered was to provide a space for the plaintiff to store the Assets, and no other forms of benefits were conferred.

The only service I can see is to allow the plaintiff to store their assets and you confirmed that that is the only service provided.

This is because the plaintiff was given the impression that the defendant was the landlord in the LOI. The defendant was described categorically as the landlord in the LOI and Mr Keh, in his personal capacity, was not a party in the LOI. The cover page of the Service Agreement refers to the defendant and the plaintiff as parties to the Service Agreement. Similarly, Mr Keh was not a party to the Service Agreement. Mr Keh signed the Service Agreement on behalf of the then-named defendant, Hup Eng. This is consistent with Ms Tay’s answers given in court during her cross-examination. Specifically, Ms Tay was questioned by counsel for the defendant (Ms Lim) on why she inserted Mr Keh’s name as the landlord of the Premises instead of the defendant’s when she submitted the plaintiff’s application for rental relief to the Ministry of Law. In response, she said that Mr Keh represented the defendant in signing the Service Agreement:

Mr Lau accepted that the Service Agreement and a tenancy agreement were one and the same where it suited him, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, as the defendant would get paid either way. However, Mr Lau adamantly denied that the Service Agreement and a tenancy agreement were the same where it would disadvantage the defendant, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, where it would mean the defendant was in breach of its main lease agreement with its landlord, JTC. Mr Lau’s inconsistent evidence on this central and critical issue was plainly unsatisfactory. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 It can be inferred from the evidence that Mr Lau accepted that there was a tenancy agreement. Although the contract was termed as the Service Agreement, in reality, it was in fact a tenancy agreement. The defendant thought that by calling it a Service Agreement instead of a tenancy agreement, it could overcome JTC’s prohibition against subletting the Premises without approval from JTC. However, it is clear from the language of the LOI that the plaintiff and the defendant were tenant and landlord respectively. The characterisation of the agreement as a Service Agreement was simply to conceal from JTC that the defendant was subletting to the plaintiff without JTC’s approval.

This is because the lease as indicated on the STARS title search was for 30 years, and since the lease was recorded to have commenced on 1 December 1978, it would have expired on 1 December 2008. Further, the defendant had renewed the lease agreement with JTC.

I accept that the matters contained in such Land Titles Registry searches may be rebutted if the evidence available before the Court shows otherwise. Therefore, even though the STARS title searches may constitute <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>proof that legal interest in the Premises vested in Mr Keh and Mdm Tan, this may be rebutted by the evidence available before the Court. The objective contemporaneous evidence <span class="font-italic">and </span>the in-court testimony of the defendant’s sole witness, Mr Lau, contradicts the information as stated in the land titles searches on the Premises shown in STARS, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that Mr Keh and Mdm Tan were the registered lease proprietors of the Premises.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The land titles searches on the Premises as shown in STARS state that the lease duration of the Premises granted by JTC to Mr Keh and Mdm Tan is for a period of 30 years. The lease commenced on 1 December 1978 and thus would have expired on 1 December 2008. Hence, it is erroneous and misleading for the defendant to submit that this STARS title search on the Premises indicates that Mr Keh and Mdm Tan were still the lessees (<span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> JTC) of the Premises in 2019 when the plaintiff and the defendant entered into the Service Agreement. Unfortunately, the defendant fails to raise this important point in its written submissions – that the STARS title search is silent as to whether Mr Keh and Mdm Tan were still the lessees of JTC in 2019.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The defendant’s reliance on the 30-year lease which expired in 2008 is therefore completely irrelevant to this case. There is clearly an evidentiary gap in the STARS title search as to the lease status of the Premises with JTC between 2 December 2008 and 2019. In fact, the other objective contemporaneous evidence clearly indicates that JTC had leased the Premises to the defendant in 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 First, the main lease with JTC as attached to the STARS title search defined Hup Eng Wooden Cases Company as the lessee.

</div> It is not disputed that Hup Eng Wooden Cases Company was the previous lessee of the Premises before the assignment of the lease to the defendant. In any event, this put to rest the defendant’s claim that Mr Keh and Mdm Tan were joint tenants and that Hup Eng Wooden Cases Company, and hence the defendant, had no legal interest in the Premises to sublet. On the contrary, the evidence shows that  Hup Eng Wooden Cases Company, as the lessee of the Premises, had sufficient proprietary interest in the Premises.

First, Mr Lau confirms that the defendant is the tenant, <span class="font-italic">vis-a</span><span class="font-italic">-vis</span> JTC, of the Premises. Second, and more pertinently, Mr Lau’s Freudian slip discloses the defendant’s true knowledge that it was not allowed to sublet without the approval of JTC. Implicit in this is the admission that the defendant is a lessee of the Premises with respect to JTC. If this were otherwise, and if indeed the defendant does not have a valid lease, Mr Lau would not have acknowledged that the subletting of the Premises to the plaintiff without JTC’s approval was illegal. This showed that Mr Lau understood that the substance of the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s relationship was one of a landlord and tenant. It follows, therefore, that the defendant must have a valid proprietary interest. His inconsistent and feeble attempts to refute this were futile. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 From the above, it is clear that the defendant had rented the Premises from JTC and, therefore, had a proprietary interest when it sublet a portion of the Premises to the plaintiff. Indeed, even in her oral closing submissions, the counsel for the defendant was unable to refer to any objective or reliable documentary evidence to show that the leasehold interest remained with Mr Keh and Mdm Tan in 2019. Yet the defendant urges the Court to draw the inference that Mr Keh and Mdm Tan were the lessees of the Premises in 2019 and not the defendant.

I emphasise that the defendant’s argument on the invalidity of the assignment is premised entirely on the leasehold interest remaining with Mr Keh and Mdm Tan, such that the Assignment Acceptance which was executed by Mr Keh and Keh Woon Ping would be defective as only Mr Keh and Mdm Tan could have executed the assignment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I shall begin by reiterating, as I held above at [65], that the STARS title search only constitutes <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>proof as to title. Given that the defendant had rented the Premises from JTC and in the absence of any evidence that the leasehold interest remained with Mr Keh and Mdm Tan after 2008, the assignment was not defective. On the contrary, my finding that the assignment was valid is fortified for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 First, JTC had, in a letter dated 4 December 2018, offered to extend the lease of the Premises from 1 December 2018 to 30 November 2023 to Hup Eng Wooden Cases Company, prior to the assignment to the defendant in January 2019.

</div> This showed that the offer for the extension of the lease for the Premises was accepted. Indeed, Hup Eng Wooden Cases Company must have had extended its lease with JTC, before JTC would agree to the assignment. Second, the Assignment Acceptance specifically states that Mr Keh and Keh Woon Ping executed the Assignment Acceptance in their capacity as directors, “[f]or and on behalf of” the defendant as the assignee, and in their capacity as partners for Hup Eng Wooden Cases Company as the assignor.

</div> This would not have been the case if the leasehold interest which JTC has granted was defective.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The evidence, therefore, shows that there was a valid assignment of the leasehold interest of the Premises to the defendant. I cannot accept the defendant’s suggestion that the Court should infer that there was a defective proprietary right arising from the allegedly defective assignment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Finally, I do not accept that the High Court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span> supports the defendant’s case. In that case, the plaintiff had leased a plot of land from the head lessor for a period of three years, with an expectation that it would be able to renew the master lease for two more consecutive terms of three years each. The plaintiff duly renewed the master lease for two subsequent terms for a total of nine years. The second master lease that the plaintiff executed was for the term of January 2011 to January 2014. During the tenure of the second master lease, on February 2012, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a sublease for the premises for a duration of 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2015. Crucially, this sublease extended beyond the tenure of the plaintiff’s second master lease. The plaintiff brought a summary judgment action against the defendant for unpaid arrears. In resisting the plaintiff’s summary judgment action, the defendant raised several possible defences, one of which was that the sublease was “bad in law” as the plaintiff “did not have a leasehold title to [the premises] out of which it could carve the sublease granted to the defendant [over the premises]” (<span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span> at [59]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Coomaraswamy J dismissed part of the summary judgment application on the basis that the defendant was able to show the existence of triable issues owing to some of the defences raised (<span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span> at [8]). However, in so far as the defendant’s defence was that the plaintiff did not have a valid leasehold out of which it could carve the sublease to the defendant, Coomaraswamy J rejected this defence. The master lease was not defective, nor did it impose any restriction on the duration for which a sublease could be granted (<span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span> at [60]–[61]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Similarly in the present case, given that the defendant had a valid proprietary interest out of which it could carve a sublease for the plaintiff, I do not think that the defendant has a lack of sufficient title. Accordingly, Coomaraswamy J’s observations at [63] of <span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span> would not apply to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 In any event, I observe that it may be possible for the facts of the present case to accommodate a tenancy by estoppel. In <span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span>, Coomaraswamy J, rendered the following observations on the doctrine of tenancy by estoppel at [67] and [68] as such:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">67 [Section 118(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)] gives effect to one half of the doctrine of tenancy by estoppel at common law. Furthermore, it enacts that half of the doctrine as it was understood at the time of its enactment in 1893. The full doctrine of tenancy by estoppel is bilateral: applying both to the landlord and the tenant. Wee Chong Jin J (as he then was) put the doctrine in this way in <span class="font-italic">Methani</span><span class="font-italic"> v Perianayagam</span> [1961] 1 MLJ 5, relying on English common law:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The doctrine is that a tenant may not question his landlord’s title and, conversely, that a landlord having by his offer of a tenancy induced a tenant to enter into (or remain in) occupation and to pay rent, cannot deny the validity of the tenancy by alleging his own want of title to create it (see Harman J delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">EH Lewis &amp; Son Ltd v Morelli</span> [1948] 2 All ER 1023 at p 1024).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">68 The principles underlying tenancy by estoppel are summarised by the learned authors of Tan Sook Yee, Tang Hang Wu and Kelvin F K Low, <span class="font-italic">Tan Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law</span> (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2009) (“<span class="font-italic">Principles of Singapore Land Law</span>”) at para 17.23 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The principle of estoppel as it applies in this context is that it precludes a person who has held out that a certain state of facts exists, thereby inducing the other party to act on this to his detriment, from denying the truth of the state of facts. In the context of landlord and tenant relationship, it means that a landlord, who may in fact have no title or estate that would support the lease he had purported to grant, is precluded from denying that he had such a right. Likewise, the tenant in such a case, provided his possession is undisturbed, is precluded from denying that the landlord has the title to create the tenancy. The estoppel arises either by deed or by the landlord’s [unambiguous] representation as to his title which the tenant relies upon when he takes the lease. Thus, where the parties accept that there is a landlord and tenant relationship between them even though the landlord may not have the interest to generate the tenancy, a tenancy by estoppel arises …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Coomaraswamy J also observed that the common law doctrine of tenancy by estoppel is consistent with s 118(1) of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (“EA”), and that both operate in tandem (at [65] and [89]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65 In any event, I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant is estopped from denying the plaintiff’s leasehold title to 231 Mountbatten Road. For this submission, the plaintiff relied on s 118(1) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). That section provides that a tenant is estopped during the continuance of a tenancy from denying that the landlord had title to the immovable property at the beginning of the tenancy. I set out s 118 in full:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Estoppel of tenant and of licensee of person in possession</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">118.</span>—(1) No tenant of immovable property, or person claiming through such tenant, shall <span class="font-italic">during the continuance of the tenancy</span> be permitted to deny that the landlord of the tenant had at the beginning of the tenancy a title to the immovable property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89 On that view, s 118(1) prescribes a rule of evidence which applies to a tenant during the continuance of the tenancy. That rule of evidence says nothing about any estoppel which may or may not apply to a tenant after the determination of the tenancy, whether by effluxion of time or otherwise. Section 118(1) is not, on that view, inconsistent with the common law rule which provides that the estoppel “continues to operate and bind the parties even after the term has ended except where the tenant is dispossessed by a third party with a superior title to his landlord” (per Belinda Ang Saw Ean J in <span class="font-italic">Thode</span><span class="font-italic"> Gerd Walter v Mintwell Industry Pte Ltd</span> [2009] SGHC 44 at [10]). Indeed, on this view, the common law rule of evidence complements s 118(1) rather than contradicting it. The result of taking this approach is that the same principle applies whether it is raised against a landlord or a tenant, whether it arises out of court or in the context of litigation and whether it arises in <span class="font-italic">viva voce</span> evidence at trial or in affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Applying s 118(1) of the EA, Coomaraswamy J found that the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Ritzland</span> was precluded from denying the plaintiff’s title to the demised premises (at [90]–[91]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 In the present case, given my findings above in relation to (a) the manner in which the defendant had given the plaintiff the impression that the defendant had the requisite leasehold interest (at [43]–[46] above); and (b) the circumstances surrounding the assignment of the leasehold interest to the defendant (at [67]–[77] above), it is likely that the defence of tenancy by estoppel may be made out. However, counsel for the defendant had argued that this was not pleaded by the plaintiff.

IRAS requested the plaintiff to submit the Service Agreement for its consideration. The Service Agreement was accordingly sent to IRAS. On 1 December 2020, IRAS sent an email to the plaintiff. In that email IRAS considered the Service Agreement to be a tenancy agreement and required it to be stamped.

</div> And crucially, the defendant’s acceptance of the Notice of Cash Grant also cuts against its claim that the Service Agreement was merely a contract for <span class="font-italic">services</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 It is clear from the above that the Government authorities considered that the Service Agreement was a tenancy agreement and that accordingly, the plaintiff was protected under the COVID-19 Act. The defendant has not provided cogent reasons to raise doubts as to the findings of these authorities. In fact, Mr Lau testified that he accepted the findings of the authorities that the Service Agreement was a tenancy agreement. The COVID-19 Act was enacted to help entities like the plaintiff who had suffered significantly due to the restrictive measures implemented by the Government, which were aimed at protecting the people of Singapore from the contagious and deadly coronavirus. Indeed, this was confirmed by the Minister for Law Mr K Shanmugam in his Speech when he introduced the COVID-19 Act for debate in Parliament (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(7 April 2020) vol 94 at col 130):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Turning then to COVID-19, the Government has had to impose border constraints, direct most businesses to shut down, get their people to work from home, and if that is not possible, no work can be done. Imposing a whole variety of restrictions on travel and movement, these were not foreseeable. Their impact on the supply chain – many businesses could not procure the supplies they needed. The impact on flow of manpower – sectors that depended heavily on foreign manpower like construction were seriously affected.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The first category covered leases, licences of non-residential property. A tenant who seeks relief must show that he is unable to pay rent during the prescribed period and that the inability to pay is to a material extent caused by a COVID-19 event. If he can show, that then the lease or licence cannot be terminated on the basis that rent has not been paid; and legal proceedings cannot be commenced against tenants on the basis that rent has not been paid.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This is help in real terms because the <span class="font-italic">tenants will get breathing space, to adjust their businesses, survive in the medium term: it is liquidity for them.</span> And these measures, of course, should be seen together with other measures that the Government and the financial industry have announced.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 When Mr Lau was asked during cross-examination whether he thought the Government authorities could have made a mistake in disbursing money to the defendant, he denied the possibility. However, when put on a spot, he claimed that the authorities were incorrect in naming the plaintiff as the defendant’s subtenant:

Clause 3(h) also conferred on the defendant an entitlement to terminate the Service Agreement with immediate effect if such illegally hired workers were found on the Premises.

In fact, Mr Lau testified that when he became the managing director in December 2019, he knew that the Service Agreement was in reality a tenancy agreement and he raised this issue with Mr Keh, the other director and majority shareholder. Mr Lau was concerned as he knew that JTC would not permit subletting of the Premises. Mr Keh assured him that it was alright as it was not called a tenancy agreement but a Service Agreement. Hence, from the very beginning the term “Service Agreement” was used to mask what was really a tenancy agreement. That was why when JTC, through CHBC,

The physical arrangement at the Premises, with the Service Area being separated from the rest of the Premises by a locked gate and a defined demarcation of the Service Area, clearly shows that the plaintiff had exclusive possession of the Service Area. This supports my finding that the LOI and the Service Agreement were clearly intended to create a landlord-tenant relation as between the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant had called the Service Agreement a “Service Agreement” instead of a tenancy agreement to (a) evade its rights and obligations as a landlord to the plaintiff as its tenant; and (b) mask its breach of the terms of its lease agreement with JTC, which prohibited it from subletting the Premises without approval. The defence seeks, impermissibly, to elevate form over substance. On the contrary, the nature of the clauses located within the Service Agreement further supports my finding that that agreement is a lease.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 I also do not accept the defendant’s argument that there was no valid leasehold interest out of which the defendant could grant the plaintiff a sublease over the Premises. Given that the STARS title search which the defendant seeks to rely on is outdated, it is irrelevant in ascertaining the nature of the leasehold interest over the Premises in 2019. On the contrary, the evidence before the Court points clearly to the conclusion that there was a valid leasehold which was assigned to the defendant, and that the assignment was valid. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant’s wrongful disposal of the Assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Having found that the Service Agreement was a tenancy agreement, I shall turn to consider whether the defendant’s disposal of the Assets was wrongful under the COVID-19 Act and the Distress Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendant had no contractual entitlement to dispose of the Assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I shall first consider the defendant’s argument that it was contractually entitled to dispose of the Assets.

This was even though the defendant’s invoices were erroneous and the defendant’s SOAs were inaccurate. However, the defendant refused to accept payment from September 2020. The defendant’s refusal to accept payments from the plaintiff and its determination to evict the plaintiff are largely attributed to the defendant’s receipt of the CHBC letter dated 31 August 2020 which highlighted, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, the unapproved subletting to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 On 23 September 2020, Ms Tay sent a WhatsApp message to Mr Ang, one of the defendant’s managers, conveying the plaintiff’s intention to make payment of the rental arrears.

</div> Considering that the plaintiff’s cheques were never dishonoured, I find it difficult to believe that Mr Lau adamantly required the plaintiff to pay in cash or cashier’s orders. Furthermore, why was the plaintiff not informed of this new mode of payment in cash or cashier’s orders? In these circumstances, it appears that Mr Lau’s claim that he would only accept cash or cashier’s orders from the plaintiff in September 2020 is an afterthought.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The plaintiff wanted to pay the defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 The plaintiff was not able to make full payment to the defendant as the latter’s invoices from January to June 2020 were incorrect. The rental was not $10,400 per month as it had been mutually reduced by the parties to $9,000 starting January 2020 (at [10] above).

</div> Furthermore, the two months’ deposit of $20,800 based on $10,400 per month for a duration of two years, which was paid by the plaintiff when the LOI was signed, should have been reduced to one month’s deposit of $9,000. This is because the two-year lease was reduced to a year. The defendant also did not seek to regularise the accounts even when Ms Tay brought it to the attention of the defendant’s housing agent, Kim, in January 2020.

</div> The plaintiff’s conduct clearly indicated that it was willing to settle the outstanding monthly arrears. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 In September 2020, the plaintiff continued wanting to settle the monthly arrears with the defendant. The defendant, however, was not interested to entertain the plaintiff. By this time, the defendant was more interested to evict the plaintiff. This was because of JTC’s discovery of the unapproved subletting to the plaintiff. Thus, the defendant was afraid of the consequences that JTC could impose if the plaintiff continued to remain in the Premises. The plaintiff was contractually entitled to remain in the Premises as the tenancy agreement had not expired then.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendant’s failure to ensure that the 3rd LOD and the 4th LOD were correctly addressed to the plaintiff</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 I should also mention that there were issues relating to the receipt of the defendant’s 3rd LOD and the 4th LOD by the plaintiff.

In the 3rd LOD, the defendant demanded that the plaintiff pay $37,676 which the plaintiff alleged was erroneous as the correct amount should have been $36,350.

The defendant’s unresponsiveness to the plaintiff who wanted to pay the monthly arrears (at [115] above) and the unreasonable demands that payment of the monthly arrears had to be either in cash or cashier’s order (at [118] above) can be attributed to an intention to evict the plaintiff. Indeed, it is evident that, by September 2020, the defendant had already made up its mind to evict the plaintiff from the Premises and ultimately did so in an unacceptably abrupt and high-handed manner through capitalising on the plaintiff’s alleged failure to pay the monthly rental and arrears. The non-payment of the monthly arrears by the plaintiff was thus an excellent opportunity or excuse for the defendant to evict the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The defendant, by its own unreasonable behaviour, refused to accept the plaintiff’s payment of the arrears in September 2020. This can be contrasted to the situation before the defendant received the CBHC letter dated 31 August 2020 in which JTC threatened to take action against the defendant for the illegal structures and the unapproved subletting to the plaintiff. Before 31 August 2020, the defendant had received and accepted payments of the arrears in July and August 2020 from the plaintiff. The reality is that the defendant refused to accept payment of the arrears from the plaintiff who wanted to pay despite not knowing the correct SOAs from the defendant. This being the case, and in the absence of any reasonable explanation at the defendant’s end, the defendant cannot now claim that the plaintiff’s failure to pay the defendant amounted to a repudiatory breach of the Service Agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Having regard to the above, I find that the defendant had no contractual entitlement to dispose of the Assets under Clause 3(cc) of the Service Agreement (see [111] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The COVID-19 Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In any case, the COVID-19 Act prohibits the defendant from taking enforcement actions against the plaintiff on the ground of the plaintiff’s non-payment of rent.

</div> The Notice of Cash Grant was only issued on 18 February 2021. The moratorium was thus in force when the defendant entered the Premises and took away the Assets from 24 to 30 September 2020. Therefore, the defendant’s seizure and disposal of the Assets are in clear breach of s 19G of the COVID-19 Act.

JTC gave the defendant an alternative to evicting the plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to submit an application to JTC to allow the plaintiff to continue as a tenant. Should JTC’s approval be given, the defendant would then have to pay liquidated damages to JTC for the unapproved subletting period. The defendant was not prepared to pay liquidated damages to JTC for its wrongful act of subletting to the plaintiff without seeking JTC’s prior approval. Thus, the defendant had to evict the plaintiff from the Premises as otherwise JTC would take punitive action against the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Thus, the CHBC Letter did not disallow the “[S]ervice [A]greement and/or the use of the [S]ervice [A]rea” by the plaintiff as specified by Clause 5(c) of the Service Agreement. This is not a case where JTC discovered the unauthorised subletting of the Premises by the defendant and directed the defendant to evict the plaintiff within two months of JTC’s letter. Rather, the defendant voluntarily terminated the Service Agreement as it did not wish to pay JTC the stipulated liquidated damages for the period of unauthorised subletting. The defendant knew that it was not permitted to sublet the Premises without approval from JTC but, nevertheless, went ahead to sublet the Service Area to the plaintiff. The latter was unaware of the unauthorised subletting by the defendant. In this situation, JTC was not even given the opportunity to consider the Service Agreement. It, therefore, cannot be said that JTC had “disallowed” the plaintiff’s use of the Service Area. At best, the defendant may, in accordance with the CHBC Letter, argue that any disallowance on JTC’s part would be after 30 October 2020. But even this does not help the defendant’s case. I, therefore, find that Clause 5(c) was not engaged and the defendant was not entitled to terminate the Service Agreement on this basis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Illegal structures on the Premises</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 The defendant also cannot argue that it terminated the Service Agreement because the plaintiff had erected the illegal structures on the Premises.

</div> Yet, it was only <span class="font-italic">after </span>the receipt of the CHBC Letter that the defendant sprang into action to evict the plaintiff. Following the receipt of the CHBC Letter, the defendant was put on notice that JTC was aware that it had sublet the Premises to the plaintiff without JTC’s approval and was desperate to fix the situation. Thus, in a hurried bid to save its own skin, the defendant acted without a single thought for the plaintiff’s interests. The defendant then capitalised on the plaintiff’s failure to pay rent to evict the plaintiff from the Premises and to then sell the Assets to Yew Huat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The evidence also suggests that the sale of the Assets to Yew Huat was done in an extremely rushed manner. Mr Lau testified that the defendant reached an agreement to sell the Assets to Yew Huat “between 15 and 20 September” 2020.

</div>
</div> In these circumstances, it can be inferred that the defendant had approached Yew Huat knowing that Yew Huat was likely to buy the Assets. This would allow the defendant to quickly dispose of the Assets and remedy its illegal subletting. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 It is, therefore, no coincidence that (a) the disposal and sale of the Assets came less than a month after the CHBC Letter dated 31 August 2020; and (b) the Assets were sold for $40,000, almost the same amount of rental arrears owed by the plaintiff to the defendant at that time. The defendant’s conduct is plainly unacceptable and inconsistent with the spirit of the COVID-19 Act, which was specifically enacted to protect tenants who were badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic from enforcement actions by their landlords. Indeed, the plaintiff’s business came to a standstill as a result of the Government’s COVID-19 restrictive measures. In these circumstances, it is clear that the defendant took such drastic action against the plaintiff in order to save its own skin and stave off enforcement action by JTC. The defendant’s seizure and disposal of the Assets were extremely high-handed. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Distress Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 As I have found that the Service Agreement is a tenancy agreement, the Distress Act is applicable to this case. It is undisputed that the defendant did not comply with the Distress Act as it did not consider the Service Agreement to be a tenancy agreement. Thus, the defendant committed multiple breaches of the Distress Act in its imperious and abrupt disposal of the Assets. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 First, the Distress Act requires that the defendant apply for a writ of distress. This the defendant had failed to do. The defendant thus acted contrary to the relevant sections of the Distress Act, which read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">No distress otherwise than under this Act</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">4.</span>  No landlord shall distrain for rent except in the manner provided by this Act.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application for writ of distress</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5.</span>—(1)  A landlord or his agent duly authorised in writing may apply ex parte to a judge or registrar for an order for the issue of a writ, to be called a writ of distress, for the recovery of rent due or payable to the landlord by a tenant of any premises for a period not exceeding 12 completed months of the tenancy immediately preceding the date of the application; and the judge or registrar may make such order accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Such authority may be in the prescribed form, with such variations as circumstances require, and shall be produced at the time of the application.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  Arrears of rent may be distrained for after the determination of the tenancy, provided that either the tenant is still in occupation of the premises in respect of which the rent is claimed to be due, or any goods of the tenant are still on the premises.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Writ of distress</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">7.</span>  A writ of distress shall be addressed to the sheriff, directing him forthwith to distrain any movable property found by him on the premises named therein, or such part of the property as may in his judgment be sufficient, when sold, to realise the amount of rent therein stated to be due to the applicant, together with such sum as may be due to the applicant by way of costs and to the sheriff for his fees and expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Second, the defendant’s seizure of the Assets comprising scaffolding for multi-tiered seating galleries and for the F1 night race were the plaintiff’s main tools of trade. Thus, the defendant’s seizure of the Assets was in breach of s 8(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Distress Act. Section 8(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Distress Act reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Property exempted from seizure</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">8.</span>  Property seizable under a writ of distress shall not include —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) goods in the possession of the tenant for the purpose of being carried, wrought, worked up, or otherwise dealt with in the course of his ordinary trade or business;</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Having regard to the above, I find that the defendant’s actions of seizing and disposing of the Assets without a writ of distress were in breach of the Distress Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Estoppel</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Given that I have already found the defendant’s intentional disposal of the Assets to be wrongful under the COVID-19 Act and the Distress Act, it is not necessary for me to deal with the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant was estopped from disposing of the Assets. I also note that much of the plaintiff’s estoppel claim rests on the representations made by Mr Ang, who in any event was not called as a witness.

If the defendant had, to the contrary, taken the time to ascertain the fair market value of the Assets, it may have been able to recover all or even an amount in excess of the plaintiff’s rental arrears. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 I, therefore, find that the defendant failed to mitigate its losses and dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Assessment of the witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 The plaintiff called three witnesses: Mr Heng, Ms Tay and Mr Ponnusamy Anbarasan, one of the plaintiff’s truck drivers. Their evidence was largely consistent and contained no serious discrepancies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The defendant’s sole witness was Mr Lau. Mr Lau’s evidence was contradictory, confusing and unreliable. I have pointed out multiple occasions when Mr Lau vacillated in his evidence on critical issues (at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[47]–[49], [145]–[146] and [160]–[161] above). Further, the defendant’s counsel argues that Mr Lau’s opinions on the nature of the Service Agreement must be treated with caution because he was not involved in the negotiations leading up to the execution of the Service Agreement. Thus, Mr Lau would not have known the parties’ true intentions.

</div> I find the submission on this point to be a non-starter. Throughout the cross-examination, Mr Lau has displayed a clear awareness and understanding of the nature of the Service Agreement as evident from his answers to the numerous questions put by the plaintiff’s counsel.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 I also find that Mr Lau has a stubborn streak, which explains the defendant’s uncompromising and high-handed conduct. For example, Mr Lau was asked about the 1st LOD dated 6 February 2020 which demanded payment of the January and February 2020 fees amounting to $22,256. Since this letter was issued after the parties mutually agreed to reduce the monthly fee to $9,000 from $10,400, the sum of $22,256 for January and February 2020 is incorrect. That the 1st LOD listed an incorrect sum of arrears is also undisputed by both parties as the defendant later issued the Credit Notes on 1 June 2020 to refund the overpaid amount to the plaintiff. However, Mr Lau adamantly denied that the sum of $22,256 stated in the 1st LOD was incorrect and vehemently defended the accuracy of the figure.

</div> It was only after the Court mentioned the Credit Notes did Mr Lau reluctantly admit, albeit implicitly, that the sum of $22,256 was incorrect and that was why he “added a [credit note]”.

</div> This gave Yew Huat the impression that the defendant had the legal right to seize and sell the Assets as the plaintiff was in arrears. Accordingly, Yew Huat had no notice of the plaintiff’s interest in the Assets. Thus, it appears that Yew Huat might have acted in good faith when it purchased the Assets and furnished consideration of $40,000 to obtain the Assets. The Court’s hands are, therefore, tied and it cannot make a declaration that the sale of the Assets to Yew Huat is null and void.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 For the above reasons, I allow the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant for its intentional disposal of the Assets.

</div> save for: (a) a declaration that the sale of the Assets to Yew Huat is null and void; and (b) an order for the plaintiff and the defendant to recover the Assets from Yew Huat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 I also dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim for the balance outstanding arrears. However, I make the following findings: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was a tenancy agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant. The language of the LOI plainly shows that the parties intended to create a landlord-tenant relationship. The Service Agreement was, in substance, a tenancy agreement. IRAS also considered the Service Agreement to be a tenancy agreement. Further, the plaintiff had exclusive possession of the Service Area. The name “Service Agreement” was an attempt by the defendant to circumvent JTC’s prohibition against subletting the Premises. In fact, JTC, through the CHBC letter, concluded that the plaintiff was the defendant’s subtenant and the defendant did not dispute JTC’s finding. Finally, the assignment of the leasehold to the defendant was valid.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The defendant had no contractual entitlement to dispose of the Assets. The plaintiff made attempts to make payment of the arrears in September 2020 but the defendant unreasonably refused to accept the plaintiff’s payment. The defendant’s intentional, unreasonable and high-handed disposal of the Assets was in breach of the COVID-19 Act and the Distress Act. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The defendant’s counterclaim fails as the defendant did not mitigate its losses. The defendant did not make attempts to ascertain the fair market value of the Assets. Its sole concern was to sell the Assets as quickly as possible in order to evict the plaintiff as its tenant so as to avert punitive actions from JTC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 The defendant should have lived up to its responsibilities as landlord of the plaintiff and engaged in discussions with the plaintiff who acted at all times as an amiable and willing tenant. Disappointingly, the defendant refused to engage the plaintiff in September 2020 and was instead determined to evict the plaintiff from the Premises so that JTC would not take action against the defendant for unapproved subletting.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 The defendant is to pay costs to the plaintiff for the main suit and the defendant’s counterclaim, to be agreed or taxed. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Tan Siong Thye<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Loh Yik Ming Michael (Clifford Law LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Bee Li and Wong Zhen Yang (Chevalier Law LLC) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
