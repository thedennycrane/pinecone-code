<br/><br/></div>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Held, awarding interlocutory judgment for the first plaintiffs’

claim and part of the first defendants’ counterclaims,</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1)    Hola had a valid claim for damages as Hiap Tian

Soon had conceded liability for the damaged piles (see [12]-[16]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2)    Hola’s right to an equitable set-off was not

excluded by contract. In a building contract, one starts with the presumption that each

party is to be entitled to all remedies arising by operation of law, including the right

to set-off. However, it is open to parties to rebut that presumption by contrary

provisions in the contract, provided that clear and unequivocal words are used. Here the

parties did not craft additional provisions to import the concept of ‘temporary

finality’ into the contract, and it can only be inferred that Hola’s right of

set-off remained intact (see [17] – [32]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(3)    It was not necessary for Hola to inform Hiap Tian

Soon that it intended to exercise the right of set-off. In any case, Hola’s General

Manager, Lau Yaw Seng, had testified that he had orally informed Hiap Tian Soon of his

intention to set off the amounts (see [33]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(4)    However, a party purporting to exercise the right

of set-off must quantify his loss by means of a reasonable assessment made in good faith.

In deciding what a reasonable assessment is, the court must take into account, inter alia,

the quantum of the sum purported to be set-off and the complexity of the rectification

works required. The set-off sum of $214,196.90 claimed by Hola was by no means a small

amount, and they ought to have done more than to obtain two casual verbal estimates of the

costs involved. Hola had accordingly failed to quantify their losses by means of a

reasonable assessment, and could not rely on the defence of equitable set-off. As such,

Hiap Tian Soon’s termination of the contract was valid and they were entitled to

succeed on their claim (see [34] – [45]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(5)    Hola’s counterclaim for loss and damages

arising from Hiap Tian Soon’s failure to proceed with reasonable diligence would be

allowed. Hiap Tian Soon’s progress of work had consistently lagged behind the

construction programme they had furnished to both Hola and the architects. Further, they

had persisted in their delay despite reminders from Hola to expedite the work (see [46]

– [55]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(6)    Hiap Tian Soon was however not liable for delay

in handing over the site from 24 July 2001 to 27 September 2001, since Hola were

themselves in delay in checking on the progress of the hand-over, and had also consented

to the delayed hand over (see [56] – [59]). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(7)    As the original contract price was revised

downwards from $10,090,000 to $7,995,000, it was unconscionable of Hola to call on the

performance bond in the sum of $1,090,000. The sum payable under the performance bond is

subject to revision unless the parties have agreed that that amount is to be unaffected by

any changes to the original contract sum. Hola was therefore only entitled to call on and

demand payment on the performance bond in the sum of $799,500, based on 10% of the revised

contract sum (see [60] - [67]).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(8)    With regard to Hola’s counterclaim for

failure to rectify the defective works, Hiap Tian Soon had generally conceded liability on

the damaged piles and as such were liable for 158 piles as well as for piles subsequently

discovered damaged in grids 8/B and 6/A (see [68]-[72]). </p>

<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The facts</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        By a contract dated 20 May

2000 (the Contract), the first defendants, Hola Development Pte Ltd (Hola) employed Hiap

Tian Soon Construction Pte Ltd (the first plaintiffs) to construct a light industrial

flatted factory with a basement car park at Ubi Avenue 1. The contract period commenced on

24 July 2000 and was to end 15 months later (in October 2001). The first plaintiffs

commenced piling works on or about 21 July 2000 and these works were completed in

September 2000. In reliance upon two interim payment certificates issued by Mr Cheong

Jiong Chian from the firm of IMT Architects (the Architects), Interim Certificate Nos 1

and 2, certifying that the piles were satisfactorily installed, Hola made payment to the

first plaintiffs for the installed piles. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        The first plaintiffs then

began excavation works using the ‘open cut method’ for the basement excavation

without obtaining prior approval from ASE Designtec, the project structural engineers, or

the Building and Construction Authority (BCA). The excavation works resulted in soil

movement which in turn damaged the piles that had been installed, causing substantial

delays to the project. By this time, Interim Certificate Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 had already

been issued. Upon realising the full extent of the defects, Hola’s General Manager,

Mr Lau Yaw Seng (Lau) approached the Architects to take into consideration the defective

piles and works by way of a retrospective valuation of all work done when issuing the

subsequent interim certificates. The Architects however, declined to certify the cost of

the rectification works in subsequent interim certificates. Consequently, Hola decided to

withhold payment of the sums certified under the said interim certificates.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        On 18 July 2001, the first

plaintiffs terminated the Contract on the grounds of non-payment by Hola. Hola however

asserted that the first plaintiffs' termination of the Contract was conduct amounting to

an unlawful repudiation of the Contract and accepted this repudiation, bringing the

Contract to an end. Hola called on the performance bond furnished by the first plaintiffs,

which had been guaranteed by the second plaintiff Goh Kim Hock (Goh) who is the first

plaintiffs' director.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        On 22 October 2001, the

first plaintiffs applied for an injunction to restrain Hola from receiving any monies

under the performance bond pending trial of this action. The injunction was granted on 15

January 2002. On 8 February 2002, the first plaintiffs discontinued this action against

the second defendant Lonpac Insurance Bhd, who had issued the performance bond in favour

of Hola. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The pleadings</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        The first plaintiffs'

claim against Hola was for a sum of $457,152.13, being the retention sum and the amount

certified under several interim payment certificates issued by the Architects. This amount

was disputed by Hola, who argued that the first plaintiffs had failed to take into

consideration the fact that one of the interim payment certificates (No. 13), amounted to

a negative certification to reflect items that were allegedly removed from the building

site when the first plaintiffs vacated the premises. Hola argued therefore that the

correct sum due under the payment certificates (as well as the retention sum) should only

be $358,107.94.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        Hola refused to make

payment under the payment certificates on the ground that they had valid claims against

the first plaintiffs for defective building work which they purported to set-off against

the certified amount due under Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10; this amounted to

$214,196.90.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        Further, Hola asserted

various counterclaims inter alia, for their losses resulting from the first plaintiffs'

alleged invalid determination as well as from the delay in the progress of their work and

in the hand-over of the site. Finally, Hola argued that it was entitled to receive the

full sum of $1,009,000.00 pursuant to the performance bond procured by the plaintiffs. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The issues</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        At the outset, the parties

were informed that only liability would be determined at the trial and the quantum of

damages would be decided by the Registrar at a later stage, if necessary.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs' case</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        The first issue which I

had to consider was whether the first plaintiffs' claim against Hola should succeed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        To decide this point, it

was necessary to consider whether the first plaintiffs' termination of the Contract on 18

July 2001 was valid. The first plaintiffs argued that it had terminated the Contract in

accordance with cl 26(1)(a) of the Conditions of Contract on the ground that Hola had

failed to pay monies due to them under Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10. Clause

26(1)(a) of the Conditions of Contract provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Without prejudice to any other rights and remedies which

    the Contractor may possess, if</p>
</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>(a)    The Employer does not pay to the Contractor the amount due on any

    certificate within the Period for Honouring Certificates named in the appendix to these

    Conditions and continues such default for seven days after receipt by registered post or

    recorded delivery of a notice from the Contractor stating that notice of determination

    under this Condition will be served if payment is not made within seven days from receipt

    thereof; or</p>
<p>(b)    …</p>
<p>(c)    …</p>
<p>(d)    …</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">then the Contractors may thereupon by notice by registered post or

    recorded delivery to the Employer or Architect forthwith determine the employment of the

    Contractor under this Contract; provided that such notice shall not be given unreasonably

    or vexatiously.’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        While conceding the

non-payment, Hola contended that they had a valid set-off in respect of damaged and

defective piles as against Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10. Pursuant to this right

of set-off, Hola claimed to withhold the balance amount due under Interim Certificates

Nos. 8, 9 and 10 pending rectification of the defective piles. Hola thus argued that the

first plaintiffs' termination of the Contract was invalid and amounted to an unlawful

repudiation. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Was Hola’s set-off valid? </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.        The law on equitable

set-off is clear. The doctrine has its roots in the historical intervention of the courts

of equity to allow deductions whenever there were good equitable grounds for directly

impeaching the demand which the plaintiff-creditor was seeking to enforce. The only

cross-claims that may be deducted therefrom are those that arise out of the same

transaction or are so closely connected with the plaintiff’s demands that it would be

manifestly unjust to allow him to enforce payment without taking account of the

cross-claim. As Chao J noted in <i>OCWS Logistics v Soon Meng Construction Pte Ltd</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=48296&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 2 SLR 376</a>:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">An unliquidated claim of the defendant for damages could

    be set-off if it arose from the same transaction as the claim of the plaintiff or was

    closely connected with the subject matter of the claim: this was equitable set-off, see <i>Hanak

    v Green</i> [1958] 2 QB 9 and <i>Morgan &amp; Son Ltd v Martin Johnson &amp; Co Ltd</i>

    [1949] 1 KB 107. </p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.        Similarly, the Court of

Appeal in <i>Pacific Rim</i> <i>Investments Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tiong &amp; Anor</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9398&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 3 SLR 1</a> found (at p 14) that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">…the exercise of equitable set-off is only

    permitted, if equitable considerations support such an exercise. It arises where there are

    good equitable grounds for directly impeaching the title to the legal demand which the

    creditor is seeking to enforce. As Lord Denning MR succinctly said in <i>The Nanfri,</i>

    at pp 974-975:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">…it is not every cross-claim which can be deducted. It is only

      cross-claims that arise out of the same transaction or are closely connected with it. And

      it is only cross-claims which go directly to impeach the plaintiff’s demands, that

      is, so closely connected with his demands that it would be manifestly unjust to allow him

      to enforce payment without taking into account his cross-claim.’ </p>
</blockquote></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.        I turn next to consider

whether Hola had a valid defence of set-off to the first plaintiffs' claim.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.        The first plaintiffs did

not deny responsibility in respect of the defective piles. In fact, they conceded

liability for the damaged piles and for rectification costs of 158 piles. That would mean

that the first plaintiffs conceded that Hola has a valid claim for damages. However, the

first plaintiffs objected to Hola’s claim of having a valid set-off at the time when

payment became due under the certificates, on the ground that any common law right to

set-off had been excluded by the Contract. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.        It is therefore necessary

to consider whether, by the terms of the Contract between the first plaintiffs and Hola,

the latter's right of set-off had been excluded. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Was Hola’s right of set-off excluded by the Contract? </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.        It is trite law that

parties may, by contract, exclude the remedy of equitable set-off. In <i>Pacific Rim

Investments (supra)</i>, the Court of Appeal noted that the right to an equitable set-off

may be expressly excluded by contract. It would suffice if the contract contained clear

words which excluded the right to set off, either expressly or by necessary implication: (<i>Kum

<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.        Here, the first

<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.        The first plaintiffs

submitted that on a true construction of cl 2(1), Hola was only able to recover the cost

of rectifying damaged work by way of set-off, if the Architects had issued an instruction

to the first plaintiffs to rectify the damaged work and, the first plaintiffs had failed

to comply with such instruction or do any rectification, causing Hola to engage another

contractor to rectify the work. The first plaintiffs argued that prior to 18 July 2001,

Hola had not employed another contractor to carry out the rectification work; therefore,

Hola had no right of set-off before this date. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.        To decide this point, I

considered the case of <i>Lojan Properties Pte Ltd v Tropicon Contractors Pte Ltd</i>

[1991] SLR 80, where one of the issues before the Court of Appeal was whether on the true

interpretation of the contract provisions, the appellants were entitled to deduct from the

amounts certified by the architects under an interim certificate of payment, sums of money

which the appellants claimed to have expended on the rectification of defective works

which the respondents had failed to do. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial

judge’s findings that the right of set-off had been excluded by the contract used

between the parties. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.        It is noteworthy that the

contract used by the parties in <i>Lojan Properties</i> was based on the Revised Standard

Form of the Singapore Institute of Architects (Revised SIA Form). As Karthigesu JA noted

(at p 84C):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">The unique features of the Conditions of Contract are

    that the contractor is assured of regular periodic payments during the period the contract

    works are in progress based on a retrospective revaluation of all work carried out under

    the contract (see cl 31(1) and (2)) and subject to the exceptions mentioned in cl 31(11)

    the contractor is put in a position to enforce payment if payment is not made on the due

    date by action in the courts.</p>
</font>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.        Clause 31(11) of the

Conditions of Contract in <i>Lojan Properties </i>provided:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">No certificate of the Architect shall be final and

    binding in any dispute between the employer and the contractor, whether before an

    arbitrator or in the courts, save only that, <i>in the absence of fraud or improper

    pressure or interference by either party, full effect by way of summary judgment or

    interim award or otherwise shall, in the absence of express provision, be given to all

    case may be, and until such final judgment or award <i>such decision or certificates

    he has as a fact ruled, in his certificates or the terms of the contract….[emphasis

    added].</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.        It is clear that in

coming to its decision, the court was heavily influenced by the unique features of the

contract. Karthigesu JA specifically approved the following passage from the first

instance judgment, where the judge, referring to cl 31(11), said:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">It is intended that the contractor be paid the amounts

    expressed to be payable in the interim certificates, and if no payment is made by the

    employer it is intended to enable the contractor in the absence of fraud, improper

    pressure or interference or in the absence of express provisions, to obtain quick summary

    judgment for the amounts certified as due. In so far as any sum claimed by the employer is

    concerned, only the amounts expressly deductible under the contract may be set off against

    the amount due under the interim certificate. I therefore come to the conclusion that

    subject to any deduction or set-off as provided expressly in the contract, the amounts

    certified in the interim certificates are due and payable to the plaintiffs.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.        The contract between the

parties was based on the 1980 version of ‘Agreement and Schedule of Conditions of

Building Contract (Private edition without quantities)’, which is in turn based

largely on the RIBA/ JCT forms. The contract did not contain cl 31(11) and the

corresponding concept of ‘temporary finality’ which was introduced in the

Revised SIA Form specifically to limit the Employer’s right of set-off. The absence

of cl 31(11) or a clause substantially similar to it in the contract was fatal to the

first plaintiffs' argument -- that the contract had excluded Hola’s right of set-off.

</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.        The first plaintiffs

cited <i>Pembanaan Leow Tuck Chui &amp; Sons Sdn Bhd v Dr Leela’s Medical Centre Sdn

Bhd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=10027&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 2 MLJ 57</a> in support of their contention. This was a decision of the Supreme

Court of Kuala Lumpur where it was held that the express enumeration of permitted set-offs

in the contract implied that the employer was limited to make deductions which fell

strictly within the scope of permitted set-offs on the basis of the <i>expressio unius</i>

principle. The court found that there were seven express provisions in the contract which

permitted the employer to set-off sums. The court held that having regard to these

provisions, and applying the <i>expressio unius</i> principle, the common law right of

set-off had been extinguished.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.        It is interesting to note

that the contract in <i>Pembanaan</i> was very similar to the present contract between the

first plaintiffs and Hola. Clause 2(1) in the <i>Pembanaan</i> contract is identical to cl

2(1) of the Contract and states:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">The contractor shall (subject to sub-clauses (2) and (3)

    of this condition) forthwith comply with all instructions issued to him by the architect

    in regard to any matter in respect of which the architect is expressly empowered by these

    conditions to issue instructions. If within seven days after receipt of a written notice

    from the architect requiring compliance with an instruction the contractor does not comply

    therewith, then the employer may employ and pay other persons to execute any work

    whatsoever which may be necessary to give effect to such instruction and all costs

    incurred in connection with such employment shall be recoverable from the contractor by

    the employer as a debt or may be deducted by him from any monies due or to become due to

    the contractor under this contract.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.        The Supreme Court in <i>Pembanaan

</i>held that the builder was under no contractual obligation to comply with the

employer’s complaints relating to defective works unless supported by written

instructions issued by the Architects pursuant to cl 2(1). The ordinary common law right

of set-off had been extinguished, not expressly but by clear implication. As Edgar Joseph

Jr FCJ noted (at p 78):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">In our view, therefore, the express enumeration of

    permitted set-offs in a contract or sub-contract, can imply that a defendant builder or

    main contractor, as the case may be, is limited to making such deductions from the amounts

    claimed as fall strictly within the scope of permitted set-offs, and nothing else, on the

    basis of the<i> expressio unius</i> principle.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">29.        With respect, the problem

with the Supreme Court’s reasoning is that it runs counter to the decision of the

House of Lords in <i>Gilbert-Ash Ltd v Modern Engineering </i>[1974] AC 689. In that case,

the employer was empowered by three (3) conditions in the contract to make deductions from

the amount certified under interim certificates, for breaches of particular warranties by

the contractor. Lord Diplock noted (at p 719):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">The effect of these conditions is to substitute for the

    sums which would be deductible from the price by operation of law in respect of those

    breaches of contract, sums calculated in the manner agreed. <i>The expressio unius rule of

    construction cannot be prayed in aid to exclude the right of the employer to set up

    breaches of other warranties in diminution or extinction of the instalment of the purchase

    price stated in the certificate as due</i> [emphasis added.]</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">30.        There is much merit in

Lord Diplock’s observations. Apart from the obvious danger of excessive reliance on

the <i>expressio unius</i> principle which requires one to infer specific intent from

silence, it is clear that the law presumes that parties are entitled to all legal

remedies, including the defence of set-off. As Goff LJ stated (at p 988B in <i>The Nanfri;

Federal Commerce &amp; Navigation Co. Ltd v Molena Alpha Inc</i> [1978] 1 QB 927, (a case

where charterers sought to deduct from the hire due to the owners the damages arising from

the vessel’s loss of speed): </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">First, it may be said that this charterparty contains

    express provisions in clauses 11 and 14 allowing deductions and therefore on the principle

    expressio unius est exclusio alterius they should not be allowed in any other cases. In my

    judgment, however, that is not sufficient because equitable set-off is part of the general

    law and can only be excluded by clear provisions to that effect, and such an inference as

    I am now considering is not sufficient.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">31.        While it is clearly

possible to exclude any or all of these remedies by way of contract, this must be done

clearly and unequivocally; one effective means of exclusion is by way of the

‘temporary finality’ provision, as in cl 31(11) of the Revised SIA Form. It is

equally clear that the position in Singapore differs from that stated in <i>Pembanaan</i>

as the Court of Appeal in <i>Pacific Rim</i> <i>Investments </i>has quoted <i>The Nanfri</i>

with approval. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">32.        The rule laid down in <i>Gilbert-Ash</i>

is clear and simple to apply. In relation to a building contract, one starts with the

presumption that each party is to be entitled to all those remedies for breach as would

arise by operation of law, including the right of set-off. However, it is open to parties

to rebut that presumption by contrary provisions in the contract, provided that clear and

unequivocal words are used. In the present context, it was open to the parties to exclude

the defence of set-off, by using the SIA Revised Form for example, or, if the RIBA form

was preferred, by crafting additional provisions to import the concept of ‘temporary

finality’ into the contract. The parties did not choose to do so and it can only be

inferred that Hola’s right of set-off remained intact. I therefore find that

Hola’s right of set-off had not been excluded by Contract.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Had the first plaintiffs been informed that Hola intended to exercise

the right of set-off? </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">33.        I noted the first

plaintiffs' contention that they had not been informed of Hola’s intention to set-off

the amounts due under Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10; I reject their contention

that this was required for set-off. Even if I am wrong on this point, I am prepared to

accept Lau’s testimony that he had orally informed the first plaintiffs of his

intention to set off the amounts, by 24 April 2002. In his written testimony (at para 50)

Lau stated: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">…Hiap Tian Soon alleged by letter dated 25 July

    2001 that Hola’s claim was a sham and was an excuse to justify the non-payment of the

    interim certificates. This was definitely not true since I had earlier informed Goh Kim

    Hock [the second plaintiff] of my intention when he came to look for me for payment. I had

    also told him on a number of occasions that payment would not be made until the damaged

    piles were rectified and stated so in my letter to the first plaintiffs dated 31 July

    2001…</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Were Hola’s losses quantifiable by a reasonable assessment made in

good faith?</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">34.        The next main contention

on the part of the first plaintiffs in relation to the set-off was, that Hola’s

losses in relation to the defective piles were not ‘quantifiable by means of a

reasonable assessment made in good faith’. In support of this argument, the first

plaintiffs pointed out that the project's quantity surveyor, Ian Chng Cost Consultants

(the Quantity Surveyor) only replied with a cost assessment on 23 July 2001, after the

first plaintiffs' purported termination of the Contract. The first plaintiffs argued that

Hola had not quantified their damages in good faith at the time they purported to set-off

their claim, and were therefore precluded from relying on the defence of equitable

set-off. As counsel for the first plaintiffs submitted:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Even if the right to set-off did arise, the damages or

    cost of rectifying the piles was never quantified by means of a reasonable assessment made

    in good faith, at least prior to the date of the termination of the Contract (i.e. 18 July

    2001).</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">35.        Hola on the other hand,

argued that while a reasonable assessment of the unliquidated damages must be made in good

faith in order for the right of equitable set-off to be exercised, the party purporting to

exercise the set-off need not arrive at an accurate and exact figure. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">36.        It is clear from <i>Pacific

Rim Investments</i> that equitable set-off may only be exercised where the loss is

quantifiable by means of a reasonable assessment made in good faith. As Thean JA noted in <i>Pacific

Rim Investments </i>(at p 11): </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">The majority of the Court of Appeal [in <i>The Nanfri</i>],

    Lord Denning MR and Goff LJ, agreed that in the circumstances the appellant charterers

    were entitled to an equitable set-off and to deduct from the hire, sums as loss arising

    from the loss of speed because the claims were so closely connected, <i>provided that the

    unliquidated loss was quantifiable by means of a reasonable assessment made in good faith</i>

    [emphasis added.]</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">37.        Indeed, in <i>The Nanfri</i>,

Lord Denning MR specifically noted (at p 975E):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">If the charterer quantifies his loss by a reasonable

    assessment made in good faith – and deducts the sum quantified – then he is not

    in default. The shipowner cannot withdraw his vessel on account of non-payment of hire nor

    hold him guilty at that point of any breach of contract. If it subsequently turns out that

    he has deducted too much, the shipowner can of course recover the balance. But that is

    all.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">38.        It is clear from the

above passage that all that is required from the party purporting to exercise the right of

set-off is, that he seeks to quantify his loss in a bona fide way by reasonable means. The

party does not actually have to produce a specific and final figure, quantified by

professional quantity surveyors, contrary to what the first plaintiffs suggested.

Similarly, the fact that the estimated figure may eventually turn out to be too high or

too low is not, in itself, sufficient to preclude a party from relying on set-off as a

defence. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">39.        There was evidence that

some attempts were made by Hola to obtain an estimate of the cost of the rectification

works. Lau testified (para 40 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief) that he had obtained

a verbal estimate from the Quantity Surveyor for the sum of S$200,000.00 prior to the

purported termination:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">…I do remember that during the course of these

    discussions in or about April 2001, one of the Consultants had estimated the cost of the

    rectification of the damaged piles to be in the region of $200,000.00.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">40.        Wong Kwong Yow of ASE

Designtec (the structural engineer) had also deposed (para 28 of his affidavit) to this

discussion and the verbal estimate that was offered, in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">[Mr Peter Lau] also requested for an estimate of the

    cost of repairs. I remember that during the discussion, the sum of $200,000.00 was brought

    up in passing, being the estimated cost of rectification for the defective piles.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">41.        In addition, Lau obtained

a second verbal estimate from a friend of his who was in the construction industry (who

did not testify) who informed Lau that the estimated cost of repairs would be

approximately $300,000.00. However, no evidence was offered by Hola to explain how these

estimates were arrived at.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">42.        It is important to

remember that what is reasonable depends on the facts of each case. In deciding what a

reasonable assessment is, the court must take into account various factors. I propose to

list just a few factors. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">43.        First, the quantum of the

sum purported to be set-off is highly relevant. Here, Hola were seeking to set-off a sum

of $214,196.90, which is by no means a small amount. Further, this sum would, but for the

set-off, have clearly been due to the first plaintiffs, as these sums were certified by

the Architects. Secondly, the court must consider the complexity of the rectification

works required. While parties are clearly not required to have ascertained the exact cause

of the problem or calculated the rectification cost down to the last dollar, they should

at least draw a distinction between rectification which is easily quantifiable (e.g. if

all that was required was the purchase of certain materials to replace defective

materials) and that which would clearly require closer consideration such as in this case,

where different parties were giving differing quotes. In the latter instance, the party

who is purporting to exercise the right of set-off will be held to a higher standard than

he would have been held to in the first situation. While, as I have stated earlier, it

would not have been necessary for Hola to have obtained a full quantity surveyor’s

report in order to meet the reasonableness requirement, they certainly must have done more

than they actually did. It is not enough to obtain two casual verbal estimates in passing;

at the very least, Hola must have had some basis or engaged in some form of rational

analysis before coming to an estimate of the costs involved. I find that the two estimates

used by Hola were not reasonable and that Hola had failed to show that the losses had been

quantified by means of a reasonable assessment. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">44.        Consequently, it is not

open to Hola to rely on the defence of equitable set-off as, the loss in respect of which

they were purporting to exercise the set-off was not quantifiable by means of a reasonable

assessment made in good faith. As such, the first plaintiffs' termination of the Contract

was valid. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Quantum of the first plaintiffs' claim </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">45.        The next issue which I

have to consider is whether the quantum claimed by the first plaintiffs was appropriate.

Assuming their claim against Hola was valid, Hola should be liable for the total amount

certified under the interim payment certificates and which remains outstanding. Hola had

argued that the sum should be $358,107.94 whereas the first plaintiffs put forward a

higher figure of $457,152.13, which failed to take into account Interim Certificate No 13

(which showed a negative certification of $84,050.76). As the total amount certified under

all the interim payment certificates came to $1,310,661.83 and, by the plaintiffs' own

evidence, the amount received from Hola was $952,553.89, the quantum of the first

plaintiffs' claim should logically be the difference between the two (2) amounts, which is

Hola’s figure of $358,107.94. However, in the event the first plaintiffs disagree

with my calculations, I direct the Registrar to assess the amount due and owing to them.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Hola’s counterclaims</p></i><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">

whether Hola’s counterclaims have any merit. </p></font><i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Damages for the delay in the progress of the plaintiff’s work</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">47.        Hola argued that the

first plaintiffs were in breach of their obligation to proceed regularly and diligently,

pursuant to cl 25 of the Contract which provides:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

</ol>
<blockquote xmlns="">

      repeat such default (whether previously repeated or not), then the Employer without

      prejudice to other rights or remedies, may within ten days after such continuance or

      repetition by notice by registered post or recorded delivery forthwith determine the

      employment of the Contractor under this Contract provided that such notice shall not be

      given unreasonably or vexatiously.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">48.        Against this, the first

plaintiffs contended that their obligation was only to complete the project by the date of

completion provided for in the Contract. Since they had validly terminated the Contract

before this date, it would be illogical to speak about them being responsible for the

delay in the completion of the project. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">49.        Following the Court of

Appeal’s decision in <i>Jurong Engineering Ltd v Paccan Building Technology Pte Ltd</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49367&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 3 SLR 667</a>, the law on this point is clear. The main contractors in <i>Jurong

Engineering</i> terminated the subcontract on the grounds that the subcontractor had

failed to proceed with reasonable diligence and had thus breached the agreement between

the parties. The court held that ‘reasonable diligence’ could only be determined

by pacing the progress of the subcontractor’s work against the subcontract programme.

As Goh J opined (at p 668):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">If the progress of the subcontract works consistently

    lagged behind and did not keep pace with the subcontract programme, then the respondents

    [subcontractors] could not be said to be progressing with reasonable diligence.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">50.        Goh J also quoted <i>Hudson’s

Building and Engineering Contracts</i> (11 ed vol 2 paras 9-034 and 9-035 (where it was

stated that ‘..<i>it would be absurd, it is submitted, if the owner was to be without

remedy until after a perhaps distant completion date…’. </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">51.        While the material

contractual term in <i>Jurong Engineering</i> was ‘reasonable diligence’, I am

of the view that the same principles should apply when one is dealing with the phrase

‘regularly and diligently’, as was used in the Contract. On the facts before me,

I find that the first plaintiffs' progress of work consistently lagged behind the

construction programme which they had furnished to Hola and the Architects. By January

2001, some six (6) months after the date of commencement of the work, the first plaintiffs

were already 2 months in delay when the progress of their work was measured against the

construction programme they had submitted. This delay was very serious in the light of the

fact that the contractual completion date was 9 October 2001, a mere 10 months away.

Further, it should be noted that the first plaintiffs persisted in their delay despite

reminders from Hola to expedite the work. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">52.        Despite the Architects'

request (on or about 19 January 2001) that the first plaintiffs expedite the work and

submit a revised master programme which incorporated efforts to make up for lost time, the

latter submitted a revised construction programme pushing back the completion date to

December 2001. However, the first plaintiffs were soon in delay again, even in respect of

the revised programme. By April 2001, they were more than 3 months behind the revised

schedule A second revised programme submitted in or about May 2001, showing an expected

completion date of April 2002. However, by 19 June 2001, the first plaintiffs reported

that they were 50 days behind schedule under the second revised programme. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">53.        I cannot accept the first

plaintiffs' contention that they were at all times ready and willing to carry out

rectification works and that the delay was in fact caused by the fact that the BCA had not

given approval to carry out such rectification. It is clear from the evidence that the

first plaintiffs had failed to do even those rectification works that did not need BCA

approval; for example, they failed to produce the necessary soil and earth movement

reports. Whilst the delay began in late 2000 or early 2001, soon after the date of

commencement, I find that the first plaintiffs only submitted rectification proposals as

late as June 2001. This was clear from the architect’s testimony in cross-examination

(N/E 135-136): </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Q: In relation to damaged piles and sewer, you agree 1<sup>st</sup>

    Plaintiffs were anxious to rectify?</p>
<p align="justify">A: No.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: You agree 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs showed willingness to rectify

    the damaged works?</p>
<p align="justify">A: No.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: Why?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Despite several reminders from my engineer to submit ECC surveys,

    they were slow in responding despite several reminders at site meetings week after week.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: But 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiffs complied with your engineer’s

    instructions and submitted rectification proposals?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Eventually yes they did submit plan quite late, June-July 2001, 2-3

    months later.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">54.        The first plaintiffs had

also argued that even on the assumption that the progress of works was in delay, this

would not by itself be a breach of contract, as cl 25 only gave Hola a right to determine

their employment. This argument must be rejected in the light of <i>Jurong Engineering</i>

where, the Court of Appeal clearly envisaged that the breach of the obligation to proceed

with reasonable diligence will give rise to damages as well as to a right to terminate the

contractor’s employment. It should be noted that the Court of Appeal quoted the

following extract from <i>Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</i> (11 ed vol

2 para 9-034) with approval: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">…even in the absence of an express term for due

    diligence and of any linked express termination clause, both such terms require to be

    implied by law, in construction contracts and subcontracts generally, as a matter of

    business efficacy<i>. The primary obligation will, it is submitted, sound in damages</i>

    if within the rules of remoteness, as where the nature of the work undertaken indicates

    that work by other contractors of the owner, or in a subcontract of the main contractor,

    or commitments entered into with neighbours or others, are within the contemplation of the

    contract as being dependent on the maintenance of a reasonable rate of

    progress….[emphasis added.]</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">55.        I therefore allow

Hola’s counterclaim for loss and damages for breach of the Contract arising from the

first plaintiffs' failure to proceed with reasonable diligence. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Delay in handing over the site </p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">56.        The Contract was

terminated on 18 July 2001. Pursuant to cl 26(2)(a) of the Conditions of Contract, the

contractor was obliged to hand over the site of the project within 7 days, i.e. by 24 July

2001. However, the site was only handed over by the first plaintiffs on 3 October 2001.

Hola claimed that the first plaintiffs were liable for the losses suffered by Hola arising

from the delay in the hand-over of the site, between 24 July 2001 and 3 October 2001. The

first plaintiffs only conceded liability in respect of the delay to hand over the site,

between 27 September 2001 and 3 October 2001. Are the first plaintiffs liable for any loss

suffered by Hola, arising from the delay in handing over, between 24 July and 27

September, 2001? </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">57.        Hola argued that there is

no clear evidence that they had waived their right to damages against the first plaintiffs

for the late hand-over of the site between 24 July 2001 and 27 September 2001. The company

argued that it had never consented to the late hand-over, and that this was clear from

reminders that the Architects sent to the first plaintiffs requesting for the hand-over of

the site In his written testimony the architect (Cheong Jiong Chian) deposed (at paras

38-41 of his affidavit):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Initially I had waited for Hiap Tian Soon to contact me

    to arrange a date for the handover of the site. However when Hiap Tian Soon failed to

    contact me to handover the site, I directed Hiap Tian Soon by way of a letter dated 29

    August 2001 to the handover of the site on 4 September 2001.</p>
<p align="justify">However, in a letter dated 4 September 2001, Hiap Tian Soon refused to

    do so on the basis that they had not been paid for interim certificates 8, 9 and 10 and

    11. I then replied in a letter dated 7 September 2001 that the site needed to be handed

    over so that the tenderers could conduct a site inspection as part of their preparations

    for the new tender. In this respect I then suggested 11 September 2001 for the handover of

    the site. Hiap Tian Soon however proposed to hand over the site on 27 September 2001 in a

    letter dated 10 September 2001. </p>
<p align="justify">By now, Hola noted with concern the inordinate delay by Hiap Tian Soon

    to hand over the site after the termination of the contract. In a letter dated 18

    September 2001, which I forwarded to Hiap Tian Soon, Hola reiterated the urgency in taking

    over possession of the site and gave a deadline for the handover of the site – 27

    September 2001, failing which Hiap Tian Soon would be in trespass…</p>
<p align="justify">Notwithstanding this, Hiap Tian Soon only gave back possession of the

    site to Hola on or about 3 October 2001. When Hiap Tian Soon failed to hand over the site

    by 27 September 2001, I reminded them in a letter dated 28 September 2001 that they would

    be responsible for any delay in handing over the possession of the site back to

    Hola…’</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">58.        I have not seen

Hola’s letter dated 18 September 2001 as it was not tendered as evidence. After

considering the architect’s testimony and the first plaintiffs' submissions, I find

that the first plaintiffs are not liable for the delay for the period between 24 July 2001

and 4 September 2001, since Hola were themselves in delay in checking on the progress of

the hand-over and, did not write to the first plaintiffs until 29 August 2001 and, had

authorised the first plaintiffs to remain on the site until 4 September 2001 in that

letter. In respect of the period 4-27 September 2001, I accept the architect’s

testimony that Hola had in fact consented to Hiap Tian Soon’s handing over of the

site on 27 September 2001. From the architect’s testimony, it appeared that by the

letter of 18 September, Hola allowed the first plaintiffs to remain on the site until 27

September 2001, while noting that thereafter, the first plaintiffs would be regarded as

being in trespass.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">59.        I find that the first

plaintiffs are not liable for the delay in handing-over of the site, between 24 July 2001

and 27 September 2001. </p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The performance bond</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">60.        Pursuant to the Letter of

Award dated 20 May 2000, the first plaintiffs had procured a performance bond in the sum

of $1,009,000.00. The amount was meant to be 10% of the original contract sum of

$10,090,000.00 as spelt out in the guarantee. Subsequently, the Architects revised the

contract sum to $7,995,000.00 following a request by Lau. The first plaintiffs

consequently contended that, given the reduction in the contract sum, the guarantee sum

must likewise be reduced to $799,500 (i.e. 10% of $7,995,000). However, Hola argued that

the parties had not contemplated the revision of the performance bond; in support of this

argument, Hola referred to Goh's evidence under cross-examination (at N/E 5):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Q: Did you ask architects or first defendants for a

    reduction?</p>
<p align="justify">A: No.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">61.        However, it would appear

clear from case-law that the claim for payment under the performance bond should be

confined to 10% of the revised contract sum, and not 10% of the original contract sum, as

argued by Hola. The Court of Appeal's decision in <i>GHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack Building

Construction Pte Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=49619&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 4 SLR 604</a> is instructive in this regard. The case

established that where the original contract sum has been revised downwards, the sum

payable under the performance bond should be based on the revised sum. It was further

deemed unconscionable for the holder of the performance bond to demand payment based on

the original contract sum. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">62.        I accept that the

revision of about 20% of the original contract sum in the present case is much lower than

the 65% revision in <i>GHL</i>. Even so, the principle established in <i>GHL</i> is clear.

The revision of the contract sum represents a reduction of the contractor’s

responsibility towards the developer. Under such circumstances, the security held by the

developer in the form of a performance bond must similarly be reduced. As was noted by

Thean JA (at p 617 of the case):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">As between GHL and Unitrack, the latter’s

    commitment under the contract was considerably reduced and similarly the security for such

    commitment would, in normal cases, be correspondingly reduced.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">63.        The Court of Appeal in <i>Dauphin

Offshore Engineering &amp; Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin

Khalifa</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=50947&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2000] 1 SLR 657</a> did not think it possible to define, in precise terms, what

constitutes <i>unconscionability</i> and stated at para 42 (p 668):</p>
<font size="3" xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">…What kind of situation would constitute unconscionability would

    have to depend on the facts of each case…There is no pre-determined categorisation.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote></font>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">64.        In the present case, the

contract sum was revised from $10,090,000.00 to $7,995,000.00. As such, the amount payable

under the performance bond should be 10% of the revised contract sum, namely $799,500.00.

It would therefore be unconscionable of Hola to call on the performance bond in the sum of

$1,090,000.00.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">65.        Hola had argued that the <i>GHL

</i>case may be distinguished as Hola and the first plaintiffs, unlike the parties in <i>GHL</i>,

did not contemplate a revision of the performance bond. This is a misreading of the <i>GHL

</i>case. The parties in <i>GHL </i>similarly did not contemplate an express revision of

the performance bond; what they had contemplated was a revision of the original contract

sum. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">66.        More importantly, the

fact that the parties did not contemplate a revision of the performance bond does not

place that sum beyond revision. In fact, the converse appears to be the case: the sum

payable under the performance bond is subject to revision <i>unless </i>the parties have

agreed that that amount is to be unaffected by any changes to the original contract sum.

This can be seen at para 28 of <i>GHL</i> (at p 617), where the Court of Appeal stated:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">GHL had not adduced any evidence to the effect that it

    was agreed that, notwithstanding the revision of the contract sum, the amount of

    performance bond would continue to be 10% of the original contract sum. It seems to us

    that in all probabilities after the revision of the contract on 30 April 1999 the parties

    contemplated that the amount of the bond would be correspondingly revised downwards to 10%

    of the revised contract sum…</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">67.        I therefore find that

Hola are only entitled to call on and demand payment on the performance bond in the sum of

$799,500.00, based on 10% of the revised contract sum; it was unconscionable of them to

claim $1,009,000.00.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Dispute over the number of piles</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">68.        There only remains one

minor issue to be addressed, relating to the number of piles in respect of which the first

plaintiffs were willing to accept liability. The first plaintiffs had accepted that they

are liable for the damaged piles and for the rectification of 158 piles. That must mean

that the first plaintiffs admitted liability in respect of the original 32 piles that were

damaged as well as the piles in grid 7/A. However, Hola had argued that in addition to

these 158 piles, the first plaintiffs were also liable for the piles subsequently

discovered to be damaged in grids 8/B and 6/A.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">69.        In a quotation dated 23

July 2001 from Hock Ann Piling Pte Ltd to the first plaintiffs (see exhibit

‘GKH-19’ in Goh's affidavit), it was stated that:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">...the nos. of RC Pile to be driven are 173 nos. as per

    the above mentioned drawing. Deducting pile cap 7/A for 20 nos. of RC piles already driven

    on 19 January 2001, the balance of RC pile will be driven will be 153 nos.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">70.        At trial, the structural

engineer<b> </b>was cross-examined on this quotation (N/E 130-131):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Q: See GKH-19 p145 of PW1’s EIC. You said to your

    counsel 187 compensating piles were required. Explain?</p>
<p align="justify">A: 153+20+5 RC piles, so total is 178 not 187. Piles driven for 7/A

    were 20 in number and again found to be damaged, so 5 more had to be added. </p>
<p align="justify">Q: If this is the case, 173 were original number of compensation piles

    but 5 more added. But 20 had been driven so balance is 153?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes.</p>
<p align="justify">Q: So total number of compensating piles should be 153+5 = 158?</p>
<p align="justify">A: Yes</p></font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">71.        It is clear that the

structural engineer’s above testimony was in relation to exhibit 'GKH-19' only, which

in turn relates to the 32 piles initially reported as damaged, as well as the piles in

grid 7/A. The exhibit was prepared before Hola discovered that the piles in grids 8/B and

6/A were damaged. Consequently, I find that the first plaintiffs are also liable for the

piles in grids 8/B and 6/A. I accept the structural engineer’s testimony that those

piles were defective, but that the defects were not discovered until much later, due to

the first plaintiffs' submission of inaccurate pile eccentricities plan to the structural

engineer. Specifically, the structural engineer had deposed (in para 32 of his affidavit):</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<font size="3"><p align="justify">Union Contractors Pte Ltd ("Union

    Contractors") who were the new contractor engaged to replace Hiap Tian Soon,

    subsequently discovered that in fact certain piles at Grid 7/A as well as Grid 8/B and

    Grid 6/A were defective. What was particularly disturbing to me was that in respect of

    Grid 8/B and Grid 6/A, Hiap Tian Soon had submitted inaccurate pile eccentricities plan to

    ASE Designtec showing that the pile eccentricities were within acceptable tolerance of

    75mm when in actual fact the actual pile eccentricity had exceeded the tolerance of

    75mm… Fortunately for Hola, these defects were noted by Union Contractors.........</p>
</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">72.        It was clear that the

first plaintiffs generally conceded liability on the damaged piles. Hence, they are liable

not just for the 158 piles, but also for the damaged piles in grids 8/B and 6/A.</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The decision</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">73.        In conclusion, I award

interlocutory judgment with costs, to the first plaintiffs on their claim against Hola. I

also award interlocutory judgment with costs, on Hola’s counterclaim for the first

plaintiffs' failure to rectify the defective works and for the delay in the works. The

first plaintiffs' liability for non-rectification shall include the defective piles in

grids 8/B and 6/A, in addition to the 158 piles in respect of which they have conceded

liability. Assessment of the first plaintiffs' claim and Hola's counterclaim shall be done

by the Registrar and the costs of such assessment shall be reserved to the Registrar.

Unless and until both claim and counterclaim have been assessed and quantified by the

Registrar and the figures set off to determine which party ultimately has to make payment,

the injunction against Hola restraining them from calling on the performance bond (which

can only be in the lesser amount of $799,500) will continue.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">74.        Finally, as a matter of

procedure, it was unnecessary for the second plaintiff to have been joined as a party to

these proceedings merely because he was the guarantor of the performance bond issued on

the first plaintiffs' behalf by Lonpac Insurance Bhd. </p>
