<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       On 7 March 2011, Oh Chun Moy, Oh Ah Yen and Oh
                    Kim Kee (“the first, second and third plaintiffs” respectively) in
                    their position as trustees of the estate of Oh Chin Seong (“the
                    Estate”) filed Originating Summons No. 183 of 2011 (“the
                    OS”) against Oh Bee Bee (“the defendant”) praying <em>inter alia</em> for the following orders under s 41 of the
                    Trustees Act (Cap 337, 2005 Rev Ed) (“the Trustees Act”) and s 67
                    of the Probate and Administration Act (Cap 251, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Probate and Administration Act”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_a"></a>(a)     That the defendant furnish proper
                        particulars and accounts of the assets and liabilities of the
                    Estate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_b"></a>(b)     An inquiry
                        be held and an account of the funeral and testamentary expenses of Oh Chin
                        Seong (“the Deceased”) be taken;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_c"></a>(c)     An inquiry be held to determine what sums have
                        been expended or liabilities incurred by the plaintiffs and the defendant or
                        some or one of them in respect of which they or some or one of them are
                        entitled to be indemnified out of the whole or any part and what parts of
                        the Estate; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_d"></a>(d)     That upon the inquiries being held, the defendant take immediate steps to
                        sign all cheques with the plaintiffs to complete the administration of the
                        Estate and distribute the Estate to all six beneficiaries within one (1)
                        month from this order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Upon hearing the parties, I granted orders in
                    terms of prayers (a), (b), (c) and (d) and awarded costs of $800 to the
                    plaintiffs excluding disbursements which would be paid on a reimbursement basis
                    by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In regard to prayer (c), I further ordered the
                    plaintiffs as trustees of the Estate to reimburse the defendant the sums of
                    $1,763.91 and $1,004 for funeral/probate expenses and expenses relating to the
                    sale of the property situated at Block 672, Woodlands Drive 71 #08-77, Singapore
                    730672 (“the flat”). In addition and provided the defendant was
                    able to furnish supporting documents by way of invoices and/or receipts, the
                    defendant was entitled to be reimbursed whatever commission (limited to 2%) that
                    she had paid for the sale of the property excluding any service fee claimed by
                    the defendant’s husband (who was not entitled to the same). Other than the
                    defendant, the second and third plaintiffs were entitled to be reimbursed
                    $1,763.91 each while the first plaintiff was entitled to be reimbursed $1,853.91
                    for expenses similarly incurred by them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Under prayer (d), I ordered that only the
                    plaintiffs and the defendant were entitled to be paid their shares from the
                    Estate. The shares due to Oh Kian Chun (“OKC”) and Oh Kian Tong
                    (“OKT”) from the Estate were not to be distributed for a period of
                    six months from the date hereof pending any claim by the defendant to their
                    shares. If the defendant failed to make her claim by 1 December 2011, the
                    plaintiffs were at liberty without the defendant’s consent to release the
                    shares to the aforesaid OKC and OKT which release would be a valid discharge at
                    law to the plaintiffs as trustees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant is dissatisfied with the above
                    orders and has filed a notice of appeal (in Civil Appeal No. 74 of 2011) against
                    my decision. I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The facts for the OS are to be found in the
                    affidavits filed by the parties, two joint affidavits were filed by the
                    plaintiffs and one by the defendant. According to the first joint affidavit
                    filed by the plaintiffs, they are the sisters of the defendant and all four are
                    the administrators as well as beneficiaries of the Estate of the Deceased (their
                    late father) who passed away on 10 June 2007. The beneficiaries of the Estate
                    also included the parties’ brothers OKC and OKT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant was in
                    control and continued to be in control of matters relating to the Estate
                    especially the accounts. They deposed that the defendant had sold the flat in
                        <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> which was an asset of the Estate,
                    which sale was completed on 29 October 2010. The plaintiffs’ solicitors
                    had written on 22 October 2010 to the defendant to ask for accounts of the
                    Estate. The defendant and her husband Ng Peng Guan (“Ng”) had, in
                    a meeting with the plaintiffs’ solicitors on 27 October 2010 agreed to
                    provide the accounts and to deposit the sale proceeds of the flat into a bank
                    account to be set up for the Estate and which would be operated by all four
                    administrators.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Estate’s bank account was duly opened
                    with United Overseas Bank Limited on 29 October 2010 and the net sale proceeds
                    ($278,376.25) of the flat deposited into the same. However, although the bank
                    account was opened in the names of the four administrators, the plaintiffs had
                    no access to the monies as the defendant held the cheque book. The defendant had
                    also collected the initial $5,000 deposit paid by the buyers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On or about 28 November 2010, the defendant and
                    Ng met the plaintiffs’ solicitors again to furnish the accounts. The
                    documents included vouchers and receipts for expenses purportedly incurred on
                    behalf of the Estate for which the defendant sought to be
                reimbursed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Meanwhile, on 24 November 2010, the solicitors
                    acting in the administration of the Estate furnished the plaintiffs’
                    solicitors with details of various bank accounts of the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 7 December 2010, the plaintiffs’
                    solicitors wrote to the defendant to inform her of the items and quantum of
                    expenses that the plaintiffs agreed or objected to, as being claimable from the
                    Estate. The plaintiffs indicated they would not agree to the defendant’s
                    intention to pay Ng for various items of expenses that were not agreed by them
                    nor would they agree to her claim for rent for keeping the Deceased’s
                    ancestral tablet at her residence. The plaintiffs also informed the defendant
                    they did not wish to make a claim against some Maybank deposits/accounts that
                    were held in the joint names of the Deceased, OKT and OKC. Neither would the
                    plaintiffs pursue any claims against two bank accounts of the Deceased, one
                    maintained with UOB and the other with Maybank. The plaintiffs’ solicitors
                    made a proposal for distribution of the Estate in the same letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 12 December 2010, the defendant rejected
                    the plaintiffs’ claims/proposals but gave no specific reasons, stating
                    only that she would seek legal advice. The plaintiffs’ solicitors sent the
                    defendant a reminder on 17 December 2010 to which the defendant responded on 19
                    December 2010 repeating her intention to seek legal advice. On 4 January 2011,
                    the plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote again to the defendant giving her another
                    two weeks to respond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 6 January 2011, the defendant made various
                    allegations against the second plaintiff (that the second plaintiff and/or her
                    husband was/were indebted to loan sharks who harassed the purchasers of the
                    flat). The plaintiffs’ solicitors pointed out the allegations were
                    irrelevant to the matter at hand. Despite another reminder from the
                    plaintiffs’ solicitors dated 26 January 2011, the defendant did not
                    respond.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     After the commencement of the OS, the
                    defendant finally responded to the plaintiffs’ allegations by affidavit.
                    In her affidavit, the defendant contended that the plaintiffs’ allegations
                    were misconceived claiming she had given full particulars of expenses incurred
                    by her on behalf of the Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The defendant alleged that after the demise of
                    the Deceased, OKT and OKC made no attempts to apply for letters of
                    administration despite the former being the eldest son of the Deceased. It was
                    she who decided with the help of Ng, that she and the plaintiffs would apply for
                    letters of administration. It was not an easy task as OKT and OKC refused to
                    give their consent to the application and the plaintiffs/she had to apply to
                    court for dispensation of the consent of the two brothers. It took two years for
                    the grant of letters of administration to be issued on 3 February
                2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The defendant deposed she objected when the
                    plaintiffs wanted to distribute the net sale proceeds of the flat to all six
                    beneficiaries including the two brothers as the latter had withdrawn $110,159.77
                    (“the sum”) from the UOB and Maybank accounts of the Deceased,
                    which were part of the assets of Estate, without the consent or knowledge of the
                    plaintiffs and yet, they chose not to pursue the matter. She disagreed with the
                    plaintiffs’ stand (as conveyed to her by the Estate’s solicitors)
                    that they would not take any action (in order to avoid further acrimony within
                    the family, and also because it was not cost effective and they had no right to
                    do so) and if the defendant wanted to take action against the brothers, she
                    would have to do so in her personal capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant did not accept the
                    plaintiffs’ decision, pointing out that $10,482.57 of the sum was
                    withdrawn using an ATM card whilst the balance of $99,883.89 had been withdrawn
                    from a joint account the Deceased held with one of the two
                brothers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The defendant disclosed in her affidavit a Tat
                    Lee Bank statement dated 26 August 2000 showing total deposits of $166,233.28 in
                    the joint account maintained by the Deceased with his wife Poh Kim Ho (the
                    parties’ mother who passed away on 5 July 2005) and a fixed deposit advice
                    from OCBC Bank of a joint account she had with the Deceased. She listed out
                    (purportedly from a notebook kept by the Deceased) joint bank deposits that the
                    Deceased had maintained with her late mother or with his various children but
                    there were no independent bank documents from the defendant to support the list
                    she produced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The plaintiffs took exception to the
                    defendant’s allegations and assertions in their reply affidavit. First,
                    they denied her allegation that they intended to distribute to the brothers
                    their brothers’ shares of the Estate. The plaintiffs deposed that they had
                    made proposals (through their solicitors) to the defendant to distribute what
                    assets they could of the Estate and later resolve the dispute of the withdrawal
                    of the sum with the brothers but the defendant had refused. The defendant had
                    further insisted on being reimbursed certain sums that they did not agree
                    to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiffs pointed out that the defendant
                    did not produce any evidence to corroborate the balances that were standing in
                    the Tat Lee Bank and OCBC accounts of the Deceased on the date of his demise.
                    Statements of the bank accounts would enable the plaintiffs to know what
                    withdrawals had been made by comparing the balances as of 10 June 2007 (date of
                    demise) with balances when the accounts were closed. Similarly, it would have
                    been useful if the defendant had produced statements from UOB and Maybank
                    showing the withdrawals of the sum by the two brothers and the balances when the
                    two accounts were closed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On the other hand, the plaintiffs deposed they
                    had evidence showing that after the Deceased’s demise, the defendant had
                    made use of the flat as storage space for goods for the business she carried out
                    with Ng who is a bankrupt. The plaintiffs surmised that it was because of
                    Ng’s bankruptcy that the defendant wanted to obtain money from the
                    Estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Finally, the plaintiffs complained that the
                    defendant had been uncooperative in her conduct. She failed to respond when the
                    plaintiffs’ solicitors wrote to her on 14 April 2011 asking that she let
                    them know what was agreed or not agreed to in this OS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     I made the orders set out earlier in <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> because from a perusal of the affidavits filed
                    by the parties and the exhibits attached thereto, it was clear to me that the
                    defendant had not produced to the plaintiffs’ satisfaction the accounts of
                    the Estate as she claimed she had, and she was not truthful in her
                    affidavit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I start by referring to the expenses that the
                    defendant claimed she had incurred on the Estate’s behalf or, were
                    allegedly owed to her by the Estate. The defendant had handed the alleged
                    accounts to the plaintiffs’ solicitors when she and Ng visited their
                    office on 28 November 2010. The figures are placed in three categories below
                    depending on whether the plaintiffs accepted liability for the items as well as
                    the quantum, accepted liability for the items but not the quantum or totally
                    rejected the items. The serial numbers stated were those set out in the
                    plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter dated 7 December 2010 to the
                    defendant.</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>(Plaintiffs’ counsel’s estimate of $23,760
                        is incorrect.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I had totalled up a sum of $7,055.65 in
                    category A being the items the plaintiff had agreed to reimburse the defendant
                    but as the plaintiffs had paid for the items equally, the defendant was only
                    entitled to be reimbursed a quarter of those items. Consequently, I divided the
                    sum by four so that the defendant’s share was $1,763.91 which sum was
                    awarded to her. The first plaintiff’s share was increased by $90
                    ($1,763.91 + $90) as she had paid the entire $90 in serial no. 7 which the other
                    three administrators did not bear. It would appear from [24A] above that
                    $7,055.65 should now be substituted by $8,469.68 (revised total of $8,559.68
                    less $90) and the defendant’s one-fourth share should now be $2,117.42
                    instead of $1,763.91 while the first plaintiff’s share should be increased
                    to $2,207.42 ($2,117.42 + $90).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     For category B, the plaintiffs had reduced the
                    defendant’s five items of claim relating to funeral expenses to $1,004 and
                    I similarly awarded her the sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The defendant was not awarded any items that
                    she had claimed in category C for the reason that she provided no supporting
                    documents. However, my order in <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a> gave the
                    defendant an opportunity to furnish proof to enable her to be reimbursed (if she
                    had indeed paid) the standard commission paid to estate agents of 2% of the sale
                    price of an HDB flat for brokering the sale. Ng however was not entitled to any
                    remuneration from the Estate as claimed or at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Cause book searches conducted by the
                    plaintiffs which were exhibited in their second affidavit showed that Ng was the
                    subject of various bankruptcy proceedings and was adjudged a bankrupt on 19
                    February 2009. When the sale of the flat was completed on 29 October 2010, Ng
                    had been a bankrupt for more than a year. As an undischarged bankrupt,
                    Ng’s estate is under the charge of the Official Assignee
                    (“OA”) and if he was indeed employed as a housing agent or even
                    acted on a freelance basis as one, he should have informed the OA as his
                    creditors would be interested in his income therefrom and whether he earned
                    enough to discharge his debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Further, apart from her bare statement on her
                    husband’s behalf, there was nothing to support the defendant’s claim
                    that Ng was instrumental in finding the buyer(s) of the flat. The plaintiffs had
                    in their first affidavit exhibited a handwritten note purportedly from Ng

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The handwritten note was at best self-serving.
                    If indeed Ng found the buyers of the flat, he should have informed the
                    plaintiffs (since they are the other administrators of the Estate) and obtained
                    their agreement to his being paid a commission as well as the rate he claimed of
                    3%, for the six services set out above (assuming he provided them]. Obtaining
                    only his wife’s agreement to the commission payment would not suffice, as
                    her agreement cannot bind the other administrators of the Estate. Equally self
                    serving and unacceptable were two receipts issued by Ng to the defendant dated 1
                    November 2007 and 1 June 2008 in the sums of $750 and $816 respectively,
                    purportedly for “transport and services during inquiry and finding
                    buyers” and for “prayer 10 June 2007 to 10 June
                    2008”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Before going further, it would be appropriate
                    at this juncture to look at the law relevant to the OS. The application was made
                    under S 41 of the Trustees Act. The relevant provision in that section is
                    actually 41S which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Trustees’ expenses</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) A trustee —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the trust funds; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b) may pay out of the trust funds,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">reasonable expenses properly incurred by him when acting on behalf of the
                        trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>[45/2004]</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) This section shall apply to a trustee who has been authorised under a
                        power conferred by Part IVA or any other written law, or by the trust
                        instrument —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) to exercise functions as an agent of the trustees; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) to act as a nominee or custodian,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">as it applies to any other trustee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It is to be noted that the operative words used in subsection (1)(a)
                    are “reasonable expenses properly incurred” in relation to a
                    trustee being reimbursed expenses incurred on behalf of a trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The OS had also referred to s 67 of the
                    Probate &amp; Administration Act. The section states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Testamentary and funeral expenses</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) The court or a judge shall allow the executors or administrators the
                        reasonable testamentary and other expenses incurred by them, and also proper
                        funeral expenses and all reasonable expenses of subsequent religious
                        ceremonies suitable to the station in life of the deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant as an administrator of the Estate is undoubtedly entitled to be paid reasonable testamentary and other
                    expenses that she had incurred on behalf of the Deceased. However, the burden
                    was on her to prove: (i) the expenses she incurred were testamentary in nature
                    and/or incurred on behalf of the Deceased and (ii) they were reasonably
                    incurred. Looking at the evidence tendered by the defendant, I was of the view
                    that she had failed to discharge the burden save for the items set out in [24A]
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     By way of one example, the defendant had
                    charged the Estate $600 per month for ten months for the rental of ancestral
                    tablet space in her home (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> <em>supra</em>) even though the plaintiffs wanted to move
                    the tablet to a temple and were willing pay for the service. Having moved the
                    tablet to her own home, the defendant had the gall to charge the Estate rent.
                    Clearly, her actions were not motivated by filial piety for her late father but
                    by pure greed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiffs had produced photographs
                    showing that the defendant and or Ng had made use of the flat before its sale,
                    as storage space for her sole-proprietorship called Guan Bee Yi Trading which
                    was in the business of handicrafts, collectibles and gifts. She did not pay rent
                    for such usage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     On the one hand, the defendant complained that
                    her two brothers should not be given their shares of the Estate because they had
                    withdrawn funds from the Deceased’s bank accounts. On the other hand, she
                    was not above misusing her own position as an administrator and a trustee to try
                    and make money from the Estate for herself and her husband.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     It is trite law which does not need repeating,
                    that the defendant owes a duty as an administrator at common law and as a
                    trustee under the Trustees Act to act in the best interests of the Estate. Her
                    conduct as reflected not only in the plaintiffs’ affidavits but in her own
                    affidavit showed that the defendant paid scant regard to her duties and
                    obligations. Instead, she seemed bent on milking the Estate for as much money as
                    she could (as the plaintiffs surmised in their second affidavit) perhaps because
                    it was the only way she and Ng could make some money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The defendant’s unseemly conduct and
                    failure to provide full accounts of the Estate and bank documents in particular,
                    despite repeated requests by the plaintiffs, prompted this court to make the
                    orders that the plaintiffs applied for in the OS, as set out in <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> earlier.</p>
