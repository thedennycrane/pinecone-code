Lucas thus maintained that there was no way he could have agreed to commit the Plaintiff to accumulator transactions. However, this conversation between Robin and Lucas was not mentioned in Lucas’ AEIC. When questioned on this omission, Lucas testified that notwithstanding Mr Gabriel’s advice, he had made a conscious decision not to include all of his evidence in his AEIC, and that “[l]ater I will explain more.”

</div> This was evident from the numerous references to “discretionary management” in his expert report. During his oral examination-in-chief, Bajaj attempted to correct his expert report during his oral examination-in-chief but did so only to the extent of deleting the word “discretionary” from some (but not all) the references to a “discretionary management” account. This was a belated retraction, and one that I could not accept as a mere oversight or a mistake. Bajaj had at other segments of his report referred expressly to “non-discretionary accounts”, as distinct from discretionary management accounts. More importantly, Bajaj went on to suggest in his report that the Plaintiff had entered into accumulators in an account the operation of which appeared to be a discretionary account (with the reference to a “discretionary management agreement” not corrected by Bajaj during his oral examination-in-chief):

The latter, in fact, was the basis of the disputed accumulator transactions between the Plaintiff and the Bank. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Bajaj used an interbank interest rate of 8% to illustrate (hypothetically) the large potential losses on an accumulator transaction. When questioned, he explained that he had used the US Dollar rate. However, it was undisputed that the disputed accumulator transactions were all denominated in Singapore Dollars, and the relevant rate was that of the Singapore Dollar interbank rate of approximately 3% at the material time. In any event, the US Dollar interbank rate was only 5–6% at the material time. The use of these lower rates would have produced smaller (hypothetical) losses than those arrived at by Bajaj.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Bajaj failed to state various sources of information on which he claimed at trial to have relied on in the preparation of his report. This was in breach of O 40A r 3(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Rules of Court (R5, Cap 322, 2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”), which requires an expert to “give details of any literature or other material which the expert witness has relied on in making the report”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Given these errors, I accorded little, if any, weight to the report of Bajaj.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Time bar</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">37 At the outset, I note that the Plaintiff’s claims in relation to the 1 March DBS AT are time barred under s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed), which provides that an action founded on a contract “shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued”.

The Plaintiff has at no time challenged these purchases.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">71 Most crucially, on 8 January 2008, the Plaintiff sold the entire allocation of the Keppel shares and approximately half of the SPC shares that it received on 3 December 2007 and 7 January 2008 pursuant to the 2 November ATs. It is undisputed that the Plaintiff made a profit on these sales. It is also undisputed that, on 14 January 2008, the Plaintiff withdrew S$1.62m from the Account, leaving a balance of S$220,326.90. Even if, (which I do not so find), the 2 November ATs had been entered into without its authorisation, the Plaintiff had by its conduct in selling the shares that it was allocated pursuant to the 2 November ATs adopted the transactions. Indeed, Lucas admitted that Erlina had given him a copy of a document reflecting a withdrawal by the Plaintiff of $1.62m from the Account a few days after 14 January 2008;

The Plaintiff did not take issue with the price at which the 2 November Keppel AT had been entered into in its pleadings, and raised this only belatedly when cross-examining Amy. Even so, the Plaintiff did not question Tan on this price differentia. In any event, instructions were to enter the market at the prevailing price, which meant that the purchase price was, as Amy testified, “plus-minus 12.60”.

</div>
</div> The prices and availability of shares change constantly, and if every relatively small difference in the price requires a confirmation from the customer, it is unlikely that any such trade can be done. Moreover, as Amy explained, the essence of an accumulator is the purchase of agreed quantities of shares by an investor at a <span class="font-italic">percentage </span>discount to the prevailing market price of the shares at the time of entry into the accumulator. The knock-out and knock-in prices in relation to the accumulator are also set as a <span class="font-italic">percentage</span> of this prevailing market price.

</div> Accordingly, very slight variances in the strike price of the shares have little impact on the profitability of the investment. That said, such a practice has its limits and if prices vary by too much, which will usually be due to a change in the market conditions, then the confirmation should be sought once again from the customer. Each case must turn on its own facts. Here the instructions were clear and the difference was not significant enough given the circumstances of the case and the customer’s approach. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">73 Accordingly, I found that the 2 November ATs were authorised by and entered into upon the instructions of the Plaintiff.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">74 Amy provided a table in her AEIC that listed seven other accumulator transactions (apart from the 3ATs and the 2 November ATs) which the Plaintiff had entered into through the Bank. All of these seven accumulator transactions were profitable; the only unprofitable accumulator transactions were the 1 March DBS AT and the 16 April DBS AT, which had to be force-sold on 22 January 2008 after the account went into margin call.

I also note that other financial investments were entered into by the Plaintiff, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, 15 Dual Currency Investments (“DCI”) trades in 2006 and 3 DCI trades in 2007, all of which generated profits, as well as 12 investments in Equity Linked Notes (“ELNs”) in 2006 and 22 investments in ELNs in 2007.

</div> These too were not challenged by Lucas and Lenny.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">75 Lucas’ assertion that there was no claim in respect of some of these seven accumulators because there was no loss is at odds with the Plaintiff’s case that:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(a) it did not know what accumulators were (but as noted above it was happy nonetheless to take the profits);</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(b) the Bank could not enter into any accumulator transactions unless it was authorised in writing by Lucas or Lenny, given that there were no such documentary records for these seven other accumulators; and </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">(c) it never complained about these accumulator transactions, entered into allegedly without Lucas or Lenny’s written authorisation, from the time they were entered into until 2013 (having allegedly only known of them in June 2008). </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">76 At this juncture, I note that the Plaintiff’s case that it only knew of these accumulator transactions in June 2008 is contradicted by documentary evidence which shows that in January 2008, a solicitor from the law firm DLA Piper, Mr Jeffrey Ong, was authorised to collect documents from the Bank on behalf of Lucas and Lenny. Accordingly, on its own evidence, the Plaintiff must have, at the very least, known of these transactions in January 2008, when Mr Jeffrey Ong collected the documents. I also disbelieve the story of Lucas and Lenny that Robin died whilst allegedly helping Lucas investigate these transactions and Lucas was too upset to think of commencing proceedings. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The discrepancies in the Bank’s records</span></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">77 I pause to observe that there were quite a number of discrepancies in the Bank’s internal records, some of which had been reviewed and approved not only by Amy and her team but also by senior officers of the Bank. First, the Client Order Processing System (“COPS”) tickets stated that the instructing party was “Erlina” rather than “Lucas” or “Lenny”. Secondly, the Direct Access Clients (“DAC”) forms were filled up inconsistently, with a tick beside the box for “EQ derivative products” despite a handwritten annotation of “no structured products”.

</div> Fourthly, a Risk Compass that was supposed to be prepared by the Bank to assess the risk appetite and sophistication of the Plaintiff was missing.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">78 Although Erlina was identified as the “client” on the COPS tickets, it is clear that the true party with whom the Defendants dealt in relation to the 3ATs and the 2 November ATs was the Plaintiff. As the trusted assistant of Lucas and Lenny (see [50] above), Erlina was simply the conduit through which Lucas and Lenny, the authorised representatives of the Plaintiff, conveyed their investment decisions to the Defendants. All transactions instructions that Erlina conveyed to the Defendants were conveyed with the authority of the Plaintiff and/or its authorised representatives. The Plaintiff received and did not object to the confirmations, advices, and statements of the transactions that they had entered pursuant to these instructions (see [58] above). Finally, Lucas’ allegation of a conspiracy by Erlina to defraud him was implausible, and I rejected the same (see [49] above). </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">79 Nevertheless, the discrepancies suggest that the Defendants were, in the words of Amy and Tan, regrettably “sloppy” and “loose in [their] documentation”, and lend some force to the Plaintiff’s contention that it was a client of low sophistication whom the Bank should never have allowed to enter accumulator transactions.
