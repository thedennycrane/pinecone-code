<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In today’s globalised world where claims
                    often involve parties from different jurisdictions, enforcement is of key
                    concern to a plaintiff. This case raises the interesting question of whether a
                    court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction to enter judgment after considering
                    the merits of the plaintiff’s case rather than in default of appearance
                    pursuant to O 13 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 332, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) – the former being a foreign
                    judgment enforceable in the defendant’s jurisdiction and the latter one
                    that is not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 25 May 2010, the plaintiff filed a writ of
                    summons with its statement of claim endorsed in the High Court. The plaintiff
                    claimed against the defendant US$491,682.46 for the provision of international
                    calling services that the defendant had not paid for, contractual interest of
                    two percent per month and costs on an indemnity basis. The international calling
                    services were provided pursuant to two agreements: (1) a “Service
                    Request-Cum-Agreement for Corporate Voice Delivery (CVD) Service”
                    (“the CVD agreement”); and (2) a “Service
                    Request-Cum-Agreement for SingTel International Private Leased Circuit (IPLC)
                    Service” (“the IPLC agreement”) (collectively “the
                    Agreements”) entered into on 12 December 2005. The Agreements
                    incorporated “Specific Terms and Conditions for CVD Service” and
                    “Specific Terms and Conditions for IPLC Service”, respectively, as
                    well as the plaintiff’s “General Terms and Conditions of
                    Service”, two versions of which are applicable to the present dispute,
                    namely one effective from 1 June 2004 and another effective from 1 August 2006.
                    Both versions of the plaintiff’s General Terms and Conditions stipulated
                    in cl 17.1 that the laws of Singapore would govern any disputes arising
                    from the Agreements and that the defendant submitted to the non-exclusive
                    jurisdiction of the Singapore courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 15 June 2010, the plaintiff applied for leave
                    to serve the writ of summons and statement of claim out of jurisdiction under O
                    11 r 1(d)(iii), (iv) and O 11 r 1(r) of the Rules. An Assistant Registrar
                    granted an order in terms on 17 June 2010 (“the 17 June 2010
                    Order”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       After an initial unsuccessful attempt to serve
                    the writ of summons and statement of claim on the defendant on 8 December 2010
                    at its registered office in New Delhi (Green Park, F-65, New Delhi, Delhi
                    110016, India) and its place of business in Noida (B-24, 25 Sector 1, Noida
                    210301, India), the plaintiff’s Indian solicitors, Kochhar &amp; Co,
                    served original and translated copies of the writ of summons, statement of claim
                    and the 17 June 2010 Order on the defendant by way of email on 29 March 2011, at
                    the defendant’s email address maintained by the Ministry of Corporate
                    Affairs, Government of India, New Delhi (vkgupta27@hotmail.com). Kochhar &amp;
                    Co confirmed that such a mode of service was in accordance with the laws of
                    India as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Order V Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as applicable in
                        India permits service of summons on a Defendant/Respondent by means of
                        transmission of documents by fax message or electronic mail service.
                        Accordingly, service of summons by email is recognized and accepted form of
                        service in India.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff filed its memorandum of service on
                    20 April 2011 instead of within the time period of 8 days from the date of
                    service of the writ of summons and statement of claim due to inadvertence. The
                    defendant failed to enter appearance after 21 days from the date of service and
                    the plaintiff obtained a certificate of non-appearance dated 11 May 2011
                    confirming the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 11 May 2011, the plaintiff filed Ex Parte
                    Summons No 2049 of 2011 praying for an extension of time for filing the
                    memorandum of service as well as for judgment to be entered against the
                    defendant. In an affidavit filed in support of the application, counsel for the
                    plaintiff requested that the court consider the pleadings and the affidavits
                    filed in order to enter judgment on the merits of the case. Counsel deposed
                    that, as advised by Kochhar &amp; Co, the enforceability of a foreign judgment
                    may be challenged in India if it had been given on account of the
                    defendant’s default of appearance without any consideration of the
                    evidence or the pleadings, <em>ie</em>, Indian law would
                    not enforce a foreign judgment that had not been given “on the merits of
                    the case”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Section 44A of the Indian Civil Procedure Code
                    1908 (see Manohar &amp; Chitaley, <em>The A.I.R.
                        Manual</em> vol 4 (All India Reporter Pvt Ltd, 6th Ed, 1979) at
                    p 958) relates to the enforcement of foreign judgments and provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) Where a certified copy of a decree of any of the superior courts of
                        any reciprocating territory has been filed in a district court, the decree
                        may be executed in India as if it had been passed by the district
                        court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) ... the district court shall <em>refuse execution of
                            any such decree</em>, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the
                        Court that the decree falls within <em>any of the exceptions
                            specified in clauses (a) to (f) of section 13</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Section 13 (which contains the exceptions to the
                    rule that foreign judgments are conclusive) states in relevant part that (see
                    Manohar &amp; Chitaley, <em>The A.I.R. Manual</em> vol 4
                    (All India Reporter Pvt Ltd, 6th Ed, 1979) at p 700):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly
                        adjudicated upon between the same parties or between parties under whom they
                        or any of them claim litigating under the same title except - ... (b)
                            <em>where it has not been given on the merits of the
                            case</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">According to the advice of Kochhar &amp; Co, the mere fact that a
                    judgment was obtained <em>ex parte</em> did not <em>per se</em> justify a finding that a decision was not
                    “on the merits of the case”. As laid down by the Kerala High Court
                    in <em>Govidan Asari Kesavan Asari v Sankaran Asari Balakrishanan
                        Asari</em> AIR 1958 Ker 203 and affirmed by the Supreme Court of India
                    in <em>International Woollen Mills v Standard Wool (UK)
                        Ltd</em> [2001] 2 LRI 765, even where the defendant chooses to keep
                    out of a case, it is possible for the plaintiff to adduce evidence in respect of
                    his claim, so that the foreign court may give a decision on the merits of the
                    case after due consideration of the evidence instead of dispensing with such
                    consideration and giving a judgment merely on account of the defendant’s
                    default of appearance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The two main issues arising in the
                    plaintiff’s application were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the court had the
                        jurisdiction to enter judgment after considering the merits of the case
                        where a plaintiff was entitled to judgment in default under O 13
                        r 1 of the Rules but had adduced evidence that such a judgment would
                        not be enforceable in the jurisdiction where the defendant and its assets
                        may be found; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     If so, whether the plaintiff was entitled to judgment on the evidence
                        adduced before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I answered both questions in
                    the affirmative and now set out the detailed grounds of my
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Jurisdiction </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The plaintiff argued that the court had the
                    inherent jurisdiction to enter judgment after considering the merits of the case
                    although the plaintiff was entitled to judgment in default of appearance under
                    O 13 r 1 of the Rules. The existence of O 13 r 1 did not
                    limit the court’s inherent powers by virtue of O 92 r 4, which provided
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that nothing in these
                        Rules shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the Court to
                        make any order as may be necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an
                        abuse of the process of the Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plaintiff submitted that, in this case, injustice would be caused
                    by the entry of default judgment because such a judgment would not be
                    enforceable in India where the defendant and its assets may be found (see
                        <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>–<a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above). The plaintiff would not be able to enforce its legal
                    rights without being put to the considerable inconvenience and expenses of
                    commencing proceedings in India.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiff also relied heavily on <em>Berliner Bank AG v Karageorgis and another</em> [1996] 1
                    Lloyd’s Rep 426 (“<em>Berliner
                    Bank</em>”) as an instance where the English Court, faced with a
                    similar situation, had exercised its inherent jurisdiction to try a case on its
                    merits although judgment in default of appearance could have been entered. In
                    that case, the plaintiff bank claimed against the defendants pursuant to certain
                    guarantees. The defendants were served with the writ but did not acknowledge
                    service. Mr Justice Colman recognised that the plaintiff was entitled to default
                    judgment under O 13 r 1 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (SI 1965 No
                    1932) (UK) (“the English Rules”) (the equivalent of O 13
                    r 1 of the Rules), but noted (at 427) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... default judgments such as one would obtain under O. 13 are in many
                        cases effectively unenforceable outside the jurisdiction of the English
                        Courts. This is because the defendant has taken no part in the proceedings
                        and, no doubt, because the Court in giving judgment in this automatic way
                        has not reviewed the merits of the claim, has not investigated the substance
                        of the claim and has directed no judicial mind to whether in fact the
                        plaintiff is entitled to recover. In those circumstances one can quite see
                        that there is some reluctance in overseas jurisdictions to enforce default
                        judgments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Colman J took the view that the facility
                    of an automatic judgment was permissive and that the court had an inherent
                    jurisdiction in relation to both O 13 (default of appearance) and O 19 (default
                    of defence) of the English Rules to order a full trial of the claim. He held
                    that that it would be “inappropriate” for the court to decline to
                    exercise its inherent jurisdiction to do so where “there is material
                    before it to suggest that a judgment obtained by the automatic method might well
                    not be enforceable in foreign jurisdictions where the defendant is known to have
                    assets or where there is a reasonable belief that he might have assets”
                    (see <em>Berliner Bank</em> at 428). Colman J then
                    proceeded to consider the affidavits placed before the court and entered
                    judgment for the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The approach in <em>Berliner
                        Bank</em> has been applied in the subsequent cases of <em>Habib Bank Ltd v Central Bank of Sudan (formerly known as Bank of
                        Sudan)</em> [2007] 1 WLR 470 and <em>Trafigura Pte Ltd,
                        Trafigura Beheer BV v Emirates General Petroleum Corporation</em>
                    [2010] EWHC 87 (Comm).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Before addressing the plaintiff’s
                    submissions, it is important to take a step back to consider the nature of the
                    court’s inherent powers and its relationship with the Rules. <em>Per</em> Andrew Phang J in <em>Wellmix
                        Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 117 at [81], O 92 r 4 “was not intended to allow the
                    courts <em>carte blanche</em> to devise any procedural
                    remedy they think fit”. As provided under s 80(1) of the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), the Rules are made for the
                    purposes of “regulating and prescribing the procedure ... and the
                    practice to be followed in the High Court and the Court of Appeal respectively
                    in all causes and matters whatsoever”. Nevertheless, as eloquently put by
                    Professor Jeffrey Pinsler, SC (see Jeffrey Pinsler, SC, <em>Supreme Court Practice 2009</em> (Lexis Nexis, 2009) at p8):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... no body of rules, no matter how comprehensive, can cater to the
                        unlimited variety of circumstances which may arise in the course of
                        litigation. Although cases may have common elements, the particularity of
                        the facts which arise may require special consideration. <em>The rules may not contemplate the particular circumstances of the case
                            and there may therefore be no available procedure. A strict application
                            of procedural law may lead to injustice in a certain situation, an
                            outcome which the court may regard as not having been foreseen by the
                            statutory machinery</em>. It is here that the doctrine of inherent
                        jurisdiction has an important role to play by virtues of its flexibility and
                        permeability. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Recognising this, the Court of Appeal in
                        <em>Wee Soon Kim Anthony v The Law Society of
                        Singapore</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 821 at [27], considered the nature of the
                    court’s inherent jurisdiction and held that its exercise “should
                    not be circumscribed by rigid criteria or tests” and that the court must
                    in each instance “exercise it judiciously”, with the
                    “essential touchstone” being that of “need”.
                    Accordingly (see <em>Roberto Building Material Pte Ltd and others
                        v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd and another</em> [2003]
                    2 SLR(R) 353 at [17]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[the court’s] inherent jurisdiction should only be invoked in
                        exceptional circumstances where there is a clear need for it and the justice
                        of the case so demands. The circumstances must be special.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I take the view that this case was an instance
                    where there was such an exceptional need. First, the Rules did not contemplate
                    the particular circumstances of the case before me, leaving there no available
                    procedure for the plaintiff to follow if it did not wish to obtain default
                    judgment (which could not be enforced where the defendant and its assets may be
                    found) but wished to obtain judgment on the merits instead. Order 13 r 1 of the
                    Rules did not <em>compel</em> the plaintiff to take out an
                    application for default judgment if the defendant failed to enter an appearance
                    within the stipulated time, rather, it provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a writ is endorsed with a claim against a defendant for a liquidated
                        demand only, then, if that defendant fails to enter an appearance, the
                        plaintiff <em>may</em>, after the time limited for
                        appearing, enter final judgment against that defendant for a sum not
                        exceeding that claimed by the writ in respect of the demand and for costs,
                        and proceed with the action against the other defendants, if any. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The plain and ordinary meaning of the word “may”
                    connotes permissiveness or an express possibility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The legislative history of the provision does
                    not suggest that the provision should be construed otherwise. Order 13 r 1(1) of
                    the Rules may be traced to O 13 r 1(1) of the English Rules, which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a writ is indorsed with a claim against a defendant for a liquidated
                        demand only, then, if that defendant fails to give notice of intention to
                        defend, the plaintiff <em>may</em>, after the
                        prescribed time enter final judgment against that defendant for a sum not
                        exceeding that claimed by the writ in respect of the demand and for costs,
                        and proceed with the action against the other defendants, if any. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This provision has been held to be permissive in nature (see <em>Berliner Bank</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Further, O 13 r 1 of the Rules may
                    be considered alongside O 19 r 2 of the Rules (judgment in default of
                    defence) as both relate to automatic judgments where a liquidated claim is
                    involved. In <em>Panwell Investments Pte Ltd v Lau Ee
                        Theow</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 73 at [24], Warren Khoo J considered O 19
                    r 2 of the Rules and held that it was “clear from the
                    authorities” that the rule allowing a plaintiff to apply for judgment in
                    default of defence was “merely a <em>permissive</em>
                    rule, and <em>not one to be applied as a matter of course in all
                        cases</em>” [emphasis added]. There can be no sensible basis to
                    distinguish between a judgment in default of appearance and one in default of
                    defence in this context, given their similar language (“the plaintiff may
                    ... enter final judgment”) in O 13 r 1(1) and O 19
                    r 2, their similar source (the English Rules) as well as their similar
                    function and purpose in the scheme of the Rules (to enable a plaintiff to obtain
                    judgment expeditiously in the event of default by the defendant).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The exercise of the court’s inherent
                    jurisdiction to offer an alternative to automatic judgment therefore did not run
                    contrary to the procedural system carefully laid out in the Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Second, there would be serious injustice to
                    the plaintiff if the court refrained from exercising its inherent jurisdiction
                    in the circumstances presented. I accepted the evidence before me on the Indian
                    Civil Procedure Code 1908, which excepts a foreign judgment which had not been
                    given on the merits of the case from recognition in India (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>–<a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>
                    above). As reasoned by Colman J in <em>Berliner
                        Bank</em> at 428 (see <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>–<a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above) it
                    would be inappropriate for the court to decline to exercise its inherent
                    jurisdiction to proceed to try a claim rather than enter automatic judgment
                    where there was “material before it to suggest that a judgment obtained
                    by the automatic method might well not be enforceable in foreign jurisdictions
                    where the defendant is known to have assets or where there is a reasonable
                    belief that he might have assets”. This was particularly so on the facts
                    of this case where the foreign defendant had agreed to have Singapore law govern
                    the Agreements and had also agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the
                    Singapore courts. It would make a mockery of the contractual rights of the
                    plaintiff if the defendant could, by failing to enter an appearance in the
                    Singapore courts despite having been properly served with the writ of summons
                    and statement of claim, avoid the consequences of failing to perform its
                    obligations by challenging the default judgment at the enforcement stage. The
                    only recourse the plaintiff would then have would be to commence proceedings
                    afresh in India, which would not only put it to considerable expense, but would
                    also significantly delay its ability to enforce its rights. This would not be in
                    the interests of justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Finally, I also considered whether prejudice
                    would be suffered by the defendant if the court were to exercise its inherent
                    jurisdiction. The result of the court exercising its inherent jurisdiction in
                    this case would be the court assessing the plaintiff’s case on its merits
                    as opposed to entering default judgment. No prejudice would be caused to the
                    defendant in this event – in the former scenario, the court may decline to
                    enter judgment for the plaintiff despite the requirements for entering default
                    judgment being met whereas in the latter, <em>ceteris
                        paribus</em>, there would be automatic entry of judgment. As the
                    defendant had absented itself from the proceedings by failing to enter an
                    appearance, it could not possibly object to judgment, whether on the merits or
                    in default, being entered in its absence. Even assuming that the court entered
                    judgment on the merits for the plaintiff, the defendant would still have some
                    recourse if the judgment was improperly obtained. For example, if the plaintiff
                    failed to make full and frank disclosure to the court during the <em>ex parte</em> hearing (see <em>The
                        “Vasiliy Golovnin”</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 at
                    [83]), the defendant could apply to the Singapore courts to have the judgment
                    set aside. The court’s consideration of the plaintiff’s case on its
                    merits rather than automatically entering judgment in default of appearance
                    therefore did not deprive the defendant of any substantial rights or cause the
                    defendant prejudice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I therefore resolved the jurisdiction issue in
                    favour of the plaintiff and proceeded to review the affidavit evidence and the
                    pleadings placed before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The merits of the case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The plaintiff’s representative deposed
                    on affidavit that the CVD agreement commenced on 10 February 2006 and the
                    plaintiff rendered monthly invoices to the defendant for the services it
                    provided. These invoices were exhibited and appeared to be regular. They were
                    sent to the billing address provided by the defendant. However, the defendant
                    failed to pay and on 20 November 2006, the plaintiff terminated the CVD
                    agreement under cl 8.3(b)(ii) of the plaintiff’s General Terms and
                    Conditions. A total of US$350,672.12 remained unpaid from the invoices issued by
                    the plaintiff to the defendant under the CVD agreement. The invoices included
                    charges for early termination of the CVD agreement from 21 November 2006 to 9
                    February 2008, which I found the plaintiff entitled to under cl 3.2(b) of
                    the Specific Terms and Conditions for CVD Service and/or cl 8.7 of the
                    plaintiff’s General Terms and Conditions as termination occurred before
                    the expiry date of the initial contract term (in this case 24 months). Under
                    cl 3.5 read with cl 1.1 of the plaintiff’s General Terms and
                    Conditions, the defendant was also liable to pay interest of two percent per
                    month on the outstanding amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Similarly, the plaintiff’s
                    representative deposed that the plaintiff commenced provision of services under
                    the IPLC agreement on 10 February 2006 and the plaintiff rendered monthly
                    invoices to the defendant. These invoices were also exhibited and appeared to be
                    regular. They were likewise sent to the billing address provided by the
                    defendant. However, the defendant failed to pay and the plaintiff terminated the
                    IPLC agreement on 20 November 2006 under cl 8.3(b)(ii) of the
                    plaintiff’s General Terms and Conditions. A total of US$141,010.34
                    remained unpaid from the invoices issued by the plaintiff to the defendant under
                    the IPLC agreement. These included fees and charges up to the expiry of the
                    contract period, which I found the plaintiff entitled to pursuant to
                    cl 3.4(b) of the Specific Terms and Conditions for IPLC Service and/or
                    cl 8.7 of the plaintiff’s General Terms and Conditions. Additionally,
                    cl 3.5 read with cl 1.1 of the plaintiff’s General Terms and
                    Conditions applied to the IPLC agreement as well, rendering the defendant liable
                    to pay interest of two percent per month on the outstanding
                amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     I therefore found the defendant liable to the
                    plaintiff for: (a) under the CVD agreement, US$350,672.12 plus interest at the
                    rate of 2% per month from 28 April 2007 (the due date of the last invoice
                    issued pursuant to the CVD agreement) up to the date of full payment; and (b)
                    under the IPLC agreement, US$141,010.34 plus interest at the rate of 2% per
                    month from 28 December 2006 (the due date of the last invoice issued pursuant to
                    the IPLC agreement) up to the date of full payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I also awarded indemnity costs to the
                    plaintiff fixed at $6,351.70 after reviewing the plaintiff’s note of costs
                    filed on 27 May 2011. The plaintiff was entitled to costs on an indemnity
                    basis pursuant to cl 10.1(e) of the plaintiff’s General Terms and
                    Conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     For the foregoing reasons, I granted the
                    plaintiff’s application and entered judgment for the plaintiff after
                    reviewing the evidence before me and hearing the submissions of counsel for the
                    plaintiff. Additionally, I granted an extension of time for the plaintiff to
                    file its memorandum of service after accepting that the plaintiff had filed it
                    late due to inadvertence and that there would be no prejudice to the defendant
                    as a result.</p>
