According to SSI Tony, this was Kay Yong’s “official address”, presumably referring to the address <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">stated in his NRIC</span>. SSI Tony and Kay Yong gave differing accounts of what transpired at the Ang Mo Kio Flat. SSI Tony’s evidence was that Kay Yong had informed the CNB officers that he was no longer staying at this address. SSI Tony thus went to the Ang Mo Kio Flat in order to “verify Kay Yong’s claim”

SSI Tony’s conditioned statement did not mention that Kay Yong had handed over the keys to the Ang Mo Kio Flat at any point and indeed, the tenor of SSI Tony’s evidence was that he did not have those keys because if he had them he would not need to knock on the door. SSI Tony was not challenged on this version of the events when he gave evidence at the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Kay Yong’s evidence was that he gave SSI Tony the keys to the Ang Mo Kio Flat, and that upon reaching Blk 123 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, the CNB officers “went up to check [Kay Yong’s] flat” while he remained in the CNB operational car. Kay Yong claimed that when the CNB officers returned, they “said that nothing was found in [Kay Yong’s] flat.”

Ah Boy was a Malaysian man who had first contacted him over the phone about two years earlier. Ah Boy said that he was a friend of “Ah San”, whom Kay Yong had met in prison five or six years earlier. Over those two years, Ah Boy had gotten Kay Yong involved in online gambling activities, including betting on horses and on football. Ah Boy and Ah San also recruited him to help them run their online betting activities by collecting bets from others in return for a commission. Kay Yong said that when Ah Boy called him at noon on the day of his arrest, he instructed Kay Yong to prepare $3,800, which was what he owed Ah Boy for bets placed during the 2014 World Cup. However, Kay Yong only managed to gather $3,600 from his own salary and by borrowing money from other people. At about 5pm, Kay Yong received a call from a Malay man (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Mazlan), and arranged to meet him at Blk 31 Bendemeer Road. When he met up with Mazlan, Kay Yong handed him the money and told him to pass it to Ah Boy. Kay Yong said that Mazlan then asked him to open his bag. He asked why, but Mazlan told him to “just open [his] bag”. Mazlan then threw something inside the bag. Feeling that “something was wrong”, Kay Yong quickly turned away and walked towards his block. While he was at his block, he had started running when he heard “running sounds” because he “felt something wrong”.

Kay Yong also said in this statement that he had “relapsed” into smoking <span class="font-italic">pei</span><span class="font-italic"> hoon </span>because of the pressure and stress he felt as a result of owing money to Ah Boy. He claimed he still owed Ah Boy $30,000 out of an original debt of $50,000 accumulated from horse and soccer betting, and from other people who had failed to pay him after placing bets.

It was implausible that Kay Yong would have spent such a large sum of money on the drugs if he did not intend to sell them.

There was no evidence to show that he was authorised under the MDA to deliver the drugs to Kay Yong.

The Defence submitted that, since Kay Yong had met with Mazlan expecting to repay a debt and to receive a debt book, Kay Yong believed that the Plastic Bag contained a debt book. The most that could be said was that he may have suspected that the Plastic Bag contained drugs, but suspicion was insufficient to establish the mental element of possession.

</div> For similar reasons, the Defence argued that Kay Yong also did not have the requisite knowledge of the nature of the drugs. It was further submitted that even on the Prosecution’s <span class="font-italic">alternative </span>case – which relied on the presumptions in ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA, Kay Yong had raised sufficient evidence to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49  The Defence further argued that Kay Yong was not in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. It was emphasised that no drug trafficking paraphernalia was found, whether in the Bendemeer Flat or the Ang Mo Kio Flat, and that the only evidence going towards whether Kay Yong intended to traffic the drugs was the sheer quantity of heroin found in his possession.

</div> Responding to the Prosecution’s alternative case (which required the Prosecution to prove that the accused possessed the drugs for the purposes of trafficking without relying on the presumption concerning trafficking in s 17 of the MDA), the Defence took the position that, in the absence of other evidence, the sheer quantity of the drugs can never be sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused possessed the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.

Thus, the first element of physical control was made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The key question concerned the second element of possession – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kay Yong knew that the contents of the Plastic Bag consisted of controlled drugs.

Ultimately, what the court is concerned with is the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account and how believable that account is.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The above remarks were clearly made in a different context where the Court of Appeal was concerned with whether or not the accused had managed to rebut the <span class="font-italic">presumption of knowledge </span>under s 18(2) of the MDA. Nevertheless, I consider that the same principles are applicable where the Prosecution seeks to prove that the accused had <span class="font-italic">actual </span>knowledge that an item in his physical control was a controlled drug, and the accused claims that he did not know that what he was carrying contained a controlled drug. That is, the court must “scrutinise all the pertinent facts”, including the accused’s background and how he received the drugs, to assess “the credibility and veracity of the accused’s account”. These principles are applicable to my assessment of whether the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Kay Yong knew that the Plastic Bag he was carrying contained a controlled drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not require the Prosecution to meet a standard of absolute certainty (<span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali bin </span><span class="font-italic">Johari v PP </span>[2008] 5 SLR(R) 1058 (“<span class="font-italic">Mohammed Ali Bin </span><span class="font-italic">Johari</span>”) at [84], citing<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45).

The first narrative was the Prosecution’s case that Kay Yong had <span class="font-italic">ordered </span>the drugs from Ah Boy (see [40] above). On this version of events, Kay Yong knew that the Plastic Bag contained drugs because that was exactly what he had expected to receive upon meeting Mazlan. The second, competing narrative was Kay Yong’s case that he had met with Mazlan expecting to pay a gambling debt and to receive a debt book for the purpose of carrying out debt collection activities for Ah Boy (see [45]–[46] above). The question was whether, on the evidence, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Prosecution’s narrative represented the truth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I was of the view that the evidence overwhelmingly supported the Prosecution’s narrative, while Kay Yong’s competing narrative was unsubstantiated and insufficient to ground a “reasonable” doubt. This was based on the following factors.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The first factor was this. There was no credible reason why Mani (or Ah Boy) would have instructed Mazlan to deliver to Kay Yong a packet of drugs worth thousands of dollars if Kay Yong had not ordered them. The Prosecution highlighted Kay Yong’s statement that he was regularly purchasing, for his own consumption, 8g packets of heroin<span class="font-italic"> </span>for about $180 (see [30] above). Based on these figures, the 459.4g of heroin found in Kay Yong’s possession would have yielded about 57 of such 8g packets, which would have had a value in excess of $10,000.

I took judicial notice of the fact that heroin is normally sold as a mixture of diamorphine and other substances. The purity of the heroin found in Kay Yong’s possession was about 4.07%.

</div> Yet whatever the exact words spoken may have been, the evidence demonstrated that Kay Yong met Mazlan with the Black Bag expecting to receive <span class="font-italic">an item</span>. I saw no reason to disbelieve the evidence of Suhana and Mazlan that Kay Yong had said “Just put inside here” when he met up with Mazlan (see [13] above). Such evidence was consistent with <span class="font-italic">either </span>the Prosecution’s narrative that Kay Yong was expecting to receive drugs, <span class="font-italic">or </span>the Defence’s narrative that he was expecting a debt book. The question was what Kay Yong actually expected to receive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Kay Yong’s position in oral evidence was clearly that, after speaking to Ah Boy at about 5pm on 20 July 2015, he was expecting to receive a debt book. Indeed, his evidence was that even though Ah Boy did not actually <span class="font-italic">say </span>that he should expect a debt book, he simply understood, based on his previous experiences collecting debts for Ah Boy, that this was what Ah Boy was referring to by saying things such as “a guy will tell you what to do” and Ah Boy’s instruction that he should call a Malay man “for him to give [Kay Yong] the job”.

</div> Having regard to Kay Yong’s statements, however, I concluded that his claim that he was expecting to receive a debt book was a mere afterthought. The relevant parts of Kay Yong’s statements are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In his contemporaneous statement, when Kay Yong was asked what was inside “these two packets”, his answer was: “<span class="font-italic">I don’t know</span>. I handed money to him and he threw things inside my bag.” [emphasis added] (see [21] above). There was no mention of any debt book, or indeed, of expecting to receive anything at all.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In his cautioned statement, Kay Yong stated that when “the Malay” had asked him to open his handbag, he had “asked…why”. Again, the impression given by this statement was that Kay Yong was not expecting to receive anything at all (see [27] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In his first long statement, Kay Yong again asserted that when Mazlan asked him to bring a bag down, he had “asked him why”.  Notably it was in this statement, recorded some ten days after his arrest, that Kay Yong mentioned a “debt book” for the first time, and said, “I <span class="font-italic">think </span>the Malay guy had passed me either a debt book or ‘<span class="font-italic">pei</span><span class="font-italic"> hoon</span>’” (see [29] above).

Crucially, the following passage from Kay Yong’s cautioned statement showed that he knew,<span class="font-italic"> </span>at the point of his arrest, that he had been found in possession of “a packet of powder”: “When they held me down and told me <span class="font-italic">about a packet of powder</span>, I then realized what happened and that ‘Boy’ had set me up.” [emphasis added].

</div>  beggared belief. On the contrary, one would have thought that if Kay Yong had expected to receive a debt book but had realised upon his arrest that what he was carrying was actually a “packet of powder”, he would have taken the first opportunity to offer this exculpatory explanation in his contemporaneous statement. That is all the more so given that Kay Yong was a person who has had dealings with drugs (see [30] above) and, based on his statements, obviously understood the gravity and possible implications of being found in possession of the drugs. For example, in his third long statement, Kay Yong stated the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Qns: If CNB had not arrested you that day, what would you have done with the packet of drug?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Ans: I would have smoked a bit and flush the rest down the toilet. I may contact ‘Ah Boy’ and ask him about this but<span class="font-italic"> I will not take the risk to return it to him </span>because he was the one who forced it upon me. … I will not keep the packet with me as my mother may find out <span class="font-italic">and it is never safe to have drugs at home</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Yet instead of explaining that he had expected to receive a debt book, in his contemporaneous statement, Kay Yong simply stated that he “[did not] know” what was inside the packet. Similarly, in his cautioned statement, which was recorded some seven days after his arrest, Kay Yong did not state that he was expecting to receive a debt book.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Even when Kay Yong eventually mentioned a “debt book” in his first and fourth long statements, he did <span class="font-italic">not</span> say that this was what he had been expecting to receive from Mazlan based on Ah Boy’s instructions. These statements suggested instead that Kay Yong was either not expecting to receive anything at all, or that he was at least unclear about what he should expect to receive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 I therefore found that Kay Yong’s claim that he had met with Mazlan expecting to receive a debt book from Ah Boy was not credible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The third reason that I was unable to accept Kay Yong’s version of events had to do with his lack of credibility as a witness. I found that his evidence was fraught with significant inconsistencies. A key plank of Kay Yong’s defence was that he had a laptop in the Bendemeer Flat which he used for online gambling. Kay Yong claimed that this laptop would have supported his claim that he had met Mazlan in the evening of 20 July 2015 for the purpose of repaying a gambling debt owed to Ah Boy.

</div> Nevertheless, I noted that Kay Yong had fled immediately upon noticing the CNB officers despite the fact that they were in plain clothes, and that he also went as far as to leap from the staircase landing immediately preceding the ground floor in his attempt to escape the CNB officers (see [15] above). Taken alongside the other evidence, I agreed that the desperate manner in which Kay Yong fled did support the inference that he knew that he was carrying a controlled drug rather than a mere debt book.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As for the argument that Kay Yong had “ample time” to check the contents of the Plastic Bag but did not do so, I did not agree with the Prosecution that this supported a finding that Kay Yong had knowledge that he was carrying controlled drugs. To begin with, by the Prosecution’s own evidence, it would have taken Kay Yong at most three to four minutes to walk from the point where he had met Mazlan to the fourth floor of Blk 31 Bendemeer Road.

</div> This was an extremely short period of time, and I failed to see what could be made of the fact that Kay Yong did not check the contents of the Plastic Bag during those several minutes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Nevertheless, based on the other factors I have mentioned at [65]–[80] above, I was satisfied that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Kay Yong had met with Mazlan expecting to receive the drugs because he had ordered them from Ah Boy. I therefore found that the second element of possession, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>, knowledge that the item contained a controlled drug, was made out.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Presumed possession and knowledge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Although it was not necessary, in light of my findings on actual possession, to consider the question of the presumption in s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA on the Prosecution’s alternative case, for completeness, I should state that the presumption of possession clearly did arise in the present case, and was not successfully rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, a person who is proved to have had in his possession, custody or control “anything containing a controlled drug” is presumed to have had that drug in his possession until the contrary is proved. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort v PP </span>[2017] 1 SLR 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort”</span>) at [34], in order to raise the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA, two elements must be satisfied: (a) the “container containing a controlled drug” must exist; and (b) the accused must have had possession, control or custody of such container. The accused need not know that the item is a controlled drug (<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort </span>at [34]). Once the accused is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession, he is then presumed to know the <span class="font-italic">nature </span>of that drug under s 18(2) of the MDA – which refers to the nature of the specific controlled drug found in his possession (<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort </span>at [35], citing <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l K Dharmalingam v PP </span>[2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>”) at [23]–[24]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 There was no doubt that the Plastic Bag was a “container containing a controlled drug” and that it was within Kay Yong’s possession, custody and control (for the reasons stated at [58] above, concerning Kay Yong’s physical control of the Plastic Bag). For the same reasons stated at [65]–[80] above, the presumption of possession was not rebutted. Thus, on the Prosecution’s alternative case, Kay Yong would be presumed to be in possession of the drugs and to have knowledge of their specific nature.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Did Kay Yong have actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 As the Prosecution had accepted,

</div> without the presumptions in s 18(2) of the MDA, the element of knowledge of the nature of the drug requires proof that the accused knew of the nature of the actual drug in his possession – for instance, that it was diamorphine or methamphetamine (<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [24] and <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort </span>at [35]). In this case, the question was whether Kay Yong knew that the packet which he received in the Plastic Bag contained diamorphine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 I found that the same evidence which established Kay Yong’s knowledge that he was carrying controlled drugs (for the purpose of establishing possession) also led to the conclusion that Kay Yong knew that he was in possession of diamorphine specifically. Apart from the evidence discussed at [65]–[80] above, the finding that Kay Yong specifically knew that he was receiving heroin which he had ordered from Ah Boy through Mazlan was buttressed by the following factors:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Kay Yong was familiar with, and had many previous dealings with heroin.

When questioned about why he thought Mazlan may have passed him <span class="font-italic">pei</span><span class="font-italic"> hoon</span>, Kay Yong stated the following in his first long statement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I suspected it could be ‘<span class="font-italic">pei</span><span class="font-italic"> hoon</span>’ because ‘Ah Boy’ had asked me to help him with his drug business many times before. I had never agreed to it so he might have decided to just push it to me directly and make me do it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 The above factors supported the conclusion that Kay Yong knew that Ah Boy dealt in <span class="font-italic">pei</span><span class="font-italic"> hoon</span>, and that, having ordered the drugs from Ah Boy, he knew and expected that he would be receiving <span class="font-italic">pei</span><span class="font-italic"> hoon </span>when he met with Mazlan on 20 July 2015.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Was Kay Yong in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I turn now to address the final element of the offence – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the accused must have been in possession of the controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking. Since I have found that the Prosecution had proven the elements of possession and knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt, the Prosecution was able to rely on the presumption concerning trafficking. As mentioned above, the quantity of 18.71g in question was far in excess of the 2g of diamorphine required to raise the presumption in s 17(c) of the MDA. The question was whether or not Kay Yong had managed to rebut the presumption concerning trafficking on a balance of probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The Defence argued that Kay Yong would have consumed a third of the drugs and discarded the rest – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that <span class="font-italic">none </span>of the drugs were intended for the purpose of trafficking.

</div> At first blush, this was not inconceivable. The evidence showed that Kay Yong paid $3,000 to Mazlan for 459.4g of heroin (see [20] above). If Kay Yong had kept a third of the drugs for his own consumption, he would have 153g of heroin – which would have yielded about 19 8g packets – for about $1,000. If Kay Yong had bought 19 8g packets of heroin from his usual suppliers for $180 each, this would have cost him $3,420. Thus, Kay Yong stood to save a substantial sum of $2,420 from keeping a third of the drugs for his own consumption. Further, it was not implausible that a person of Kay Yong’s financial means would have spent a sum of $1,000 on this quantity of drugs. He was earning a gross pay of $1,500 a month, with a take-home salary of $1,231.50.

</div> This was not a situation where the value of the drugs was so out of proportion to the accused’s limited financial means as to make it unlikely that he would have held, for his own consumption, the amount of drugs which he claimed that he would.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 However, taking the evidence in the round, I found that Kay Yong had not proven that it was more likely than not that he would have kept a third of the drugs for his own consumption. This was in view of the fact that Kay Yong’s <span class="font-italic">own evidence </span>suggested that he was not in the habit of stockpiling large quantities of drugs. In fact, in his long statement Kay Yong stated that he would not have kept the packet of drugs with him “as [his] mother may find out <span class="font-italic">and it is never safe to have drugs at home</span>” [emphasis added] (see [74] above). Unlike in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Abdullah HC</span>, this was not a situation where the accused had adduced any evidence to suggest that he was usually in the habit of keeping and storing a certain quantity of drugs. Indeed, despite the fact that Kay Yong had smoked <span class="font-italic">pei</span><span class="font-italic"> hoon </span>on the day of his arrest, no drugs were found inside of the Bendemeer Flat.

</div> I further noted that Kay Yong had given inconsistent evidence concerning the amount of drugs that he would have retained for his own consumption. While in oral evidence he said that he would have kept a third of the drugs, in his third long statement he said that he would have smoked only “a bit” and discarded the remainder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Thus, I found that on the evidence, Kay Yong had failed to rebut the presumption concerning trafficking in respect of the full quantity of drugs found in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 For completeness, I should add that with regard to the Prosecution’s <span class="font-italic">alternative </span>case, I would not have found that this element had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given that no drug paraphernalia was found in either the Bendemeer Flat or the Ang Mo Kio Flat, and having regard to Kay Yong’s pattern of consumption and financial means, there was a “reasonable doubt” as to whether Kay Yong had intended to traffic the entire 459.4g of heroin found in his possession. However, that point is academic, since I had found that the Prosecution’s primary case was made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 As the elements of the charge against Kay Yong had been made out, I convicted him of the charge and imposed the mandatory sentence of death.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision with respect to Mazlan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The elements of the offence of trafficking under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA are as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Possession of the drugs;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Knowledge of the nature of the drugs;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Trafficking; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) The absence of authorisation.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 As I have mentioned, Mazlan did not dispute the Prosecution’s version of events, and I was satisfied that each of the elements was made out. Mazlan had admitted that he knowingly collected heroin from Mani at Tuas Avenue 11. He clearly had physical custody of the drugs from the time that he collected the drugs from Mani to the time he delivered them to Kay Yong. He also delivered the drugs to Kay Yong, which came within the definition of trafficking in s 2 of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Accordingly, I convicted Mazlan on the charge.

</div> It was clear that Mazlan was not <span class="font-italic">selling </span>the drugs to Kay Yong. His role in the transaction between Mani (or Ah Boy) and Kay Yong was simply to deliver the drugs from Mani to Kay Yong. His involvement did not involve “any other type of activity associated with drug supply and distribution” (see <span class="font-italic">Christeen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [69]) apart from transporting the drugs from one party to another. It was undisputed that Mazlan also was not entrusted with any decision-making powers and was acting, at all times, under Mani’s instructions. Finally, Mazlan’s unchallenged evidence was that he had agreed to deliver the drugs for Mani “once and for all”.
