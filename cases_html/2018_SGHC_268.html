convicted him on the charges. Under s 33(1) of the MDA, read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, the prescribed punishment is death. Pursuant to s 33B(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, the court has a discretion not to impose the death penalty if the requirements set out in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA are satisfied. I found that the requirements of s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) were not satisfied and further, the Prosecution did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA.

At about 8pm, Nabill and one Mohamed Khairul Bin Jabar (“Khairul”) were arrested when they were both leaving the Flat. The CNB officers then entered the Flat and arrested one Mashitta Binte Dawood (“Mashitta”), Nabill’s wife. Khairul was arrested because he was found with two packets of methamphetamine in his bag and Mashitta was arrested because she was a suspected drug addict.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">6 </span>The CNB officers proceeded to search the Flat in Nabill’s presence.

Dr Chua opined that based on clinical assessment, Nabill was “positive for non-opoid drug withdrawal”. In his oral evidence, Dr Chua stated that it was not possible for a clinician to tell how severe the withdrawal was and that drug withdrawal symptoms for non-opoid drugs (and methamphetamine) would generally last between two to seven days, depending on the person and the amount of drugs consumed.

</div> Nabill stated as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) He gave a fairly detailed account of how he first met Danish in early 2015 and how they would go out for drinks together. Sometime in October 2015, Danish asked Nabill if he could stay over at the Flat and leave for work the next day from there. Nabill agreed and from then onwards, Danish would stay at the Flat frequently, almost five days a week (on the weekdays), in Bedroom 1 together with Sufian. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Around 3am on 27 January 2016, Danish came to the Flat to sleep. Nabill was aware that Danish had planned to come to the Flat and had asked Sufian to open the door for Danish. Nabill asked Danish to bring 25g of “ice” for his (Nabill’s) consumption. The “ice” found in Bedroom 1 could have been brought by Danish for Nabill, though Danish had brought more than Nabill had asked for. As for the drugs found in the “Akira” box (F1) in Bedroom 1 and the cannabis found in the trolley bag (B1) in the storeroom, Nabill was sure that Danish had brought them to his Flat on 27 January 2016, because these items were not there when Nabill was fixing the wardrobe in Bedroom 1 and the rack in the storeroom on 26 January 2016. After Danish left the Flat at about 5am, he messaged Nabill to say that someone will come and pick up the “things” within half an hour, but no one came. Nabill woke up at 10am and saw Danish’s message. He then tried to call Danish every hour and Danish kept telling him that he would come to pick up the things, but he did not.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Nabill stated that Danish had brought 25g of “ice” for him on three occasions, once in December 2015 and twice in January 2016. However, each time, Danish would bring more than 25g so that Nabill could sell the extra. Nabill thought this was a “trap” because Danish would not take back the extra “ice” and wanted Nabill to “clear” them for him. However, Nabill had not sold any of the “ice” yet, which was why they were still in large packets.

The Prosecution need not prove that the accused specifically knew that he was in possession of drugs or even of something that turns out to be contraband; the question of whether he knows the package or container contains drugs<span class="font-italic"> </span>is an inquiry that arises when considering the question of knowledge rather than of possession (at [12]–[13]). Once it is proved that the accused had physical control over or possession of the package or container that contains the thing in question, the court is entitled to infer that he had knowledge of the existence of that thing. It is then incumbent on the accused to discharge the evidential burden by raising a reasonable doubt that this was not the case (at [16]). In an appropriate case, the Prosecution may also rely on the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">44 </span>In the present case, the Prosecution proceeded on the basis that it had proved actual possession and knowledge and sought to rely on the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA. In the alternative, it submitted that the presumptions of possession and knowledge under s 18(1) and s 18(2) of the MDA were engaged and that Nabill had failed to rebut the presumptions, and that it had proved that Nabill had the drugs in his possession for the purposes of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">45 </span>As a preliminary point, the Prosecution is not precluded from relying on both alternatives mentioned above. This was recognised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Hishamrudin bin Mohd v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] SGCA 41 at [20]–[21] when it considered the case on the alternative premises of the accused’s actual and presumed possession of drugs found in his car. This was also the case in <span class="font-italic">Zainal</span>, where the Court recognised that the presumptions under ss 17 and 18 of the MDA could apply, in that the Prosecution could prove the facts of possession and knowledge and invoke the presumption of trafficking, or invoke the presumption of possession and/or knowledge and prove that such possession was for the purpose of trafficking (at [55]). The Court in <span class="font-italic">Zainal</span> concluded that, based on an analysis of <span class="font-italic">each of the scenarios</span>, the corresponding presumptions were not rebutted in that case. In other words, the Prosecution can rely on the two alternatives, so long as the presumption under s 17 and the presumptions under s 18(1) and (2) of the MDA are not invoked and applied together (because they cannot be so applied), and the Prosecution makes clear which presumptions it seeks to rely on (<span class="font-italic">Zainal </span>at [53]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision on conviction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">46 </span>After assessing all the evidence, I was satisfied that on either alternative (as set out at [44] above), the Prosecution had proved its case against Nabill.

By his own evidence, he had placed the 63 packets of diamorphine in the “Akira” box. He also did not deny that he had control and possession of the Flat and of Bedroom 1. However, he claimed that the diamorphine did not belong to him and he did not know how it came to be present in Bedroom 1. The first time he saw the diamorphine was around 2pm on 27 January 2016 when he found the packets laid out on the bed. He claimed that Faizal must have brought the diamorphine to the Flat in the trolley bag and that Sufian may have laid it out on the bed. Hence, the drugs belonged to Faizal or Sufian, and he merely tidied up the room by placing them into the “Akira” box.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) He essentially admitted that he knew that the packets contained diamorphine because, by his own account, he had seen them laid out on the bed at around 2pm on 27 January 2016 and was able to recognise that they contained diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) He also claimed that the diamorphine did not belong to him and by implication he had no intention to sell it.

</div> I rejected Nabill’s explanation. Sufian was not called to testify to support Nabill’s account. Moreover, Nabill conceded that Sufian had his own handphone, hence there was no conceivable reason why Sufian would have had to use Nabill’s handphone. In my view, Nabill’s explanation was but a feeble attempt to shore up his claim that he was asleep when Faizal arrived at the Flat. His claim that he was asleep when Faizal arrived was, in turn, an attempt to distance himself from the drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">53 </span>Second, in the 9th Statement recorded on 28 July 2016, Nabill stated that he was aware that Faizal had gone to the Flat on 26 January 2016 to “put things” and identified the “things he put” as the “trolley bag” (see [33] above).

</div> By Nabill’s own evidence, he was aware in advance that Faizal was going to the Flat with the trolley bag and to deliver drugs. For completeness, the CCTV footage captured Faizal, accompanied by Nabill, going down the lift at about 10.20pm without a trolley bag. Thus Nabill would have known that Faizal had left the Flat without the trolley bag and had deposited it in the Flat.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">54 </span>Next, I found it unbelievable that Faizal would have brazenly hidden from Nabill the fact that he had brought the trolley bag (containing drugs, and in such large quantities) to the Flat and intended to keep it there without Nabill’s permission or knowledge. Nabill claimed that Faizal had secretly sought to leave all kinds of drugs (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, heroin, cannabis, ecstasy and erimin) in the Flat on about five prior occasions.

</div> Nabill added that he had developed a habit of checking the Flat every time after Faizal left to ensure that he did not leave unwanted drugs behind. Going by Nabill’s account, it was difficult to believe that Faizal would disrespectfully continue to deposit drugs in the Flat without Nabill’s consent and knowledge, running the risk of outraging Nabill and affecting their friendship. On Nabill’s account, it was also unbelievable that he would continue to allow Faizal to come to the Flat regularly when he knew full well that there was a substantial risk that Faizal would again hide drugs in the Flat and put him at risk of being caught with those drugs which he knew could attract imprisonment or the death penalty. I disbelieved Nabill’s explanation that he continued to allow Faizal to come to the Flat because he needed Faizal to supply drugs to him for consumption. As Nabill admitted, he could easily have met Faizal somewhere outside the Flat to obtain the drugs from Faizal.

</div> Therefore, Nabill’s account was not internally coherent and suggested, instead, that he was expecting Faizal to come to the Flat with the trolley bag containing the drugs and had knowingly allowed him to deposit the trolley bag with the drugs in the Flat. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">55 </span>Indeed, if Nabill were truly so mistrusting of Faizal that he would check the Flat for drugs whenever Faizal left, and given that he was aware of the severe legal consequences of being found with a large quantity of illicit drugs, then one would expect him to have done a thorough check of the Flat on 26 January 2016 (or the next day) after Faizal left. Instead, Nabill claimed he had checked <span class="font-italic">only</span> Bedroom 1 and was satisfied upon this cursory check that there were no drugs in <span class="font-italic">the </span><span class="font-italic">whole Flat</span> (apart from the methamphetamine in the master bedroom toilet which was for his consumption) and only discovered the huge quantities of diamorphine when it was laid out on the bed the next day and the cannabis when he was arrested.

</div> Nabill’s complacency suggested that he was not worried about Faizal bringing drugs to the Flat and was aware that he would do so.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether Nabill knew the contents of the trolley bag </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">56 </span>I was also satisfied that Nabill knew that the trolley bag contained drugs, and that he knew the nature of the drugs in the trolley bag, at the material time when Faizal brought the trolley bag to the Flat. Nabill’s evidence was that all the drugs found in Bedroom 1 and the storeroom had been brought by Faizal on 26 January 2016, because they were not present in the Flat before that time. If so, then if it were found that Nabill knew what the trolley bag contained when Faizal brought it to the Flat, this knowledge would extend not only to the cannabis found in the trolley bag but also to all the other drugs which had somehow found their way from the trolley bag into Bedroom 1 by the time of Nabill’s arrest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">57 </span>First, there was evidence of Nabill’s familiarity with drugs (and the type of drugs found at his Flat), and his past experience with Faizal bringing drugs, including diamorphine and cannabis, to the Flat. In the 1st Statement recorded after his arrest, Nabill was able to identify the various types of drugs that were seized from the Flat.  He also testified that he consumed drugs regularly with others. He claimed that Faizal came to the Flat a few times a week to smoke “ice” and that he obtained his “ice” from Faizal, who in turn obtained it from Danish. As mentioned at [54] above, Nabill also claimed that on about five prior occasions, Faizal had brought various kinds of drugs (including diamorphine and cannabis) to the Flat without his permission or knowledge, and would retrieve them only upon Nabill’s prompting, which was why he would check the Flat each time after Faizal left to make sure that he had not left behind any drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>Second, even by Nabill’s account, his reaction upon discovering the trolley bag in the storeroom strongly suggested that he in fact knew that the trolley bag contained drugs and not cigarettes. I should state first that I rejected Nabill’s evidence that he only discovered the trolley bag on 27 January 2016. As I found at [53] above, Nabill was aware that Faizal had gone to the Flat on 26 January 2016 to deposit a trolley bag and to deliver drugs.

</div> Nonetheless, I proceeded to assess the internal coherence of Nabill’s own account of the facts, on the basis that he discovered the trolley bag on 27 January 2016 as he claimed, in order to determine whether he was to be believed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>In this regard, Nabill claimed that when he discovered the trolley bag in the storeroom around 4pm on 27 January 2016, he immediately or “straightaway” phoned Faizal to remove it, because he <span class="font-italic">knew</span><span class="font-italic"> or at least suspected that it contained drugs</span>.

</div> His knowledge or suspicion was entirely to be expected given Faizal’s purported history of bringing unwanted large quantities of various drugs to the Flat. However, what was incongruent with Nabill’s innocence was his reaction to Faizal’s reply that the trolley bag only contained cigarettes. Nabill stated that he did not open the trolley bag to verify its contents and that he trusted Faizal because of the “size of the trolley”.

</div> whereas the many varieties of drugs that Faizal had previously brought to the Flat could have easily been contained within a trolley bag. Indeed, in the 9th Statement, Nabill said that it was “difficult to say” what quantity of drugs Faizal left at the Flat on various occasions because the quantities differed and were concealed in various bags, such as a “sling bag”, “bag”, “paper bag” or “plastic bag”.

</div> If anything, the size of the trolley bag should have given Nabill cause for worry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span>Furthermore, Nabill’s conduct and his purported trust in Faizal on 27 January 2016 (in taking Faizal at his word that the trolley bag contained cigarettes) was inconsistent with his apparent lack of trust in Faizal on previous occasions, as seen in the way that he had allegedly searched the Flat after each visit by Faizal to ensure Faizal had not left unwanted drugs in the Flat. It was also inconsistent with his apparent lack of trust in Faizal the night before he was arrested (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 26 January 2016) as he claimed he did a check of Bedroom 1 after Faizal left the Flat that night. His complacency on this occasion is particularly stark given that Nabill stated that he <span class="font-italic">actually</span><span class="font-italic"> suspected</span>, when he called Faizal, that the trolley bag might have contained drugs, and was aware of the serious penalties attached to drug offences. Additionally, according to his version of events, when he called Faizal about the trolley bag around 4pm on 27 January 2016, he had already discovered the large quantities of drugs (which he knew at that time to be diamorphine) in Bedroom 1, and suspected that either Sufian or Faizal was responsible for its presence in the Flat. In this context, it is inexplicable that Nabill did not act to verify that the trolley bag contained cigarettes as Faizal claimed, as one would expect him to have been worried about the presence of more drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">61 </span>It was also strange that Nabill was in no hurry to get Faizal to remove the trolley bag from the Flat.

I did not believe Nabill’s alternative account that SSgt Ika had asked, “ada barang salah lagi?” (meaning “any more illegal things?”), and that Nabill had directed the CNB officers to the storeroom because of the contraband cigarettes rather than the trolley bag containing the drugs. First, Nabill’s version of SSgt Ika’s question kept evolving.

</div> In contrast, SSgt Ika was consistent in his testimony that he had merely asked “ada lagi?” and that Nabill had replied “storeroom”. Second, the context supports the inference that Nabill understood SSgt Ika to be asking whether there were any more drugs and had directed the CNB officers to the storeroom because he was aware that there were drugs in the trolley bag. SSgt Ika had asked Nabill this question after Bedroom 1 had been searched and a large amount of drugs had been uncovered.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">68 </span>Third, Nabill completely altered his account of who the diamorphine belonged to. In the 1st Statement, he stated that it belonged to Danish who had brought it to the Flat and in particular for G1A1, that Danish had intended to sell it. In the 2nd to 6th Statements, Nabill supplied details that would make this story about Danish more realistic – details such as how he came to know Danish, Danish’s regular stays at the Flat, Danish’s supply of “ice” to him, Danish’s history of leaving extra “ice” behind to “frame” Nabill into selling the excess “ice” for him, and how Nabill had heard Danish entering the Flat in the early hours of 27 January 2016. However, in the 7th Statement, Nabill claimed for the first time that Faizal had brought the cannabis to the Flat. From that point on, Nabill did an about turn and claimed that it was Faizal who had brought all the drugs to the Flat in the trolley bag on 26 January 2016. Nabill then denied that he knew Danish and that Danish had ever come to the Flat. By the time the 7th Statement was recorded, Nabill must have realised that there was CCTV footage of the lift leading to the Flat, which was why, in that statement, he stated for the first time that Faizal was the person who had brought the trolley bag and drugs to the Flat, and requested for the CCTV footage to be examined. In fact, during the trial, Nabill admitted that he changed his account from “Danish” to “Faizal” after ASP Peh showed him the CCTV footage of the lift leading to the Flat.

</div>
</div> The CCTV footage captured Faizal in the lift with the trolley bag going up the lift and did not capture any images of Danish. I found that Nabill changed his account to attribute the drugs to Faizal only when he realised that his account about Danish could not stand in the face of the objective records. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>Lastly, Nabill altered his account of how the diamorphine came to be found in Bedroom 1. In the 4th Statement, he explained that Danish must have brought them to the Flat at about 3am on 27 January 2016, because these items were not there when Nabill was fixing the wardrobe in Bedroom 1 on 26 January 2016. In the 8th to 10th Statements, Nabill merely said that all the drugs in Bedroom 1 and the storeroom must have been brought to the Flat in Faizal’s trolley bag. In the 10th Statement, he claimed that he first saw the diamorphine laid out on the bed in the afternoon on 27 January 2016 when he quarrelled with Mashitta, but did not explain how they came to be laid out on the bed. When questioned whether Sufian was connected to the drugs that Faizal brought to the Flat, Nabill stated that he did not know, and added that he did not know “if Sufian saw Faizal taking the drugs out of the trolley bag”.

</div> However, during the trial, Nabill claimed that the diamorphine would have been laid out on the bed by Sufian, and not Faizal, as Nabill did not see anything on the bed when he checked Bedroom 1 after Faizal left the Flat on 26 January 2016 and Sufian was at home on 27 January 2016.

This was incredibly damaging to his credibility and led me to question why he felt compelled to concoct a story about Danish in the first place instead of offering at the earliest opportunity the defence which he ultimately offered at trial – namely that the diamorphine belonged to either Faizal or to Sufian (who allegedly placed it in Bedroom 1, having possibly obtained it from the trolley bag). I will return to the issue of Nabill’s evolving defence in light of his statements later (see [77]–[82] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Nabill’s account that Sufian had placed the drugs on the bed in Bedroom 1</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>Next, I rejected Nabill’s explanation that Sufian had placed the diamorphine on the bed in Bedroom 1. The way that Nabill conducted himself upon discovering the drugs was not as one would expect if he had innocently found such a large quantity of diamorphine in his Flat. He claimed that he called Sufian to come back to the Flat and clear “all the thing inside [Bedroom 1]”.

</div> Strangely, however, he did not ask Sufian why there were drugs (and so much of them) in the room and who had brought them to the Flat. He agreed that he did not even mention the word “drugs” to Sufian. Nabill tried to explain that he did not ask Sufian about the drugs because Sufian “sounded so innocent at that point in time”.

He did not call Mashitta to support his account that he first found the diamorphine on the bed in Bedroom 1 at about 2pm on 27 January 2016 and then packed the drugs into the “Akira” box after quarrelling with her, or call Sufian to support his phone conversation with Sufian after he discovered the diamorphine. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>There was also objective evidence that Nabill had been in contact with some packets of diamorphine, which supported a finding that he was in possession of it and knew the nature of its contents as he was involved in packing it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">73 </span>Nabill’s DNA was found on F1D3A, which comprised 10 mini packets of diamorphine which were packed into a larger ziplock bag (F1D3), which was in turn found in a white plastic bag (F1D) retrieved from the “Akira” box.

</div> Since G1A was found <span class="font-italic">inside</span> G1 which was on the bed at the time of Nabill’s arrest, Nabill would not have come into contact with the surface of G1A when supposedly quarrelling with Mashitta or when putting the other packets of diamorphine into the “Akira” box after the argument. Nabill had no explanation of how G1A1 came to be in Bedroom 1. In the 1st Statement recorded at the time of his arrest, he recognised G1A1 as heroin and said it belonged to Danish who would sell it. However, since he later recanted all his accounts relating to Danish, this explanation (that G1A1 belonged to Danish who would sell it) no longer holds water. During the trial, he testified that he could not recall if he had seen G1A.

</div> In my view, the DNA evidence is persuasive that Nabill had handled G1A which contained G1A1.

</div> Thus, he claimed that he had not deliberately made false statements. He stated that from the 7th Statement dated 23 May 2016 onwards, he came to believe that it was Faizal who had brought the drugs to the Flat, because Mashitta (who had in turn been informed by the domestic helper) had told him that Faizal brought the trolley bag. I found this explanation entirely unconvincing. According to Nabill at trial, he had already discovered <span class="font-italic">prior to</span> his arrest at around 4pm on 27 January 2016 that Faizal had brought the trolley bag to the Flat and that it was in the storeroom. Thus, there was no reason why he would have implicated Danish in the first six statements which were all recorded <span class="font-italic">after</span> his arrest, and why he would change his position and implicate Faizal only from the 7th Statement when he was supposedly prompted to change his original account because of what Mashitta had allegedly told him.

</div> At the same time, he agreed that he was not confused or in fear, and was not ignorant of what he was saying when he made the statements implicating Danish. Nabill then adjusted his explanation – he stated that after the CNB allowed him to call Danish, he found out from Danish that the drugs belonged to Danish and Danish also told him that he had passed the drugs to Faizal. That was why he deliberately implicated Danish in the 1st Statement.

</div> He told Dr Ng about his relationship with Dhanesh and how Dhanesh had left the drugs in the Flat on the night of 26 January 2016. By the time Dr Ng examined Nabill, any drug withdrawal symptoms would have worn off. When he was asked why he nonetheless told Dr Ng that Danish was responsible for the drugs in the Flat, Nabill could only say that he could not recall what he said to Dr Ng.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In the 8th Statement recorded on 24 May 2016, Nabill was asked in what packaging Danish supplied “ice” to him, and he gave an intelligible description, implicitly continuing to maintain that Danish, rather than Faizal, was his “ice” supplier. It was only after he was shown the CCTV footage of Faizal in the lift leading up to the Flat on 26 January 2016, and realising that the CCTV footage did not capture any images of Danish, that Nabill then changed his evidence in the <span class="font-italic">very same statement</span> to say that Danish had never been to his Flat. As I found at [68]<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>earlier, Nabill changed his account to “Faizal” only when he realised that his account about Danish could not stand in the face of the objective CCTV evidence. Indeed, Nabill admitted that he began to attribute the drugs to Faizal in the end because he had viewed the CCTV footage, in that he had a “better view on the CCTV” footage.

</div> I found this explanation, that the CCTV footage helped him to clarify what happened, to be utterly illogical and untrue. Details such as whether Nabill had ever met Danish, whether Danish had ever been to the Flat, whether Danish had “framed” him with drugs and so on, were matters within Nabill’s own experience and knowledge, and he would not have needed the CCTV footage to realise that his account about Danish was false. Moreover, if he knew – as he later testified – before his arrest that Faizal had brought a trolley bag to the Flat, he did not need the CCTV footage to supply him with that knowledge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">82 </span>Therefore, I found Nabill to be an untruthful and unreliable witness, who kept changing his story along the way. He clearly knew, at the time he made each statement, what he meant to say, and he had made up stories about Danish in his initial statements to hide the fact that he knew that Faizal had come to the Flat on 26 January 2016 with a trolley bag of drugs. I find he did so to disassociate himself from the drugs that were subsequently seized from the Flat. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Submissions by the Defence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">83 </span>Before I conclude, I deal with various arguments raised by the Defence which have not been dealt with above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">84 </span>First, the Defence submitted that the CNB failed to investigate other persons who may have been involved in the drug transactions, such as Mashitta, Sufian, Khairul and Faizal.

</div> my analysis will takes account whether Nabill possessed the drugs for the purpose of returning them to any of these other individuals, or for the purpose of trafficking. I also add that there is no requirement to prove <span class="font-italic">ownership</span> of the drugs for an offence under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) read with s 5(2) of the MDA to be made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">85 </span>Next, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution had refused to produce a statement taken from the domestic helper to show that she had allowed Faizal entry into the Flat on 26 January 2016 and that Faizal had brought the trolley bag.

</div>
</div>
</div> Again this was immaterial and did not affect my findings. I had found that Faizal was the one who brought the trolley bag to the Flat, so the domestic helper’s evidence in this regard would add nothing more. Even if she had allowed Faizal into the Flat on 26 January 2016, this did not mean that Nabill was unaware that Faizal had brought a trolley bag containing drugs that night. I have explained my reasons for finding that Nabill knew that Faizal was bringing a trolley bag to the Flat and that the trolley bag contained drugs, and the evidence of the domestic helper would not impact any of those reasons. In fact, the Defence chose not to call witnesses who could have supported Nabill’s version of events, namely Mashitta, Faizal and Sufian (whom Nabill claimed had laid out the drugs in Bedroom 1 and whom Nabill called subsequently to ask him to clear the things). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">86 </span>Next, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution should have disclosed statements recorded from Mashitta, Faizal and Sufian because these statements could have been advantageous to the defence. I rejected this submission. Under s 259 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), any statement made by a person (other than the accused) in the course of any investigation is inadmissible in evidence unless it falls within an exception listed in s 259(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">e</span>). The Defence did not identify which exception applied, and why it would apply, such that these statements if disclosed could be admitted at the trial. The Prosecution’s disclosure obligations as set out in <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Kadar </span><span class="font-italic">and another v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 1205 (“<span class="font-italic">Kadar</span><span class="font-italic"> No 1</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>are not affected by the operation of any ground for non-disclosure recognised by any law (see <span class="font-italic">Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter </span>[2011] 4 SLR 791 at [18]). In any event, the Defence also did not attempt to show how these statements, even if inadmissible under s 259, could have fallen within the Prosecution’s obligations to disclose “any unused material that is likely to be inadmissible, but would provide a real (not fanciful) chance of pursuing a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to be admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused” (<span class="font-italic">Kadar No 1</span> at [113]). If the Defence could have benefitted from the evidence of Mashitta, Sufian or Faizal, it could also have called them as witnesses but chose not to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">87 </span>Finally, the Defence suggested that Sufian could have been connected to the drugs found in the Flat because the CCTV footage showed him carrying a red packet that was similar in appearance to G1B and G1C when he was in the lift heading down from the floor where the Flat was at around 6.33am on 26 January 2016. He was no longer carrying this packet when he was seen again in the lift, going up to the floor where the Flat was at around 6.57am.

</div> The drugs in G1B and G1C did not form the subject of the charges against Nabill (even if Sufian were in some way connected to those drugs), and the drugs which Nabill was charged with trafficking were packaged in a different manner. In any event, Sufian’s role, if any, would not affect my findings as regards Nabill because Nabill’s involvement in the drugs found in Flat was not precluded by Sufian’s (even if proved). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">88 </span>In conclusion, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt that Nabill had actual possession of the drugs (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the diamorphine in Bedroom 1 and the cannabis in the trolley bag) and knew the nature of these drugs. I was further satisfied that the Prosecution was able to rely on the presumption in s 17 of the MDA that Nabill was in possession of the drugs for the purposes of trafficking since the quantities of both types of drugs exceeded the amounts specified in s 17, and found that Nabill failed to rebut this presumption on the balance of probabilities. I summarise below my findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">89 </span>First, as regards the element of possession, since Nabill had physical control of the Flat, the “Akira” box, the “Mintek” bag and the trolley bag, the latter three of which contained the drugs in question, I was entitled to infer that Nabill had knowledge of the existence of the drugs in each of these receptacles (<span class="font-italic">Zainal </span>at [16]). It was incumbent on him to show why, despite his physical control of them, he “reasonably ought not to be taken to be in possession of [their] contents” (see <span class="font-italic">Zainal</span> at [17]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In relation to the diamorphine, I found that Nabill was in possession of the diamorphine (G1A1) found in the “Mintek” bag because it was found in his control and his DNA was found on exhibit G1A. As for the 63 packets of diamorphine in the “Akira” box, Nabill by his own account <span class="font-italic">knew</span> that they were in the “Akira” box because, according to him, <span class="font-italic">he</span> had placed them there after the alleged quarrel with Mashitta. The fact that I have rejected his account means that Nabill by his own admission knew, prior to his arrest, that there was diamorphine in the “Akira” box, but had furnished no credible reason why it was there. I rejected his explanation that Sufian or Faizal was responsible for placing the diamorphine in Bedroom 1 because his account was discredited on many fronts. Even if Faizal had placed the diamorphine in Bedroom 1 on the night of 26 January 2016, I found that Nabill would have known of this and would have had agreed to it. This is because I have found that Nabill knew that Faizal was bringing a trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016 and knew what it contained. Either way, Nabill had no credible explanation for why he ought not to be taken to be in possession of them. I was thus satisfied he had actual possession of them. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As for the cannabis, even by Nabill’s account, he was aware of the presence of the trolley bag and that it contained something which turned out to be the cannabis. He claimed to have discovered the trolley bag at about 4pm on 27 January 2016, and immediately called Faizal about it. In any event, I rejected Nabill’s account that he did not know that Faizal had brought the trolley bag containing drugs to the Flat, and I found that Nabill knew that Faizal was bringing something to the Flat in the trolley bag and that he had agreed to it. He therefore had physical control of the cannabis in the trolley bag and the requisite knowledge that the trolley bag contained something which was later discovered to be the cannabis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">90 </span>Second, as regards the element of knowledge, I found that Nabill knew the nature of the drugs in the Flat, specifically that the drugs in Bedroom 1 which formed the subject of the 1st Charge were diamorphine and that the drugs found in the trolley bag which formed the subject of the 2nd Charge were cannabis.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In relation to the diamorphine, Nabill on his own account had seen the diamorphine contained in F1A, F1B, F1C, F1D and F1E laid out on the bed before his arrest and recognised them as diamorphine. In relation to G1A1, I found that Nabill had been in contact with that packet and would have known it to contain diamorphine (as evident in the 1st Statement where he was able to identify the content of G1A1). Actual knowledge was therefore proved.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As for the cannabis, I rejected Nabill’s evidence that he thought the trolley bag contained cigarettes and his account of how the trolley bag was brought to the Flat without his knowledge or consent. I found that he knew that Faizal was bringing drugs in the trolley bag to the Flat on 26 January 2016. Even by his own account, Nabill knew by around 4pm on 27 January 2016 of the trolley bag in the storeroom and knew or suspected at that time that it contained drugs. The evidence as a whole, including my findings that Nabill was <span class="font-italic">expecting</span> and <span class="font-italic">involved in</span> the delivery of the drugs by Faizal and told deliberate lies to the CNB and to this court to conceal his involvement with the drugs in the trolley bag, lead to a strong inference that Nabill knew the precise nature of the drugs that Faizal was bringing to the Flat in the trolley bag. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">91 </span>Third, on the element that the possession of the drugs was for the purpose of trafficking, I found that Nabill failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking in s 17 such that he possessed the drugs for some other purpose. Nabill’s case was that the drugs were in his possession for Faizal or Sufian to retrieve them, and that he was wholly uninvolved in the procurement or intended trafficking of these drugs. His evidence as to the intended purpose of the drugs was therefore inextricably linked to his wider story about how the drugs came to be found in the Flat without his knowledge or consent. For the reasons above, I rejected his evidence about how the drugs came to be found in the Flat, and accordingly rejected his evidence that he had no purpose for the drugs apart from storing them for Faizal or Sufian’s retrieval. Nabill also did not put forward a defence that the drugs were intended for his personal consumption. Furthermore, a large quantity of diamorphine and cannabis was in his possession – more than four times the amount of diamorphine at which capital punishment would be imposed, and more than twice the amount of cannabis at which capital punishment would be imposed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">92 </span>On the Prosecution’s alternative case, I was also satisfied that the presumptions under ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA were engaged. It was undisputed that Nabill and Mashitta owned the Flat and that Nabill was residing at the Flat and had the keys to, and control of, the Flat, including Bedroom 1 and the storeroom. As regards the “Akira” box specifically, it was not disputed that it belonged to Nabill. It was thus clear that the “Akira” box, the “Mintek” bag and trolley bag were also in his possession, custody or control at the material time. To rebut the presumptions, Nabil had to show on a balance of probabilities that he did not have the drugs in his possession because he did not know that the various receptacles or places contained a controlled drug and that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the drug (see <span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 2 SLR 903 at [16]–[17]; <span class="font-italic">Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 1 SLR 633 at [34]–[35]). For the reasons given earlier (see also [89]–[90] above), I found that Nabill failed on a balance of probabilities to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">93 </span>Turning to the element of trafficking, even without the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Nabill possessed the drugs in question for the purposes of trafficking. The court is entitled to infer the drugs were in the possession of an accused for the purpose of trafficking on the basis of evidence such as the quantity of drugs, the presence of drug trafficking paraphernalia, the absence of evidence that the drugs were for his personal consumption and other circumstantial evidence substantiating a finding that he was involved in drug trafficking (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Raman Selvam s/o Renganathan v Public Prosecutor </span>[2004] 1 SLR(R) 550 at [48]; <span class="font-italic">Abdul Kahar bin Othman v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] SGCA 11 at [92]). In the present case, the evidence pointed towards Nabill being involved in trafficking the drugs found in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">94 </span>As stated above, I rejected Nabill’s evidence that he intended to return the drugs to Faizal or Sufian. The sheer quantity of the drugs (as stated at [91]<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>above) made an inference of trafficking irresistible. It was not Nabill’s case that the drugs were intended for his personal consumption and, as I had rejected his evidence that he had nothing to do with how the drugs came to be found in the Flat, I thus found that they were stored there for the purposes of trafficking. Nabill also did not deny that four weighing scales (H1B, H1C, F1H and F1G4) were in his possession and were used by him (though he claimed that his use was limited to ascertaining the weight of the “ice” he obtained for his own consumption).

</div> Moreover, the fact that Nabill’s DNA was found on one of the mini packets of diamorphine (F1D3A) showed that he was involved in packing the mini packets.

However, s 33B of the MDA confers on the court the discretion to impose the alternative sentence of life imprisonment and the mandatory minimum 15 strokes of the cane, provided the offender satisfies the requirements in s 33(B)(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA and receives a certificate of substantive assistance from the Public Prosecutor. The accused bears the legal burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that his involvement in a drug trafficking offence was restricted only to the activities of a courier as listed in s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA (see <span class="font-italic">Zainudin bin Mohamed v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 1 SLR 449 at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">97 </span>In the present case, the Prosecution submitted that Nabill failed to show that his involvement was restricted only to the activities listed under s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission because Nabill, having run a defence that he was unconnected to the drugs found in the Flat, had not adduced any evidence to show that his involvement was limited to that of a courier, and the Defence had also not suggested that Nabill was a courier.
