        Judith Prakash J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff and the defendant are Singapore
                    companies in the business of providing transport services for the import and
                    export of cargo by sea. Neither company is a ship owner or operator. Each of
                    them deals with third party providers of vessels either directly or through
                    another middleman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This action arises out of arrangements made
                    between the plaintiff and the defendant for the transport of machinery
                    (“the cargo”) from the port of Nanwei in China to Singapore. The
                    exact contractual arrangements are a matter of dispute: the plaintiff’s
                    position is that there were two charter contracts (the “first
                    fixture” and the “second fixture” respectively) between the
                    plaintiff and the defendant by which the plaintiff agreed to supply a vessel to
                    transport the cargo, the second fixture being concluded after the first fixture
                    was cancelled by the defendant. The defendant’s position is that the first
                    fixture was the only contract between the parties and that because the plaintiff
                    breached the terms of the first fixture, the defendant had to ship the cargo by
                    a vessel supplied by a third party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The plaintiff has sued the defendant for loss of
                    freight and demurrage and the defendant has made a counterclaim for damages for
                    breach of contract and also loss of business arising from a letter written by
                    the plaintiff to the defendant’s customer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The following main issues arise from the
                    pleadings, evidence and submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     What happened to the first fixture:
                        was the plaintiff in breach?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Was the second fixture concluded between the plaintiff and
                        the defendant?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_c"></a>(c)     Was the Notice of Readiness (“NOR”) tendered by the vessel
                        under the second fixture valid?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_d"></a>(d)     What remedies are recoverable by either party in relation
                        to the first or second fixtures?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_e"></a>(e)     Is the plaintiff liable to the defendant for the tort of
                        wrongful interference with trade?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       All events referred to in this summary of what
                    occurred took place in 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first fixture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In July 2012, the defendant entered into a
                    contract with a company called Herrenknecht Asia Headquarters Pte Ltd
                    (“Herrenknecht”) to transport the cargo from China to Singapore
                    and deliver it to Herrenknecht. At about the same time, the defendant’s
                    general manager and director, Marcus Stephen Tan (“Mr Tan”) and
                    its operations manager, Yesica Winata (“Ms Winata”), had
                    discussions with the plaintiff’s director, Madeline Ong Kah Liang
                    (“Ms Ong”), regarding the provision of a vessel to carry the
                    cargo from the port of Nanwei, China, to Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 26 July, the plaintiff and the defendant
                    entered into the first fixture by which the plaintiff agreed to provide the
                    vessel “MV Dahua” (the “<em>Dahua</em>”) to carry the cargo to Singapore for a lump sum
                    freight of US$161,000. The plaintiff had in its turn chartered the <em>Dahua</em> for this purpose from FLS (Thailand) Co., Ltd
                    (“FLS”) on the basis that it would pay FLS a lump sum freight of
                    US$155,000 for the carriage of the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The charter contract between the plaintiff and
                    the defendant was a voyage charter and a written document entitled
                    “Fixture Note” was signed by both parties. It contained the
                    following important terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">02) Loading port: 1SBP Owners Berth Nanwei Port, Guangdong, PR
                        China;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">03) Discharging port: 1SBP Owners Berth Singapore;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">04) Laycan: 10<sup>th</sup> –
                            20<sup>th</sup> Aug, 2012;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19) Others as per Gencon C/P 1994.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Clause 4 above is crucial. It provided that the
                        “laycan”, meaning the period during which the <em>Dahua</em> had to arrive in Nanwei and be ready to load
                        the cargo, was between 10 and 20 August. If the <em>Dahua</em> did not meet this laycan, then the defendant would be
                        entitled to cancel the fixture. The term “laycan” or
                        “lay/can” is commonly used in charter contracts as a short
                        form to indicate the dates when the vessel is to be ready to load and the
                        cancelling date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Clause 19 of the Fixture Note incorporated, as
                    part of the first fixture, the terms of the standard form contract devised by
                    The Baltic and International Maritime Council and codenamed
                    “Gencon”. The plaintiff relied on cl 9 of Gencon
                    (“cl 9”) to support its stand. Clause 9 provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>9</b>.    
              <b>Cancelling Clause</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    Should the Vessel not be ready to load (whether in
                            berth or not) on the cancelling date indicated in Box 21, the Charterers
                            shall have the option of cancelling this Charter Party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b)    Should the Owners anticipate that, despite the
                            exercise of due diligence, the Vessel will not be ready to load by the
                            cancelling date, they shall notify the Charterers thereof without delay
                            stating the expected date of the Vessel’s readiness to load and
                            asking whether the Charterers will exercise their option of cancelling
                            the Charter Party, or agree to a new cancelling date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Such option must be declared by the Charterers within 48 running hours
                        after the receipt of the Owners’ notice. If the Charterers do not
                        excise their option of cancelling, then this Charter Party shall be deemed
                        to be amended such that the seventh day after the new readiness date stated
                        in the Owners’ notification to the Charterers shall be the new
                        cancelling date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The provisions of sub-clause (b) of this Clause shall operate only once,
                        and in case of the Vessel’s further delay, the Charterers shall have
                        the option of cancelling the Charter Party as per sub-clause (a) of this
                        Clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 30 July, FLS informed the plaintiff that
                    the ship’s agent for the <em>Dahua</em> at Nanwei
                    would be Bruce Gong (“Mr Gong”), of ASB Group Co., Ltd of
                    Guangdong (“ASB”). This information was passed on to the
                    defendant. Subsequently there was contact directly between Mr Gong and the
                    defendant regarding the loading of the cargo and the cargo documents were duly
                    passed to ASB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The defendant was anxious to ship the cargo as
                    early as possible. On 7 August, and again the next day, the defendant wrote
                    to the plaintiff asking for the status of the <em>Dahua</em>. On 8 August, the plaintiff replied that the vessel was at
                    Yingkou anchorage due to bad weather and, according to its schedule, the
                        <em>Dahua</em> would be at Shanghai between 10 and 12
                    August; at Nanwei between 15 and 17 August; and in Singapore between 22 and 25
                    August. A second e-mail was sent out by the plaintiff later the same day
                    which stated that the vessel would be in Nanwei on 15 August and since there was
                    a very big typhoon in China all plans had been delayed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The defendant did some investigation of its
                    own and, allegedly, Mr Tan was advised that the <em>Dahua</em> was in the vicinity of North Korea on 10 August and
                    nowhere near the vicinity of the bad weather. On 13 August, the defendant
                    informed the plaintiff that the vessel was near North Korean waters. The e-mail
                    alleged that the vessel was already in default of the fixture note as it would
                    need 15 to 18 days to reach Guangzhou. The e-mail ended with the following
                    demand:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Kindly get the replacement vessel asap by today before noon hrs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The plaintiff denied that the vessel was
                    anywhere near North Korea. On the afternoon of 13 August, it informed the
                    defendant that the vessel had berthed in Tianjin. On 14 August, FLS informed the
                    plaintiff that due to continuing poor weather conditions and delays at the
                    various ports in the region, the <em>Dahua</em> would only
                    be able to arrive at Nanwei between 20 and 25 August. Accordingly, on 15
                    August, Ms Ong informed Mr Tan that she had been pushing for a confirmed
                    schedule but so far the best estimate the plaintiff had received regarding the
                        <em>Dahua’s</em> arrival was “ETA 20
                    – 25<sup>th</sup> August”. Ms Ong asked
                    whether the laycan could be extended to 30 August. Her evidence was that Mr Tan
                    rejected this suggestion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading to the disputed second fixture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     By 16 August, the plaintiff was able to put
                    forward some “options” (as Ms Ong called them) to the defendant
                    regarding the shipment. In her e-mail sent at 1.35pm that day, Ms Ong told the
                    defendant that the <em>Dahua</em> was expected to arrive at
                    Nanwei around 30 August and if the defendant was willing to wait, the ship owner
                    wanted it to sign an extension of the fixture note. If the defendant was not
                    interested, then the <em>Dahua</em> would not call at
                    Nanwei. She then advised that: (i) an alternative vessel under consideration,
                    the “<em>Limco Asia</em>”, was not suitable
                    because not all the cargo could be stowed under-deck; and (ii) another possible
                    alternative vessel could load on 24 August at Gaolan port which apparently
                    was close to Nanwei. Ms Ong asked the defendant to check with the shipper of the
                    cargo whether loading at Gaolan would be acceptable. Ms Ong concluded by saying
                    that the plaintiff was still looking for alternatives but these were the three
                    “options” presently available. She wanted Mr Tan’s urgent
                    response on them. However, the defendant did not reply to this e-mail. At 6.37pm
                    on 16 August, Mg Ong informed the defendant that if it did not agree to an
                    extension of the <em>Dahua’s</em> laycan, the fixture
                    note would be void on 20 August as the vessel would not be going to Nanwei to
                    pick up the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Mr Tan was upset by that e-mail. In his
                    response, he indicated that if the <em>Dahua</em> could not
                    meet the terms of the first fixture, the defendant might take legal action. Ms
                    Ong replied on 17 August that the plaintiff had given the defendant three
                    options and the defendant should indicate its choice as otherwise the plaintiff
                    could not proceed. She also complained that Mr Tan had refused to answer her
                    calls. A few hours later at 1.12pm, she sent the defendant an e-mail announcing
                    that the plaintiff had found a “passing by vessel” to load the
                    cargo in Nanwei on 20 August. She asked the defendant to confirm its acceptance
                    of this new vessel and that the cargo was ready for loading as otherwise the
                    vessel’s detention charge would be US$25,000 per day. Ms Ong stressed that
                    she needed an immediate acceptance in order to secure this vessel. The vessel
                    that this e-mail referred to was the “MV AAL Dampier”
                        (“<em>AAL Dampier</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is from this point onwards that the
                    parties’ accounts of what occurred diverge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     According to Ms Ong, the defendant accepted
                    the <em>AAL Dampier</em> and the plaintiff proceeded to
                    secure the vessel by entering into a charter with FLS as the disponent owners of
                    this vessel. According to the charter between the plaintiff and FLS, the ports
                    of loading and discharge were Nanwei and Singapore respectively and the time of
                    shipment was between 19 and 20 August. The freight was US$155,000 lump sum
                    and the detention charge was US$20,000 per day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     There was no signed fixture note between the
                    plaintiff and the defendant in respect of the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em>. The earliest written response to the plaintiff’s
                    email was sent by Ms Winata at about 1.51pm on 17 August. She asked the
                    plaintiff to advise the defendant speedily of the specifications of the vessel.
                    The e-mail stated that the cargo was ready for loading and it needed to be
                    loaded not later than 20 August. Further, the plaintiff should make sure that
                    there was no further delay and that the ETA Singapore of the <em>AAL Dampier</em> was to be no later than 25 August.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     At 2.06pm on 17 August, Ms Ong sent the
                    defendant an e-mail addressed to Ms Winata. The first line of this e-mail read:
                    “Thank you for your confirmation. As discussed, we have confirmed fixing
                    the shipment…”. This first line was followed by the terms of the
                    engagement which identified the vessel as being “AAL tonnage or
                    [substitute] (intention <em>AAL Dampier</em>)”, and
                    specified the following: the port of loading as Nanwei port, the port of
                    discharge as Singapore, the time of shipment as “19 –
                    20.8.2012”, the freight as US$161,000 lump sum and the detention charge
                    as “US$25,000 per day pro rata”. Ms Ong’s testimony was that
                    she had had a conversation with Ms Winata during which the latter had
                    confirmed the charter of the <em>AAL Dampier</em> by
                    the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As far as the plaintiff is concerned, the
                    defendant had agreed orally to charter the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em> to carry the cargo from Nanwei to Singapore and the
                    e-mail summarised above confirmed that. The defendant’s position is that
                    it did not confirm the charter of this vessel. It was only exploring the
                    possibility of loading the cargo on to the same. The defendant says that the
                        <em>AAL Dampier</em> was offered by the plaintiff in an
                    attempt to rectify its breach under the first fixture. The defendant’s
                    interactions with the plaintiff thereafter were an attempt to co-operate in
                    order to mitigate its own loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after 2.06pm on 17 August</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     After the exchange of e-mails detailed above,
                    the parties continued to correspond. On the same day, the plaintiff sent an
                    e-mail giving the defendant the stowage plan of the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em> and also details of its agent. In this e-mail, the
                    plaintiff stated that the vessel’s ETA in Nanwei was 19 August and its ETA
                    in Singapore was 24 August. By a further e-mail sent later that evening, the
                    plaintiff asked the defendant to confirm that the shipper had no problem with
                    customs clearance at Nanwei. Further, the shipper should contact the new agent
                    in respect of loading and ASB was no longer involved with the shipment. The
                    defendant replied that the shipper had been informed of this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The <em>AAL Dampier</em>
                    arrived at Nanwei on 20 August. It tendered its NOR at 1915 hours that evening.
                    The plaintiff was informed by FLS on 22 August that a berth had been booked
                    for the vessel but that there was delay due to congestion at Nanwei
                port.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The <em>AAL Dampier</em>
                    was scheduled to berth on 23 August. In order to confirm the berth, certain
                    shipping/customs documents in relation to the cargo were required by the Nanwei
                    port authorities. It was the defendant’s responsibility, as the shipper,
                    to procure these. The defendant did not supply these shipping/customs documents
                    and as a result the vessel lost the 23 August berth booking. It was then given a
                    tentative berth booking for 27/28 August subject to the shipping/customs
                    documents being made available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 23 August, the defendant informed the
                    plaintiff that the defendant would be loading the cargo on board a different
                    vessel, the “<em>MV Sea Castle</em>” (the
                        “<em>Sea Castle</em>”). Mr Tan said that
                    the defendant was unable to load on the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em> as the previous agent, ASB, had retained the shipping
                    documents. The plaintiff’s reply was that it would charge the defendant
                    dead freight of US$161,000 as well as detention charges. The defendant
                    nevertheless proceeded to load the cargo on the <em>Sea
                        Castle</em> which thereafter transported it to
                Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claim and counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff brought this action to recover
                    its loss arising out of the failure of the defendant to load the cargo onto the
                        <em>AAL Dampier</em>. The plaintiff claimed freight of
                    US$161,000 or, in the alternative, damages for breach of contract. It also
                    claimed detention charges of US$25,000 per day pro-rated for three days.
                    Further, the plaintiff asked for an order that the defendant do indemnify and
                    pay the plaintiff any sum that the plaintiff may be liable to pay the head
                    charterer and/or the owner of the <em>AAL Dampier</em>
                    arising out of the failure of the defendant to perform the charter of the
                    vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The defendant resisted the plaintiff’s
                    claim on the basis that the plaintiff had been in breach of the fixture in
                    respect of the <em>Dahua</em> and that there had never been
                    a confirmed fixture for the <em>AAL Dampier</em>. Thus, the
                    defendant was entitled to ship the cargo by the <em>Sea
                        Castle</em> and to recover the extra costs it had incurred by reason
                    of having to engage this vessel. The defendant also had a counterclaim against
                    the plaintiff for wrongful interference with the defendant’s business
                    relationship with Herrenknecht.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What is the legal position in respect of the first fixture?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The parties have taken opposing positions in
                    relation to the legal effect of the events that occurred between 13 and 17
                    August 2012. The plaintiff’s position is that what occurred fell within
                    cl 9(b) and, as a result, the defendant cancelled the fixture of the
                        <em>Dahua</em> on or about 16 August 2012. The
                    defendant denies that this was the legal effect of those events. It contends, in
                    effect, that cl 9(b) did not come into play because the plaintiff was in
                    breach of the first fixture in that the inability of the <em>Dahua</em> to meet the contracted laycan of between 10 and 20 August
                    2012 arose from the deliberate decision to send the vessel to Tianjin and
                    Qingdao.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I repeat below the portions of cl 9 which
                    are relevant to the issues discussed in this part of the judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b)    Should the Owners anticipate that, despite the
                            exercise of due diligence, the Vessel will not be ready to load by the
                            cancelling date, they shall notify the Charterers thereof without delay
                            stating the expected date of the Vessel’s readiness to load and
                            asking whether the Charterers will exercise their option of cancelling
                            the Charter Party, or agree to a new cancelling date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Such option must be declared by the Charterers within 48 running hours
                        after the receipt of the Owners’ notice. If the Charterers do not
                        excise their option of cancelling, then this Charter Party shall be deemed
                        to be amended such that the seventh day after the new readiness date stated
                        in the Owners’ notification to the Charterers shall be the new
                        cancelling date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Was there a lack of due diligence on the part of the
                plaintiff?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In order to invoke cl 9(b), the plaintiff
                    had to show that the inability of the <em>Dahua</em> to
                    meet the laycan was not due to lack of due diligence on its part. The
                    defendant’s position is based on the plaintiff’s own evidence as
                    shown by its documents and the testimony of Ms Ong. This evidence was that the
                    vessel had not originally been scheduled to call at Tianjin and it was only on
                    13 August 2012 that the plaintiff was informed of the change in the
                    schedule decided on by the owners of the <em>Dahua</em>. On
                    14 August 2012, FLS informed the plaintiff that the laycan could not be met and
                    asked for an extension of laycan to 25 August 2012. Ms Ong’s response to
                    FLS was that the plaintiff was not able to extend the laycan and FLS should find
                    a substitute vessel. The defendant submitted that this evidence showed that the
                    plaintiff knew that it was going to be in breach of the first fixture, yet the
                    plaintiff did not inform the defendant at that time about the request by FLS or
                    that it was trying to find a substitute vessel. Instead, on 15 August 2012 the
                    plaintiff informed the defendant that the ETA of the <em>Dahua</em> was between 20 and 25 August 2012 and asked whether the
                    defendant would agree to extend the laycan to 30 August 2012. Obviously, the
                    defendant submitted, the plaintiff wanted an extension of the laycan so as to
                    avoid a breach of the first fixture on its part. Further, on 16 August
                    2012, the defendant was told that the <em>Dahua</em> had
                    departed Tianjin and diverted to Qingdao to load another lot of cargo and would
                    arrive in Nanwei on 30 August 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Although the defendant did not say so in
                    terms, the implication of this recital of events was that the plaintiff had not
                    exercised due diligence to make the <em>Dahua</em> ready to
                    load at Nanwei by the cancelling date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In my judgment, the evidence does reflect a
                    lack of due diligence on the part of the plaintiff. The plaintiff, as the
                    disponent owner of the <em>Dahua</em> under the second
                    fixture, had a duty to cause the vessel to proceed to the loading port with
                    reasonable despatch or, as cl 9(b) put it, to exercise due diligence to
                    meet the contracted laycan. Whilst there was some evidence of bad weather
                    affecting the vessel’s progress during the period between 8 and
                    10 August, the vessel was sent to Tianjin instead of directly to Shanghai
                    as originally scheduled. Even then, the vessel could perhaps have arrived in
                    Nanwei within the laycan even with a stop-over in Shanghai. However, instead of
                    proceeding to Shanghai and then Nanwei, after Tianjin, the owner sent the vessel
                    to Qingdao. This decision was in breach of the obligation to proceed to Nanwei
                    with reasonable despatch.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It is clear from the correspondence that
                    passed between the plaintiff and FLS that although from 8 August 2012, the
                    plaintiff was actively checking on the position of the <em>Dahua</em> and trying to obtain the firm estimate of when it would
                    arrive in Nanwei, the plaintiff did nothing to try and compel the vessel to meet
                    the laycan. Whilst on 13 August the plaintiff remonstrated with FLS about the
                    change in the itinerary of the vessel, it went no further than asking for an
                    urgent solution to solve the problem of the laycan. It seems thereafter to have
                    concentrated on trying to find a substitute vessel for the defendant. This may
                    have been a practical approach, given that the plaintiff was not in a position
                    to force the <em>Dahua</em> to sail to Nanwei, but it did
                    not establish due diligence in attempting to meet the laycan set by the first
                    fixture. As early as 15 August, the owner indicated that the estimated arrival
                    date at Nanwei was between 20 and 25 August and asked for the laycan to be
                    extended to 30 August. Shortly thereafter, the owner’s decision to
                    divert the vessel to Qingdao made it impossible for the vessel to arrive at
                    Nanwei within the laycan and thus equally impossible for the plaintiff to claim
                    that it had exercised due diligence to meet the laycan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Was a proper notice given under cl 9?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As the plaintiff did not exercise due
                    diligence to bring the <em>Dahua</em> to Nanwei within the
                    laycan, it was not able to invoke cl 9(b). However, the submissions of the
                    parties discuss at some length the issue of whether, if the plaintiff had been
                    entitled to do so, it met the notice requirements of the clause. Thus, although
                    the issue is not pertinent to my ultimate decision, I will consider whether the
                    plaintiff gave a notice in the terms required by cl 9(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The defendant argues that the notice given by
                    the plaintiff was inadequate and did not meet the requirements of cl 9(b).
                    In particular, the plaintiff failed to: (a) notify it of the revised expected
                    date of the <em>Dahua’s</em> readiness to load; and
                    (b) ask the defendant whether it would be exercising its option of either
                    cancelling the charter or agreeing to a new cancelling date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The plaintiff relies on three e-mails to show
                    that the requisite notice was given. These are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_a"></a>(a)     The e-mail of 15 August 2012 when
                        the plaintiff informed the defendant that so far the best date given by the
                        owner was “ETA 20 – 25 August” and that the owner had
                        asked for an extension of laycan to 30 August, and if not granted, the owner
                        would look for another vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_b"></a>(b)     The e-mail of 16 August 2012, at 1.35pm, when the
                        plaintiff informed the defendant that the <em>Dahua</em> had diverted to Qingdao and it was expected to arrive
                        at Nanwei on 30 August; and if the defendant was willing to wait for that
                        vessel it had to sign an extension of the first fixture, otherwise the
                        vessel would not call at Nanwei. Further, the plaintiff advised the
                        defendant of a possible vessel that could load at Gaolan port on 24 August.
                        The plaintiff asked the defendant to “advise your choice of
                        acceptance urgently”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_35-p2_c"></a>(c)     The e-mail of 16 August 2012, at 6.37pm, when the
                        plaintiff told the defendant that if it did not agree to an extension of the
                        laycan, the first fixture would “be void on 20 August” and the
                            <em>Dahua</em> would not be going to pick up the
                        cargo and asked the defendant to advise it of the defendant’s decision
                        regarding the extension and the other “options” mentioned in
                        the earlier e-mail of the same day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The legal position regarding unilateral
                    notices served pursuant to contractual rights is that such notices should be
                    interpreted objectively and purposively: See <em>Mannai
                        Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd</em> [1997] AC
                    749. The House of Lords in that case stated that the question to be decided was
                    how a reasonable recipient of such a notice, circumstanced as the actual
                    recipient was, would understand the notice. The court also stated that the
                    purpose for which a notice is given must be taken into account when determining
                    the validity of the notice (per Lord Steyn at 767–769).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The defendant argued that <em>The “Madeleine”</em> [1967] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 224
                        (“<em>Madeleine</em>”) and <em>The</em> “<em>Helvetia-S</em>” [1960] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 540 (“<em>Helvetia-S</em>”) stipulate that a notice of delay
                    given by an owner under a cancellation clause in the charter party is only valid
                    if there is strict adherence to the requirements of the clause. The cases do not
                    stand for this proposition. In fact, both cases do not even discuss when a
                    notice of delay given by an owner to a charterer will be valid. Rather, they
                    concern the issue of whether the charterer is entitled to cancel a charter party
                    pursuant to a cancellation clause before the stipulated cancelling date when it
                    is clear that the owner will be unable to tender the ship in time. They decided
                    that the charterers had no such right under the cancellation clauses in question
                        (<em>Madeleine</em> at 244; <em>Helvetia-S</em> at 552). Those clauses gave the charterer an option
                    to cancel should the vessel not be delivered on a specified date. They were
                    quite unlike cl 9(b) which provides for a notice to be given by the owner
                    in anticipation of an inability to deliver on a specified date and for the
                    notice to be given in advance of that delivery date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the present case, the plaintiff’s
                    e-mail at 1.35 pm on 16 August advised the defendant that the estimated time of
                    arrival of the <em>Dahua</em> at Nanwei was 30 August 2012.
                    The plaintiff also asked whether the defendant was prepared to wait and extend
                    the laycan. This e-mail clearly meets the requirements of cl 9(b) because
                    it states the revised expected date of the <em>Dahua’s</em> readiness to load and poses the question to the
                    defendant as to whether the latter was willing to agree to the new date. Implied
                    in this question was the further question of whether, instead of agreeing to the
                    new date, the defendant would prefer to exercise its option in cancelling the
                    first fixture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The defendant argues that this e-mail only
                    stated the date of the <em>Dahua’s</em> expected
                    arrival in Nanwei as opposed to the expected date of the vessel’s
                    readiness to load as required by cl 9(b). The defendant’s
                    interpretation of the e-mail is overly pedantic and technical. The e-mail stated
                    that the <em>Dahua’s</em> revised expected date of
                    arrival was 30 August 2012. A reasonable recipient in the defendant’s
                    position would have understood this to mean that the earliest date of the
                    vessel’s expected readiness to load was also 30 August 2012. In fact, the
                    plaintiff was telling the defendant that if it was willing to accept the change
                    of date, it would have to sign an extension of the fixture to this
                date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The defendant also argues that the e-mail
                    should not be considered a notice concerning the cancellation of the first
                    fixture because the plaintiff was simply forwarding the message it received from
                    the owner of the <em>Dahua</em>. This argument must be
                    rejected. The e-mail cannot be construed simply as a forwarded message sent for
                    the defendant’s information only since the plaintiff explicitly requested
                    the defendant to decide whether it was willing to extend the laycan and to
                    advise its choice urgently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     For the reasons given above, it is my view
                    that had the plaintiff exercised due diligence to meet the laycan, the notices
                    it gave the defendant on 16 August 2012, in particular the email of 1.35 pm,
                    would have served as valid notice under cl 9(b).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   What was the legal position on 16 and 17 August
                2013?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The fact that the plaintiff was not entitled
                    to invoke cl 9(b) is not the end of the matter. The position on 16 August
                    2012 was that the plaintiff had clearly notified the defendant that it was
                    unable to meet the contractual laycan. It asked the defendant to agree to an
                    extension of the laycan. It was entitled to do this as a method of avoiding a
                    breach of contract by an agreed variation of terms. There was nothing sinister
                    in such a request as the defendant implied. The defendant remained free to
                    reject the request. The legal consequence of the events that occurred was that
                    on 16 August 2012 there existed a situation of anticipatory breach of contract
                    on the part of the plaintiff. The defendant then had the choice to affirm the
                    contract or to accept the breach and terminate the contract. The
                    defendant’s position is that it took the first course. In my judgment, it
                    actually took the latter one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The defendant did not accept the new laycan
                    suggested by the owner of the <em>Dahua</em>. Nor did it
                    state explicitly in any correspondence that it wanted to cancel the first
                    fixture. Ms Ong’s evidence was that after she had made the request that
                    the laycan be extended to 30 August, Mr Tan called her and said it was too late
                    and asked her to look for a substitute vessel. Such a response was arguably a
                    termination of the first fixture. The defendant denied that this had happened.
                    However, I am satisfied that the defendant’s conduct and the evidence
                    support the conclusion that it terminated the first fixture, if not on
                    16 August then on 17 August. I should state here that although from time to
                    time below I may use the terms “cancel” and
                    “cancellation” I do not mean to imply that cl 9(b) was in
                    operation during this period. I use the terms as synonyms for
                    “terminate” and “termination” and because the
                    parties used them in the course of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     First, I note that when Mr Tan was asked in
                    court whether he had insisted that the <em>Dahua</em>
                    perform the first fixture, although he was somewhat evasive, he finally agreed
                    that he had not insisted that the <em>Dahua</em> go to
                    Nanwei in any case. The following is taken from the Notes of Evidence:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The emails on the 15th and 16th, we’ve just

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Your questions. Because actually I did not stop her

                            first fixture note on whether to come in or not.</span></p>

                            or disagree?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Disagree.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Second, the defendant did not at any time
                    after 1.12pm on 17 August insist that the <em>Dahua</em>
                    call at Nanwei on or before 20 August 2012. While at 11.32pm on 16 August, Mr
                    Tan had threatened to take legal action under the first fixture, this threat was
                    not repeated thereafter. Instead, the defendant leapt at the opportunity on the
                    17 August to get another vessel to carry the cargo. The significance of 1.12pm
                    on 17 August was that was the time when the plaintiff first notified the
                    defendant of the availability of the <em>AAL
                    Dampier</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As early as 13 August, the defendant had asked
                    the plaintiff to look for a new vessel to replace the <em>Dahua</em>. Under the first fixture, it had no right to do
                    this—it was stuck with the <em>Dahua</em> until and
                    unless the vessel was not ready to load in Nanwei at the end of the laycan, that
                    is 20 August 2012. It was only when the plaintiff’s emails on the morning
                    of 16 August arrived that the defendant was given the opportunity to get out of
                    the first fixture without incurring any potential legal liability to the
                    plaintiff. Even if Mr Tan did not call Ms Ong soon thereafter and say he was not
                    willing to wait, the defendant’s response to the plaintiff’s offer
                    of the <em>AAL Dampier</em> the next day shows that it had
                    terminated the first fixture. The defendant has denied concluding the second
                    fixture but there is no doubt that it was actively exploring the suitability of
                    the <em>AAL Dampier</em> to carry the cargo and went as far
                    as instructing its shipper to load on that vessel. Whether the second fixture
                    was concluded or not, this conduct on the part of the defendant coupled with its
                    lack of interest in the <em>Dahua</em> thereafter shows
                    that it had cancelled the first fixture. Of course, if the second fixture was
                    concluded that would mean that the first fixture was at an end as the defendant
                    had clearly indicated its intention to transport the cargo on the <em>AAL Dampier</em> instead of the <em>Dahua</em> and could not have been legally bound to do
                both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The defendant submits that it is entitled to
                    damages by reason of the plaintiff’s breach of the first fixture. I accept
                    that a theoretical right to damages arose since the termination of the first
                    fixture was due to the plaintiff’s breach. However to establish a legal
                    right to recover the same, the defendant must show that the damages it says it
                    incurred were the result of the breach. I discuss this further
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there a concluded second fixture?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The plaintiff submits that the second fixture
                    was made on or about 17 August 2012 and that it was partly oral and partly
                    in writing. As I have said, the defendant denies that the second fixture was
                    ever concluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In cases such as the present one, where
                    parties carry on negotiations with a view to conclude a contract, “the
                    courts look at the whole course of the negotiations between both parties in
                    order to ascertain if an agreement is reached at any given point in
                    time”: <em>Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence
                        Peter</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 332 at [53].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     As I have mentioned, from 13 August 2012
                    onwards, the defendant was concerned about the progress of the <em>Dahua</em> and whether it would arrive at Nanwei within the
                    laycan. From that date, the defendant had asked the plaintiff to look for a
                    substitute vessel. The plaintiff itself told FLS on 14 August 2012 that it
                    did not want to extend the laycan of the <em>Dahua</em> to
                    25 August and that it wanted a substitute vessel. By 16 August, both the
                    plaintiff and FLS had been actively pursuing other options. This was shown in
                    the 1.35pm e-mail on 16 August when the plaintiff informed the defendant of two
                    other ships it had investigated: the “<em>Limco
                        Asia</em>” which was not suitable due to insufficient cargo
                    space and another vessel which would be able to load at Gaolan port on 24
                    August. On 17 August 2012, therefore, the context in which the parties were
                    operating was that they were carrying on an active and anxious search for a
                    vessel to replace the <em>Dahua</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On that day, FLS informed the plaintiff that
                    the <em>AAL Dampier</em> was available to transport the
                    defendant’s cargo and asked the plaintiff if FLS could “fix
                    her”. FLS had to respond to the owner of the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em> by 2pm that day. The plaintiff passed the message on to
                    the defendant in an e-mail sent at 1.12pm on 17 August. The pertinent parts of
                    this e-mail read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have found a passing vessel to load your cargoes in Nanwei Port on

                    evidence that there was a telephone conversation between him and Ms Ong after
                    the plaintiff’s e-mail cited above was sent. The relevant parts of the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Ms Winata sent out several e-mails to the
                    plaintiff that afternoon and evening. The first was dated at 1.51pm and it
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Kindly advise us your vessel specification Fast and Kindly take note cargo
                        is ready to load on vessel &amp; its inside port near the ship side
                        only.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">And Kindly make sure no further delay, cargo need to load not later than
                        20 Aug and Pls make sure ETA SINGAPORE NOT LATER THAN 25 AUG 2012 due to LC
                        requirement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In its submissions, the plaintiff
                    characterises the conversation between Mr Tan and Ms Ong as showing the
                    defendant’s acceptance of the <em>AAL Dampier</em> albeit based on conditional terms that that
                    vessel would be able to load the cargo at Nanwei. It argues that the terms of
                    the concluded second fixture were contained in an e-mail (which it calls the
                    “fixture recap”) the plaintiff sent to the defendant at 2.06pm.
                    The e-mail stipulates some terms and general conditions of the fixture that the
                    parties were negotiating. However, the defendant had not at this point given a
                    final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of the plaintiff’s
                    offer. The plaintiff had not yet reassured the defendant about the <em>AAL Dampier’s</em> ability to transport the cargo. The
                    evidence suggests that the vessel had to have an attached crane to lift the
                    cargo. Indeed, in two e-mails dated 17 August 2012 sent to the plaintiff
                    thereafter, at 2.20pm and 4.17pm, the defendant continued to ask for additional
                    information (<em>eg</em>, the vessel’s
                    “stowage plan” and some other details).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The plaintiff gave the defendant the
                    vessel’s stowage plan, its estimated time of arrival in Nanwei and
                    Singapore and some other details at 4.34pm the same day. Thereafter, at 6.07pm,
                    the plaintiff posed a number of queries to the defendant by e-mail. The
                    defendant responded at 6.19pm with its answer entered in uppercase letters next
                    to the questions. The plaintiff’s original e-mail together with the
                    defendant’s responses read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(AA) Please confirm that the shipper has no problem with the customs
                        clearance at port of Loading to have the cargoes load onboard MV “All
                        Dampier”, If so, we will proceed to bring the vessel to Nanwei Port
                        as per schedule. Kindly advise urgently. – SHIPPER CONFIRM ON THIS
                        ISSUE.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(BB) Please inform the shipper only contact our new agent, AAL, for the
                        loading the cargoes onboard Mv “AAL Dampier”. Please inform
                        them that Bruce is no longer involved with the shipment. – ALREADY
                        INFORMED.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(CC) Please ensure that the shipper will only be loading the cargoes
                        onboard MV “AAL Dampier” instead any other vessel. –
                        NOTED, ALREADY INFORMED.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In the light of the confirmation given by the defendant in
                        this e-mail, I am of the view that there can be no doubt that the second
                        fixture was concluded by this time. The conditional acceptance given by Mr
                        Tan over the telephone in the afternoon had, at the latest by 6.19 pm,
                        become an unconditional acceptance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In fact, the defendant itself acknowledged the
                    existence of the concluded second fixture in an e-mail it sent to ASB on 22
                    August 2012. ASB was the local shipping agent the plaintiff had appointed
                    for the <em>Dahua</em> (but not the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em>). As mentioned above, the parties encountered problems in
                    obtaining the shipping/customs documents for the cargo after the <em>AAL Dampier</em> arrived at Nanwei port. These documents were
                    needed for the <em>AAL Dampier</em> to berth. In the
                    circumstances, Mr Tan wrote to Mr Gong of ASB stating the defendant did not have
                    a contract for the <em>Sea Castle</em> in the following
                    terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no way we can load our goods with the said vessel which does not
                        have Crane. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please do take note that I have a contract with AAL Dampier. I DO NOT
                        have any contract with your said vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     During cross-examination, Mr Tan maintained
                    that this was not an acknowledgment that the defendant had entered into the
                    second fixture. He explained that he wrote this e-mail under the instructions of
                    Ms Ong in a desperate bid to obtain the shipping/customs documents. However, as
                    the plaintiff points out, “this explanation appears nowhere in his
                    AEIC” and therefore does indeed appear to be an afterthought. Even if Ms
                    Ong had advised him to write this e-mail, it must reflect what he regarded as
                    the true state of affairs then (<em>ie</em>, the parties
                    had concluded a fixture for the <em>AAL Dampier</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The defendant’s second argument is that
                    even if the second fixture was concluded, the same was void because a
                    fundamental term, the laycan, had not been agreed. The plaintiff’s
                    response is that the laycan was agreed and that it was 19 to 20 August
                    2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The plaintiff referred to the “fixture
                    recap” that it sent to the defendant on 17 August 2012 at 2.06pm. This
                    document states that the “time of shipment” is 19 to 20 August
                    2012. The plaintiff argues that the parties were aware that “time of
                    shipment” meant the laycan for the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em>. The defendant’s argument is that this phrase
                    referred to the date that the cargo was meant to reach Singapore and that the
                    laycan was left undecided.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The defendant’s argument is
                    disingenuous. The defendant’s most urgent concern on 17 August was to ship
                    the cargo by 20 August. In Ms Winata’s e-mail to the plaintiff at
                    1.51pm, sent out just before the defendant received the “fixture
                    recap”, the defendant said that the cargo had to be loaded by 20 August
                    and that it had to reach Singapore latest by 25 August. It was not asking for a
                    commitment that the cargo would reach Singapore by 20 August. When it received
                    the “fixture recap” e-mail, the defendant must have understood
                    that “time of shipment” meant the period in which the vessel had
                    to be available for loading at the load port and did not mean the discharge of
                    cargo at the discharge port. Thus, when the plaintiff informed the defendant at
                    4.34pm that the <em>AAL Dampier</em> would “ETA
                    Nanwei 19.8 PM, ETA Singapore (Jurong) 24.8 PM”, the defendant did not
                    protest. Instead, at 6.19pm, the defendant confirmed that its shipper had no
                    problem with customs clearance at Nanwei and the cargo could be loaded on board
                        <em>AAL Dampier</em>. The factual matrix makes it plain
                    that both parties intended the phrase “time of shipment” to refer
                    to the laycan under the second fixture.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the
                    laycan term was agreed by the parties and that the second fixture was not void
                    by reason of uncertainty of terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Did the AAL Dampier tender a valid NOR on 20 August 2012?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     A valid NOR can only be given when the vessel
                    concerned (a) has arrived at its specified destination; (b) is in a state of
                    readiness to load or discharge; and (c) has fulfilled any additional
                    requirements contained in the charter: John Schofield, <em>Laytime and Demurrage</em> (Informa Law &amp; Finance, 6th Ed, 2011)
                    at para 3.267.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The defendant contends that the NOR tendered
                    by the <em>AAL Dampier</em> on 20 August 2012 was invalid
                    because the vessel was not in a state of readiness to load since it had not
                    berthed at Nanwei on that date. Therefore, the defendant is saying that the
                    second fixture required the vessel to berth at Nanwei before giving its NOR. The
                    plaintiff argues that the NOR was valid because the second fixture was a port
                    charter. It contends that the <em>AAL Dampier</em> was
                    an “arrived vessel” as of 20 August 2012 when it arrived at Nanwei
                    port and was entitled to tender its NOR then, notwithstanding the fact that it
                    had not berthed. It also argues that the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em> could not berth on time because the defendant had failed
                    to secure the shipping/customs documents related to the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     A berth charter is one that requires a vessel
                    to proceed to a named berth or one that contains an express right for the
                    charterers to nominate a berth. A port charter is one that “requires the
                    vessel to proceed for loading to a named port, but not to some particular berth
                    either specified in the charter or by the express terms of the charter to be
                    specified by the charterer”: <em>North River Freighters,
                        Ltd v President of India</em> [1955] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 668 at 679.
                    In a port charter, a ship is said to have “arrived” even when it
                    is not berthed if (a) it is within the port; and (b) it is at the immediate
                    and effective disposition of the charterer. The vessel will be in such a
                    position if it is at a place where waiting ships usually lie except in
                    “extraordinary circumstances” which must be proven by the
                    charterers: <em>The Johanna Oldendorff</em> [1974] AC 479
                    at 535H.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     In the present case, the second fixture was a
                    port charter. This can be deduced from the correspondence. The “fixture
                    recap” lists the <em>ports</em> of loading and
                    discharge as Nanwei and Singapore respectively. Furthermore, the defendant
                    unqualifiedly acceded to the plaintiff’s query if they could
                    “proceed to bring the vessel to Nanwei port as per schedule” in an
                    e-mail sent at 6.19pm on 17 August 2012. These pieces of evidence suggest that
                    the contractual destination was Nanwei port and not a named berth thereat. This
                    is in contrast to the first fixture which provided the loading port to be
                    “Owners Berth Nanwei Port”. Therefore, under the second fixture,
                    the <em>AAL Dampier</em> was an “arrived
                    vessel” as of 20 August 2012 when it arrived at Nanwei port. It was
                    entitled to tender its NOR on that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Consequence of a valid NOR having been tendered on 20 August
                2012</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The purpose of an NOR is to inform the
                    charterer that loading may commence. A valid NOR also causes the laytime to
                    commence. Laytime is the period of time during which the loading operation must
                    be completed. Upon expiry of the laytime, liability for further delay in
                    completing loading of the vessel shifts to the charterers: see generally Stephen
                    Girvin, <em>Carriage of Goods by Sea</em> (Oxford
                    University Press, 2nd Ed, 2011) at paras 32.22 and
                32.37–32.38.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The second fixture does not contain a laytime
                    clause which sets out a specific loading time. Instead, the following provisions
                    of the “fixture recap” served to indicate how detention would be
                    charged:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Cargo to be delivered/received as fast as vessel can load/discharge
                        otherwise detention to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Time lost due to swell and/or weather and/or waiting for loading and/or
                        discharging berth on ships [<em>sic</em>] arrival at or
                        off port…will be charged as time for which detention is due.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The tendering of the NOR on 20 August 2012 had
                    the effect of notifying the defendant that the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em> was ready to load. From then the liability for any delay
                    in loading the vessel shifted to the defendant and the time that the vessel
                    spent waiting to berth was on the defendant. The <em>AAL Dampier</em> was not loaded in the period between NOR and 23
                    August 2012 and did not even berth then. On the basis of the clauses set out
                    above, the time that the vessel spent waiting to berth, up to the time when the
                    defendant repudiated the second fixture on 23 August would count as detention
                    for which the defendant had to pay.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">What would be the position if the second fixture was a berth
                charter?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Even if the second fixture was a berth
                    charter, the defendant’s failure of its obligation to secure the
                    shipping/customs documents for the cargo which would have enabled the <em>AAL Dampier</em> to obtain a berth and thereby become an
                    “arrived” vessel, makes it responsible for detention charges. In
                        <em>The Atlantic Sunbeam</em> [1973] 1 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 482 in 488, the court held that it was an implied term of charter parties
                    that charterers will act with “reasonable despatch and in accordance with
                    the ordinary practice of the port” of loading/discharge in carrying out
                    acts which had to be done by them to enable the vessel to become an
                    “arrived vessel”. <em>The World
                        Navigator</em> [1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 23 at 29 suggests that
                    in the event of breach of this implied term, the commencement of laytime may be
                    antedated to the date it would have begun but for the breach (<em>ie</em>, the liability for delay shifts to the charterers as of the
                    date when the ship would have become an “arrived vessel” but for
                    the charterers’ breach). The term in the “fixture recap”
                    that time spent waiting for berth would count as detention time is also relevant
                    in this connection as similar clauses have been interpreted as applying only to
                    cases where a berth is not available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The evidence here suggests that certain
                    shipping/customs documents relating to the cargo were required by the Nanwei
                    port authorities for the <em>AAL Dampier</em> to
                    obtain a berth. These shipping/customs documents were prepared by the Chinese
                    shipper of the cargo and were submitted to ASB at the time when the first
                    fixture was still afoot. When it became apparent that the <em>Dahua</em> would not arrive by the cancelling date, the defendant
                    approached Mr Gong and requested him to look for another vessel to ship its
                    cargo. Mr Gong in turn approached one Mr Louis of Uptrans/Jade Shipping who
                    secured the <em>Sea Castle</em>. It appears that Mr Gong
                    gave Mr Louis the shipping/customs documents. Subsequently, Mr Louis refused to
                    release these documents and insisted that the cargo be loaded onto the <em>Sea Castle</em>. As a result, the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em> was unable to berth and become an arrived
                ship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The plaintiff had informed the defendant that
                    Austral Asia Line (“AAL”) and not ASB was its agent for the
                        <em>AAL Dampier</em> as early as 17 August 2012.
                    The defendant had confirmed that customs clearance was in order for the
                        <em>AAL Dampier</em> in an e-mail dated the same day.
                    Yet, it seems that the defendant did not or could not ensure that the
                    shipping/customs documents were handed over to AAL before the arrival of the
                        <em>AAL Dampier</em> at Nanwei.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The defendant’s contention is that the
                    delay was caused by the plaintiff’s lateness in applying for a berth. To
                    this end, it adduced the following e-mail from Mr Tan to Ms Ong:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Below is what they found out from the berthing officer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Just double-confirm with Harbor supervisor, the vessel for loading S-608
                        parts just only can berth the wharf from the afternoon of 22-Aug-2012 due to
                        the delay of application for berthing, which wharf was berth at another
                        vessel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>Ms Ong was cross-examined on this issue and her responses were
                        as follows:</p>

                        berth.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Have you adduced any evidence to show

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It is in evidence that the plaintiff had not
                    applied for a berth before the <em>AAL Dampier’s</em>
                    arrival on 20 August 2012. However, it cannot be said that it was <em>late</em> in applying for the berth because the plaintiff
                    needed the shipping/customs documents to do so. It did not have these documents
                    as a result of the defendant’s failure to ensure beforehand that these
                    documents were handed to the plaintiff’s newly appointed agents. That is
                    the implication of Ms Ong’s evidence: that even if the plaintiff was late,
                    an earlier application would have had no success because of the
                    defendant’s breach of its obligation to take steps that would have enabled
                    the <em>AAL Dampier</em> to become an arrived vessel. The
                    position is made even clearer by the fact that the allotment of a berth on 23
                    August was cancelled due to the absence of the shipping/customs clearance
                    documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Repudiation of the second fixture</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     On 22 August 2012, with the issue of the
                    shipping/customs documents still unresolved, Ms Ong wrote to the defendant
                    informing it that the <em>AAL Dampier</em> was only
                    expected to berth on 27 or 28 August 2012. The defendant wrote to the plaintiff
                    on 23 August 2012 to advise that it would be loading the cargo onto the
                        <em>Sea Castle</em>. By doing so, the defendant was in
                    repudiatory breach of the second fixture.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>However, there is an arithmetical error in the
                        defendant’s calculation. On the basis of the figures above, the total
                        US dollar amount expended by it in respect of the <em>Sea
                            Castle</em> was US$176,208.67. This means that the defendant spent
                        US$15,208.67 (not US$9,208.67) more than if it had shipped on the <em>Dahua</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     It is not clear to me why the defendant
                    incurred travel expenses between 8 and 12 August 2012, and again between 28 and
                    30 August 2012, and how such expenses (as well as the bank charges) were caused
                    by the plaintiff’s breach of contract. Since the reason for these expenses
                    and their connection to the breach have not been explained, I would not, in any
                    case, have allowed the defendant to recover them. The defendant, however, has a
                    bigger problem. This is that it would not have incurred the ocean freight paid
                    to ASB or the <em>Sea Castle’s</em> detention charges
                    if it had not breached the second fixture. These expenses arose out of its own
                    inability to load the cargo on board the <em>AAL
                        Dampier</em> and its subsequent repudiation of the second fixture. The
                    defendant’s additional expenses did not arise from the plaintiff’s
                    breach of the first fixture and therefore cannot be recovered.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The plaintiff seeks to recover damages in the
                    sum of US$236,000, or such other sum as may be assessed. The figure
                    mentioned comprises the freight on the shipment of US$161,000 and detention
                    charges of US$75,000 on the basis of the agreed rate of US$25,000 per day on a
                    pro-rata basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In my judgment, whilst the plaintiff is
                    entitled to recover the full quantum of the detention charges, it cannot recover
                    the full freight it would have charged had the cargo been loaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In relation to the detention charges, it was a
                    term of the contract that detention would be paid at the stated rate for the
                    number of days the <em>AAL Dampier</em> was detained.
                    The plaintiff’s claim is based on a detention period of three days or part
                    thereof from the service of the NOR on 20 August until the defendant’s
                    repudiation of the second fixture on 23 August 2012. The defendant did not
                    challenge the plaintiff’s computation; it only challenged the right of the
                    plaintiff to claim detention. This challenge was mainly premised on the argument
                    that there was no concluded second fixture. Since I have found against the
                    defendant on that point, the defendant must pay detention charges at the agreed
                    rate for the period stated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     On the damages claim, the plaintiff is not
                    entitled to claim the full contractual freight charges of US$161,000. The second
                    fixture provided that the freight was to be fully prepaid on completion of
                    loading and to be deemed earned as the cargo was being loaded. The cargo was not
                    loaded. Thus, the full freight was never earned. In the absence of a contractual
                    entitlement to the full freight, the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages
                    instead. As is well known, damages are compensatory and intended to place the
                    innocent party in the position it would have been in had the other party not
                    breached the contract. In this case, if the cargo had been loaded, the defendant
                    would have paid the plaintiff freight of US$161,000 but the plaintiff in turn
                    would have been obliged to pay FLS freight of US$155,000 for the carriage of the
                    cargo. Thus, the damage suffered by the plaintiff was only the loss of the
                    US$6,000 profit that it would have made on the overall transaction. Thus, it can
                    only recover US$6,000 as damages for non-shipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Apart from damages, the plaintiff has prayed
                    for an order that the defendant indemnify it against any sum that it may be
                    liable to pay the head charterer (<em>ie</em>, FLS) arising
                    out of the defendant’s failure to ship the cargo on the <em>AAL Dampier</em>. The plaintiff contends that it had specifically
                    chartered the vessel from FLS to perform the second fixture and that it now
                    faces a claim from FLS as a result of the defendant’s breach of the same.
                    I accept this argument. The plaintiff’s failure to meet its contractual
                    obligation to FLS in respect of the <em>AAL Dampier</em>
                    was due entirely to the defendant’s breach of the second fixture. If the
                    plaintiff’s liability to FLS had already been ascertained, the plaintiff
                    could recover the same from the defendant as part of the compensatory principle.
                    Since such liability has not yet been determined, the plaintiff is entitled to a
                    declaration that the defendant must indemnify it when liability is
                    ascertained.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Is the plaintiff liable for the tort of wrongful interference with
                trade?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The defendant has a separate counterclaim
                    based on the assertion that the plaintiff has committed the tort of wrongful
                    interference with trade. The defendant argues that two letters that the
                    plaintiff sent to Herrenkencht on 2 and 11 October 2012 (“the two
                    letters”), which raised the possibility of Herrenknecht being joined as
                    an alternate defendant to the plaintiff’s present proceedings against the
                    defendant, were written with an intention to injure the defendant’s
                    business relationship with Herrenknecht. The defendant claims that the plaintiff
                    knew at all times that the defendant was not acting as Herrenknecht’s
                    agents. Hence, there was no legal basis to include Herrenknecht in a proceeding
                    against it. The defendant invites the court to draw the inference that the two
                    letters were written with an intention to convey the message that “the
                    defendant could not be trusted to do Herrenknecht’s business without legal
                    ramifications for Herrenknecht”. The defendant claims that it suffered
                    loss because, subsequently, Herrenknecht failed to award it two contracts it was
                    expecting to receive and also barred the defendant from participating in any
                    future tenders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     To establish a claim of wrongful interference
                    with trade, the claimant must show that (a) the defendant has committed an
                    unlawful act affecting a third party; (b) the defendant acted with an intention
                    to injured the claimant; and (c) the defendant’s conduct in fact resulted
                    in damage to the claimant: Gary Chan Kok Yew &amp; Lee Pey Woan, <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2011)
                    at para 15.028. The defendant fails on all three counts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     First, the defendant has not even submitted on
                    how the plaintiff’s acts can be regarded as “unlawful”.
                    Second, the defendant has not shown that the plaintiff acted with an intention
                    to cause loss to the defendant as an end in itself, or as a means to an end:
                        <em>OBG Ltd v Allan</em> [2008] 1 AC at
                    [42]–[43]. The plaintiff’s solicitors, Joseph Tan Jude Benny LLP,
                    drafted the two letters. The plaintiff’s position is that the two letters
                    were sent merely to establish the exact relationship between the defendant and
                    Herrenknecht and which party it should sue. While their true intention might not
                    have been quite so innocuous, I am of the view that the plaintiff’s
                    solicitors were merely exploring all their options before commencing litigation.
                    The defendant has not shown that the two letters were sent with the intention to
                    injure the defendant’s business relationship with Herrenknecht. Third,
                    there is no evidence to show that the Herrenknecht discontinued its business
                    relations with the defendant because of the plaintiff’s conduct. In fact,
                    by 23 August 2012, Herrenknecht had already issued a lawyer’s letter to
                    the defendant because of the problems encountered in shipping the cargo to
                    Singapore. Therefore, it is likely that relationship between the defendant and
                    Herrenknecht had already broken down by then. Hence, the plaintiff’s two
                    letters cannot be said to have caused the defendant to lose Herrenknecht’s
                    business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
