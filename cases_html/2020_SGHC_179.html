This was said to follow from the proper construction of the service management agreement between each of the first and second defendants on one hand, and the third defendant on the other, the International Safety Management Code (2002 Ed) published by the International Maritime Organisation (the “ISM Code”), and case law. It was also argued that the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">judicata</span> did not apply to warrant the action being struck out, one of the reasons being that the assessment of damages should not take into account payments with no admission of liability.

Taking first the appeal in respect of O 14 r 12 of the ROC (RA 274 of 2019), I found that the first and second defendants fell within the use of the term “agent” in the settlement agreement because of the clauses governing their roles under the SHIPMAN 2009 contracts. Even if the first and second defendants were independent contractors in certain senses, as contended for by the plaintiff, that did not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto </span>preclude them from being agents as well, and they were such in the context of the settlement agreement and the contracts.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 That being my conclusion on the O 14 r 12 matter, the plaintiff was precluded from suing outside the settlement agreement, which would amount to an abuse of process. I also found that the plaintiff was similarly precluded by operation of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> as the claims against the first and second defendants should have been raised in the 2016 suit, but the plaintiff did not do so.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Both appeals in RAs 273 and 274 were therefore dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Determination under O 14 r 12 of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 I found that the issue set out at [5] above should be determined, and that the appropriate determination was that the first and second defendants were, for the purposes of the settlement agreement, agents of the third defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether such determination was appropriate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 O 14 r 12 of the ROC allows for the determination of a question of law or construction of a document without trial. It provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(1) The Court may, upon the application of a party or of its own motion, determine any question of law or construction of any document arising in any cause or matter where it appears to the Court that –</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) such question is suitable for determination without a full trial of the action; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) such determination will fully determine (subject only to any possible appeal) the entire cause or matter or any claim or issue therein.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[…]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span> Vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2020 Ed) (<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2020</span>) make clear at [14/12/4] that it is not the case that an application under O 14 r 12 of the ROC should only be made if the decision would finally determine the entire cause of matter. This point is buttressed by clear authority to that effect in <span class="font-italic">Payna Chettiar v Maimoon bte </span><span class="font-italic">Ismail</span> <span class="font-italic">and others </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 738 at [34], and <span class="font-italic">Beam Technology (Mfg) Pte Ltd v Standard Chartered Bank</span> [2003] 1 SLR 597 at [8]. Thus, a determination by the court may be made if it would save time and costs, even if it does not dispose of the entire dispute: see also <span class="font-italic">Ong &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Ngu Tieng Ung</span> [1999] 4 SLR 379 at [8]. The overriding consideration in deciding when the discretion will be exercised is whether summary determination on the facts of the case would fulfil the underlying purpose of O 14 r 12 of the ROC, to save time and costs for the parties: <span class="font-italic">TMT Asia Ltd v BHP Billiton Marketing AG (Singapore Branch)</span><span class="font-italic"> and another</span> [2015] 2 SLR 540 at [32];<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">ANB v ANF</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1 at [61].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 That said, factual disputes would not be suitable for an application under O 14 r 12 of the ROC. In <span class="font-italic">The “Chem Orchid”</span> <span class="font-italic">and other appeals and another matter </span>[2016] 2 SLR 50, the Court of Appeal observed at [60] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… We underscored the fact that the process under O 14 r 12 could only be invoked if there were no factual disputes relating to the point of law in question. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 I found that there were no material factual disputes relating to the instant application, and that the question in the present case was suitable for determination. The question was simply whether the first and second defendants were agents for the purposes of the settlement agreement. It was a matter of the construction of the documents, and in particular the contracts entered into between each of the first and second defendants and the third defendant. No trial of facts was necessary to resolve that question. I was also satisfied that such a determination would determine the proceedings, or at least a substantial issue therein, as it would potentially give rise, as it eventually did, to a striking out.  The determination would therefore save time and costs, and would fulfil the underlying purpose of O 14 r 12 of the ROC.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I noted the plaintiff’s argument that the issue, properly construed, was whether the first and second defendants were independent contractors, which was an inquiry raising factual questions to be resolved. I did not accept this characterisation of the issue. Whether the first and second defendants were independent contractors was a separate question from whether they should be regarded as agents under the settlement agreement. It was irrelevant whether these defendants were independent contractors under general law: what was solely in issue was whether they fell within the term “agents” as used in the settlement agreement. Determining that issue by concluding that they were agents under the settlement agreement would avoid the need for determining whether they were independent contractors. If, on the other hand, they were not found to be agents by construction of the applicable contracts, then and only then would the question of whether they were independent contractors need to be determined, among other possible issues. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Furthermore, as rightly argued by the defendants, the plaintiff has not made anything more than a bare assertion that the first and second defendants were independent contractors. It is not enough in resisting an application under O 14 r 12 of the ROC to merely assert that factual issues would arise. Sufficient material should be placed before the Court so that an assessment can be made whether the need for evidence to be given and factual weighing is real and not merely illusory. Crucially, there is nothing in the plaintiff’s pleadings which illustrates a factual dispute that precludes the operation of O 14 r 12 of the ROC, and the plaintiff makes no averments in its pleadings as to the degree of control (or lack thereof) exercised by the third defendant over the other two defendants. Thus, even on his own case that the degree of control exerted is the central consideration in determining whether someone is an agent, the plaintiff has not raised any factual dispute in his pleadings. It is trite, as the Court of Appeal has established in <span class="font-italic">Olivine Capital Pte Ltd and another v Chia Chin Yan and another matter</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1371 at [41] and [42] in the context of an application under O 14 r 12 of the ROC, that a party is bound by his pleadings in O 14 proceedings under the ROC. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 I was therefore unpersuaded by the plaintiff’s argument, which I reiterate was raised for the first time on appeal, that the question outlined at [5] above was not suitable for determination. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The determination of the issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Turning to the determination of whether the first and second defendants were agents of the third defendant within the ambit of the settlement agreement, the defendants argued that they were. As noted above, the plaintiff argued that the defendants were independent contractors, and were thus outside the scope of the settlement agreement </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I accepted the arguments of the defendants that the first and second defendants were covered by the settlement agreement. This is illustrated by the applicable contracts between the defendants, which treated the first and second defendants as agents of the third defendant ship-owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The relevant governing agreements between the each of the first and second defendants, and the third defendant, incorporated the SHIPMAN 2009 standard terms. Under these contracts, the management services provided by the first and second defendants were governed by the SHIPMAN 2009 standard terms, and cl 3 of SHIPMAN 2009 specified that the managers carried out the services provided in respect of the vessel as agents for and behalf of the owners.

</div> All of these functions under cll 4 and 5 of SHIPMAN 2009 would have been carried out by each of the first and second defendants as agents of the third defendant under their respective contracts with the third defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As argued by the defendants, all three defendants have never disputed that position <span class="font-italic">inter se</span>. As observed in <span class="font-italic">The Law of Agency</span> (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2017) from [02.011] to [02.014], the crucial issue is whether the person purported to be an agent has the authority to affect the legal relations of his principal as a result of the mutual assent of both parties. In this regard, the distinction between employees and independent contractors is not critical. Rather, both servants and independent contractors may or may not have authority conferred on them to affect the legal relations of another. Where such authority is granted, they are agents in addition to being servants or independent contractors. Applying this reasoning to the facts, I took note of the fact that there has never been any dispute between the first and third defendants that the first defendant was acting as an agent of the third defendant. When the plaintiff first commenced proceedings against the third defendant in the 2016 suit, there was also no suggestion at all by the third defendant that it should not be liable and that the first defendant, as an independent contractor, was the proper defendant. On the contrary, the third defendant had never indicated that the first defendant was not its agent despite the plaintiff’s contract of employment having only been with the first defendant and not the third defendant.

The plaintiff argued that cl 3 of the SHIPMAN 2009 agreement entered into between each of the first and second defendants (see [26] above), and the third defendant, had to be read subject to cll 4 and 8(b).

</div> The plaintiff thus argued that the services rendered were of the defendants’ own account for compliance with these codes, and were therefore the actions of independent contractors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 I did not accept that these clauses cited by the plaintiff were sufficient to displace the construction that the settlement agreement covered the first and second defendants. The clauses in question were not such in their strength to exclude the operation of cl 3, and in any event did not account for the clear wording of cl 8(a) (see [26] above). If anything, reading the clauses together indicates that the purpose of the references to the ISM and ISPS Codes is to impose standards for the ship managers to meet. Critically, it did not follow that such references served to specify the contractual relationship between the parties. It was entirely possible for a ship manager to be responsible for complying with the ISM and ISPS Codes and to be the “company” identified as being responsible for such compliance, and still simultaneously be the ship-owner’s agent. If any reconciliation or harmonious reading was needed, for the purposes of these proceedings, the clauses governing the contractual relationship between the parties would have to be given priority over clauses merely stipulating one party’s compliance obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Again, as I have noted above, it was immaterial that the first and/or second defendants would otherwise have been independent contractors at general law. The contractual clauses effectively deem the first and second defendants as agents for the third defendant in the execution of their duties as ship managers, and this forms part of the background that has to be considered in construing the settlement agreement.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Turning to the wording of the settlement agreement, it is clear that it covered not just the third defendant, but also agents of the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 No special definition of an “agent” was used in the settlement agreement, and there is nothing in the express terms of agreement excluding the first and second defendants. The contractual agreement between the defendants was plain. The fact of the matter is that the parties did not specify in the settlement agreement any definition of who would count as an agent for the third defendant. That left open the issue, and on a plain reading of the terms, any person in an agency relationship with the third defendant would count as an agent. An agency relationship would arise through the appropriate contractual relationship with the third defendant, and in this case the SHIPMAN 2009 standard terms incorporated by the parties were unambiguous about the nature of the relationship between ship manager and owner. It was thus clear that each of the first and second defendants had been agents for the third defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37  I note for completeness that no evidence was raised as to the negotiations underpinning the settlement agreement which showed that the agreement was meant to exclude the first and second defendants. In any event, the scope for material evidence from negotiations to contour contractual interpretation is circumscribed, and requires that the evidence be relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting parties, and relate to a clear and obvious context: <span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 from [125] to [129]. Moreover, the Court of Appeal in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Xia Zhengyan v Geng Changqing</span> [2015] 3 SLR 732 at [69] expressly left open the question of whether or not there should be a principle that evidence of prior negotiations ought to be generally admissible in Singapore. Given that the plaintiff did not refer to any pre-contractual negotiations in his pleadings and arguments, it was not necessary for me to say more on this topic. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I did find that it was odd for the plaintiff to rest his position on the first and second defendants being independent contractors rather than agents; in most, if not all, cases concerning the distinction, it is the plaintiff arguing assiduously for agency, while the putative principal would deny it strenuously. The fact that the roles were inverted on the present facts underscores how the plaintiff is attempting to construe the first and second defendants as independent contractors outside the terms of the settlement agreement so as to be able to pursue them for further recovery above and beyond the resolution reached in the settlement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Whether a relationship of agency exists between two parties will be subject to the terms of any contract between the putative principal and putative agent. Where the contract between the two is clear, it is not for any third party to re-characterise that relationship between them in some other way, unless the relationship is alleged to be a sham or disguise. Any attempt to do so in the context of the present case would, however be a clear non-starter; nothing was pleaded or alleged that would have characterised the defendants’ invocation of agency as anything but <span class="font-italic">bona fides</span>. There is no allegation of there being a sham on the instant facts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40   With the settlement agreement as it was, it was simply not open to the plaintiff to argue that the first and second defendants were independent contractors and therefore not “agents” within the meaning of the settlement agreement. Similarly, it is not open to the defendants to change their position on whether or not a relationship of agency existed <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Given that this was a question of interpretation of the contractual provisions, it followed then that, contrary to the plaintiff’s position, no factual determination was required as to whether the first and second defendants were independent contractors, and nothing stood in the way of a determination under O 14 r 12. For the reasons outlined above, I determined that the first and second defendants were the third defendant’s agents within the meaning of the settlement agreement.   </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Striking out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The law on striking out</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 O 18 r 19(1) of the ROC provides that the Court can order pleadings to be struck out where they:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Disclose no reasonable cause of action or defence (O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>));</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Are scandalous, frivolous or vexatious (O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>));</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) May prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action (O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)); or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Are otherwise an abuse of process of the Court (O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The principles governing the application of O 18 r 19(1) of the ROC are reasonably well-established.

This is anchored on the judicial policy to afford a litigant the right to institute a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> claim before the courts and to prosecute it in the usual way unless the case is wholly and clearly unarguable: <span class="font-italic">Tan Eng Khiam v Ultra Realty Pte Ltd</span> [1991] 1 SLR(R) 844 at [31].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2020 </span>observe at [18/19/6] that “[t]he claim must be obviously unsustainable, the pleadings unarguably bad and it must be impossible, not just improbable, for the claim to succeed before the court will strike it out”. It also bears note that each limb of O 18 r 19(1) of the ROC provides a separate and distinct basis for the Court’s exercise of its power to strike out pleadings: <span class="font-italic">The “Bunga Melati 5”</span> [2012] 4 SLR 546 at [31].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The settlement agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 What followed from the conclusion that the first and second defendants were agents of the third defendant was that they were within the ambit of the settlement agreement, and that the plaintiff had contracted to absolve them of liability. Thus, the proceedings instituted by the plaintiff should be struck out for want of a reasonable cause of action, and for abuse of process.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As noted above, the ambit of the settlement agreement covers claims by the plaintiff against the third defendant and its agents. Specifically, it is clear that the settlement agreement covers any claims for injuries and damages arising out of the accident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As I have already found that first and second defendants were indeed covered by the settlement agreement by virtue of being the third defendant’s agents, the suit against them would be an abuse of process. The agreement was binding and intended to put to rest the very kind of proceedings which the plaintiff was pursuing in this suit. It is clear from the case of <span class="font-italic">Chua Choon Lim Robert v MN Swami and others</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 589 at [42], [45], and [50] that an action brought in breach of an undertaking to not commence litigation is liable to be struck out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC as being vexatious and an abuse of the process of Court. The very essence of entering into a full and final settlement in the context of personal injury is twofold: to secure a measure of recompense for the injury suffered, and to allow for finality for the potentially liable party. For the plaintiff to then turn around and persist in seeking to claim damages for injury he has already been compensated for would be to undermine the very basis of the settlement. The Court’s processes cannot be used to assist such undermining. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Abuse of process would thus be made out as a basis for striking out the plaintiff’s action under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC, or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the Court. These same circumstances would, to my mind, also be sufficient to constitute both the absence of a reasonable cause of action under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC, as well as being vexatious under O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Extended doctrine of res judicata</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The defendants argued that even if the first and second defendants were not found to be agents of the third defendant, the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>barred the present claim.

Res judicata is a rule of substantive law, while abuse of process is a concept which informs the exercise of the court’s procedural powers. In my view, they are distinct although overlapping legal principles with the common underlying purpose of limiting abusive and duplicative litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Court of Appeal further noted at [44] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It seems to us that the common thread linking the decisions relating to the doctrine of abuse of process is the courts’ concern with managing and preventing multiplicity of litigation so as to ensure that justice is achieved for all. … It is important to also emphasise not only the <span class="font-italic">fact-sensitive</span> nature of the inquiry that is entailed in apply the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> but also the <span class="font-italic">strict limits</span> within which such a rule will be applied … the court will exercise its discretion in such a way as to strike a balance between allowing a litigant with a genuine claim to have his day in court on the one hand and ensuring that the litigation process would not be unduly oppressive to the defendant on the other …  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The policy reasons underlying the doctrine were summarised in <span class="font-italic">Antariksa Logistics</span> at [82] as seeking to bring finality to litigation and avoid multiplicity of proceedings. This promotes the public interest of efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation, and also prevents litigants from being oppressed and unfairly harassed by legal proceedings.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In deciding whether the doctrine applies, the Court may also assess other considerations such as (i) whether there are <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not raised, (ii) how closely connected the causes of action are in terms of the required supporting facts, and (iii) whether, holistically speaking, the later proceedings are in substance nothing more than a collateral attack on the previous decision: <span class="font-italic">Antariksa Logistics</span> from [110] to [112]. Parties will generally not be allowed to reopen litigation if the matters should have been raised originally. As rightly argued by the defendants, the doctrine now extends to matters which have been settled either by consent judgment or by a settlement agreement: <span class="font-italic">Ven</span><span class="font-italic">katraman</span> as discussed at [49] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In the context of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>there is no need for strict identity of parties for the doctrine to apply, at least in respect of litigation: <span class="font-italic">Lai Sw</span><span class="font-italic">ee Lin Linda v Attorney-General </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 565 at [62] to [64]; <span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">hen Khek Koon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another and other suits</span> [2014] 1 SLR 245 (“<span class="font-italic">Then</span><span class="font-italic"> Khek Koon</span>”).

That must be so: the whole point of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> is to avoid an unnecessary and undesirable proliferation of proceedings relating to the same subject matter: see the speech of Wigram VC in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> (1843) 3 Hare 100. To hold otherwise would allow a plaintiff with a cause of action against a number of severally-liable defendants to bring successive separate actions against each defendant until he got the desired result. To permit that would lead to a multiplicity of proceedings, the possibility of inconsistent findings of fact and would fail to achieve finality in litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">That risk of a multiplicity of proceedings arising applies even where a settlement is reached. To restrict the operation of the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> to situations where parties in both suits were perfectly identical would undermine the one of the key objectives of settlement – achieving finality by putting litigation to rest.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 What matters ultimately is, as observed by George Wei J at [77] of <span class="font-italic">Antariksa Logistics</span>, whether “in all the circumstances, a party is abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it an issue which could have been raised before”. On the instant facts, I am satisfied that the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> should apply. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, the plaintiff is relying on fundamentally the same set of facts in the present action against the first and second defendants as it did in its action against the third defendant in the 2016 suit. The similarities in the statements of claim for both actions are particularly telling. The statement of claim in the present action outlines materially similar particulars of how the accident came about (from [8(a)] to [8(j)]) as the statement of claim in the 2016 suit (from [6(a)] to [6(ee)]). Even the details of the negligent breach on the part of the first and second defendants asserted in the statement of claim for the present action are entirely subsumed by the allegations of breach in the 2016 suit. For example, the plaintiff asserts in the present action that the first and second defendants “failed to ensure that the modified Turning Gear Remote Control was safe”,

</div> That loss has already been provided for by the settlement. To permit further recovery for the same loss runs a very high risk of double-recovery. Viewing the facts holistically, they strongly suggest that the current action is, in effect, little more than a collateral attack on the resolution provided for in the settlement agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Third, as noted by the defendants, the plaintiff was aware of the existence of the first and second defendants when the 2016 suit was brought, and the facts relied on were the same or substantially similar ([49] to [51] above). Even the causes of action relied on were the same. No other evidence or special circumstances arising after the settlement agreement were invoked. Given all this, there did not appear to be a <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> reason for the plaintiff not bringing any claims he had against the first and second defendants at the same time he commenced the 2016 suit against the third defendant. Further, in light of all the circumstances, including the significant involvement of personnel from the first defendant in dealing with the 2016 suit (see above at [50] and [51]), there would have been an expectation that the settlement agreement which compromised the 2016 suit covered the first and second defendants as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In sum, I am satisfied that even if the first and second defendants were not agents of the third defendant within the scope of the settlement agreement, the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>operated on the instant facts to render the plaintiff’s current suit an abuse of process. The abuse in this context causes prejudice because the parties and those expected to have benefited or been protected by the resolution of the 2016 suit would have arranged not just their affairs but also their expectations on the basis of the agreement and the bargain that was reached. Allowing one party to go outside the settlement would be to cause prejudice, as would allowing the plaintiff to bring fundamentally the same case against the first and second defendants when it had chosen not to do so earlier.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I noted for completeness that the plaintiff had argued that as the payments under the settlement agreement had been made <span class="font-italic">ex gratia</span> and with no admission as to liability, the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> would not apply. No authority was cited for this proposition. I could not agree with such a claim. What mattered was not the nature of the payment, or whether liability for such payment was in fact admitted, but rather the fact that the settlement was intended to conclude matters and preclude further proceedings. It was an abuse of process for the plaintiff to have pursued these proceedings after that agreement was reached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The ability of parties to organise and pursue their actions as they see fit is not an untrammelled or unbounded right:  there will have to be limits to ensure proper case management and efficiency, as well as to avoid prejudice. As observed by Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Goh Nellie v Goh Lian </span><span class="font-italic">Teck and others </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 at [23], citing <span class="font-italic">Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society v Seddon</span> [1999] 1 WLR 1482:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the task of the court [is] to draw the balance between the competing claims of one party to put his case before the court and of the other not to be unjustly hounded given the earlier history of the matter …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I was satisfied that the plaintiff has had ample opportunity to put his full case involving any claims against the first and second defendants before the Court, but had failed to do so. Accordingly, even if the first and second defendants were found not to be agents within the ambit of the settlement agreement, the plaintiff’s pleadings still ought to be struck out as an abuse of process, and his action dismissed.

As mentioned above, this handing-over clearly pre-dated the first defendant’s injury. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The plaintiff’s response to this, in its pleaded reply, was to assert that the “Turning Gear Remote Control was damaged during the time the 2nd Defendants were the managers of the Vessel”.

</div> No other particulars were provided beyond this bare assertion, which had not even been made in the plaintiff’s statement of claim. While I was cognizant of the high threshold required before striking out was warranted, I was not persuaded that the plaintiff’s bare assertion in this regard should suffice to render the claim against the second defendant an arguable one. It was not pleaded that the second defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff which survived the second defendant no longer being the ship manager, nor was any explanation provided as to why this particular allegation was not raised in the 2016 suit. The absence of any reasonable cause of action within the meaning of O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the ROC was thus another basis for the striking out of the plaintiff’s action <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In sum, I was of the view that the question outlined at [5] above was one which was suitable for determination under O 14 r 12 of the ROC.
