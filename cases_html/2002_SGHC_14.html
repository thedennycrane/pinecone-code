<strong>Judgment</strong>

</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">        The appellant, Abu Syeed

Chowdhury, was charged with three counts of obtaining an employment pass by making a false

statement, punishable under s 57(1)(k) read with s 57(1)(iv) of the Immigration Act (Cap

133) (‘the Act’). He consented to have two similar charges taken into

consideration for the purposes of sentencing. All five charges related to a false

declaration in his applications regarding his employment pass, which stated that he held a

Bachelor of Science degree, a statement which he knew to be false.</p>
<p align="justify">2 The appellant was sentenced by district judge See Kee Onn to four

weeks’ imprisonment on each of the three charges, with two sentences to run

consecutively. I dismissed his appeal against the sentences and enhanced them to a term of

two months’ imprisonment on each charge, with two sentences to run consecutively, for

a total of four months’ imprisonment. I now give my reasons. </p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The facts</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">3 The appellant, a 34 year old Bangladeshi national, was granted an

employment pass to work in Singapore on 17 April 1996. From 17 April 1996 to 15 April

1998, he worked as a purchasing officer in Arc Marine Pte Ltd. From 1998 to 2001, he

worked at Unimarine Shipping Services Pte Ltd (‘Unimarine’), first as a

purchasing officer, and later as a purchasing manager from 1 January 2000. </p>
<p align="justify">4 During this five year period, the appellant made five applications to

either apply for or renew his employment pass. These applications formed the subject

matter of the charges under s 57(1)(k). The offence under s 57(1)(k), read together with s

57(1)(iv), states as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">Any person who

  …by making a false statement obtains or attempts to obtain an entry or re-entry

  permit, pass or certificate for himself or for any other person … shall be guilty of

  an offence and - … shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $4,000 or to

  imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both … </p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">5 The five charges against the appellant cover the period from 1997 to

2001 and were nearly similar in content. It suffices to relate the first of the charges

proceeded with, which stated: </p>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">You … are

  charged that you applied for renewal of an Employment Pass in Form 8R, which application

  was received by the Employment Pass Department on 23.2.1999, to work for Unimarine

  Shipping Services Pte Ltd (RCB No.: 199201449N) as a Purchasing Officer, for which an

  Employment Pass was issued on 27.4.1999, on the basis of your declaration in the

  application form that you graduated from University of Dhaka with a Bachelor of Science, a

  statement which you declared to be true to the best of your knowledge, when the

  application form contained facts which you knew to be false. You have thereby committed an

  offence under Section 57(1)(k), of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) and punishable under

  Section 57(1)(iv) of the said Act.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">6 The other two charges to which the appellant pleaded guilty related

to similar applications to renew his employment pass, made on 1 March 2000 and 3 March

2001 respectively. In a similar vein, the two charges taken into consideration averred to

similar applications made on 22 February 1997 and 15 April 1998. </p>
<p align="justify">7 The common thread in these applications was the appellant’s

false declaration that he had graduated from the University of Dhaka in 1986 with a

Bachelor of Science degree. Each application was supported by a copy of a forged

graduation certificate to this effect. Verification from the University of Dhaka confirmed

however that the certificate was bogus and that the appellant was not a graduate of the

University. Nor, for that matter, did he hold the degree in question. He had in fact

purchased the forged certificate in Indonesia sometime in 1988 or 1989, for the price of

about US$100. In this manner, he had thereby induced the Employment Pass Department of the

Ministry of Manpower to issue as well as renew his employment passes annually from 1997 to

2001. </p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The mitigation plea</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">8 In mitigation, the appellant pleaded several factors which can be

succinctly stated as follows.</p>
<p align="justify">9 First, he claimed to be a victim of circumstance and poor advice. He

had apparently paid a Bangladeshi agent US$3,000 to travel to Australia for employment,

but was tricked and left stranded in Jakarta. Sometime in 1988 or 1989, he claimed to have

met a second Bangladeshi agent, who took pity on him and offered to sell him the false

degree certificate in order to obtain an employment pass in Singapore. This unnamed agent

further provided him with the air fare to fly to Singapore. </p>
<p align="justify">10 Secondly, he pleaded that he had lived as a virtuous, law-abiding

and productive resident in Singapore. He had paid all his taxes and had never given

trouble to the authorities. His employers considered him an employee of high calibre and

wrote testimonials in his favour. Notably, his present employer also stood as his bailor

for the present charges. He also pleaded that he did not cynically extract the full

benefits of his deception – for example, he did not purchase an HDB flat, nor did he

enjoy medical benefits at a subsidized rate. He also claimed to be a ‘pious and

devout resident’ who rendered both time and money to charitable organisations. </p>
<p align="justify">11 Thirdly, he asked for recognition to be given to his full

co-operation with the authorities. Upon commencement of investigations, he had admitted to

his wrongdoing and subsequently pleaded guilty in court. </p>
<p align="justify">12 Finally, he pleaded for leniency on the basis that he was married

with two young and dependent children. He claimed to have come from a well-respected

family in Bangladesh dealing in the clothing business, and submitted that a custodial

sentence would ruin his family reputation as well as his personal life. </p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The decision below</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">13 The judge in arriving at his decision considered that there was a

patent and inexplicable disparity in sentencing precedents at the district courts. Turning

to the available appellate decisions for guidance, he found the facts of <i>Rivera Eleazar

P v PP</i> (MA 308 of 1997, unreported) directly applicable to the present case and

sentenced the appellant accordingly. Significantly, he also expressed the opinion that a

custodial sentence should be the norm for an offence under s 57(1)(k), and that a fine

should only be granted under exceptional circumstances.</p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The appeal</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">14 Counsel for the appellant, Mr S K Kumar, submitted that a blanket

custodial sentence should not be applied to this particular offence. He argued that to

adopt such a ‘benchmark’ would unnecessarily fetter the discretion of the judge

under s 57(1)(iv) to impose either a fine or a custodial sentence. He further contended

that, given the various mitigation factors in this particular case, the discretion of the

court should be exercised in favour of a fine only. </p>
<p align="justify">15 At the outset, I dispensed with Mr Kumar’s concern about the

undesirability of a ‘benchmark’ tariff as opposed to absolute sentencing

discretion. This was simplistic argument which missed the point of a ‘benchmark’

tariff. A ‘benchmark’ is a sentencing norm prevailing on the mind of every

judge, ensuring consistency and therefore fairness in a criminal justice system. It is not

cast in stone, nor does it represent an abdication of the judicial prerogative to tailor

criminal sanctions to the individual offender. It instead provides the focal point against

which sentences in subsequent cases, with differing degrees of criminal culpability, can

be accurately determined. A good ‘benchmark’ decision therefore lays down

carefully the parameters of its reasoning in order to allow future judges to determine

what falls within the scope of the ‘norm’, and what exceptional situations

justify departure from it. </p>
<p align="justify">16 Having perused the authorities on s 57(1)(k), I found it unfortunate

that some of the preceding cases in the district courts were inconsistent and could not

provide a clear sentencing regime for this area of law. For example, in cases with

materially similar facts, the punishments given in the lower courts varied between fines

and custodial sentences. Moreover, although five cases have come up for consideration on

appeal, they unfortunately did not merit written decisions, and therefore lacked

prescriptive force. I was therefore grateful to the learned district judge for grasping

the nettle and bringing this issue to the forefront. The time is ripe for a robust

reassessment of the applicable sentencing principles and to set a firm benchmark for cases

of false representation punishable under s 57(1)(iv). </p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The sentencing precedents relating to s 57(1)(k) offences</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">17 In this regard, I shall first review the five Magistrate’s

Appeal cases which have come before this court. To my mind they illustrate a clear

sentencing principle which will be evident upon a comparison of their facts. </p>
<p align="justify">18 In two of the five cases, the appellate court decided that fines

were sufficient punishment. In <i>Goh Chuay Fern v PP</i> (MA 344 of 1999, unreported),

the appellant falsely declared in her application for an entry permit that she had never

been convicted in a court of law in any country. She had, however, been previously

convicted for an offence of theft-in-dwelling. She pleaded guilty to one charge under s

57(1)(k) of the Act, and on appeal successfully reduced the initial sentence of six

weeks’ imprisonment to a fine of $1,000 in default one month’s imprisonment.</p>
<p align="justify">19 In <i>Ng Kar Weng v PP</i> (MA 300 of 1997, unreported), the

appellant attempted to obtain an entry permit for his wife, a Chinese national. He had

made a false statement in the application that she had not previously been convicted in a

court of law in any country. In fact, she had been convicted and fined previously in

Singapore for working illegally while on a social visit pass. He pleaded guilty and was

sentenced to imprisonment for two months. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to a fine of

$2,500 in default two months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p align="justify">20 In the remaining three appellate decisions, the court found it fit

to impose a custodial sentence on the offenders. In <i>Li Hong Wei v PP</i> (MA 236 of

2001, unreported), the appellant, a Chinese national, had obtained a social visit pass by

falsely declaring on her disembarkation form that she had never been prohibited from

entering Singapore. In truth, she had been banned from re-entering Singapore after being

convicted for illegally overstaying in 1997. She pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to two

months’ imprisonment. On appeal, her sentence of two months’ imprisonment was

affirmed. </p>
<p align="justify">21 In <i>Kesorn Yuangtan v PP</i> (MA 250 of 1999, unreported), the

appellant, in her application to obtain an entry permit, had failed to declare that she

faced a permanent ban from entering Singapore, following her arrest in 1992 for engaging

in prostitution. Her sentence of two months’ imprisonment was affirmed on appeal. </p>
<p align="justify">22 The final appellate case was <i>Rivera Eleazar P v PP</i> (MA 308 of

1997, unreported). This case was closest on point to the present facts and therefore most

persuasive in authority. The appellant in this case was a 29 year-old Filipino national,

who had bought a forged Bachelor of Science in Commerce (Marketing) degree certificate in

1993. He subsequently tendered it in his application for an employment pass in 1996 to

work as a website engineer. In March 1997, he made the same false declaration in a second

application for an employment pass to work as a managing director in his own company. In

mitigation, he pleaded that he had married a Singaporean wife who was gainfully employed

as a senior medical representative, and that they had two young children who were

Singapore citizens. He was also the director and 25% shareholder of the company with a

paid-up capital of $100,000. He pleaded guilty to one charge and was sentenced to two

months’ imprisonment. His appeal against sentence was subsequently dismissed. </p>
<p align="justify">23 The above cases provide a valuable insight into a key sentencing

principle in offences under s57(1)(k), which is that the severity of the punishment

depends on the nature and extent of the deceit employed by the applicant. In this regard,

the act of tendering a forged certificate in <i>Rivera Eleazar </i>was the most culpable

among the above instances of deception due its active and deliberate nature. There, as in

the present case, the applicant had gone beyond making a false declaration. He had

actively procured and submitted a forged certificate for the sole purpose of corroborating

his falsehood, thereby boosting his chances of hoodwinking the authorities. Similarly, the

offenders in <i>Li Hong Wei</i> and <i>Kesorn Yuangtan </i>merited custodial sentences

because their false declarations were made in active defiance of an entrance ban by the

immigration authorities. This was unlike the offenders in <i>Goh Chuay Fern </i>and <i>Ng

Kar Weng</i>, who, although having made a false declaration on a material fact, did not do

so with the knowledge that they would be thwarting a previous adverse finding made against

them by the immigration authorities. </p>
<p align="justify">24 Admittedly, the five appellate decisions cited above have limited

prescriptive force as they do not set down a clear sentencing norm. Neither do they inform

of the relevant sentencing principles applicable to an offence as wide in scope and as

prevalent in practice as that under s 57(1)(k). It is therefore appropriate at this

juncture to consider a clear re-statement of the sentencing regime that should apply to

such cases. </p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The sentencing norm and principles for false representations under s 57</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">25 I turn first to legislative history to discern parliamentary

intention behind the promulgation of the offence under s 57. Notably, the maximum

punishment prescribed under s 57(1)(iv) was doubled by Parliament in amendments to the Act

made in 1995, when the maximum fine was increased from $2,000 to $4,000, and the maximum

term of imprisonment was increased from six months to 12 months. This was due to concern

over the increase in offences of false representation under the Immigration Act, as

represented by s 57(1)(f) to (l) and punishable under s 57(1)(iv). On 1 November 1995, the

Minister for Home Affairs had this to say in Parliament, during the second reading of the

Amendment Bill: </p>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3"><p align="justify">Mr Speaker, Sir, we

  have also taken the opportunity to enhance the penalty under section 57(1)(iv) from a

  maximum fine of $2,000 to $4,000 and from six months’ jail to one years’ jail to

  deal with the increase in the number of offences of false representations under section

  57(1)(f). The penalties for other offences listed under section 57(1)(iv) have also been

  raised to maintain parity with the new penalty under section 57(1)(f). </p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Parliament had therefore espoused its intention to take a tougher stand

against such offenders, presumably to stem the tide of illegal immigrants awash on our

shores in the wake of the regional economic downturn. It therefore behoves the judiciary

to adopt a similar mindset when enforcing the law in immigration cases. </p>
<p align="justify">26 For this reason, I intend to lay down a firm sentencing benchmark in

order to send a strong message of deterrence to immigration offenders. Where a false

representation is made under the various limbs of s 57(1) that are punishable by s

57(1)(iv), a custodial sentence should be the applicable norm, and a fine should only be

warranted under exceptional circumstances. This is because a mere fine of up to $4,000

would be insufficient deterrence when weighed against the pecuniary benefits of working in

Singapore. To some economic migrants, such a fine would merely represent a slap on the

wrist, a cynically calculated cost of breaking the law for personal profit. I do not think

that the immigration policies of a country, and the welfare of its citizen employees,

should be held ransom by such profiteers. Accordingly, custodial sentences must be imposed

to send out the firm signal that gaining entrance to Singapore by deception simply does

not pay. </p>
<p align="justify">27 A benchmark is however imperfect without clear guidance as to its

underlying sentencing principles. This guides the judge as to the length of the custodial

sentence, as well as to the existence of special circumstances which exceptionally warrant

a fine only. In this exercise, I do not find it useful to make tortuous distinctions

between individual cases. Instead, the following four considerations should prevail on the

judicial mind in applying the sentencing norm. </p>
<p align="justify">28 The first consideration should be the materiality of the false

representation on the mind of the decision-maker. The greater the impact of the falsehood

in inducing the grant of the application, the more severe should be the sentence imposed.

Conversely, a false declaration as to a fact which makes little difference to the

application might exceptionally give grounds for leniency to be granted. </p>
<p align="justify">29 The next consideration would be the nature and extent of the

deception, as discussed in the above authorities. An applicant who goes to greater lengths

to deceive the authorities, or who acts in conscious defiance of the authorities, merits

more severe punishment. Moreover, a deception which by nature is more difficult to detect,

or which, as in the present case, is aided by the production of forged corroborating

documents, should likewise deserve a heftier punishment. Offenders should not be allowed

to exploit the evidential difficulties inherent in certain types of declarations, whose

verification would otherwise take up valuable time and resources on the part of the

immigration authority. </p>
<p align="justify">30 The third factor to take into consideration should be the

consequences of the deception. In the present type of case, the court should consider

whether the employer suffered any detriment as a result of the false declaration.

Additionally, it should also consider the wider implications of the deception –

whether, for example, the offender had effectively deprived a potentially better-qualified

applicant of the job opportunity; or worse, put others at risk of adverse consequences by

performing a job without the requisite skills. </p>
<p align="justify">31 The final factor to be considered relates to the personal mitigation

factors applicable to the offender. In this regard, I would add the rider that little

weight should be accorded to those hardships which arise only as a result of the

offender’s illegal entrance to the country. Often in such cases, the offender starts

a family in Singapore, despite the knowledge of his illegal entry and the sufferings they

would face if he were caught and punished. To that extent I would consider such hardships

to be self-induced and carrying little mitigation value. He who lives on borrowed time

cannot complain when the clock runs out. </p>
<i><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The appropriate sentence</p></b></i>
<p align="justify">32 In the present case, a substantial custodial sentence is therefore

appropriate, unless there exist exceptional circumstances which justify a departure from

the norm. Applying the four sentencing considerations above, I found no reason to depart

from this norm, for the following reasons. </p>
<p align="justify">33 The first is that the deception was clearly material. Put another

way, but for the appellant’s purported educational qualifications, the Employment

Pass Department would not have granted him entry into Singapore. The next consideration I

took into account was that the deception on the part of the appellant was conscious and

deliberate. The forged certificate was obtained as early as 1988 or 1989, yet he had the

presence of mind to retain it at least until 1996 to support his false declaration. In

this light I found his account of being a victim of circumstance and of having been led

astray by an unnamed agent to be highly dubious. This deception seemed to my mind to be a

planned and conscious act, and was hardly the product of a moment of weakness. The third

consideration related to the substantive consequences of the deception. While his

employers were not prejudiced by the appellant’s lack of qualifications, the fact

remained that, by his deception, he had deprived a better-qualified candidate of entry

into the country. Finally, I did not find the personal mitigation factors in this case

exceptional enough to grant only a fine or a token custodial sentence. While his early

plea of guilt had some mitigatory effect, I was not inclined to give it much weight, for

the reason that the prosecution would have had no difficulty in proving the charge against

him, per Chan Sek Keong J in <i>Wong Kai Chuen Philip v </i>PP <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=4791&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1991] 1 MLJ 321</a>, 322-23;

see also <i>Sim Gek Yong v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=8985&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 1 SLR 537</a>. The disruption to the appellant’s

family life was likewise not a good mitigating factor, for, as mentioned above, he had

brought the plight upon his family with full knowledge of the attendant risks. Balanced

against these factors were the countervailing aggravations that the offence was motivated

purely by personal benefit, and that it had involved a five year long period of deception,

with every likelihood that the appellant would have made further false declarations had he

not been caught. </p>
<p align="justify">34 Accordingly, having considered that a substantial custodial sentence

was appropriate, I saw no reason to depart from the tariff of two months’

imprisonment set out in <i>Rivera Eleazar P v PP</i>, whose facts were materially similar

to the present appeal. I therefore enhanced the sentences to two months’ imprisonment

on each charge, with two of the sentences to run consecutively. </p>
