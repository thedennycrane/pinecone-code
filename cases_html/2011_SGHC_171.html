<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Kempinski Hotels SA (“the
                    applicant”) has made three separate applications to set aside three
                    separate awards made in arbitration proceedings between itself and PT Prima
                    International Development (“the respondent”). The applicant was
                    the claimant in the arbitration proceedings whilst the respondent was the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The present proceedings, filed by the applicant
                    on 4 July 2008, concern the third interim award dated 20 May 2008 (“the
                    Third Award”) made by the arbitrator (“the Arbitrator” or
                    “the Tribunal”) in SIAC Arbitration No 37/2002 (“the
                    Arbitration”). The next set of proceedings, Originating Summons No 121 of
                    2009 (“OS 121”), concerns the fourth interim award dated 20
                    October 2008 (“the Fourth Award”) made by the Arbitrator while the
                    final set of proceedings, Originating Summons No 766 of 2009 (“OS
                    766”), concerns the costs award dated 15 April 2009 (“the Costs
                    Award”) made by the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       To a large extent the decision that I make in
                    the present proceedings regarding whether the Third Award ought to be set aside
                    will govern the decisions to be made regarding the setting aside of the Fourth
                    Award and the Costs Award. I will therefore set out the facts in detail in this
                    judgment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties and the contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The applicant is a company registered in
                    Switzerland and its principal activities include the management and operation of
                    hotels across the world. The respondent is a corporation incorporated in
                    Indonesia. It is the owner of a hotel located in Jakarta (“the
                    Hotel”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 15 April 1994, the applicant and respondent
                    entered into an Operating and Management Contract (“the Contract”)
                    in relation to the Hotel which obliged the applicant to, <em>inter alia</em>, market, operate and manage the Hotel. The Contract
                    was governed by Indonesian law. The Contract was intended to operate for a
                    period of 20 years, with an automatic extension of a further ten years unless
                    parties agreed otherwise. In or about June 1998, the applicant took over the
                    operation and management of the Hotel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Between November 1996 and May 2000, three
                    decisions of the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism (“the Three
                    Decisions”) were issued. Essentially, they made it compulsory for the
                    Contract to be carried out by a company incorporated in Indonesia (such company
                    being hereafter sometimes called a “PMA company”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 6 November 1998, a proposal was made to the
                    applicant by Bloch &amp; Partners, its legal counsel, in response to the first
                    and second Decisions. The lawyers indicated that the formation of an Indonesian
                    company was not necessary and proposed that certain amendments should be made to
                    the Contract (“the Bloch proposal”). The Bloch proposal was
                    forwarded by the applicant to the respondent and the respondent replied that it
                    was agreeable to the same. No amendments were, however, effected nor did the
                    applicant change the entity operating the Hotel to an Indonesian
                company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Thereafter, disputes arose between the parties
                    and, by way of a letter dated 25 October 2001, the respondent purported to
                    give the applicant notice of material breach of the Contract on the part of the
                    applicant. On 7 November 2001, the applicant responded refuting the
                    allegations of the respondent. The next development was that on 6 February
                    2002, the respondent gave the applicant written notice purporting to terminate
                    the Contract. As a result, the applicant was no longer able to operate the
                    Hotel. About two months thereafter, the respondent informed the public that it
                    had entered into a management contract with another hotel group and that the
                    Hotel would be renamed. The applicant took the position that the
                    respondent’s decision to rename the Hotel, and any prevention of the
                    applicant’s management of the Hotel was a breach of the
                Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Arbitration</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The First and Second Awards</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In May 2002, the applicant commenced the
                    arbitration proceedings. Its claim in the Arbitration was essentially for
                    wrongful termination of the Contract by the respondent. In September 2002, the
                    respondent lodged its Points of Defence in the Arbitration and took the position
                    that the termination of the Contract was valid under Indonesian law. The
                    respondent also mounted a counterclaim for alleged breaches of contract by the
                    applicant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In April 2003, the respondent sought, and was
                    subsequently given leave, to amend its Points of Defence to include for the
                    first time a plea of supervening illegality as a defence to the
                    applicant’s claim. The respondent took the position by this amendment that
                    the contract had become illegal after 3 May 2000 by reason of the Three
                    Decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The respondent wanted the issue of illegality
                    tried first as a preliminary issue. In response, the Arbitrator issued
                    Procedural Order No 1 dated 8 July 2003 in which he gave the following
                    directions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In this case, the preliminary issue which the Respondent claims should be
                        tried first relates to an alleged illegality. The shaping of that issue has
                        gone through various phases in the Respondent’s pleadings. It took its
                        final shape in the amendment that was allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Illegality cannot operate in the abstract. It involves questions of mixed
                        fact and law ... Illegality is not such a preliminary issue like <em>res judicata</em>, estoppel, or an essential substantive
                        requirement of an action ... as would destroy the claim completely at the
                        outset. Illegality is akin to other contractual principles that lead to the
                        extinction or diminution of liability.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For these reasons, ... after the completion of the [applicant’s]
                        case, at a date yet to be fixed, the issue of illegality will be dealt with
                        and an order made at the end of the consideration of that issue ... Further
                        proceedings will depend on the outcome of arguments on the illegality
                        issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The respondent filed its Points of Re-Amended
                    Defence and Counterclaim on 18 August 2003. The respondent specifically pleaded
                    illegality and <em>force majeure</em> as part of its
                    defence. The applicant then filed a reply in which it maintained that the Three
                    Decisions did not have the force of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The issue of illegality was heard in two
                    tranches. The first hearing took place from 26 July to 28 July 2004.
                    Thereafter, there were two rounds of written submissions by each party. The
                    Tribunal published the First Award on 18 February 2005. By the First Award,
                    the Tribunal held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     on the facts the applicant had
                        understood the Decisions made in 1996 and 1997 as mandating the
                        incorporation of a local company for the operation of the Contract. Whilst
                        the immediate response of certain officers of the applicant was that the
                        incorporation of a local company was necessary, the later response was not
                        to incorporate such a company but to amend the Contract in such a manner as
                        to indicate the lack of necessary presence in Indonesia and to continue to
                        operate as before;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     there is a doctrine of supervening illegality in Indonesian contract
                        law and the Three Decisions constituted a valid basis for the raising of the
                        plea of supervening illegality in this case;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     the Three Decisions did not prevent the
                        performance of the Contract between the parties but only prescribed a manner
                        for the performance of the Contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     in accordance with the evidence of Mr Fred Tumbuan
                        (“Mr Tumbuan”), the respondent’s legal expert,
                        there were steps that had to be taken to comply with the Three Decisions.
                        The first was to incorporate a local company, obtain a tax registration
                        number and a PMA licence from the relevant authority and the next would be
                        to novate the Contract. Novation was necessary as the local company, being a
                        distinct entity, had now come into the picture. The applicant had not sought
                        to follow these steps. Hence, the continued performance of the Contract had
                        become impossible; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>(e)     the outcome was that the Contract remained valid though
                        incapable of performance. This solution of the civil law would permit
                        remedies to be provided to the extent of benefits that had been transferred
                        to the party who relied on the illegality. These benefits could be
                        claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 10 June 2005, the Arbitrator identified the
                    issues that remained to be settled following the publication of the First Award
                    (“the Remaining Issues”):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     given the finding [in the First
                        Award] that the Contract in dispute is valid but is not capable of
                        performance except in the manner prescribed in the Three Decisions, are any
                        claims to damages arising from the Contract still available to the
                        [applicant] under Indonesian law?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     if claims to damages are still available to the
                        [applicant], what are the bases for the computation of such damages (and
                        quantum thereof)?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     if claims to damages are not available to the [applicant], are there
                        any remedies (including to a declaration) available to the
                        [applicant]?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     if
                        no remedies are available, should the claims be dismissed and an appropriate
                        order made as to costs?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The respondent proposed that the Remaining
                    Issues be dealt with by way of written submissions. The applicant objected to
                    this proposal and instead proposed that a further hearing take place where
                    experts from each party would be cross-examined. After considering the
                    submissions of each party on this issue, the Arbitrator issued a Procedural
                    Order dated 20 September 2005 agreeing with the applicant’s proposal
                    for the Remaining Issues to be dealt with by cross-examination of each
                    party’s experts (“the 2005 Procedural Order”).
                    Cross-examination of each party’s experts duly took place from 6 to
                    8 February 2006. Further written submissions were furnished
                    subsequently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Arbitrator published the Second Award on
                    12 December 2006. Broadly, the Arbitrator held that as there were
                    alternative modes of performing the Contract that were consistent with the Three
                    Decisions, any obstacles posed by the Three Decisions to the performance of the
                    Contract by the applicant were not irresistible or absolute. In this regard, it
                    was held that, based on evidence given by the applicant’s legal expert,
                    Professor Mariam Darus (“Prof Darus”), it was still possible for
                    the applicant to carry out the Contract in compliance with the Three Decisions.
                    Arising from this possibility of lawful performance of the Contract, the
                    Arbitrator held that the possibility of damages was still available to the
                    applicant in the event that it was successful in showing that the Contract had
                    been wrongfully terminated. He said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">46.    Question One: Given the finding that the Contract
                            is valid but is not capable of performance except in the manner
                            prescribed in the Decisions, are any claims to damages arising from the
                            Contract still available to the [applicant] under Indonesian
                        law?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The answer that must be given is that there are alternative methods of
                        performance which would be consistent with the three Decisions. Given that
                        the Contract is valid, recourse to these alternative methods of performance
                        is viable. Their existence rules out <em>force
                            majeure</em>. Failure to give effect to them raises the
                        possibility of a remedy by way of damages. Thus, claims for damages arising
                        from the Contract are still available to the [applicant] under Indonesian
                        Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Third Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     According to the respondent, in about March
                    2007 it learned that the applicant had, prior to the publication of the Second
                    Award, entered into a contract (“the new management venture”) to
                    provide hotel management services in respect of another hotel which was located
                    within a one mile vicinity of the Hotel. On 28 March 2007, the
                    respondent’s solicitors wrote to the Arbitrator to seek
                    “clarifications” of the First and Second Awards in the light of
                    this information. As a result, on 10 April 2007, a conference was held to
                    decide how the Arbitration was to proceed. At this conference, the respondent
                    referred to para 9 of its letter of 28 March:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    In connection with the clarifications sought in
                            paragraphs 6 to 8 above, it has also recently come to light that the
                            [applicant] had in fact applied for, and obtained, a PMA licence from
                            the BKPM in relation to the establishment of a local company by the name
                            of PT Kempinski Indonesia. Furthermore, it has also come to light that
                            the purpose of the [applicant’s] incorporation of PT Kempinski
                            Indonesia is to provide hotel management services for a hotel by the
                            name of Hotel Indonesia Kempinski Jakarta. Hotel Indonesia Kempinski
                            Jakarta is located on the same street and within a 1 mile vicinity of
                            the [respondent’s] hotel. These are all highly material facts
                            which the [applicant] had in bad faith failed to disclose at any time
                            during the course of the Arbitration. In this regard, the [respondent]
                            now [seeks] further clarification on the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.1    Given that the [applicant has] now applied for a
                            PMA license to carry out hotel management services when [it] had
                            previously denied that [it was] under any such obligation, coupled with
                            the [applicant’s] previous submissions in support of [its]
                            contention, the [respondent seeks] clarification on whether the
                            [applicant’s] actions are in breach of [its] active duty of good
                            faith, such active duty being the bedrock and foundation of the
                            Indonesian law of contract. This is especially so bearing in mind the
                            Tribunal’s findings in the [First Award] that the [applicant] had
                            deliberately avoided incorporating a local company and obtaining a PMA
                            license to provide hotel management services to the [respondent] so as
                            to avoid having to pay tax to the Indonesian authorities
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Arbitrator then directed the applicant to
                    provide specific disclosure of the following information:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     when negotiations were commenced
                        regarding the new management venture;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     when the BKPM licence to form a PMA company was given to
                        the applicant to establish the new management venture;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     when the PMA company was formed;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether the
                        new management venture prevented novation of the Contract or performance of
                        the Contract by means of either of the two other possible ways identified in
                        the Second Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The applicant issued its response to these
                    queries on 24 May 2007. The respondent was not satisfied with this response and
                    sought specific discovery of the documents relating to these matters. On
                    11 July 2007, the Arbitrator made an order directing the applicant to
                    disclose certain information relating to the new management venture. On
                    3 September 2007, the Arbitrator ordered that the information be produced
                    by 7 September 2007 failing which the Arbitrator would ask parties to
                    address him on the adverse inferences that could be drawn from such failure and
                    the consequences of such inferences. The next day, 4 September 2007, the
                    applicant put in its response to the order for disclosure. Therein, it stated
                    that the new management venture was irrelevant to the issue of liability in
                    respect of the respondent’s termination of the Contract. In the same
                    letter, the applicant sought directions for the further conduct of the
                    Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 14 September 2007, the Arbitrator issued a
                    document entitled “SIAC Arbitration [37/2002], Directions”
                    (“the 14 September letter”). In this document, the Arbitrator
                    noted that in respect of the questions he had posed on 10 April 2007, question
                    (a) remained unanswered, the answer given to question (b) was “around
                    September 2006” but the Tribunal’s order that the applicant
                    disclose when it had made the application for the licence to form a PMA company
                    had not been satisfied. Regarding question (c), the PMA company was said to be
                    “still in formation”. In respect of question (d), the Tribunal had
                    to draw the inference that the new management venture precluded the performance
                    of the Contract between the parties in the possible ways that were identified in
                    the Second Award. The Arbitrator then made the following observations and
                    direction:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    It is to be taken that specific performance can no
                            longer be a remedy in these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The Tribunal has not asked for the production of
                            the contractual terms of the new contract. The existence of the new
                            venture is admitted. It is assumed, unless the contrary is established,
                            that the new venture is a hotel management venture and that it conflicts
                            with the performance of the Contract with the Respondent in the manner
                            consistent with Indonesian law contained in the Regulations
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The Tribunal was persuaded by the expert produced
                            by the [applicant] that the Contract still remained performable because
                            methods of performance were still open. It is evident that they are not
                            any more. The Tribunal believes that the Contract has ended through the
                            operation of law as a result of the methods of legal performance being
                            no longer possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    If there is a remedy available, it is only by way
                            of damages. The issues that remain relate to (1) whether a remedy by way
                            of damages is available and what the effect of the ending of the
                            Contract through the operation of the law on this issue is (2) if
                            damages are available, how the damages are to be calculated, having
                            regard to the fact that the Contract is no longer in existence. (3) if
                            damages are available, what counterclaims and defences still
                            remain.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    The parties must also address what adverse
                            inferences could be drawn from the failure of the [applicant] to provide
                            the information by the Tribunal relating to the questions posed on 10
                            April, 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the light of the above, the Tribunal invites the parties to address the
                        Tribunal as to the disposition of the dispute. It is not necessary to hear
                        expert evidence as the law has now been sufficiently canvassed. Parties
                        could address the Tribunal through written submissions. The submissions
                        should be made on or before 12<sup>th</sup> October
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Both sides tendered their written submissions
                    on 26 October 2007. By letter dated 14 December 2007 (“the 14 December
                    letter”), the Arbitrator informed the parties that he had reached certain
                    decisions which were being communicated to them so that further responses could
                    be made or issues identified on which hearings could be held. The Arbitrator
                    indicated that the issue then was to determine the effect of the new management
                    venture of the applicant on the conclusion that there was a possibility of the
                    performance of the Contract by the three methods that were indicated in the
                    Second Award. The Arbitrator considered these three methods and said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    As a result, a holding that the new contract
                            closes the possibility of performance in any of the three ways left
                            seems inevitable. It has not been disclosed when the negotiations for
                            the new venture began. But it is evident that on or before
                                28<sup>th</sup> April 2006, the three possibilities
                            of performance ceased. The result is arrived at on the basis of existing
                            expert evidence. The [applicant] disputes this conclusion. To do so
                            effectively, it must be demonstrated that the three ways of performance
                            are still possible, despite the new contract. If the parties agree to
                            provide further expert evidence on this question, this would be
                            heard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    The possibility of specific performance has
                            diminished to a vanishing point and need not be considered further. The
                            issue of damages, at the least for the period between 2002 and April,
                            2006 still remains... Under the circumstances the issue remains on what
                            grounds a claim for damages is maintainable. It is necessary to settle
                            this issue. Unless there is agreement on the issue that is raised in
                            para 10, this will remain the issue on which the arbitrator would wish
                            further submissions to be heard ... [such] submissions could be sent to
                            the arbitrator before 1<sup>st</sup> February,
                            2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The applicant tendered its further submissions
                    on 1 February 2008. On 17 March 2008, the Arbitrator invited parties to tender
                    further opinions from their respective legal experts on the following
                    issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    Having regard to the fact that the [applicant] has
                            entered into a new management contract in the vicinity of the hotel that
                            was the subject of the contract between the [applicant] and the
                            [respondent], is the conduct of the parties to [the] dispute after 6
                            February 2002 relevant to the issues that have been raised in this
                            Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    The opinions must have regard to the second interim
                            award and the methods of performance open to the [applicant] mentioned
                            therein as well as those discussed in the existing opinions of the
                            experts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The applicant’s expert, Prof Darus,
                    issued two opinions, the first on 25 April 2008 and the second on 7 May 2008.
                    The respondent submitted one opinion from Mr Tumbuan on 29 April 2008. On 9 May
                    2008, the Arbitrator wrote to the parties. This letter (“the May 2008
                    Letter”) is important and must therefore be quoted in full. It
                    reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    The arbitration has now reached a difficult phase
                            with the supplementary opinion put in by Professor Darus indicating a
                            possible change of positions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    As the Tribunal has pointed out previously, the
                            second interim award was based largely on the opinion which she stated
                            confirming the first award and on the evidence she gave before the
                            Tribunal. She did not query the correctness of that award but maintained
                            that the contract can be performed in one of three ways.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    The Tribunal had asked for answers to two specific
                            questions. There was a delay in the submission of the opinion of the
                            [respondent’s] expert.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The supplementary opinion was intended to rectify
                            the situation created by the late submission of the opinion of the
                            [respondent’s] expert. Instead, it seeks to change the first award
                            and has five other opinions attached. These opinions were not solicited
                            by the Tribunal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    Under the circumstances, the parties must decide
                            how to proceed with the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    In the absence of any agreement, the Tribunal will
                            make an order on the issues that have been raised as to the effect of
                            the new contract of the [applicant].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    As to the delay in the Arbitration, parties fixed
                            all time schedules by agreement. The Tribunal held proceedings when
                            parties agreed to hold them. This was a pattern that was
                            established.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    As to the 180 days in Indonesian law, Indonesian
                            law is not the procedural law that applies.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    The Tribunal has the next 60 days (with five days
                            blocked out) free. If the parties are mindful, they can make progress in
                            the arbitration during this period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On 20 May 2008, the Arbitrator published the
                    Third Award in which he held that:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the new management venture made on
                                26<sup>th</sup> April 2006 was inconsistent with the

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">as a result, the methods of performance that
                            remained open after the Three Decisions were no longer possible;

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the possibility of damages for the period between

<p class="Judg-1">The Tribunal directed the parties to file submissions on
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The respondent duly filed the relevant
                    submissions. The applicant did not do so within the specified time. Instead, on
                    4 July 2008, it filed these proceedings to set aside the Third
                Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Fourth and Fifth Awards</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On 11 July 2008, the respondent requested that
                    the Arbitrator proceed to make his final determination on the issue of damages
                    between the date of termination of the Contract and 26 April 2006. The applicant
                    then asked for an extension of time to file its submissions and these were
                    eventually filed on 18 July 2008. These submissions did not, however, contain
                    any argument on damages. On 20 October 2008, the Arbitrator issued the Fourth
                    Award and held that, on the facts, no steps were taken to make performance of
                    the Contract lawful. As such, any actual award of damages would be contrary to
                    the public policy of Indonesia and therefore an award of damages to the
                    applicant was not possible on legal grounds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     After the issue of the Fourth Award, the
                    Tribunal requested the parties to make submissions on costs. On 15 April 2009,
                    the Arbitrator issued the Costs Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Issues before the Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Although, technically, these proceedings
                    relate only to the applicant’s application to set aside the Third Award, I
                    will in this judgment for convenience and ease of dealing with and deciding on
                    the various arguments also consider the applications to set aside the Fourth
                    Award and the Costs Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On the submissions made before me in relation

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Functus Officio </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Both parties accepted that the law governing
                    the procedure and jurisdiction of the Tribunal was Singapore law. In <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 2 (LexisNexis,
                    2003 Reissue) (“<em>Halsbury’s</em>”),
                    the concept of partial <em>functus officio</em> was
                    described in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A valid award once made is final and binding and enforceable against the
                        party against whom it is made. ... The arbitrator has not power to re-visit
                        the issues decided and cannot vary, amend, correct, review, add to or revoke
                        the award. ... <em>In the case of an interim award the
                            arbitrator becomes functus in respect of issues disposed in the interim
                            award although not functus officio in relation</em> [to] <em>such matters as may remain outstanding for determination in the
                            arbitration</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     These principles are based mainly on s 19B of
                    the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the
                    Act”). The relevant sub-sections of the Act state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>19A</b>. —(1)   Unless otherwise
                        agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may make more than one award at
                        different points in time during the arbitration proceedings on different
                        aspects of the matters to be determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)   The arbitral tribunal may, in particular, make an award
                        relating to —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) an issue affecting the whole claim; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) a part only of the claim, counter-claim or cross-claim, which is
                        submitted to it for decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)   If the arbitral tribunal makes an award under this
                        section, it shall specify in its award, the issue, or claim or part of a
                        claim, which is the subject-matter of the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>19B</b>. —(1)   An award made by
                        the arbitral tribunal pursuant to an arbitration agreement is final and
                        binding on the parties and on any persons claiming through or under them and
                        may be relied upon by any of the parties by way of defence, set-off or
                        otherwise in any proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)   Except as provided in Articles 33 and 34 (4) of the Model
                        Law, upon an award being made, including an award made in accordance with
                        section 19A, the arbitral tribunal shall not vary, amend, correct, review,
                        add to or revoke the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, s 2(1) defines “award” in the following
                    terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“award” means a decision of the arbitral tribunal <em>on the substance of the dispute</em> and includes
                            <em>any interim, interlocutory or partial award
                            ..</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, a final and binding award within the meaning of s 19B
                    must be a decision “on the substance of the dispute”, and may
                    include an interim or partial award. The fact that a partial award may
                    nonetheless be final and binding within s 19B(1) is underscored by s
                19A.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Reading ss 2(1), 19A and 19B of the Act
                    together, it is clear that an award which is made in relation to only some of
                    the issues in the arbitral proceedings is nonetheless “final and
                    binding” in the s 19B sense. Once such an award is made, the arbitrator
                    then becomes <em>functus officio</em> only in relation to
                    those issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The applicant based its submission that the
                    Arbitrator was <em>functus officio</em> in relation to the
                    Third and subsequent awards by reference to the issue of supervening illegality.
                    It pointed out that the supervening illegality issue had been raised as a
                    defence eight months after the commencement of the Arbitration. The
                    respondent’s pleaded case on this issue was that the Three Decisions made
                    it illegal for the Contract to be performed after 3 May 2000. This was tried as
                    a preliminary issue and, in the First Award, the Tribunal had held that the
                    Contract was valid but incapable of performance. The First Award did not,
                    however, dispose of the supervening illegality issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The applicant submitted that parties had
                    subsequently agreed that the supervening illegality issue would be disposed of
                    if the Remaining Issues (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above)
                    were answered. In the Second Award, the Tribunal addressed the Remaining Issues
                    and held that the possibility of a claim for damages was still available to the
                    applicant. This finding, the applicant argued, disposed of the preliminary issue
                    of supervening illegality in its favour. Given the finality of the First and
                    Second Awards on this issue pursuant to s 19B of the Act, the validity of the
                    Contract and the possibility of damages arising from the respondent’s
                    alleged breach of the Contract could no longer be disputed by the
                    respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     At no time was the new management venture
                    mentioned in the respondent’s pleaded case or validly raised as an issue
                    before the Tribunal during the two tranches of hearings leading up to the First
                    and Second Awards on the supervening illegality issue. By raising the issue of
                    the new management venture for the first time in its letter of 28 March 2007,
                    the respondent was seeking to raise new matters after the Second Award had fully
                    determined the supervening illegality issue. The applicant submitted that this
                    was legally impermissible as the Tribunal was <em>functus
                        officio</em> in relation to that issue and had no jurisdiction to
                    consider the matters raised in the 28 March 2007 letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As s 2(1) of the Act makes clear, an award
                    must be “on the substance of the dispute” before it acquires the
                    qualities prescribed by s 19B. First, therefore, it is necessary to analyse the
                    First and Second Awards to determine the disputes which were resolved in
                    substance. Next, it will be necessary to analyse the Third, Fourth and Costs
                    Awards to determine whether the disputes resolved in those awards are the same
                    as the disputes resolved in the First and Second Awards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the First Award, the Tribunal held,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, that the Contract remained valid
                    but had become incapable of performance in the manner stipulated by the Contract
                    as a result of the Three Decisions. However, the Tribunal postulated that the
                    Contract could still be legally performed if appropriate steps were taken to
                    comply with the Three Decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In essence, what the Second Award decided was
                    that the Three Decisions <em>did not exclude the possibility of
                        damages</em> being awarded to the applicant because there were three
                    alternative methods of performance of the Contract. The Tribunal clearly drew a
                    distinction between, on the one hand, the <em>availability</em> of <em>future claims</em> of
                    damages, which was decided in the Second Award, and, on the other hand, the
                    applicant’s legal <em>entitlement</em> to damages,
                    which was not decided in the Second Award and which <em>could not
                        be decided</em> at that stage without proof of breach and loss.
                    Several paragraphs in the Second Award make this clear.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the Third Award, the Tribunal went on to
                    decide that the availability of a future claim of damages which remained despite
                    the Three Decisions was now extinguished by the fact that the applicant had
                    entered into the new management venture. The correctness of this decision as a
                    matter of evidence or of law is not in issue here; nor can it be. What matters
                    is that the Tribunal decided that the applicant’s potential right to
                    damages was extinguished. This decision was distinct from its earlier decision
                    that the right to damages was not extinguished <em>due to the
                        Three Decisions</em>. The Second Award cannot be read to mean that the
                    Tribunal was deciding that the right to damages would remain regardless of
                    whatever occurred after the date of the Award; all it was asked to decide was
                    whether the potential right to damages <em>still
                        remained</em> in the light of the Three Decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Fourth Award decided issues which were
                    distinct from those decided in the Second and Third Awards. There is no
                    jurisdictional conflict between the Third and Fourth Awards because the Third
                    Award did not decide whether the possibility of damages between the date of
                    termination of the Contract and the date on which the applicant entered into the
                    new management venture remained open.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Further, the issues decided in the Second
                    Award are distinct from those decided in the Fourth Award. As explained above at
                        <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>, what was decided in the Second
                    Award was that the <em>availability</em> of a <em>claim</em> to damages was not excluded by the Three
                    Decisions. The Fourth Award essentially held that the availability of a claim to
                    damages during that period was in fact excluded due to the operation of
                    Indonesian public policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The submissions that the applicant made to the
                    effect that the Second Award had fully determined the supervening illegality
                    issue and that despite the Tribunal’s findings in the First and Second
                    Awards that the Contract was valid and that damages were available to the
                    applicant, the Tribunal had gone on in the Third and Fourth Awards to reject
                    both of those findings, were an incorrect characterisation of the awards because
                    the applicant incorrectly equated the availability of a claim to damages with
                    the legal entitlement to damages (which is dependent upon proof of
                    breach).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Therefore, the matters determined in the First
                    and Second Awards were distinct from those determined in the Third and Fourth
                    Awards, and consequently the Tribunal was not <em>functus
                        officio</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     No question of jurisdiction arises in respect
                    of the Costs Award as the First and Second Awards did not deal with the issue of
                    costs at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As stated above (at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>), the applicant also relied on an alleged agreement or
                    understanding between the parties. After the First Award was made, the parties
                    agreed that the Arbitration would proceed by considering four issues which were
                    put to the Tribunal. These four issues were decided in the Second Award. The
                    applicant said that the parties had agreed that the supervening illegality issue
                    would be disposed of if those four issues were decided. In this respect, the
                    applicant referred me to two paragraphs in the Second Award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    Faced with this finding of the Tribunal [in the
                            First Award], the parties met to decide how the arbitration should
                            proceed further. <em>The parties agreed that the way to
                                dispose of the matter was to require the Tribunal to state four
                                issues to be decided..</em>. The parties agreed on four
                            issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12.    [The Tribunal listed the four issues] ...
                                <em>Parties are in agreement that the illegality
                                issue will be disposed of if these questions were answered
                                ..</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The applicant submitted that the above paragraphs indicated that the
                    Tribunal was aware of this agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     To my mind, however, there is insufficient
                    evidence of a binding agreement in the terms asserted by the applicant. It is
                    unclear whether the common, objective intention of the parties was truly that
                    the Arbitrator should proceed to determine the substantive issue of liability
                    after these four issues were decided. The matter to be disposed of could easily
                    be the issue of the effect of the Three Decisions on the Contract (and,
                    consequently, the possibility of a claim to damages), which is not the same as
                    the issue of the effect of subsequent events on the Contract. No additional
                    evidence was provided by the applicant for its contention (apart from an email
                    dated 10 June 2005 from the Tribunal, which is also inconclusive). There was, in
                    particular, no document emanating from the respondent that showed that it had
                    agreed to what the applicant argued for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Waiver</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The respondent submitted that even if the
                    Tribunal was <em>functus</em> in relation to the issues
                    decided in the Third and Fourth Awards, the applicant had waived its right to
                    object when it actively made submissions in response to the clarifications
                    sought by the respondent. As I have found that the Tribunal was not <em>functus</em>, I do not have to decide this issue. Although I
                    express no concluded view on this matter, it appears to me that if the Tribunal
                    was <em>functus</em> it would not have been possible for
                    the applicant to confer jurisdiction on it simply by participating in the
                    submissions. There would have to be an affirmative agreement between the parties
                    on the issue of jurisdiction for the same to be conferred again on the
                    Arbitrator after he had been rendered <em>functus</em>,
                    especially because this would involve reopening issues that, by definition, had
                    already been definitively decided. Also, from the beginning (in this context I
                    am referring to the 10 April 2007 conference), the applicant had put forward the
                    position that the issue of availability of future profits had been irreversibly
                    decided in the Second Award and that therefore the next step in the Arbitration
                    was to proceed with factual evidence so that a decision could be made on whether
                    the respondent had lawfully terminated the Contract. There is therefore some
                    doubt as to whether on the facts a waiver could be established.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issue Estoppel</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The argument relating to issue estoppel was a
                    variant of the argument relating to jurisdiction. The applicant submitted that
                    the respondent was barred by issue estoppel from introducing the issue of the
                    new management venture during the Arbitration and after the Second Award was
                    made. Relying on <em>Halsbury’s</em> at para 20.118,
                    it contended that issue estoppel also operates against the raising of issues
                    which were not but which ought to have been raised in earlier proceedings. It
                    also cited the judgment of Lord Denning MR in <em>Fidelitas
                        Shipping Co Ltd v V/O Exportchleb</em> [1966] 1 QB 630 at 640C-G which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But within one cause of action, there may be several issues raised which
                        are necessary for the determination of the whole case. The rule then is
                        that, once an issue has been raised and distinctly determined between the
                        parties, then, as a general rule, neither party can be allowed to fight that
                        issue all over again... [E]ach party must use reasonable diligence to bring
                        forward every point which he thinks would help him. If he omits to raise any
                        particular point, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident (which
                        would or might have decided the issue in his favour), he may find himself
                        shut out from raising that point again, at any rate in any case where the
                        self-same issue arises in the same or subsequent proceedings. But this is
                        not an inflexible rule. It can be departed from in special circumstances
                        ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Like principles apply to arbitration ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The applicant argued that the respondent was
                    barred from raising the issue of the applicant’s new management venture
                    (whether in the letter of 28 March 2007 or any time thereafter) because the
                    First and Second Awards had disposed of the issue of supervening illegality and
                    were binding on the Tribunal as well as the parties. The respondent was also
                    obliged to raise the issue of the new management venture before the Second Award
                    was made. As this was not done, the respondent was barred by issue estoppel from
                    introducing this issue through the back door via the letter of 28 March
                    2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     For the reasons that I have given in relation
                    to my rejection of the <em>functus officio</em> argument,
                    the issues decided in the First and Second Awards were distinct from those
                    decided in the Third and Fourth Awards. Even if they were not distinct, the only
                    issue in the Second Award which could possibly be the basis for the issue
                    estoppel would be a determination by the Tribunal that there was no fact which
                    could terminate the possibility of the three methods of performance. There was
                    no such determination in the Second Award as the Tribunal was only asked to
                    decide the legal availability of a future claim to damages. Therefore, no issue
                    estoppel could have arisen in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     In any event, the applicant did not put
                    forward any basis existing in the Act which would allow the Court to set aside
                    an arbitral award because the arbitrator had made a mistake in law and allowed a
                    party to belatedly raise an issue that had not, but should have, been raised
                    during earlier proceedings. The Court’s power under the Act to set aside
                    an award is a limited one and cannot be exercised on the basis that the
                    arbitrator has made a mistake of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Failure to Plead</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The applicant submitted that the respondent
                    did not plead the issue of the new management venture and that therefore this
                    did not form part of the arbitral reference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     The respondent responded that the
                    applicant’s argument on lack of jurisdiction due to inadequate pleading
                    could not stand because:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(1)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">there is no rule in arbitration that limits the
                            jurisdiction of the Tribunal to the pleadings;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(2)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the rules of pleading in arbitration are much
                            more flexible than the rules of pleading in court and do not require
                            every single relevant fact to be stated;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(3)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">in any event, under the doctrine of
                            competence-competence, the arbitrator is free to determine his own
                            jurisdiction and had the power to consider the new management venture
                            under the Third Award since he considered it to be within his
                            jurisdiction; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(4)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">in fact, if one reads the respondent’s
                            Points of Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim dated 18 August 2003 at
                            para 43C, it is wide enough to cover the Tribunal’s consideration
                            of the new management venture.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In relation to the first point, the respondent
                    said that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is determined by the scope of the
                    arbitration agreement and not by the pleadings. The arbitration agreement in
                    this case was of the widest possible construction and would cover the relevant
                    facts of the new management venture in relation to the continuing availability
                    (or otherwise) of a claim to damages. I cannot accept this argument. The purpose
                    of the arbitration agreement here, as in other cases, was to bind parties to
                    submit the disputes arising under the Contract to determination by arbitration.
                    It did not imply that parties would be free at any time during the proceedings
                    to raise material and unpleaded points without having first made an application
                    to amend their pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     It is relevant in this connection that under
                    Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law (set out in the First Schedule to the Act),
                    one of the grounds on which an arbitration award may be set aside is where the
                    matters decided by the Tribunal were beyond the scope of the submission to
                    arbitration. To determine whether matters in an award were within or outside the
                    scope of the submission to arbitration, a reference to the pleadings would
                    usually have to be made. It is therefore incorrect for the respondent to argue
                    that jurisdiction in a particular reference was not limited to the pleadings or
                    that there was no rule of pleading that requires all material facts to be stated
                    and specifically pleaded as would be required in court litigation. An arbitrator
                    must be guided by the pleadings when considering what it is that has been placed
                    before him for decision by the parties. Pleadings are an essential component of
                    a procedurally fair hearing both before a court and before a tribunal. I was
                    therefore surprised that the respondent argued that it was not required to plead
                    material facts because this dispute was being adjudicated by an
                    arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     
          <em>Singapore Arbitration
                        Legislation Annotated</em> by Merkin and Hjalmarsson (Informa, 2009)
                        (“<em>Merkin and Hjalmarsson</em>”)
                    states at p 38:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where an arbitration is conducted on the basis of Model Law, art. 23, the
                        arbitrator is bound to decide the case in accordance with the parties’
                        pleadings, and he is not entitled to go beyond the pleadings and decide on
                        points on which the parties have not given evidence and have not made
                        submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above statement was adopted from <em>Ng Chin Siau v
                        How Kim Chuan</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 789, a decision that I made in the
                    context of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Arbitration
                    Act”). The fact that it was incorporated in a text on the Model Law and
                    the Act shows that the principles enunciated in that case are accepted as
                    applying equally to international arbitration under the Act. In that case, I
                    emphasized that abiding by the rule as to the pleading of material facts was
                    essential in arbitration proceedings where the right of appeal was severely
                    limited.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It is also relevant in this case that, as the
                    applicant pointed out, the Tribunal as well as the parties proceeded on the
                    basis of the pleadings filed during the arbitration. The fact that the
                    respondent recognised that it had to plead the supervening illegality issue
                    before the same could be heard by the Tribunal as a preliminary issue, showed
                    that all persons engaged in the arbitration proceeded on the basis that the
                    Tribunal could only determine issues that had been pleaded. The Arbitrator
                    himself placed emphasis on the importance of the pleadings at para 46 of the
                    Second Award where he stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“[s]ubject to any defences <em>which arise from the
                            pleadings</em> ... the normal basis for damages [recoverable by
                        the applicant] would be loss of profits. ...” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The respondent’s third point, that under
                    the doctrine of competence-competence, the Arbitrator is free to determine his
                    own jurisdiction and had the power to consider the new management venture
                    because he considered it to be within his jurisdiction, is a non-starter. An
                    arbitrator’s ability to determine his own jurisdiction does not make all
                    such decisions as to jurisdiction final and binding. A court can still reverse
                    an affirmative decision on jurisdiction if it considers that the arbitrator was
                    mistaken on the issue. Apart from the common law principles, this power is also
                    contained in Art 16(3) of the Model Law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     That leaves the last point raised by the
                    respondent which was that its Points of Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim were
                    wide enough to cover the new management venture. It is therefore necessary to
                    consider para 43C of this pleading which the respondent relies on in this
                    regard. This paragraph reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43C    The [respondent] will also contend that by reason
                            of:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    [the First Decision]; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    [the Second Decision]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [applicant was] legally obliged to have carried out their duties under
                        the Contract after 3 May 2000 through an Indonesian (PMA) company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In breach of these Decisions, the [applicant] did not do so. Accordingly,
                        under Article 1335 of the ICC, it became illegal for the Contract to be
                        performed by the [applicant] after that date. In the circumstances, the
                        Contract became unenforceable <em>after that date</em>
                        and the [applicant] <em>are therefore not entitled to the
                            reliefs claimed</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Alternatively, the Contract had become illegal and incapable of
                        performance after 3 May 2000 and Article 1245 of the ICC applies
                        accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Article 1245 ICC</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“No compensation of costs, damages and interest takes place, if the
                        obligor is, due to force majeure or uncontrollable situation, hindered from
                        giving or doing something, which he was obliged, or has done something,
                        which he was prohibited to do.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In essence, the respondent had claimed in the
                    italicised portion of its Points of Re-amended Defence and Counterclaim, that
                    the Contract had become unenforceable and/or incapable of performance after 3
                    May 2000 because of the supervening illegality. This pleading was filed in
                    August 2003 at which point the new management venture had not been entered. It
                    was not in the contemplation of the respondent at that time, therefore, that the
                    impossibility of performing the Contract could possibly be due to conflicting
                    contractual obligations voluntarily undertaken by the applicant with a third
                    party. The respondent was saying only that the Contract could not be performed
                    because it had been rendered illegal by the Three Decisions or because of the
                        <em>force majeure</em> consequence of the Three
                    Decisions. At that time, the respondent considered the supervening illegality
                    issue to be a total answer to the applicant’s claim. It was not necessary
                    therefore to consider other points which might make it impossible for the
                    applicant to perform the Contract. The necessity of doing this only arose when
                    the Arbitrator found, based on Prof Darus’ evidence, that there were still
                    three possible ways of performing the Contract despite the Three Decisions. Para
                    43C of the Points of Re-Amended Defence and Counterclaim thus does not, was not
                    intended to, and cannot, cover the issue of the effect of the new management
                    venture on the possibility of performing the Contract. A related point,
                        <em>ie</em>, the extent to which the applicant’s
                    possible future claim to damages was restricted or adversely affected by the new
                    management venture, was also not covered by this pleading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The correct course for the respondent to have
                    taken when it found out about the new management venture in 2006 or 2007 was to
                    have applied to amend its pleading to include the allegation that the existence
                    of the new management venture was a fact which made it impossible for the
                    applicant to perform the Contract and therefore to claim damages as from the
                    date the new management venture came into existence. Such an amended pleading
                    would have allowed the applicant to amend its own pleading in order to set out
                    the possible grounds on which it could contend that the new management venture
                    would not have such an effect. The Arbitrator would then have been able to take
                    evidence on the new management venture and the impact it had on the Contract and
                    would have been able to establish the facts necessary to come to a decision as
                    to whether or not the existence of the new management venture made it impossible
                    for the applicant to perform the Contract and/or claim damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Instead of doing that, the respondent raised
                    the new management venture in its letter of 28 March 2007 in which it asked for
                    “clarifications” on the Second Award. In para 9.1 of this letter
                    which is quoted at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above, the
                    respondent asked for clarification on whether the applicant’s application
                    for a PMA licence to carry on the new management venture was in breach of its
                    active duty of good faith. In para 9.4 of the same letter, the respondent went
                    on to ask for clarification whether the applicant was entitled after its own
                    repudiation of the Contract (<em>ie</em>, by entering into
                    the new management venture) to prospectively perform the Contract by rectifying
                    its prior and existing breaches of the Three Decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In my judgment, the respondent was not truly
                    asking for clarification on the Second Award by making these queries. Instead,
                    it was raising new issues for the Tribunal’s determination. Indeed, in a
                    later written submission to the court, the respondent conceded that the wrong
                    nomenclature had been used in the 28 March 2007 letter and that these matters
                    were not matters of clarification. Under the Act, there is only a limited
                    residual power for a tribunal to correct or interpret an arbitral award after it
                    has been issued. Under Art 33 of the Model Law, a party to an arbitration may
                    ask the tribunal to correct in an award “any errors in computation, any
                    clerical or typographical errors or any errors of similar nature”. It is
                    further provided that if the parties agree, then one party may ask the tribunal
                    to interpret a specific point or part of the award. The two queries raised by
                    the respondent in the 28 March 2007 letter (at [62]) did not fall into either of these categories. The
                    Arbitrator could either have ignored the request or pointed out the error.
                    Instead, unfortunately, he took up the points and this eventually resulted in
                    the Third Award. The issues raised required proper investigation and a
                    determination of the factual matrix. That this was not done was one consequence
                    of the issues being raised as “clarifications” and not in the form
                    of an amended pleading which would have served to identify properly to the
                    applicant the case that it had to meet and reply to, and which would have
                    enabled it to put in the necessary response and evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In the result, the Third Award must be set
                    aside on the ground that failure to plead the new management venture resulted in
                    the Tribunal making a decision that was beyond the scope of the matters
                    submitted to it. I will now consider the remaining challenges to the Third Award
                    as my decision on these matters would affect the future handling of the
                    Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Breach of natural justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Under s 24(b) of the Act, the High Court is
                    empowered to set aside an award on the basis that a breach of the rules of
                    natural justice had occurred in connection with the making of the award and as a
                    result thereof the rights of any party had been prejudiced. As is well known,
                    the concept of natural justice comprises two rules. The first is that the
                    adjudicator must be disinterested and unbiased and the second is that the
                    parties must be given adequate notice and opportunity to be heard (see <em>Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 at [43] (“<em>Soh Beng
                    Tee</em>”)). In this case, the applicant alleges that breaches of
                    both rules occurred during the arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Apparent bias</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The first allegation made by the applicant is
                    that the Arbitrator was not disinterested and unbiased because he gave the
                    appearance of having a closed mind and also acted in such a way as to give rise
                    to an impression of apparent bias. In this respect, the applicant cited
                        <em>Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni</em> [2007] 1
                    SLR(R) 85 (“<em>Re Shankar”</em>) for the
                    test to establish the existence of apparent bias. In that case, Sundaresh Menon
                    JC stated (at [91]) that the test was
                    whether “there are circumstances which would give rise to a reasonable
                    suspicion or apprehension in a fair-minded reasonable person with knowledge of
                    the relevant facts that the tribunal was biased”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     The applicant also relied on <em>Turner (East Asia) Pte Ltd v Builders Federal (Hong Kong) Ltd and
                        another</em> [1988] 1 SLR(R) 483 (“<em>Turner”</em>) as being on all fours with the present case. In
                        <em>Turner</em>, an application was made under the
                    Arbitration Act to remove the arbitrator on the ground of misconduct. The main
                    complaints against the arbitrator were that he had evinced a closed mind on the
                    issue and had entered into the fray. The court held that there was a reasonable
                    likelihood of bias which warranted his removal. Chao Hick Tin JC (as he then
                    was) set out the role of an arbitrator in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">65    Parties are entitled to expect from an arbitrator
                                <em>complete impartiality and indifference
                                ..</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>..</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">78    There can be no doubt that an arbitrator must
                            always act judicially with a <em>detached mind</em>
                            and with patience. <em>He must not at any time descend
                                into the arena</em> or take an adversarial role. <em>His response and words used must always be measured and
                                circumspect</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Applicant’s emphasis]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In this case, the applicant’s complaint
                    of apparent bias was made in relation to two main issues:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Tribunal’s entry into the fray when it
                            asked the applicant for information on the new management venture and
                            requested the parties to make submissions on possible adverse
                            inferences; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the fact that the Tribunal made certain
                            conclusions on matters of Indonesian law without expert evidence on
                            those matters being adduced.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Entry into the fray</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In relation to the first issue, what the
                    applicant relied on was correspondence dated 11 July 2007 and 3 September 2007
                    from the Arbitrator to the parties. In the first letter, the Tribunal formally
                    requested that the applicant should produce information relating to the new
                    management venture. In the second letter, the Tribunal imposed a deadline of 7
                    September 2007 for the production of the information and informed the parties
                    that if the information was not produced by that date, it would ask them to
                    address it on the adverse inferences that could be drawn from such failure and
                    the consequences of such inferences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The applicant’s submission that this
                    correspondence evinced the Tribunal’s entry into the fray is not supported
                    by the facts. The Tribunal did not conduct its own investigation: the existence
                    of the new management venture was first raised by the respondent in the letter
                    of 28 March 2007 which I have referred to several times before. In that letter,
                    the respondent informed the Tribunal that the applicant had entered into this
                    new venture and requested consideration by the Arbitrator on how the actions of
                    the applicant affected the findings in the Second Award. As I have said, in my
                    view, the Arbitrator should not have dealt with this request but that does not
                    mean that in doing so the Arbitrator was entering into the fray. The
                    Arbitrator’s actions thereafter were in response to what he considered to
                    be a legitimate manner of raising a matter that was of obvious relevance to the
                    proceedings. The Arbitrator did not initiate the inquiry or take the initiative
                    in any questionable way.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     As for the direction on possible adverse
                    inferences, it was in fact a direct result of the applicant’s repeated
                    breach of the Tribunal’s order for disclosure. Examining the evidence in
                    chronological order, the respondent made a formal application for specific
                    discovery of information and documents relating to the new management venture on
                    2 July 2007. The Tribunal then made a formal request for information on 11 July
                    2007. In the formal request, the Tribunal noted that by its letter of 24 May
                    2007 the applicant admitted that it was involved in the new management venture
                    and had formed a PMA company to manage it. The Tribunal requested certain pieces
                    of information and documents from the applicant as they could have been relevant
                    to determine the continuing validity of the Contract as well as the issue of
                    damages. By the time of this request on 11 July 2007, the applicant had already
                    failed to provide the information which was requested during the conference held
                    on 10 April 2007. The Tribunal requested that the applicant should produce the
                    information by 17 August 2007 or indicate its reasons for not doing so. The
                    applicant did not meet this deadline. That failure resulted in the letter of 3
                    September 2007 imposing the new deadline of 7 September 2007 and raising the
                    possibility of an adverse inference being drawn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     In other words, the applicant repeatedly
                    failed to provide the information that was requested by the Tribunal: (a) after
                    the conference on 10 April; (b) after the 11 July letter; and (c) after the 3
                    September letter. The only information that was provided by the applicant was
                    the first page of the new management venture contract which was produced on 4
                    September 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Furthermore, the Tribunal did make allowance
                    for any reasonable justifications which the applicant could have had for its
                    failure to provide the information. In the 11 July 2007 letter, it asked the
                    applicant to provide reasons for its failure. The applicant did not do
                    so.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     I acknowledge that while the applicant did not
                    provide any information in response to the requests (apart from the first page
                    of the new contract), it had consistently protested that the new management
                    venture was irrelevant: it did so in its letters of 24 May and 4 September 2007.
                    However, no weight can be attached to these protests for the purpose of the
                    natural justice inquiry. The complaint of the Tribunal entering into the fray is
                    essentially one based on procedural fairness; it is not one of substance. The
                    relevance or otherwise of the new management venture is a matter of
                    substance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Viewed as a whole, I find it difficult to
                    conclude that there was a breach of natural justice in this regard. While it is
                    true that the Tribunal “must not at any time descend into the
                    arena” (per Chao JC in <em>Turner</em>), it is far
                    from clear that this was the case. The reason for the Tribunal’s request
                    for further information and the mention of possible adverse inferences was the
                    fact that it believed that the new management venture was relevant to the issues
                    that it had to determine. The applicant was given the opportunity to explain its
                    failure to disclose but chose not to do so. Also, even if the applicant had
                    given the requested information, that in itself would not lead to bias or
                    prejudging of the issue. The information that had been provided would merely
                    have formed part of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Looking at the course of events as a whole and
                    having considered all the correspondence that passed between the parties and the
                    Tribunal, I have concluded that a reasonable person would not, on this evidence,
                    perceive the Tribunal as having been biased.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">The Tribunal’s conclusions on matters of Indonesian
                law</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The main thrust of the applicant’s
                    contention on this issue is that the Tribunal reached certain conclusions on
                    matters of Indonesian law in two letters sent in 2007, the 14 September letter
                    and the 14 December letter, without the benefit of expert evidence. These
                    letters allegedly demonstrate apparent bias on the part of the Tribunal because
                    they indicate a closed mind on those matters of Indonesian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The statements in the two letters with which
                    the applicant takes issue can essentially be condensed into the following
                    proposition: that the new management venture removed the possibility of
                    performance of the Contract by any of the three alternative methods which
                    previously existed. By the time that the Tribunal made those statements, the
                    Tribunal had already had the benefit of two tranches of hearings and had seen
                    each party’s experts and listened to their responses to questions in
                    cross-examination. The Tribunal had also received from both parties numerous
                    submissions on the effect of Indonesian law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The applicant submitted that the important
                    point was that the Tribunal did not hear expert evidence which was tested by
                    cross-examination on the implications of the new management venture. The issue
                    of the new management venture was only raised for the first time on 28 March
                    2007, which was after the two hearings had ended. Before the issue of
                    cross-examination is considered, it will be necessary first to determine whether
                    or not there was expert evidence before the Tribunal which <em>could</em> have justified its statements in the two
                letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The following statements in <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> provide a useful guide:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">65    ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    ... An arbitrator should not base his decision(s)
                            on matters not submitted or argued before him. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    It is almost invariably the case that parties
                            propose diametrically opposite solutions to resolve a dispute... The
                            arbitrator, however, is not bound to adopt an either/or approach. He is
                            perfectly entitled to embrace a middle path (even without apprising the
                            parties of his provisional thinking or analysis) so long as it is based
                            on evidence that is before him ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In the 14 September letter, the Tribunal
                    stated that it “was persuaded by the expert produced by the [applicant]
                    that the Contract <em>still</em> remained performable
                        <em>because methods of performance were still
                        open..</em>.”. This was in fact the crucial piece of evidence
                    produced by Prof Darus during the events leading up to the Second Award. By
                    necessary implication, there was evidence before the Tribunal which <em>could</em> show that the Contract would <em>not</em> remain performable if the three methods of performance were
                    no longer open. The question then is: was there evidence which could show that
                    the new management venture had the result of closing off all three methods of
                    performance?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It is clear from the letters that, in the
                    Arbitrator’s opinion, there was such evidence. In the Second Award, which
                    is not subject to challenge by the applicant, the Tribunal discusses the three
                    methods of performance in some detail: novation at para 39-41, a tripartite
                    agreement at para 42, and Art 18 of the Contract at para 43-45. The two letters
                    in which the Tribunal expressed some views on Indonesian law were sent not more
                    than a year after the Second Award. In the 14 December letter, the Tribunal
                    specifically said that the three methods were identified after expert evidence
                    and that the experts had also indicated views on how the three methods would
                    work. In the Tribunal’s opinion this evidence dispensed with the need for
                    further expert testimony on this particular issue. If the Arbitrator was in
                    error in deciding that there was sufficient evidence before him to conclude that
                    the new venture had closed off the three alternative methods of performance,
                    that was an error of substance and not of procedure. In my view, the Arbitrator
                    did not have a closed mind since he had reached his conclusions on the basis of
                    submissions and evidence. He was also willing to consider further evidence on
                    issues arising from those decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     I must, however, record some reservations
                    about the writing of the 14 December letter. The Arbitrator was plain in his
                    expression in that letter. He stated that he had reached certain decisions on
                    the basis of the parties’ submissions and that he was stating his views so
                    that further responses could be made or issues identified on which hearings
                    could be held. The Tribunal specifically stated that the 14 December 2007 letter
                    was not an award. In my judgment, the Arbitrator fell into error in issuing this
                    letter. This holding is not made because I think that the Arbitrator displayed a
                    closed mind. It is made because the Arbitrator was making decisions which were
                    beyond the scope of the existing pleadings and without the benefit of additional
                    evidence which may have been adduced had both parties submitted proper pleadings
                    on the issue of the new management venture. In my opinion, the letter was also
                    sent out in error because the Arbitrator’s decisions on legal issues
                    should only have been made in the course of an award or in the course of
                    exercising the powers specifically given by the Act, the Model Law and the Rules
                    of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“the SIAC
                    Rules”) which governed the Arbitration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     One other point arises. The SIAC Rules provide
                    that any arbitrator may be challenged if circumstances exist that give rise to
                    justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator’s impartiality or independence (r
                    10.1). The applicant did not seek to challenge the Arbitrator’s
                    impartiality immediately after the issue of the 14 December letter. This may be
                    some indication that at the time the applicant did not consider that that
                    letter, whether taken alone or in conjunction with the 14 September letter,
                    showed a closed mind on the part of the Tribunal. The SIAC Rules also provide
                    that a challenge must be issued within 14 days after the relevant circumstances
                    become known to the challenger. It seems to me, although I do not express a
                    concluded view since this point was not argued before me, that the
                    applicant’s failure to challenge the Arbitrator’s impartiality in
                    late 2007 or early 2008 should preclude the argument that is now being made on
                    the basis of the letters.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">Cross-examination in relation to the letters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In connection with the letters, the applicant
                    also argued that procedurally the Tribunal had acted unfairly because it had not
                    allowed cross-examination of the expert witnesses prior to making the decisions
                    in the 14 December letter. It submitted that the Arbitration had always been
                    proceeded with by way of cross-examination of witnesses followed by submissions.
                    This was supported by the 2005 Procedural Order in which the Tribunal
                    specifically ordered that the Arbitration proceed by way of cross-examination of
                    expert witnesses. The following excerpt from the order is especially
                    pertinent:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Cross examination, can, of course, be dispensed with if the parties agree
                        that this is not necessary. They may dispense with the need for any oral
                        hearing as well. But, if one of the parties requires that there be
                        cross-examination of an expert witness, it is best to permit it,
                        particularly when this has been the course adopted previously in the
                        arbitration. <em>The integrity of an award may be affected,
                            if this were not done</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     When the respondent suggested
                    witness-conferencing instead of cross-examination of experts during the second
                    tranche of hearing despite the 2005 Procedural Order, the Tribunal stated that
                    “It is best that the procedure not be varied from the one used at the
                    last hearing on illegality. Parties had agreed upon that procedure after
                    discussion. Parties may vary the procedure by agreement...”. The
                    applicant relied on this letter, together with the 2005 Procedural Order, as
                    support for the legitimacy of its expectation regarding
                    cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     The applicant also cited Art 24(1) of the
                    Model Law and r 22.1 of the SIAC Rules which provide:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Art 24 Model Law:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to any contrary agreement by the parties, the arbitral tribunal
                        shall decide whether to hold oral hearings... However, unless the parties
                        have agreed that no hearings shall be held, the arbitral tribunal shall hold
                        such hearings at an appropriate stage of the proceedings, if so requested by
                        a party.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Rule 22.1 of the SIAC Rules:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Unless the parties have agreed on a documents-only arbitration, the
                        Tribunal shall, if either party so requests, hold a hearing for the
                        presentation of evidence by witnesses, including expert witnesses, or for
                        oral submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The applicant made repeated requests for
                    cross-examination of the respondent’s witnesses. Essentially, the present
                    issue is as follows: given that both parties’ experts had already been
                    cross-examined during the proceedings leading up to the Second Award, does the
                    applicant’s legitimate expectation extend to <em>further</em> cross-examination on the specific issue of the relevance
                    and effect of the new management venture?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     The difficulty for the applicant in the
                    present case is that the 2005 Procedural Order, Art 24 of the Model Law and r
                    22.1 of the SIAC Rules do not seem to be applicable directly, due to the fact
                    that cross-examination had been carried out, albeit not specifically in respect
                    of the new management venture. It seems to me that there is no reason why the
                    principle expressed in those rules should apply such that the applicant’s
                    legitimate expectation would extend to further cross-examination on a specific
                    issue that had not been pleaded. There was no point in asking for
                    cross-examination on a matter which was not in the pleadings and in respect of
                    which, therefore, the cross-examination would have been unfocussed and not
                    properly directed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     In any case, the evidence that the Tribunal
                    relied on in coming to the decisions in the letters consisted partly of
                    admissions and partly of evidence that had been taken during the two hearings
                    (and this included evidence elicited on the cross-examination of the experts).
                    It is therefore my view that the Tribunal’s refusal to allow further
                    cross-examination could not give rise to an appearance on bias on its
                    part.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Failure to allow cross-examination of witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The applicant also raised the issue of lack of
                    cross-examination in support of its contention that the Tribunal did not give it
                    an opportunity to be heard. This is distinct from its challenge on the basis of
                    apparent bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The absence of cross-examination before the 14
                    September letter and 14 December letter relates specifically to the issue of the
                    new management venture. The applicant’s complaint, however, refers also to
                    events which occurred after the two letters but before the Third Award was
                    issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     When the applicant raised its defence of
                    waiver on 3 March 2008, it submitted to the Tribunal that it would be necessary
                    to cross-examine the respondent’s witnesses regarding the Bloch proposal.
                    This request was ignored. Two weeks later, the Tribunal instead asked the
                    parties to tender expert opinions as to whether the conduct of the parties
                    (having regard to the new management venture), after the alleged wrongful
                    termination of the Contract, was relevant to the issues raised in the
                    Arbitration. In particular, it specified that the opinions “must have
                    regard to the second interim award and the methods of performance open to the
                    [applicant] mentioned therein as well as those discussed in the existing
                    opinions”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     The first opinion from each expert was
                    submitted in April 2008. The applicant’s expert submitted a supplementary
                    opinion on or about 7 May 2008. The applicant’s complaint, therefore,
                    cannot be that it was not given the chance to present its case or that it was
                    not able to respond. Its complaint in relation to the period between the two
                    letters and the Third Award is therefore similar to its complaint of apparent
                    bias in relation to the two letters: that it was not able to cross-examine the
                    respondent’s expert.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In addition to its reliance on the 2005
                    Procedural Order, the provisions of the Model Law and the SIAC Rules, and the 28
                    September 2005 letter (as discussed earlier at <a href="#p1_86">[86]</a>), the applicant also relied on para 9 of the May 2008
                    letter (at [23]). This letter provides
                    no assistance to the applicant as it does not refer to cross-examination at all,
                    whether implicitly or explicitly. In fact, it expressly states that the Tribunal
                    would issue the Third Award if the parties could not reach an agreement
                        <em>as to the progress of the arbitration;</em> there
                    was no representation that the sixty days would be left open for
                    cross-examination.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     It is my view, however, that the Tribunal
                    should have, at the least, have asked the parties whether they wished to
                    cross-examine each other’s expert on the new opinions submitted before it
                    proceeded to issue the Third Award. The 2005 Procedural Order, the
                    Tribunal’s insistence on cross-examination in the 28 September 2005
                    letter, and the vigorous cross-examination of the experts that had previously
                    taken place would have combined to create an expectation that new expert
                    evidence would not be accepted or rejected without giving the experts the
                    opportunity to defend their views on cross-examination. The respondent put in an
                    argument that, by this stage, the arbitration was akin to a documents-only
                    arbitration. I cannot accept that argument. There was a great deal of
                    correspondence (in fact, far too much), but that did not change the essential
                    nature of the Arbitration especially as the applicant kept emphasizing its
                    desire to proceed to a hearing on the facts and to cross-examine the factual
                    witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     One of the requirements for an award to be set
                    aside on the ground of breach of natural justice is that such breach must cause
                    prejudice to the rights of the party challenging the award. In this case, in one
                    sense, the breach caused prejudice to the applicant’s rights because the
                    Arbitrator in the Third Award rejected Prof Darus’ opinions in relation to
                    this issue: he considered that they conflicted with evidence that she had
                    previously given and that he had accepted. Prof Darus was not given the
                    opportunity to even attempt to reconcile the apparent conflict between her
                    previous and her current evidence. Nor was the applicant able to attempt, by
                    cross-examination, to wring any concessions from Mr Tumbuan on his conflicting
                    opinion. On the other hand, since the breach occurred in the context of an award
                    that was outside the submission to arbitration, even if cross-examination had
                    been allowed the award would still have been invalid. The parties in fact saved
                    costs by not conducting cross-examination. On balance, therefore, I hold that in
                    the circumstances the failure to invite parties to cross-examine each
                    other’s experts could not have prejudiced their rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Failure to consider defences raised by applicant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     On 1 February 2008, the applicant submitted
                    that the defence of substantial non-performance was the basis for its legitimate
                    entry into the new management venture. This defence was also put forward by Prof
                    Darus on 25 April 2008. The applicant raised the separate defence of waiver on 3
                    March 2008 based on the respondent’s apparent acceptance of the Bloch
                    proposal (made after the first two of the Three Decisions were
                issued).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The respondent’s expert, Mr Tumbuan, did
                    not deal with the defences raised by the applicant. Instead, he dealt only with
                    the effect of the new management venture on the three methods of
                    performance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    A supplementary opinion of Prof Darus was
                    sent to the Tribunal on or about 7 May 2008. It purported to clarify matters of
                    Indonesian law for the Tribunal in relation to the First Award. This
                    supplementary opinion was supported by several opinions of other legal
                    experts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    The applicant submitted before me that the
                    failure of the Tribunal to consider its submissions on the defences in itself
                    constitutes a breach of natural justice. In support of its contention, the
                    applicant relied on the recent case of <em>Front Row Investment
                        Holding (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Daimler South East Asia Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 80 (“<em>Front Row</em>”). In
                    that case, the arbitrator concluded in his award that the applicants had
                    abandoned two of the three alleged misrepresentations pleaded despite the fact
                    that reference was made to all three alleged misrepresentations in the
                    applicants’ opening and closing submissions. Andrew Ang J set aside the
                    arbitral award on the ground of a breach of natural justice. The following
                    statements were made:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">31    [A] court or
                            tribunal will be in breach of natural justice if in the course of
                            reaching its decision, it disregarded the submissions and arguments made
                            by the parties on the issues (without considering the merits thereof)
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">32    As the Court of Appeal
                            noted in <em>Soh Beng Tee ..</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Parties to arbitration have, in general, a right to be heard
                            effectively on every issue that may be relevant to the resolution of a

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">35    The failure to allow a party to address the
                            tribunal on a key issue is the corollary to allowing the submissions but
                            then ignoring it altogether whether deliberately or otherwise. In both
                            cases, the mischief is precisely the same: <em>a party is
                                denied the opportunity to address its position to the judicial
                                mind</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    In my opinion, however, the case does not
                    assist the applicant. Andrew Ang J could not have meant that each point in the
                    submissions of both parties must be expressly addressed by the tribunal in its
                    awards. Rather, what the Judge meant was that both parties should be given the
                    opportunity to <em>address the tribunal</em> and that the
                    tribunal should at least consider those submissions (rather than ignoring them
                    outright).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    At para 49 of Professor Darus’ opinion
                    of 25 April 2008, she stated that “the [applicant’s] entry into the
                    new [management] venture is ... legally irrelevant under Indonesian law
                        <em>and has no effect on the quantum of damages to be
                        awarded</em> to the [applicant]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In the Third Award, the Tribunal stated that
                        “<em>the New Management Contract ... is
                        inconsistent</em> with the obligations under the contract in dispute
                    [and] <em>as a result the methods of performance that remained
                        open</em> after the Three Decisions <em>are no longer
                        possible</em>”. It went on to state that “the
                    possibility of damages for the period between the date of the alleged
                    termination of the management contract and 26<sup>th</sup>
                    April, 2006 still remains.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    By necessary implication, the Tribunal must
                    have considered and rejected Prof Darus’ opinion because it concluded that
                    the <em>effect</em> of the new management venture was to
                    remove the possibility of damages. This is supported by the fact that the
                    Tribunal expressly refers to Prof Darus’ opinion at several points
                    throughout the Third Award, at paras 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 21. In fact, the
                    Tribunal expressly rejects Prof Darus’ supplementary opinion of 7 May 2008
                    at paras 9, 19, 20 and 21.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    As for the defence of waiver, the respondent
                    submitted that this argument had already been raised and dismissed by the
                    Tribunal in the Second Award. In the Second Award, the Tribunal stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Waiver Argument of the [applicant]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20. ... Whether or not there is a force majeure which made the performance
                        of the obligation illegal or impossible is the issue that is involved in the
                        present stage of the proceedings. The waiver argument is not helpful in
                        resolving this issue. It presupposes an illegality, which must be accepted
                        by the [applicant] or proved by the respondent. Though the waiver argument
                        was put up by the [applicant], merely raising the argument does not amount
                        to the acceptance of illegality. On the respondent’s part, the issue
                        would be whether any illegality can be established. <em>The
                            issue of waiver is, therefore, not discussed any
                        further</em>.” [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    Although the excerpt cited by the respondent
                    does not mean that the issue of waiver has been definitively determined for all
                    purposes (including for the substantive hearing in the future, if any), it is
                    quite clear that the Tribunal had already considered and dismissed the issue of
                    waiver <em>in relation to the hearing on the issue of
                        illegality</em>. The applicant’s assertion that the waiver
                    defence was not determined by the Tribunal is an inaccurate interpretation of
                    the Second Award. Therefore, the applicant’s complaint on the failure to
                    consider its submissions on waiver is baseless. In any event, the defence of
                    waiver is ultimately irrelevant to the issues decided in the Third and Fourth
                    Awards: the rights which were allegedly being waived were those of the
                    respondent, whereas the Third and Fourth Awards decided that the rights
                        <em>of the applicant</em> to a possible claim in
                    damages were extinguished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The applicant was given the opportunity to
                    make its submissions on the two defences before the Third Award was made, and
                    those submissions were considered by the Tribunal. The only avenue left to the
                    applicant in relation to this allegation is that the Tribunal did not explicitly
                    deal with the two defences in any of the Awards. In response, the respondent
                    relied on the case of <em>SEF Construction Pte Ltd v Skoy
                        Connected Pte Ltd</em> [2010] 1 SLR 733 in support of the proposition
                    that I endorsed in that case that “natural justice requires that the
                    parties should be heard; it does not require that they be given responses on all
                    submissions made”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Apart from <em>Front
                        Row</em>, the applicant also relied on the English case of <em>Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd v Schiffahrtgeselleschaft
                        “Lesum” mbH &amp; Co KG</em>, unreported,
                    5 November 1996 (“<em>Hanjin
                    Shipping</em>”). There, the applicants alleged that the arbitrators
                    failed to consider one of many submissions made based on contributory
                    negligence. Notwithstanding that the arbitrators expressly stated in their
                    reasons for the award that they had given “very careful
                    consideration” to “all” the matters put before them in the
                    course of the hearing but had not dealt with those matters found to be
                    irrelevant, Langley J held that there was at least a “real
                    possibility” that the applicants’ submissions on contributory
                    negligence had been overlooked, and set aside the award on that
                basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    
          <em>Hanjin
                        Shipping</em> does not provide any assistance to the applicant. It is
                    clear that Langley J justified his decision on the grounds of the overall
                    context of the case. This is evidenced by the following excerpt from the
                    judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... On one reading... it can be said that [the arbitrators] were intending
                        to reject all the [applicants’] submissions... However, read <em>in the context of the reasons as a whole and their
                            structure</em> and the submissions made to me I remain unsure that
                        that was the case... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the present instance, the overall context of the Second and Third
                    Awards indicates that the Tribunal did consider the applicant’s
                    submissions on the two defences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    The applicant pointed out that the
                    respondent’s expert, Mr Tumbuan, did not deal with the defences of
                    substantial non-performance and waiver in his opinion of 29 April 2008 which was
                    given after Prof Darus’ opinion on 25 April 2008. The applicant asserted
                    that “Darus’ opinion was unchallenged on the [defence of
                    substantial non-performance] point ... and the respondent also had no response
                    to the waiver argument.” By implication, the applicant suggests that it
                    would be a breach of natural justice for the Tribunal to reject the
                    applicant’s arguments without the existence of countervailing arguments by
                    the respondent. This argument is misplaced and is completely out of line with
                    the ethos of arbitration. There was no breach of natural justice in relation to
                    the way in which the Tribunal handled the two defences. In this respect,
                        <em>Soh Beng Tee</em> at [65] shows that the Tribunal was well within its powers:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is almost invariably the case that parties propose diametrically
                        opposite solutions to resolve a dispute. They may expect the arbitrator to
                        select one of these alternative approaches. <em>The
                            arbitrator, however, is not bound to adopt an either/or approach...
                            Similarly, an arbitrator is entitled – indeed, it is his
                            obligation – to come to his own conclusions or inferences from the
                            primary facts placed before him..</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Fourth and Costs Awards</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    I have held above that the Third Award must
                    be set aside. The applicant submitted that if this course was taken, then the
                    Fourth Award had also to be set aside. The respondent disagreed. It argued that
                    the Third and Fourth Awards could stand on their own even if one of them was set
                    aside. It said that the Third Award concludes that the applicant is not legally
                    entitled to damages from 26 April 2006 onwards whilst the Fourth Award concludes
                    that no award of damages can be made for the period between termination and 26
                    April 2006 because any award of damages will be contrary to public policy. The
                    awards, therefore, are not founded upon each other in such a way as to require
                    that if one is set aside, the other must be as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    I do not accept the respondent’s
                    argument. As the applicant contended, the Tribunal’s finding that an award
                    of damages would be contrary to public policy was based on his earlier finding
                    that the Contract was in violation of the Three Decisions and the opinion that
                    no effort appeared to have been made to effect the changes that would have made
                    performance lawful (at para 62 of the Fourth Award). This opinion was not based
                    on any pleaded case nor had evidence been admitted in relation to this issue.
                    The Fourth Award must therefore be set aside as well.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The Costs Award must also be set aside since
                    it relates, <em>inter alia</em>, to the costs of the two
                    awards that have been set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The effect of setting aside the awards</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The parties agreed that the effect of
                    setting aside an arbitral award is, generally, that the arbitrator is not
                        <em>functus officio</em> in respect of the issues
                    determined in that award and that the arbitration would be revived accordingly.
                    Where the parties differ is in relation to who should conduct the resumed
                    proceedings. The applicant submitted that in this case the Arbitration should
                    proceed before a freshly constituted tribunal whilst the respondent took the
                    position that the Arbitrator should continue to conduct the
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    
          <em>Merkin and
                        Hjalmarsson</em> state the following at p 118 of their text in
                    relation to the consequences of setting aside an award:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The remedy where an application is upheld is the setting aside of the
                        award. However, the court may as an alternative remit the award to the same
                        arbitrators for further consideration (art. 34(4)). If the court is of the
                        view that <em>the arbitrators are unfit to continue the
                            hearing</em>, the correct approach is the setting aside of the
                        award and the appointment of a fresh tribunal. If the court decides to remit
                        the matter to the arbitrators, it is a matter for them to decide how to
                        proceed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is no direct case authority on the point but it is sensible to
                    remit the matter back to the same arbitrator as long as he has not been
                    disqualified from hearing the proceedings for any reason.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    In this case, I have found that there was no
                    evidence of apparent bias on the part of the Tribunal. Accordingly, there is no
                    reason for me to order that the Arbitration continues before a fresh tribunal.
                    The Arbitrator is fully apprised of this complicated case and is therefore
                    eminently suited to continue to conduct the proceedings. In the continued
                    proceedings, it may be advisable that the Arbitrator not enter into or entertain
                    lengthy correspondence from the parties raising issues and points of law on
                    matters that are not the subject of any pending application before the
                    Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    For the reasons given above, this
                    application is allowed with costs.</p>
