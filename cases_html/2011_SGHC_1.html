<p class="Judg-Quote-1">on the 15th day of April 2009, at or about 1.20 p.m., at Block 133 Lorong
                        Ah Soo #02-428, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in
                        Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to
                        wit, by having in [his] possession for the purpose of trafficking, one
                        hundred and thirty-six (136) packets containing a total of 1,004.69 grams of
                        granular/powdery substance, which were analyzed and found to contain not
                        less than a total of 89.55 grams of Diamorphine, without any authorization
                        under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and [he had] thereby
                        committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2), and
                        punishable under section 33 of the said Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The facts surrounding the arrest of the accused, which were not challenged,
                    were summarised in the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>B</b>.    
              <b>FACTS OF THE CASE</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    … Acting on information received, a party of officers from
                            the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) had, on 15
                            April 2009, at or about 1.05 p.m., been involved in an operation that
                            led to the arrest of the Accused and one Lim Kee Wan at the void deck of
                            Block 129, Lorong Ah Soo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Upon his arrest, the Accused was escorted to his residence at Block
                            133 Lorong Ah Soo, #02-248 (“the Flat”). Access to
                            the Flat was gained through the use of keys which had been found on the
                            Accused upon his arrest at the void deck.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    Once in the Flat, the Accused was asked to lead the officers to his
                            bedroom (“Bedroom 3”), which he did. A search of
                            the air-conditioner in Bedroom 3 by SSgt Derek Wong Ruijun
                            (“SSgt Derek”) in the Accused’s
                            presence, revealed the existence of, <em>inter
                                alia</em>, a paper bag containing two and five packets of
                            substances believed to be heroin (<b>Exhibits
                                P134</b> and <b>P135</b> respectively)
                            and a digital weighing scale (<b>Exhibit
                            P168</b>). The Accused acknowledged, upon such recovery, that the
                            items recovered were his.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6.    Sometime thereafter, the Accused was brought into the kitchen. During
                            an ensuing search of the kitchen by ASP Teng Jit Sun Jack
                            (“ASP Jack”) in the Accused’s presence,
                            a vacuum cleaner stored in a kitchen cabinet was recovered. It was later
                            discovered that the said vacuum cleaner contained five packets <em>each</em> containing 20 smaller packets of granular
                            substance (<b>Exhibits P158</b> to <b>P162</b>), and one packet containing 19 smaller
                            packets (<b>Exhibit P163</b>) of granular
                            substance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">7.    Thereafter, SSgt Ong Teng Wei Henry (“SSgt Henry
                            Ong”) asked the Accused if he had any other drugs to
                            surrender. After considering the matter for a while, the Accused
                            motioned to the cooker hood. As SSgt Henry Ong did not know precisely
                            where the Accused had been motioning towards, he attempted to press a
                            button at the cooker hood area, at which point of time another packet
                            containing what was later ascertained to be 10 smaller packets of heroin
                                (<b>Exhibit P164</b>) fell onto the kitchen
                            stove.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    The exhibits stated above were safeguarded [by] Senior Staff Sergeant
                            Heng Chin Kok (“SSSgt Heng”) pending the arrival
                            of the investigation officer. In the interim, at or about 3.20 pm,
                            Inspector Eugene Tan Jun Hao (“Insp Eugene Tan”)
                            recorded a contemporaneous statement from the Accused (<b>Exhibit P110</b>). In the said statement, the
                            Accused was shown the seized drug exhibits and asked what they were. The
                            Accused confirmed that the seized packets of white granular substances
                            contained heroin. He also informed Insp Tan that he had <em>“roughly 137 packets of
                                heroin</em>[<em>”</em>] and
                            that they belonged to him. It would be significant to note that the
                            brown paper bag had not been taken out of the vacuum cleaner at the time
                            of such questioning.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    Once the Investigation Officer, Inspector Aaron Tang Zhixiong
                            (“Insp Aaron Tang”) arrived at the scene (at about
                            4.10 p.m), he supervised the photo-taking process. He was assisted by
                            Inspector Chee Tuck Seng (“Insp Chee”) and Senior
                            Staff Sergeant Stanley Tan (“SSSgt Stanley Tan”).
                            When they eventually left the Flat with the Accused, SSSgt Stanley Tan
                            was in possession of the seized exhibits until about 7.25 pm, when he
                            handed custody of the same to Insp Aaron Tang at the Police Cantonment
                            Complex (“PCC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    At about 8.15 pm, the Accused was brought to the PCC Exhibit
                            Management Room. The seized drug exhibits were then weighed in his
                            presence. Weighing of the drug exhibits ended at about 8.30 pm, and the
                            said exhibits were thereafter placed in a locked safe.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>C</b>.    
              <b>STATEMENTS OF THE ACCUSED</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11.    In the course of investigations, a number of statements were taken
                            from the Accused. For the purposes of these proceedings, apart from the
                            statement given to Insp Eugene Tan (considered earlier), five other
                            statements are relevant. The essence of these five statements given by
                            the Accused can be found below:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">a.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">In his cautioned statement to Insp Aaron Tang on 16 April 2009, at

                                    statement”</b>) (<b>Exhibit
                                    P126</b>), the Accused admitted, <em>inter
                                    alia</em>, that he was <em>“caught with his buyer”</em> at the
                                void deck of the Flat and that the heroin subsequently found in his
                                Flat, was his. He also stated that his girlfriend, one Chua Wei Kim
                                (who had been arrested with him), was not involved in his
                                trafficking activities;</span></p>

                                    P127</b>), the Accused intimated that he had turned to
                                    <em>“selling heroin to support
                                    myself”</em>. He also confirmed that the seven
                                packets of white granular substances found in the air-conditioner
                                (namely <b>Exhibits P134</b> and <b>P135</b>) had been placed by him in the

                                    sale</u>. He also confirmed that the weighing scale that
                                had been found in the air-conditioner had been used by him to weigh
                                the heroin. The Accused also stated that he had kept heroin in the
                                vacuum cleaner (<b>Exhibit P185</b>) because
                                he was of the view that no one used or checked the said vacuum
                                cleaner;</span></p>

                                he had placed the heroin in three different locations because they
                                served distinct functions in his supply chain: depending on

                                concealed in the vacuum cleaner being the replacement stock should

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Further, during testing carried out at the Health Sciences Authority, several
                    of the exhibits were found to contain the accused’s DNA. These
                    included, in particular, the Ziploc bag containing Exhibit P162 (<em>ie</em>, the 20 packets found in the vacuum cleaner), the
                    cooker hood grill that hid Exhibit P164 (<em>ie</em>, the
                    10 packets obtained from the cooker hood) and the paper bag which contained
                    Exhibits P77 and P78 found in the air-conditioner. During trial, Dr Christopher
                    K C Syn, a Senior Forensic Scientist with the Health Sciences Authority, also
                    confirmed that the lack of DNA on the other exhibits was not conclusive that the
                    accused had not been in contact with them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The accused elected not to give evidence. He did not call any witnesses. As
                    mentioned, no serious challenge to the Prosecution’s evidence was
                    mounted. At the close of the trial, there was hardly anything substantive by way
                    of a defence stated by counsel for the accused in his closing submissions. I was
                    given to understand that the manner in which counsel conducted the defence was
                    limited by the accused’s instructions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the charge had been made
                    out. I accordingly convicted the accused. I now give my reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The MDA provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Trafficking in controlled drugs</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>5. –</b>(1) Except as authorised by
                        this Act, it shall be an offence for a person, on his own behalf or on
                        behalf of any other person, whether or not that other person is in Singapore
                        —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    to traffic in a controlled
                        drug;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    to offer to traffic in a
                        controlled drug; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    to do or offer to do any act
                        preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled
                        drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    For the purposes of this Act, a
                        person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in
                        his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The drugs seized were analysed and found to contain not less than 85.99 grams
                    of diamorphine, which is a Class A drug. The accuracy of Ms Lim’s
                    findings was not challenged. The packets containing these drugs were found in
                    the Flat. The keys to the Flat were found on the accused’s person. The
                    accused had acknowledged that the drugs seized were his. His DNA was found on a
                    number of the exhibits seized. In fact, when he was questioned by the CNB
                    officers, he was able to direct them to the cooker hood where some of the
                    packets of drugs were hidden. He had even estimated with accuracy the number of
                    packets of drugs in the house before these were discovered, seized and counted
                    by the CNB officers. There was no question that the accused was in possession of
                    the packets of drugs seized. Pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA, the
                    presumption therefore arose that he knew the nature of the drug. In any event,
                    the accused clearly knew the nature of the controlled drug he was in possession
                    of. The accused had admitted that the packets contained heroin when questioned
                    by the CNB officers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       As the packets seized were found to contain far more than 2 grams of
                    diamorphine, the presumption under s 17(c) of the MDA would also arise
                    that the accused had the drug in his possession for the purposes of trafficking,
                    which is defined in s 2 of the same Act:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Interpretation</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>2</b>. In this Act, unless the context otherwise
                        requires —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“traffic” means —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    to sell, give, administer,
                        transport, send, deliver or distribute; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    to offer to do anything
                        mentioned in paragraph (a),</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">otherwise than under the authority of this Act, and
                        “trafficking” has a corresponding
                        meaning…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Even in the absence of the presumption, I would find that the accused was
                    trafficking in diamorphine within the meaning of s 2 of the MDA. In his
                    cautioned statement, he admitted that he had been caught at the void deck
                    together with his buyer. In his first long statement, he admitted that he had
                    turned to selling heroin to support himself. In his first and second long
                    statements he had admitted that the drugs found in the air-conditioner, cooker
                    hood and vacuum cleaner were meant for sale. He had even given a detailed
                    explanation as to how these served different functions in his drug supply chain
                    and that he had some regular customers. The diamorphine seized that formed the
                    charge was clearly meant for sale and not for the accused’s personal
                    consumption or other purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As mentioned, the defence counsel did not raise any arguments in his closing
                    submissions in relation to the merits of the charge. Nonetheless, two legal
                    issues were alluded to in the course of proceedings that, for completeness and
                    given the gravity of the charge, I ought to address.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     First, counsel for the accused made the suggestion that Insp Eugene Tan was
                    not empowered to record the contemporaneous statement taken from the accused
                    because CNB officers are not empowered to record statements. However, pursuant
                    to s 32 of the MDA, in any case relating to the commission of an
                    offence under the MDA, a CNB officer has all the powers of a police officer
                    under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)
                    (“CPC”) in relation to an investigation into a seizable
                    offence. This includes taking statements from the accused pursuant to
                    s 121 of the CPC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Second, counsel for the accused suggested during the course of cross-examining
                    Insp Aaron Tang that it was crucial that Insp Aaron Tang did not include in his
                    own conditioned statement the weights of the exhibits that he recorded in his
                    investigation diary. However, counsel did not go on to explain the significance.
                    Insp Aaron Tang’s explanation that he had not included these weights
                    because they were not as accurate as those put up in the Health Sciences
                    Authority’s report was reasonable. In any event, during
                    cross-examination, he provided the weights of the various exhibits that he had
                    recorded in his investigation diary. Counsel did not highlight any particular
                    aspect of Insp Aaron Tang’s evidence that ought to be given less
                    weight as a result of his omission.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On the evidence, I found that the Prosecution had proved the charge against
                    the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore convicted the accused and
                    sentenced him to death in accordance with s 33 of the MDA read with the
                    Second Schedule.</p>
