        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    trial judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Tang Kin Fei and
                        others v Chang Benety and others</em> [2011] 1 SLR 568
                    (“the Judgment”), where the Judge validated certain resolutions
                    passed at several inquorate directors’ meetings of a company, PPL Shipyard
                    Pte Ltd (“the Company”), under s 392 of the Companies Act
                    (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed). We allowed the appeal and now give the detailed
                    grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts </p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Company was incorporated in 1997 and is in
                    the business of designing and constructing offshore drilling rigs. According to
                    the Appellants, its business was largely built up by the efforts of first
                    Appellant, Benety Chang (“Chang”) as well as and the second
                    Appellant, Anthony Aurol (“Aurol”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Prior to 2001, the majority shareholders of the
                    Company were PPL Holdings Pte Ltd (“PPLH”), a wholly-owned
                    subsidiary of Baker Technology Ltd (“Baker”), a public listed
                    company which held 97% of the shares. The remaining 3% of the shares in the
                    Company were held by E-Interface Holdings Ltd
                    (“E-Interface”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 29 March 2001, 50% of the shares of the
                    Company were sold by PPLH to Sembcorp Marine Ltd
                (“SCM”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       On 13 November 2001, E-Interface became a
                    wholly-owned subsidiary of PPLH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In 2003, SCM increased its shareholding in the
                    Company to 85%. As the majority shareholder, SCM nominated six of the nine
                    directors of the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellants and Respondents are all directors
                    of the Company. The three Appellants were PPLH’s nominees while the six
                    Respondents were SCM’s nominees. Two of the Appellants, Chang and Aurol,
                    are also directors of PPLH.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Aurol was removed as a director of the Company
                    on 8 June 2010 on the ground that he had allegedly passed on the
                    Company’s confidential information to Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings)
                    Ltd (“Yangzijiang”), a company which subsequently took over Baker.
                    The other two Appellants, Chang and Douglas Tan, are still directors of the
                    Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       For a better picture of the dispute between the
                    parties, reference must first be made to the shareholders’ agreement
                    entered into between PPHL and SCM on 9 April 2001 (“the
                    Shareholders’ Agreement”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. It provided for the appointment of six
                    directors, with PPLH and SCM appointing three directors each. Clause 5.3 of
                    this agreement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> provided that the quorum for a
                    director’s meeting is two, <em>provided that at least one
                        director from PPLH and SCM are present</em>. Following the
                    Shareholder’s Agreement, Art 98 of the Company’s articles of
                        association<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> was amended to take into account the
                    agreed arrangement that for there to be a quorum, at least one director from
                    each side must be present at a meeting of the board of directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The arrangements in the Shareholders’
                    Agreement and articles of association regarding the quorum for a meeting of the
                    board of directors were not changed after SCM became the majority shareholder of
                    the Company by amassing 85% of the Company’s shares in 2003, although (as
                    already noted) the number of directors was increased to nine, with six appointed
                    by SCM.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The chain of events leading to the passing of
                    the resolutions in dispute began on 16 April 2010, when Yangzijiang issued
                    a binding letter of offer to Baker to acquire all its shares in PPLH for US$155m
                    (“the Offer”). A term of the Offer was that Chang and Aurol were
                    to give undertakings to Yangzijiang that they would not voluntarily resign from
                    their executive positions with the Company for a period of two years with effect
                    from 1 January 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 17 April 2010, Baker disclosed the
                    Offer to the market, and stated that the consideration for the purchase was
                    arrived at by taking into account, <em>inter alia</em>, a
                    certain net book value of the Company for the financial year 2009. Subsequently,
                    Baker accepted the offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     PPLH argued that SCM wanted to scuttle the
                    deal for the sale of its shares to Yangzijiang. SCM tendered a cheque for
                    $59,433,522 as payment for the 15% shareholding of PPLH in the Company but PPLH
                    rebuffed this attempt to purchase its stake in the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The SCM-appointed directors took steps to
                    strengthen their control of the Company. At a scheduled meeting of the board of
                    directors on 28 April 2010, which was attended by the Appellants, the
                    Respondents introduced matters not specifically stated on the agenda and
                    proceeded to appoint a new managing director to replace Douglas Tan, a new Chief
                    Financial Officer and Joint Secretaries, all of whom were nominated by SCM.
                    Despite the Appellants’ objections to these appointments, which were not
                    within the ambit of the present appeal, the appointments were approved by six
                    votes to three.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 10 May 2010, SCM lodged complaints
                    (“the SCM complaints”) with the Company that Chang and Aurol had
                    allegedly breached their duty to the Company by disclosing confidential
                    information to Yangzijiang about its book value for the financial year 2009 six
                    days before the said accounts were lodged with the Accounting and Corporate
                    Regulatory Authority. In view of these allegations, the chairman of the board of
                    directors, Tang Kin Fei (“Tang”), thought it was in the
                    Company’s best interests to deal with the allegations immediately. As a
                    result, Don Lee Fook Kang, a SCM-nominated director, e-mailed all the directors
                    on 10 May 2010 to convene a board meeting on 11 May 2010 (“the
                    11 May meeting”) for the purpose of appointing a law firm to advise
                    the Company on the SCM complaints.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Appellants did not attend the 11 May
                    meeting. Tang received a letter from Wee, Tay &amp; Lim, acting for
                    the Appellants, objecting to the meeting as inadequate notice was given and a
                    list of possible lawyers who could be appointed to advise the company was not
                    circulated before the meeting. He also received a letter from Straits Law
                    Practice, acting for PPLH, stating that Aurol had not committed any breach of
                    confidentiality, and even if there was such a breach, it was <em>de minimis.</em> The Respondents nevertheless proceeded with the
                    meeting and resolved to appoint WongPartnership to advise and act for the
                    Company in respect of the SCM complaint.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 15 May 2010, SCM commenced Suit
                    No 351 of 2010 against PPLH and E-interface (“the Suit”). In
                    the Suit, SCM sought, <em>inter alia</em>, a declaration
                    that when it became the owner of 85% of the issued and paid up capital of the
                    Company on 9 July 2003, the provisions of the shareholders’ agreement
                    and the Company’s articles of association, that were premised on an equal
                    partnership with PPLH and E-Interface, ceased to apply. SCM also alleged that
                    the sale of Baker’s shares in PPLH was a breach of an implied term that
                    neither party would, without offering its shares in the Company to the other,
                    act in a manner which would cause the other to end up being a
                    “partner” of a party owned or controlled by someone else other
                    than the parties to the shareholders’ agreement. SCM claimed various
                    reliefs, including a right to acquire the remaining shares held by PPLH and
                    E-Interface in the Company. PPLH and E-Interface counterclaimed against SCM for,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, injunctive relief against the
                    removal the Appellants as directors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Subsequently, WongPartnership, on their own
                    initiative, suggested to Wee, Tay &amp; Lim that another board meeting
                    be convened to discuss their appointment. On 27 May 2010, the Respondents
                    called for another Board meeting to be convened on 3 June 2010 (“the
                    3 June Meeting”). On 31 May 2010, the Appellants sought
                    confirmation that the meeting would be conducted in accordance with the terms of
                    the Shareholders’ Agreement and that each side’s directors would
                    therefore have three votes regardless of the number of directors present. The
                    Respondents’ solicitors replied on 1 June 2010 to the effect that
                    Art 98 of the Company’s articles of association did not restrict the
                    six SCM-nominated directors from casting more than three votes. On 2 June
                    2010, the Appellants replied that they would not attend the 3 June Meeting.
                    The Respondents proceeded with the 3 June Meeting in the Appellant’s
                    absence and passed the following resolutions:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     confirming the appointment of
                        WongPartnership to act for and advise the Company;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     instructing WongPartnership to
                        investigate the allegations raised in the 10 May letter and advise the
                        Company on its response to the allegations; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     instructing WongPartnership to provide general
                        advice relating to the Suit and the continued operations of the
                        Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Notwithstanding the resolutions passed at the
                    3 June Meeting, the Respondents thought it prudent to hold yet another
                    directors’ meeting to expressly appoint WongPartnership to represent the
                    Company in the Suit. On 10 June 2010, notice was given that yet another
                    board meeting would be held on 14 June 2010 (“the 14 June 2010
                    meeting”). Wee, Tay &amp; Lim proposed a circular board
                    resolution to limit WongPartnership’s authority in respect of the Suit but
                    the Respondents preferred to give WongPartnership wider authority in the
                    resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As there was no agreement, the Respondents
                    passed a resolution at the 14 June 2010 meeting in the Appellant’s
                    absence to empower WongPartnership to enter an appearance on behalf of the
                    Company and to accept all documents served in the Suit on the Company’s
                    behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Appellants called for a meeting of the
                    board of directors on 21 June 2010 (“the 21 June 2010
                    meeting”). The agenda included giving wider authority to WongPartnership
                    in relation to the Suit and giving the chairman or any other person nominated by
                    him the authority to give instructions to WongPartnership in relation to the
                    Suit as well as to receive advice from that law firm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 18 June 2010, Straits Law Practice,
                    acting for PPLH, sent a telefax to the Respondents’ solicitors stating
                    that they had no issue with WongPartnership advising and representing the
                    Company in the suit. They suggested that instructions to WongPartnership should
                    be on the basis of unanimous instructions, but were unable to propose a
                    resolution acceptable to all parties. The Respondents then suggested that
                    Douglas Tan, a PPLH-nominated director, be allowed to comment on or add to the
                    instructions given by the chairman or his nominee as an interim measure but this
                    suggestion was not accepted by the Appellants. The 21 June 2010 meeting
                    proceeded without the attendance of the Appellants. The resolutions set out in
                    prayer 5 of the amended application were passed at this

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It is noteworthy that there was subsequent
                    progress on the issue of WongPartnership’s appointment. On 29 June
                    2010, WongPartnership wrote to Wee, Tay &amp; Lim to propose that
                    their scope of appointment be to advise and represent the Company in relation to
                    the Suit and to do all things necessary for the conduct of the Suit (“the
                    29 June Letter”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> As an initial step,
                    WongPartnership was to advise the Company on the role and approach which it
                    should adopt in the Suit. Wee, Tay &amp; Lim confirmed that this was
                    acceptable on 1 July 2010 (“the 1 July
                    Agreement”).</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The Respondents’ position in the court

                        Appellants.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> They argued that the resolutions
                    had to be validated in order to allow WongPartnership to advise the company on
                    the SCM Complaints as well as the Suit. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Appellants’ position, on the other

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Appellants argued that lack of quorum was

                    that even if the lack of quorum was a procedural irregularity, it could not be
                    cured under s 392 as this would lead to substantial injustice.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> In particular, they contended that the
                    irregularities in question deprived them of their right to a quorum, exposed
                    Aurol and Chang to investigation, and was part of the consistent course of
                    conduct by the Respondents to scuttle the deal between Yangzijiang and Baker for
                    the acquisition by the former of all the latter’s shares in PPLH. They
                    also argued that there was no need for to proceed with the application as they
                    had already agreed to WongPartnership’s appointment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Judge held as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     The absence of a quorum was, by
                        statute, only a <em>procedural</em> irregularity. Both
                        the procedural irregularity and the substance of the resolutions must be
                        considered as part of the holistic approach mentioned in <em>The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Reliance National Asia Re Pte
                            Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 121 (“<em>Oriental Insurance</em>”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     Where there is a deadlock in the sense that no
                        quorum can be formed for a board meeting, to allow one party to push ahead
                        with its agenda in the absence of the other party wa<em>s
                            prima facie</em> a <em>substantial
                            injustice</em>. It would be for the proposing party to persuade
                        the court why the resolutions should nevertheless be
                    validated;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     Prayer 1 was in respect of a resolution passed at a board meeting
                        convened at very short notice and its substance was, in any event, covered
                        by prayer 2. As such no order on prayer 1 was
                    made;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        resolutions in prayers 2, 3(c) and (d), 4 and 5(a) were neutral and in
                        the Company’s interests as it had to be represented in the Suit. As
                        for prayer 5(b), it was practical to identify someone from whom
                        WongPartnership could receive instructions. As such, these prayers were
                        validated; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_e"></a>(e)     Prayers 3(a) and (b) were not neutral. They appeared one-sided because
                        they assumed that the proposed investigation regarding the SCM complaints
                        was truly in the Company’s best interests. However, the true motive
                        for the investigation had not been established. Hence, these prayers were
                        not validated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Appellants’ case<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> before this court was that that
                    the Respondents had breached both the Shareholders Agreement and the
                    Company’s articles of association in:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     proceeding with the meetings when no
                        director from PPLH was present (“the Quorum irregularity”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     not
                        adjourning the meetings when there was no quorum (“the Adjournment
                        irregularity”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Appellants reiterated their arguments made
                    in the court below, namely, that the Respondents’ actions, as outlined in
                    the above paragraph, involved substantive (and not merely procedural)
                    irregularities that were therefore incapable of being validated under
                    s 392, and that, even if they were procedural irregularities, substantial
                    injustice would be caused to them if the resolutions were validated. In so far
                    as the Respondents were concerned, they also relied on the same arguments
                    advanced in the court below, namely, that the irregularities in question were
                    clearly procedural and may therefore be validated pursuant to s 392, and
                    that no substantial injustice would be caused if there was such
                    validation.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Section 392(1)(<em>a</em>); also reproduced above at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>), which makes it clear that a lack of a quorum is <em>prima facie</em> at least a <em>procedural</em> irregularity (<em>cf</em> the
                    words “unless the contrary intention appears”), provides as
                    follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(<em>a</em>) the <em>absence

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The power of the Court to remedy such a
                    procedural irregularity is provided for in s 392(2) (also reproduced above
                    at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>), as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) A proceeding under this Act is not invalidated by reason of any
                        procedural irregularity unless the Court is of the opinion that the
                        irregularity has caused or may cause <em>substantial
                            injustice that cannot be remedied by any order of the Court and by order

                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Section 392 is largely based on
                    s 1322 of the Australian Corporations Act (No 50 of 2001). However,
                    the proposition that procedural irregularities will not invalidate court
                    proceedings was adopted from the law relating to insolvency proceedings and may
                    be traced back to s 179 of the Insolvency Act of 1874 (38 Vic
                    No 5) (Qld), which provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No proceeding in insolvency shall be invalidated by any formal defect or
                        by any irregularity unless the court before which an objection is made to
                        such proceeding is of opinion that substantial injustice has been caused by
                        such defect or irregularity and that such injustice cannot be remedied by
                        any order of such court</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court may if it think fit make an order declaring that any such
                        proceeding is valid notwithstanding any such defect or irregularity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The said provision was first applied in the
                    sphere of company law when s 3 of the Companies Act 1893
                    (57 Vic 3) (Qld) was enacted. The rationale for the provision, as
                    explained during the Parliamentary Debates on the bill, was as follows (see
                    Queensland, <em>Parliamentary Debates</em>, Legislative
                    Assembly, 19 July 1893, 239 (<em>per </em>Thomas
                    Joseph Byrnes)):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is every reason why such a power should be given to the court. It
                        may happen that a meeting is ordered to be held in London at twenty-one
                        days’ notice, and that by reason of some defect in the cable only
                        twenty days’ notice is given. <em>It would be an
                            unfortunate thing, knowing as we do that twenty days’ notice would
                            be ample to reach every creditor in Great Britain, that the whole of the
                            proceedings should be rendered nugatory because the order could not be
                            carried out in its entirety.</em> What we propose in this clause
                        is... to assimilate the law to what it is in insolvency and to give the
                        court power, if there is no substantial miscarriage of justice, to make an
                        order declaring that any such proceeding is valid, notwithstanding any such
                        defect or irregularity. It is hardly necessary for me to say more on the
                        subject ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Considering its history, it appears that
                    s 392 balances the twin considerations that proceedings are not invalidated
                    for minor reasons, and that procedural irregularities do not result in unjust
                    situations that cannot be remedied by the courts. Hence, once a court is
                    satisfied that an irregularity is procedural, the only question is whether it
                    results in substantial injustice that cannot be remedied by an order of
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As noted above, the Appellants argued that the
                    quorum requirement under Art 98 is an expressly negotiated right that gives
                    them an unchallengeable right to create a deadlock. Thus, the lack of quorum in
                    this instance is a substantive irregularity. They relied on this court’s
                    decision in <em>Thio </em><em>Keng
                        </em><em>Poon v Thio </em><em>Syn
                        </em><em>Pyn and others and another appeal</em>
                    [2010] 3 SLR 143 (“<em>Thio </em><em>Keng </em><em>Poon</em>”) and
                    other Australian decisions to support their argument that some irregularities,
                    while meeting the description in s 392(1), are nonetheless characterised as
                    substantive breaches.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Respondents countered that it was clear
                    from s 392(1) that a lack of quorum is, without more, a procedural
                    irregularity and there was no reason why s 392(1) should not be given its
                    plain meaning. In addition, they stated that the Adjournment irregularity is
                    covered by s 392(1)(b) and is a procedural step which deals with the
                    process of calling meetings and not the substance of the resolutions passed.
                        <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In determining whether an irregularity is
                    procedural or substantive, the following passage from the judgment of the court
                    in <em>Thio </em><em>Keng
                        </em><em>Poon</em> (at [66]) is
                    instructive:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We would be stating the obvious if we say that the question
                        of whether a particular irregularity is procedural or substantive can often
                        be a strikingly difficult issue to determine: see <em>Cordiant Communications (Australia) Pty Ltd v The Communications Group
                            Holdings Pty Ltd</em> [2005] NSWSCC 1005 (“<em>Cordiant</em>”). Palmer J in <em>Cordiant</em> enunciated the following principles in
                        addressing that question (at [102] to [104]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">What, then, is the substantive irregularity as distinct
                            from a procedural irregularity? In my view, the cases concerning the
                            distinction between a substantive law or rule and a procedural law or
                            rule provide some guidance. In <em>John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd
                                v Rogerson</em> (2000) 203 CLR 503, Gleeson CJ,
                            Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said (at 543-544):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">matters that affect the existence, extent or enforceability of the
                                rights or duties of the parties to an action are matters that, on
                                their face, appear to be concerned with issues of substance, not
                                with issues of procedure. Or to adopt the formulation put forward by
                                Mason CJ in McKain ‘rules which are directed to governing or
                                regulating the mode or conduct of court proceedings’ are
                                procedural and all other provisions or rules are to be classified as
                                substantive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In the light of this observation and of the decisions in
                                <em>Industrial Equity, ANZ Nominees,
                                Scullion</em> and <em>Link
                                Agricultural</em>, I think that the following general
                            proposition may be formulated for the purposes of the application of the
                            Corporations Act, s 1322: [the Australian equivalent of
                            s 392]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">-    what is a ‘procedural
                                irregularity’ will be ascertained by first determining what is
                                ‘the thing to be done’ which the procedure is to
                                regulate;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">-    if there is an irregularity which changes
                                the substance of ‘the thing to be done’, the
                                irregularity will be substantive;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-3">-    if the irregularity merely departs from
                                the prescribed manner in which the thing is to be done without
                                changing the substance of the thing, the irregularity is
                                procedural.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The application of such a proposition in any particular case will
                            depend upon the starting point, <em>ie</em>,
                            defining ‘the thing to be done’. Different answers to the
                            question will be found depending on how broadly or narrowly one defines
                            ‘the thing to be done’.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Reference may also be made, in this regard, to
                    R P Austin &amp; I M Ramsay, <em>Ford’s Principles of Corporations Law</em>
                    (LexisNexis/Butterworths, Australia, 14th Ed, 2010) at

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In <em>Thio
                        </em><em>Keng </em><em>Poon</em>, where an attempt was made to remove a director, the
                    irregularity concerned a failure by the other directors to first request the
                    director in question to vacate his directorship before passing a resolution to
                    remove him as director. This was a breach of Art 88(c) of the
                    company’s articles of association. The court held that this was a
                    substantive breach, which was not an irregularity of the same genre as that
                    contemplated in s 392(1) because it involved a breach of a specific
                    requirement in the articles of association, which clearly specified the
                    procedure for removing a director<em>.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The irregularity in <em>Thio
                        </em><em>Keng </em><em>Poon</em> must be viewed in the context of an irregularity regarding
                    an attempt to remove a director. This court stated that the failure to serve a
                    notice to resign upon that director, as required by the company’s articles
                    of association, was certainly not of the same genre as the irregularities listed
                    in s 392(1). In contrast, in relation to a lack of quorum <em>per se</em>, the Singapore courts have largely, in view of
                        s 392(1)(<em>a</em>) (reproduced above at
                        <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> and <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>)), regarded this as a procedural irregularity (see, for
                    example, <em>Sum Hong Kum v Li Pin Furniture Industries Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 529 (“<em>Sum
                        Hong Kum</em>”) at [35], and <em>Kwa Ban Cheong v Kuan Boon Sek and
                        others</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 644 at [22]). This is consistent with the approach in
                    Australia (see, for example, <em>Re Pembury Pty
                        Ltd</em> (1991) 4 ACSR 759 at 761 and <em>Whitehouse v Capital Radio Network Pty Ltd</em> [2004] TASSC 12 at
                        [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     It follows that the Appellants’
                    contention that the lack of quorum in the present case must be a <em>substantive</em> irregularity merely because the parties had
                    expressly negotiated for a deadlock right cannot be accepted. In <em>Sum Hong Kum</em>, where deadlock rights were also involved
                    in the context of an inquorate meeting, Warren Khoo J
                    (“Khoo J”) correctly found that in view of s 392(1), the
                    lack of a quorum was without more, a procedural irregularity. We respectfully
                    agree with Khoo J and are of the view that the lack of a quorum in the
                    present case is a procedural irregularity. Consequently, the Adjournment
                    irregularity, which arises from the Quorum irregularity, is also procedural.
                    However, this does not mean that the Appellants’ contention was wholly
                    without merit when viewed from the perspective of substance (as opposed merely
                    to form) inasmuch as the court will <em>not</em> validate a
                        <em>procedural</em> irregularity if to do so would be
                    – or is likely - to cause <em>substantial injustice</em> to any person (see s 392(6)(<em>c</em>) reproduced above at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>). Put simply, such an approach would achieve, in <em>substance</em>, the <em>same</em> result
                    which the Appellants had sought in any event provided that they could
                    demonstrate that substantial injustice had indeed been suffered by them. And
                    that is an issue to which our attention now turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Substantial injustice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As just mentioned, as the Quorum and
                    Adjournment irregularities involve procedural irregularities, a question arises
                    as to whether the Judge erred in exercising his power under s 392(2) to
                    validate the resolutions. This turns on whether the Appellants would suffer
                    substantial injustice if the resolutions are validated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     As for what constitutes substantial injustice,
                    this court explained in <em>Thio </em><em>Keng </em><em>Poon</em> as follows at
                    [75]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The meaning of substantial injustice has been discussed by the courts in
                        various jurisdictions on numerous occasions, and in this regard, the
                        following principles can be distilled. First, it is axiomatic that there
                        must be a direct link between the procedural irregularity in question and
                        the injustice suffered (see <em>Golden Harvest</em>
                        ([55] <em>supra</em>) at 955-956, <em>Mamouney v Soliman</em> (1992) 9 ASCR 63 at 71
                            (“<em>Mamouney</em>”)). Secondly, the
                        injustice must be of a “substantial” nature. In essence, what
                        this means is that the injustice must be real, rather than theoretical or
                        fanciful (see <em>Bell Resources Ltd v Turnbridge Pty Ltd
                            (No 2)</em> (1988) 13 ACLR 762 at 766). There must,
                        therefore, be some basis or indication on the face of the evidence before
                        the court that the aggrieved party had suffered injustice or would suffer
                        injustice as a result of the procedural irregularity occurring. <em>Thirdly, the aggrieved party must show that there may or could
                            have been a different result, if not for the occurrence of the
                            procedural irregularity</em> (see <em>Mamouney</em> at 71 where Hodgson J made a general reference
                        to the cases of <em>Re Pembury</em> ([55] <em>supra</em>) and <em>Poliwka v Heven
                            Holdings Pty Ltd</em> (1992) 7 ACSR 85). This is a
                        fundamentally important point. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In addition, in <em>Golden
                        Harvest Films Distribution (Pte) Ltd v Golden Village Multiplex Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 940, this court held at [54] that that the determination of
                    substantial injustice under s 392 involved <em>“a
                        holistic weighing and balancing</em> of the <em>various
                        interests</em> of <em>all</em> the relevant
                        parties<em>”</em> [emphasis added]<em>.</em> This holding was endorsed in <em>Oriental Insurance</em> at [106].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In <em>Re Goodwealth</em> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 691
                (“<em>Re Goodwealth Trading Pte Ltd</em>”), a minority
                    shareholder petitioned to wind up the company. In response, the majority
                    shareholder sought to hold a board meeting to appoint solicitors to represent
                    the company in order to strike out the petition. The minority shareholder and
                    director employed the defensive tactic of not attending the board meeting, which
                    resulted in a deadlock. This court held the lack of quorum caused substantial
                    injustice as it resulted in disputed decisions, namely the appointment of
                    solicitors to represent the company, being taken by one of only two shareholder
                    groups in a company to the exclusion and possible disadvantage of the other
                    shareholder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     It bears noting that the quorum requirement in
                    the present case was not merely an ordinary one specifying a minimum <em>number</em> as such but also one which related, in fact, to
                    the issue of <em>representation</em> on the board of
                    directors. This requirement was to ensure that parties would have their
                    interests represented at board meetings and could thus prevent the Company from
                    making any decision which would prejudice them. The importance of this
                    requirement is evident as it was not only provided for in the articles of
                    association but enshrined in the Shareholders’ Agreement as well. In our
                    view, where such a quorum requirement is breached, there will <em>prima facie</em> be substantial injustice to the side which exercised
                    its deadlock rights.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Undoubtedly, the nature of the resolutions
                    passed at the board meeting must be considered as well. If innocuous resolutions
                    affecting no party’s rights are passed, it is most unlikely that any party
                    would apply to the court to invalidate them. As Margaret Chew aptly observed,
                    “[i]n most cases ... where an applicant has sought to impugn an
                    irregularity, the irregularity and the proceedings initiated to invalidate it
                    ... <em>are likely to be symptoms of a greater struggle between
                        shareholding factions, oftentimes between the minority and the
                        majority</em>” (see Margaret Chew, <em>Minority
                        Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</em> (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed,
                    2007) at p 14) [emphasis added]. Indeed, in the present case, the deadlock
                    rights were relied on by the Appellants to ensure that resolutions, which
                    advanced the Respondents’ complaints against some of the Appellants, were
                    not passed by the board. The resolutions passed by the Respondents in the
                    absence of the Appellants purported to appoint WongPartnership not only to
                    represent and advise the Company in the Suit, but also to investigate the SCM
                    complaints (see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> prayers 3(a) and
                    (b)). The Judge rightly found that the resolutions relating to the investigation
                    of the SCM complaints were one-sided as they assumed that the proposed
                    investigation regarding the SCM complaints was in the Company’s best
                    interests. By instructing WongPartnership to investigate the SCM complaints, the
                    Respondents placed the Appellants, who were the subject of the allegations, in a
                    disadvantageous position. Clearly, the Respondents were attempting thereby to
                    gain a tactical advantage over the Appellants in the Suit. Although the
                    resolutions relating to the SCM Complaints were not validated by the Judge, they
                    shed light on the Respondents’ intention to make use of the inquorate
                    meetings to pass resolutions to the possible disadvantage of the Appellants.
                    Following <em>Re Goodwealth</em>, it is evident that
                    this cannot be permitted if the resolutions that are the subject of this appeal,
                    whilst seemingly innocuous on their face, still relate to the tactical advantage
                    just mentioned. This is a point to which we now turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Whether the validation of the said resolutions
                    will cause substantial injustice must be seen in the context of the 29 June
                    Letter. The Appellants had set out their position on the appointment of
                    WongPartnership as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">1.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We refer to the
                            recent correspondence on this matter. We propose that the scope of our
                            appointment be as follows:</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">a.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">to advise and represent the Company in relation
                                to [the Suit] including the filing of pleadings and affidavits,
                                discovery, attendance at court hearings, and to do all other things
                                necessary for the conduct of the Suit on behalf of the Company;
                                and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-No">b.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-2-Item">as an initial step, to provide advice to the
                                Company on the role and approach which it should adopt in the Suit,
                                including the immediate steps of filing a Defence to the
                                Counterclaim and a reply affidavit(s) in Summons No. 2651 of
                                2010/E.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">2.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Any expansion or variation of our role as
                            solicitors for the Company can be discussed at a later
                        date.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">As mentioned above, the Respondent’s accepted this proposal
                    on 1 July 2010 (resulting in the 1 July Agreement).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     However, the resolutions validated by the
                    Judge expanded WongPartnership’s role to include the providing of general
                    advice on any issue relating to the dispute between its shareholders and the
                    continued operations of the Company. Furthermore, these resolutions provided
                    that the Chairman of the Company would give and receive instructions from
                    WongPartnership in relation to the Suit. This enlarged scope of
                    WongPartnership’s role gave the Respondents a significant advantage over
                    the Appellants for, while the resolutions made provision for Douglas Tan to
                    comment or add to the instructions provided to WongPartnership, the Chairman
                    would have the final say if Douglas Tan’s instructions conflicted with the
                    Chairman’s instructions. In these circumstances, there would be no check
                    on the Respondents, who could instruct WongPartnership to act to the
                    Appellants’ detriment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Essentially, the validation of the resolutions
                    had the effect of overriding the 1 July Agreement on the appointment of
                    Wong Partnership and widening its scope. This constituted, without more, a
                    substantial injustice to the Appellants as they were deprived of the bargain
                    which they had struck with the Respondents and WongPartnership. There was no
                    indication that the 1 July Agreement was, as the Respondents contended,
                    merely an interim agreement. As such, the parties should have abided by the
                    terms of the said Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the final analysis, after conducting
                        <em>“</em>a holistic weighing and balancing of
                    the various interests of all the relevant parties<em>”</em> (see also above at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>), we found that validating the resolutions would cause
                    substantial injustice which cannot be remedied by an order of court. As was the
                    case in <em>Thio </em><em>Keng
                        </em><em>Poon</em>, there was a link in the
                    present case between the procedural irregularities and the substantial injustice
                    suffered by the Appellants. The result might have been different if the
                    Respondents had not proceeded with the inquorate board meetings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     For the reasons set out above, we allowed the
                    appeal with costs and with the usual consequential orders.</p>
