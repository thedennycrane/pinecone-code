        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In the present case, the accused had pleaded
                    guilty to having sexually assaulted and abused a friend’s daughter
                    repeatedly over a continuous period of some seven years. This systematic pattern
                    of sexual assault and abuse began when the victim was just eight years old and
                    continued regularly until she was 15 years old. The assault and abuse came
                    to light only when the victim belatedly confided in her aunt, who then told her
                    parents, who (in turn) reported the offences to the police.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The accused was subsequently charged with 44
                    counts of multiple sexual assaults perpetrated against the victim. He pleaded
                    guilty to nine of the charges and the remaining 35 charges were taken into
                    account for the purposes of sentencing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The trial judge (“the Judge”)
                    sentenced the accused to (see <em>PP v ABJ</em> [2009] SGHC
                    185 at [5]):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     16 years’ imprisonment for each
                        of the five charges under s 376(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224,
                        1985 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) (<em>viz</em>, the first, second, eighth, 13th and 19th charges (see
                        also below at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>)), which sentences
                        were to run concurrently;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     one year’s imprisonment for the charge under
                        s 7 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38, 2001 Rev
                        Ed) (“the CYPA”) (<em>viz</em>, the 28th
                        charge (see also below at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>));</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     eight years’ imprisonment for the charge under s 377 of the
                        Penal Code (<em>viz</em>, the 29th charge (see also
                        below at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>)); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_d"></a>(d)     eight years’ imprisonment for
                        each of the two charges under s 376A(1)(<em>b</em>) and s 376A(1)(<em>a</em>),
                        respectively, of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)
                        (“the Penal Code (2008 Rev Ed)”) (<em>viz</em>, the 42nd and 43rd charges, respectively (see also below
                        at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>)), which sentences were to run
                        concurrently.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In so far as the overall sentence was concerned,
                    the Judge ordered (in respect of the sentences imposed and set out in the
                    preceding paragraph) that the sentences in (a), (b) and (c) above were to run
                    concurrently, and that these sentences were to run consecutively with the
                    sentences imposed in (d) above, with the result that the accused was sentenced
                    to a total of 24 years’ imprisonment with effect from 21 July 2008.
                    The accused could not be caned due to his age.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Prosecution was dissatisfied with the
                    sentence meted out to the accused and brought the present appeal. After hearing
                    submissions from the parties, we allowed the appeal and sentenced the accused to
                    32 years’ imprisonment. We now give the detailed grounds for our
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The accused is a 60-year-old Chinese man. At the
                    time of his arrest, he was working as a coffee shop assistant. He is married
                    with two sons and two daughters. His wife and children are residing in
                    China.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The victim is a 17-year-old Chinese girl. She is
                    the eldest of four daughters in her family. At the time of the trial last year,
                    she was repeating her Secondary Three studies in school. Her parents are
                    divorced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The accused and the victim’s father were
                    acquainted sometime in the year 2000, when they were fellow mediums in a Chinese
                    temple. They also worked for the same employer as odd-job labourers. The
                    victim’s family regarded the accused as a “spiritual
                        advisor”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> as well as a close and trusted family
                    friend. The accused would stay over at the victim’s home regularly, and
                    the victim and her siblings would address him as
                        “uncle”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before the victim’s parents’
                    divorce, the family stayed at a four-room Housing and Development Board
                    (“HDB”) flat at Bangkit Road. After the parents’ divorce in
                    2004, the victim stayed with her mother in a rented flat at Gangsa Road. The
                    victim and her mother stayed at this last-mentioned flat until around August
                    2006, when they moved into their current HDB flat at Woodlands. The sexual
                    assaults took place at all three of these homes and also at a fourth venue,
                        <em>viz</em>, the accused’s own flat at Lower
                    Delta Road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The sexual assaults continued for some seven
                    years, beginning when the victim was only eight years old and continuing until
                    she was 15 years old. The victim had reported to the doctors who interviewed her
                    that the frequency of the abuse ranged from being committed “daily to
                    3–4 times a month”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> until the year 2008, when it became
                    less frequent as she had avoided the accused by giving excuses to the effect
                    that she was not free.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In his medical report dated 5 February
                        2009,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Dr Cai Yiming
                    (“Dr Cai”), a senior consultant psychiatrist, noted that
                    severe psychological harm had been inflicted on the victim as a result of the
                    accused’s sexual assaults as well as abuse. In particular, the victim was
                    driven to promiscuous behaviour, which she used as a
                        “tool”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> to help her forget what the
                    accused had done to her. She also indulged in acts of self-mutilation.
                    Dr Cai also noted that the victim “had a low self-esteem and
                    disliked herself”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He further noted that she
                    was “at risk of developing into [<em>sic</em>] a
                    borderline personality disorder, drug and alcohol abuse and having interpersonal
                    difficulties in the future”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Most
                    significantly, perhaps, Dr Cai was of the view that:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would be difficult for [the victim], even with intensive counseling, to
                        show recovery as the effects of the sexual abuse on her [were] quite severe
                        and over a prolonged duration involving the use of force and physical
                        objects in genital penetration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Indeed, all these findings are consistent with the contents of the
                    Victim Impact Statement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     As already mentioned, the accused was charged
                    with 44 counts of multiple sexual assaults perpetrated against the victim. These
                    assaults included rape, anal sex, oral sex as well as indecent acts of
                    penetration of the victim’s vagina involving a banana as well as a stick.
                    The accused pleaded guilty to nine of the charges, <em>viz</em>, the first, second, eighth, 13th, 19th, 28th, 29th, 42nd and
                    43rd charges. The first, second, eighth, 13th and 19th charges related to the
                    rape of the victim when she was between eight and 11 years old (pursuant to
                    s 376(2) of the Penal Code). The 28th charge related to the offence
                    involving penetration of the victim’s vagina with a banana when she was 13
                    years old (pursuant to s 7 of the CYPA). The 29th charge related to the
                    offence involving anal intercourse when the victim was 13 years old (pursuant to
                    s 377 of the Penal Code). The 42nd charge related to the offence involving
                    the penetration of the victim’s vagina with a stick when she was 15 years
                    old (pursuant to s 376A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Penal
                    Code (2008 Rev Ed)). The 43rd charge related to the offence of sexual
                    penetration of the victim when she was 15 years old (pursuant to
                        s 376A(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Penal Code
                    (2008 Rev Ed)). The accused was, as we have already noted, sentenced to a
                    total of 24 years’ imprisonment by the Judge (see above at <a href="#p1_3">[3]</a>–<a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arguments before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Prosecution argued, on appeal, that the
                    aggregate sentence imposed by the Judge was manifestly inadequate and
                    disproportionate to the gravity of the offences in terms of the nature of the
                    sexual assaults, the prolonged period of abuse and the extent of damage caused
                    to the victim. In its written submissions, the Prosecution stated that
                    “this [was] one of the worst cases of its kind”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>
                    which observation was reiterated during oral submissions before the court. It
                    also argued that the accused’s age was not a limiting factor which
                    prevented the court from imposing a heavier sentence on the
                accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The accused acknowledged (in a letter to the
                    court) that he had committed very serious offences and stated that he was very
                    sorry to the victim and to society. He promised to reform himself. He also
                    referred to his medical problems and hoped that he could see his family in China
                    one day. We pause to note, parenthetically, however, that the accused did not
                    own up to his misdeeds of his own volition and that his offences came to light
                    only when they were reported by the victim’s parents to the police (see
                    also the decision of this court in <em>PP v UI</em> [2008]
                    4 SLR(R) 500 at [73]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     There is a general – and constant
                    – need to balance societal needs and concerns on the one hand and the
                    needs and concerns of the individual on the other. This is especially the case
                    in the context of the sentencing process. As I observed in <em>ADF v PP</em> [2009] SGCA 57 at [218] and [222]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">218    The sentencing process is not – and ought
                            not to be – a mechanistic one. Still less is a decision on
                            sentencing in a given case arrived at merely by a resort to a prior
                            precedent or precedents unless the facts as well as context in that case
                            are wholly coincident with those in the prior case or cases. This last
                            mentioned situation is, in the nature of things, likely to be rare. The
                            sentencing process is a complex one where the precise factual matrix is
                            all-important and where the court is tasked with the delicate process of
                            balancing a number of important factors centring on both individual (in
                            particular, in relation to the accused) and societal concerns. Indeed,
                            the general aims of sentencing (viz, prevention, retribution,
                            deterrence, rehabilitation and the public interest) embody these various
                            concerns (see generally Kow Keng Siong, Sentencing Principles in
                            Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2009) at ch 6). Having regard to the
                            fact that the sentencing process is not a mechanistic one, it ought (as
                            I have just mentioned) to be a holistic and integrated one that takes
                            into account all the general aims of sentencing as applied to the
                            precise factual matrix before the court itself, and in so far as they
                            are relevant to that particular factual matrix.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">222    However, one cannot ignore the second principal
                            (and, in some ways, contrasting) theme in sentencing, viz, the concerns
                            surrounding the individual accused. One basic tenet is as logical as it
                            is fair and commonsensical: that an accused should not be punished
                            excessively, even if the wider or broader societal concerns might
                            suggest otherwise. As I have mentioned above, the court has to balance
                            the factors from both the individual as well as the societal
                            perspectives. This concern – that the accused should not receive
                            excessive punishment – is often reflected in that time-honoured
                            adage that “the punishment should fit the crime”.
                            Nevertheless, this particular adage cannot be viewed solely from the
                            individual accused’s point of view but must also take into account
                            the relevant societal or public context. On occasion, in fact, the
                            societal concerns are so important that they must be given predominant
                            (even conclusive) effect. This brings us back to the principle of
                            balance, always bearing in mind that the entire process must be applied
                            by the court in as holistic and integrated a fashion as
                        possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Hence, <em>all</em>
                    relevant factors – both societal as well as individual in nature –
                    must be taken into account in the context of the relevant factual matrix as a
                    whole, bearing in mind that, on occasion, the societal concerns may (as stated
                    in the preceding paragraph) be given predominant (or even conclusive) effect.
                    This is, in our view, one such occasion. Before proceeding to elaborate further,
                    we pause to observe, parenthetically, that, whilst bearing in mind the
                    individual accused’s point of view (in particular, in the context of the
                    present appeal, the accused’s age), one must also bear in mind the fact
                    that the victim, too, is an individual who has (in this case) been severely and
                    repeatedly violated by the accused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     This was, in no uncertain terms, an abhorrent
                    case comprising a deliberate, systematic and remorseless pattern of sexual
                    assaults on, as well as sexual abuse of, a young and innocent victim stretching
                    over a continuous period of some seven years. These wanton and despicable
                    assaults also involved, on occasion, sadistic acts of perversion committed in
                    the context of a flagrant breach of trust as well as in a climate of fear. The
                    psychological scars inflicted on the victim could not have been more severe and
                    now appear to be indelible (see above at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In the circumstances, the age of the accused
                    (which can, depending on the facts, be a mitigating factor (see the decision of
                    this court in <em>PP v UI</em> at [78])) pales into
                    insignificance in the light of what was perpetrated by the accused on the
                    victim. It is important, at this juncture, to emphasise the important point
                    referred to above (at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>) to the effect
                    that the sentencing process is not – and ought not to be – a
                    mechanistic one. Indeed, as also mentioned above (also at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>), much will turn on the precise facts before
                    the court in the case at hand. For example, unlike <em>PP v
                        UI</em>, the causal link in the present case between the
                    accused’s conduct and the harm suffered by the victim was clearly and
                    unequivocally established. Further, although the forgiveness extended by the
                    victim to the accused in <em>PP v UI</em> was accorded
                    little (if any) weight, there was no element of forgiveness whatsoever in this
                    case. Although the lack of violence in the commission of the offences ought not
                    to be taken into account as a mitigating factor (see <em>PP v
                        UI</em> at [74]), “the presence of violence would undoubtedly
                    be an <em>aggravating</em> factor” [emphasis added]
                    (see <em>PP v UI</em> at [74]). Indeed, as we have seen,
                    the accused had in fact remorselessly inflicted violence upon the victim in this
                    case. Further, although there had also been a pattern of offences committed in
                    breach of trust in <em>PP v UI</em>, the pattern of sexual
                    assault and abuse of the victim in the present case was, in our view, even more
                    deliberate, systematic as well as remorseless.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     We were, in fact, of the view that this was an
                    eminently suitable case to impose three consecutive sentences in accordance with
                    the principles which V K Rajah JA laid down in <em>ADF v PP</em> (at [138]–[146]). In particular, in that case,
                    Rajah JA observed as follows (at [146]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The discretion given by s 18 of the [Criminal
                        Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed)], despite the lack of
                        manifest statutory constraints, is one that must be exercised sparingly and
                        carefully assessed in relation to the one-transaction rule as well as the
                        totality principle within the broad context of the material facts. A
                        decision to impose more than two consecutive sentences ought not to be
                        lightly made and, indeed, should usually only be imposed in compelling
                        circumstances. Concurrent sentences are ordinarily called for when there is
                        a single episode of criminality which results in a number of offences having
                        been committed. For the avoidance of doubt, I stress that there is, however,
                        no rule or principle of sentencing that distinct offences committed on the
                        same day or in the same criminal episode must be made to run concurrently.
                        On the other hand, the totality principle cannot be unthinkingly invoked to
                        minimise punishment for those who maliciously pursue a deliberate course of
                        criminal behaviour. Multiple wrongdoing by a multiple wrongdoer as a general
                        rule must be viewed more severely than single offending involving similar
                        offences. The community (and the victim(s)) have suffered more because of
                        the greater harm done. Often the exercise of this discretion will involve
                        intuitive (and not mathematical) considerations and calibration that takes
                        into account the totality of the criminal behaviour. There is no rigid
                        linear relationship between the severity of the offending and the length of
                        the cumulative sentence. In my view, an order for more than two sentences to
                        run consecutively ought to be given serious consideration in dealing with
                        distinct offences when one or more of the following circumstances are
                        present, viz:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    dealing with persistent or habitual offenders
                                …;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    there is a pressing public interest concern in
                                discouraging the type of criminal conduct being punished
                                …;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    there are multiple victims; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(d)    other peculiar cumulative aggravating features
                                are present … .</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In particular, where the overall criminality of the offender’s
                        conduct cannot be encompassed in two consecutive sentences, further
                        consecutive sentences ought to be considered. I reiterate that the above
                        circumstances are non-exhaustive and should not be taken as rigid guidelines
                        to constrain or shackle a sentencing court’s powers. Beyond this, I do
                        not think that it will be helpful to spell out how this discretion must be
                        exercised. Myriad permutations of offending can take place and too dogmatic
                        or structured an approach would constrain effective sentencing. In the
                        ultimate analysis, the court has to assess the totality of the aggregate
                        sentence with the totality of the criminal behaviour.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Turning to the facts of the present case, the
                    circumstances are certainly “compelling” (see <em>ADF v PP</em> at [146]) and merit the imposition of more than two
                    consecutive sentences. This was certainly a situation where there had been
                    “[m]ultiple wrongdoing by a multiple wrongdoer” (see <em>ADF v PP</em> at [146]). Indeed, the accused in this case
                    certainly did “maliciously pursue a deliberate course of criminal
                    behaviour” (see <em>ADF v PP</em> at [146]), which,
                    in our view, “there is a pressing public interest concern in
                    discouraging” (see <em>ADF v PP</em> at [146]). More
                    specifically, in addition to the severe harm that has been caused to the victim
                    in this case, it is also in the public interest that the accused’s overall
                    sentence be enhanced, his age notwithstanding, given the deplorable and
                    systematic nature of his offences. With due respect to the Judge, the sentence
                    originally imposed fails to adequately encapsulate the heinousness of the
                    accused’s depraved and wanton conduct, which (as noted above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>) the Prosecution has described as one of the
                    worst cases of its kind to come before the courts. In our view, the conduct of
                    the accused, his age notwithstanding, has in the prevailing circumstances to be
                    denounced in the strongest possible terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     We therefore allowed the appeal by the
                    Prosecution and ordered that the terms of imprisonment imposed by the Judge for
                    the first, 29th and 42nd charges run consecutively. All the remaining sentences
                    imposed by the Judge were to run concurrently. The accused was consequently
                    sentenced to a total of 32 years’ imprisonment with effect from
                    21 July 2008.</p>
