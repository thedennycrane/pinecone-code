        Lai Siu Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In this case, JK Private Limited ("the
                    plaintiff") sued Lonpac Insurance Bhd (“the defendant") for failing to
                    pay for services the plaintiff had rendered to the defendant, pursuant to a
                    letter of appointment dated 1 August 2008 ("the LOA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff is a Singapore company with its
                    office at 135 Middle Road #05-10, Bylands Building. The plaintiff’s
                    managing-director is one Goh Jong Kan (“Goh”) whose initials
                    presumably appear in the plaintiff’s name. The defendant is a Malaysian
                    insurance company with an office in Singapore which was at 100, Beach Road
                    #19-00, Shaw Tower at the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Between 14 and 24 April 2008, the defendant
                    had issued nine marine policies (“the policies”) to a company
                    called Idea Giant Ltd (“the shipper”) and to other Singapore
                    companies including Super Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd (“Super
                    Coffeemix”), insuring various types of products shipped to S.S.L Trading
                    Co Ltd (“SSL”) and Malikha Automobile Co Ltd
                    (“Malikha”) (collectively “the consignees”) in
                    Yangon, Myanmar. The products shipped to the consignees consisted of malt
                    cereal, glucose creamer, coffee powder, non-dairy creamer and coffee mixes
                    popularly known as 3-in-1 or 2-in-1 (collectively “the goods”)
                    which were manufactured by companies in the Super Coffeemix group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The goods were shipped to Yangon on three
                    vessels known as “Kota Tegap”, “Kota Tabah” and
                    “Kota Tampan” (collectively “the vessels”). The
                    vessels arrived at Yangon between 17 and 28 April 2008. Because of a
                    lengthy holiday in Myanmar between 12 and 22 April 2008, the consignees had
                    to wait for a considerable period for documentation for customs clearance to be
                    completed. Unfortunately, a cyclone named “Nargis” struck the
                    Irrawaddy River and other regions of Myanmar between 2 and 3 May 2008 with
                    a wind force of over 120mph. As a result, the port terminal at Yangon was closed
                    until 9 May 2008, several roads were blocked by fallen trees and those roads
                    were only reopened gradually between 12 and 16 May 2008. The goods which
                    were water-stained to varying degrees were eventually cleared from the port
                    between 21 and 25 May 2008 and delivered to the consignees’
                    warehouse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The defendant appointed the Singapore office of
                    claim adjusters WK Webster (International) Pte Ltd (“Webster”) to
                    survey the damaged goods after they had been delivered to the consignees.
                    (Webster also acted as the defendant’s settling agent subsequently). In
                    turn, Webster appointed Captain Min Sein (“Captain Min”) of
                    Myanmar Marine Company Limited (“MMCL”) to conduct the actual
                    surveys. The surveys were carried out by Captain Min in the presence of
                    representatives of the consignees, the supervisors of the warehouse and one Dr
                    Moe Myint Zaw Win (“Zaw Win”) who was allegedly the Department
                    Head of Divisional Health in Yangon. After the surveys were completed, Zaw Win
                    ordered the goods to be destroyed. The goods in plastic bags were apparently
                    burnt on 28, 29 and 30 May 2008 at the Shwe Pyi Tahr township (“the
                    township”) in the presence of representatives of the police, the fire
                    brigade and MMCL.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In June 2008, the defendant received claims
                    under the policies (“the claims”) in respect of losses the
                    consignees had sustained on the goods arising out of cyclone Nargis. The
                    defendant’s principal officer Terence Teo Chin Poh (“Teo”)
                    spoke to one Henry Tan (“Tan”) of Insurance Education &amp; Claims
                    Consultants Pte Ltd and inquired whether Tan had any contacts in Myanmar or
                    whether Tan knew of anyone who had contacts in Myanmar. Tan (who was described
                    by the defendant as a consultant) suggested that the defendant should meet
                    Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Tan arranged a meeting sometime in late July
                    2008 to introduce Goh to Teo. A second meeting was arranged by Tan on
                    1 August 2008 (“the August meeting”) with Goh. This time the
                    meeting was attended not only by Teo and Tan but also by the defendant’s
                    group Chief Operating Officer Tee Choon Yeow (“Tee”). At the
                    August meeting, Goh indicated he could accept the defendant’s assignment
                    to conduct checks on the parties involved in the claims and the extent of the
                    flooding caused by cyclone Nargis after he was briefed on the defendant’s
                    requirements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The discussion then turned to the issue of
                    remuneration. Tee inquired as to Tan’s usual charges for consultancy
                    services. Tan replied he usually charged 25% to 30% of the quantum saved on a
                    claim <em>viz</em> the difference between the original
                    amount claimed and the sum actually paid out. Tee asked Goh for the charges for
                    his fees. Goh said they would be 10% of the quantum saved. Goh inquired if he
                    could be paid a bonus amounting to another 5% if he completed the assignment
                    within three months; Tee agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The attendees agreed that the terms of
                    Goh’s assignment should be reduced into writing. The terms were drafted by
                    Tee with Teo’s assistance and typed out by Teo’s secretary and this
                    was done in Goh’s presence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The typed document was the LOA which was
                    addressed to Goh and copied to Tee. As the parties disagreed on the
                    interpretation of this document, I shall set out its text in full. It
                    reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Principal Officer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Goh requested an advance from the defendants.
                    Tee inquired as to the amount and how long Goh’s investigation would take.
                    Goh indicated he would be in Myanmar for three days and that his expenses would
                    be $2,500 per day. The defendant handed Goh a cheque for $7,500 for his
                    expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     At Goh’s request, the defendant
                    subsequently issued him a letter of authorisation dated 6 August 2008 which
                    reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Mr Goh</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Letter of Authorisation</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We hereby confirm that you are authorised to check and report on the
                        various Marine claims duly advised to you separately arising from the
                        Cyclone “Nargis” event on May 2 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(signed Terence Teo)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Principal Officer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Goh left for Myanmar on 12 August and returned
                    to Singapore on 16 August 2008. While he was in Myanmar, he contacted a
                    lawyer U Zaw Lin who gave him a copy of the State Law and Order Restoration
                    Council National Food and Drug Law (“the SLORC”). Goh then
                    consulted U Win Hlaing, a retired judge, who advised him that the claims of the
                    consignees were highly doubtful and suspicious.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     After his return, Goh discussed his findings
                    in Myanmar with Tan who agreed that the claims made on the defendant were either
                    fraudulent or could be rejected in toto. This was confirmed in an email from Tan
                    to the defendant on18 August 2008 which was copied to Goh. Goh followed up
                    with his own email to Tan on 20 August 2008, thanking Tan for introducing
                    him to the defendant and offering Tan 50% of the net fee he would receive from
                    the defendant based on 10% of the quantum he saved the defendant. Tan did not
                    reply to Goh’s email.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 21 August 2008, Tan wrote to the defendant
                    (copied to Goh) forwarding documents he had received from Goh. Tan concluded his
                    letter as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Separately, we will discuss the merits of these documents and its
                        application to form a basis of denial in respect of the 9 claims submitted
                        by insured.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The enclosures in Tan’s letter included a letter dated
                    14 August 2008 from Zaw Lin (referred to in <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>) to Goh forwarding an English version of the
                SLORC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Goh issued the plaintiff’s tax invoice
                    to the defendant on 21 August 2008 (“the plaintiff’s
                    invoice”) in the sum of $347,610.71 which comprised:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Goh followed up on the plaintiff’s
                    invoice by sending an email to Teo on 22 August 2008 stating it was a great
                    achievement on his part to have completed the defendant’s assignment
                    within 21 days and that Goh had provided the defendant with the requisite
                    documents to reject the claims. Goh concluded his email with a request for
                    $50,000 advance against the plaintiff’s fees because the plaintiff was GST
                    registered and would have to submit its third quarter returns by 30 October
                    2008. No payment was made on the plaintiff’s invoice. Goh’s request
                    for $50,000 advance was also not acceded to by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 22 October 2008, Goh wrote on the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 24 November 2008 Goh had a meeting at the
                    defendant’s office where he requested an advance of $150,000 from Tee. As
                    the loan was not part of the terms of the LOA, Goh’s request was refused.
                    Tee counter-offered $7,500 which Goh rejected. Goh followed up the meeting with
                    two emails to the defendant, dated 26 and 29 November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     In his email of 26 November 2008, Goh
                    described the defendant’s counter-offer of $7,500 as
                    “peanuts” and added that “peanuts are for monkeys”.
                    He reiterated that based on the documentation he had brought back from Myanmar
                    and the views of his contacts (who included ministers and a retired judge), the
                    defendant could “throw out 100% of this claim”. In his email reply
                    dated 26 November 2008, Tee disagreed with Goh’s views.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In his email of 29 November 2008, Goh
                    reiterated his opinion that the defendant could reject the claims immediately as
                    being unfounded, based on what his counsel in Yangon had told him and based on
                    the valuable documents he had given the defendant. Goh repeated his request for
                    a loan of $150,000 which he said, was intended to maintain the goodwill that he
                    enjoyed in Myanmar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On his part, Tan separately advised the
                    defendant in his email dated 3 December 2008 to reject the claims as the
                    consignees had not proven their loss.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 12 December 2008, another meeting took
                    place at the defendant’s office. According to Teo, on the pretence that he
                    needed to have the plaintiff’s documents endorsed by the Myanmar Embassy
                    in Singapore, Goh took back the originals that he had previously forwarded to
                    the defendant through Tan on 21 August 2008. His taking back of the
                    documents was confirmed in Goh’s email on the same day to Tee. The
                    documents were never returned to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In his email dated 12 December 2008 to the
                    defendant, Goh recorded that his request for an advance payment of $150,000 had
                    been refused by the defendant. Goh added that he had agreed with the defendant
                    to meet Webster’s representatives on 15 December 2008 and to make a
                    presentation to the latter that there was no claim. However, Goh required the
                    defendant to advance him a higher loan of $300,000 which amount had to be paid
                    to him before the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The defendant did not advance $300,000 or any
                    other sum to Goh despite meeting with Webster’s representatives on or
                    15 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     On 16 December 2008, Webster prepared draft
                    letters to the consignees rejecting their claims. Webster then wrote to the
                    consignee Malikha on 19 January 2009 to reject its claims. No evidence was
                    adduced that the defendant and/or Webster sent a similar letter to the other
                    consignee SSL. Between December 2008 and January 2009, Goh pressed the defendant
                    as well as Tan to close the claims and to pay the plaintiff’s
                    invoice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Notwithstanding the disclaimer of liability by
                    the defendant through Webster, the defendant entered into negotiations with the
                    consignees and on 26 June 2009, agreed to pay them US$770,000 (“the
                    settlement sum”) on the claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Goh on his part lost patience with the
                    defendant and on 19 January 2009, the plaintiff filed this suit claiming
                    the balance of $340,110.71 of the invoice amount (after deducting the
                    defendant’s advance of $7,500).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     In the statement of claim, the plaintiff
                    averred that it completed its investigations on or about 21 August 2008 and
                    handed to the defendant all documents and supporting evidence necessary to
                    legally complete the matter by rejecting the claims. The plaintiff relied on an
                    email from Webster dated 16 December 2008 that agreed with the plaintiff’s
                    assessment and recommendation of rejecting the claims. The plaintiff alleged
                    that by virtue thereof, it had completed and discharged its duties pursuant to
                    the LOA. Consequently, by completing and discharging its duties within 90 days
                    from the date of its appointment, the plaintiff contended it was eligible for a
                    5% bonus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In its defence (Amendment No 3), the defendant
                    averred that the plaintiff’s provision of documents to the defendant on
                    21 August 2008 and the defendant’s subsequent rejection of the claims
                    did not bring the matter to legal completion in the context of the LOA. Further,
                    the plaintiff’s representative Goh had retrieved the documents from the
                    defendant on or about 12 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The defendant pleaded that Webster’s
                    email dated 16 December 2008 forwarded to the plaintiff only two draft
                    letters of rejection to the consignees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendant contended that payment to the
                    plaintiff under the LOA could only be made after the quantum saved, on the
                    consignees’ claim of $2,165,798.90, if any, had been ascertained.
                    Accordingly, the defendant averred, the plaintiff had no basis to issue the
                    plaintiff’s invoice on 21 August 2008. Further, the LOA was given on
                    a “no cure no pay basis” as was confirmed in Goh’s email to
                    the defendant dated 19 September 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The defendant pleaded that on or about 26 June
                    2009, it reached agreement with the consignees to pay the settlement sum on
                    their claims and that was paid on or about 12 January 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In its reply, the plaintiff averred that in
                    rejecting the claims, the defendant had thereby admitted the plaintiff had fully
                    discharged its obligations under the LOA. The plaintiff further contended it was
                    not bound by the settlement between the plaintiff and the consignees as it had
                    been made without reference to the plaintiff while the decision on the quantum
                    was a unilateral act on the part of the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     After the defendant had filed its defence, the
                    plaintiff applied for summary judgment on its claim. By an order of court made
                    on 2 September 2009, the plaintiff was awarded judgment in the sum of
                    $157,394.84 which included the 5% bonus (“the judgment sum”)
                    excluding interest and costs, thereby reducing its claim to $182,715.87 for the
                    trial. The judgment sum was calculated based on 10% of the amount saved by the
                    defendant <em>viz</em> the difference between the
                    settlement sum and the original sum claimed by the consignees. No breakdown of
                    the sum was furnished to the court by the parties either in their pleadings or
                    in the affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”). The breakdown
                    appeared in an affidavit filed by Goh on 26 August 2009 for the summary
                    judgment application. He deposed that the exchange rate of the US dollar to the
                    local currency was $1.45 as of 26 June 2009 (date of the settlement).
                    Goh’s computation of the judgment sum which was accepted by the court
                    below was as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The plaintiff called only one witness for its
                    case, Goh, even though an advocate cum qualified chemist from Myanmar, one U Min
                    Sein, had filed an AEIC to confirm <em>inter alia</em> that
                    the English translation of the Myanmar documents that Goh brought back from
                    Myanmar were accurate. U Min Sein’s AEIC also confirmed the credentials of
                    U Win Hlaing (“Hlaing”), a Myanmar retired judge, whom Goh had
                    consulted and who had rendered an opinion to the defendant on the
                    consignees’ claim. The plaintiff did not call Hlaing to testify, nor any
                    of the persons who had witnessed the burning of the goods. The plaintiff had
                    subpoenaed Webster’s director, Christina Lau, but decided not to call her
                    to the stand. The defendant had three witnesses in Tan, Teo and Raymond Ong
                    (“Ong”), who was its claims manager.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I turn first to the evidence presented by Goh
                    for the plaintiff’s case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(i)   The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     I would first make a preliminary observation
                    that Goh’s AEIC was short on crucial facts after his visit to Myanmar, but
                    long on arguments, particularly where he dwelt at length on what he considered
                    was the true interpretation and meaning of the LOA, usurping the function of
                    this court. Goh further complained of and criticised the conduct of the
                    defendant <em>in extenso</em>. In his AEIC Goh went on to
                    question the defendant’s payment of the settlement sum, pointing out that
                    the cheque was issued by Travelex Singapore Pte Ltd to Idea Giant Ltd and drawn
                    on the Bank of New York in America; he pointed out that with the embargo imposed
                    by the United States and other governments on bank transactions involving
                    Myanmar companies, no payment could have been made in New York to Idea Giant Ltd
                    (if it was a Myanmar company) as the funds would have been frozen. Goh
                    disbelieved the payment was genuine. For added measure, Goh questioned the
                    signatories to the Release and Subrogation form as their authority to represent
                    the consignees was not produced. None of his speculative comments was supported
                    by documentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Goh had highlighted without modesty, his close
                    ties since 1978 with Myanmar officials and businessmen. That being the case, one
                    would have thought he would/could have brought from Myanmar witnesses who would
                    testify for his claim including U Min Sein but he did not.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As Goh’s AEIC was not particularly
                    helpful, I turn my attention instead to his cross-examination during which
                    significant matters were revealed by him. Goh disclosed that he had lied when he
                    told the defendant he took back his documents to have them legalised by the
                    Myanmar Embassy. Indeed, he never sent the documents to the Myanmar Embassy at
                    all. Goh admitted he intended to and did use the documents as a bargaining chip
                    in his attempts to obtain advances/loans from the defendant. Unless the
                    defendant acceded to his demands and paid him, Goh said he would not return the
                    documents. Although he (and his counsel) contended that the defendant could have
                    but did not ask for the return of the documents, I very much doubt Goh would
                    have acceded to the defendant’s request had he been asked.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The court had pointed out to Goh that his
                    action was illogical when, after the defendant refused his initial request for a
                    loan of $50,000, Goh renewed his request by asking for higher advances first of
                    $150,000 and then of $300,000. Until he was advised by the court, Goh was
                    unaware that foreign law had to be proved as a fact in Singapore courts.
                    Consequently, notwithstanding his counsel’s submission that the SLORC was
                    in the English language, that did not dispense with the need for an expert in
                    Myanmar law (be it U Win Hlaing or anyone else) to testify in a Singapore court
                    had the defendant been sued by the consignees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     It was equally clear from Goh’s
                    cross-examination that notwithstanding his professed experience of one
                    year’s duration as a claims manager in a Malaysian insurance company which
                    no longer exists, Goh had no experience whatsoever of evaluating and processing
                    marine insurance claims. He was also unaware of the law involved. Consequently,
                    apart from his repeated assertion that the claims were fraudulent or
                    “very suspicious”, Goh acknowledged after being pressed by the
                    court, that he did not know the basis on which marine claims could be rejected.
                    He eventually conceded that the defendant could not have repudiated the claims
                    based solely on the documents he had brought back from Myanmar. Despite this
                    concession, the plaintiff’s closing submissions were premised on the
                    misconception that the defendant’s decision to reject the claims was based
                    on the plaintiff’s documents – purely because the defendant and/or
                    its solicitors did not ask for more information or documents from Goh
                    subsequently. Goh had also acknowledged that apart from the bald statements in
                    his AEIC and/or his own surmise, he had no evidence that Idea Giant Ltd was a
                    Myanmar company or that the funds under the cheque for the settlement sum would
                    have been frozen due to United States’ or other countries’ sanctions
                    against the Myanmar government.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Indeed, Goh’s cross-examination proved
                    that the defendant was justified in not relying on either his documents or his
                    advice to reject the consignees’ claims. He had acted with unseemly haste
                    in sending the invoice to the defendant on 21 August 2008 for his commission
                    when the merits of the claims had not even been considered. Contrary to the
                    stand he took in his AEIC that the words “legal completion” in the
                    LOA meant that the plaintiff was entitled to be paid upon completion of his work
                    in Myanmar, Goh agreed under cross-examination that legal completion took place
                    on or about 26 June 2009 when the defendant reached a settlement with the
                    consignees. I conclude that he would have been an unreliable witness if Goh was
                    called to testify for the defendant had the consignees sued to recover the
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(ii)   The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Tan who is a chartered insurance practitioner
                    stated in his AEIC that it was agreed with Goh at the August meeting that the
                    words “10% on the quantum saved for the amounts adjusted as
                    $2,165,798.90” in the LOA meant the difference between the amount
                    originally claimed by the consignees and the amount paid out when the case was
                    legally completed. If at the legal completion stage, the defendant did not have
                    to pay a single cent on the claim, then the quantum saved would be the entire
                    sum of $2,165,798.90. I should add that Goh’s interpretation of the words
                    “amount saved” during re-examination accorded with Tan’s
                    – Goh clarified that the words meant that if the defendant could save some
                    money, they pay him less commission. In this regard, his counsel’s closing
                    submission that Goh was confused and gave wrong answers is rejected. I do not
                    believe he was at all confused.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Tan deposed that to him the words
                    “legal completion” envisaged a situation where the claimant had
                    either withdrawn its claim or that the claim had been settled either amicably
                    between the parties or by way of a judgment in court; in other words, when the
                    defendant’s file was closed. He added that it was never the parties’
                    intention that “legal completion” meant the point in time (as the
                    plaintiff/Goh contended) when an initial repudiation/rejection letter had been
                    sent out to the claimant. Common sense dictated that an initial letter of
                    rejection of a claim that was submitted did not amount to the matter being
                    legally completed. As Goh had offered to share his fee with him, Tan pointed out
                    that it was also to his benefit if the defendant paid Goh early. Tan said he had
                    advised Goh not to be unduly worried about his fees as the defendant being an
                    insurance company would always act in good faith. He had advised Goh not to do
                    so, when Goh told Tan that he intended to complain to the Monetary Authority of
                    Singapore and to take legal proceedings. Tan’s involvement in the claims
                    ceased thenceforth and he had no further dealings with either party thereafter.
                    I should point out that Tan received no remuneration for the help that he
                    extended to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Tan explained he had urged the defendant to
                    send a letter to the consignees to deny liability in order to test the ground as
                    the documents submitted by Goh was only one basis to deny the claims. During
                    cross-examination, Tan’s attention was drawn to his AEIC where he had
                    deposed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If, at the legal completion of this matter, the defendants do not have to
                        pay out a single cent on the claim, then the quantum saved would be the
                        whole amount of S$2,165,798.90 and I am certain that the plaintiffs will be
                        paid 10% of that sum plus the 5% bonus.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Counsel for the plaintiff suggested to Tan that the words “do
                    not have to pay” meant that the defendant was not under a legal
                    obligation to pay. Consequently, if the defendant (as was the case here) chose
                    to settle the claims amicably with the consignees, such voluntary payment was
                    outside the scope of the words; Tan disagreed. Counsel for the plaintiff in his
                    submissions appeared to have overlooked Goh’s testimony during
                    cross-examination, where Goh had agreed that under the LOA, the defendant was at
                    liberty to settle the claims without referring to him/the plaintiff. Tan also
                    disagreed with counsel for the plaintiff that once Webster rejected the claims,
                    the plaintiff would be paid in accordance with the LOA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As for his own letter to the defendant dated
                    21 August 2008 where he opined that the claims had not been substantiated and
                    could be fraudulent, Tan explained that he only meant that as an opener and a
                    tactic for the defendant to reject the claims – more investigations needed
                    to be carried out before the defendant could form an opinion whether it could
                    rebut the claims on their merits. Tan categorically denied Goh’s
                    allegation that he (Tan) had drafted the plaintiff’s letter dated 22
                    October 2008. While he acknowledged that the words “after your legal
                    completion which should be immediate” were in his handwriting, Tan
                    explained that Goh had shown the letter which Goh had drafted to Tan and had
                    inquired whether it was “ok”; Tan added the handwritten words and
                    made other amendments to correct Goh’s grammatical errors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     When Teo took the stand, for the defendant, he
                    confirmed Tan’s version of what had transpired at the August meeting. In
                    his AEIC, Tan deposed that Tan’s letter of 21 August 2008 contained a
                    letter in English dated 14 August 2008 from one Zaw Lin who was purportedly an
                    advocate of the chief court in Yangon. The other enclosures in Tan’s
                    letter appeared to be in the Burmese language without any translations. Teo
                    deposed he was very surprised to receive the plaintiff’s invoice around 21
                    August 2008 as the plaintiff had made the following erroneous assumptions in the
                    invoice:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_a"></a>(a)     that the defendant could
                        successfully reject the claims based on the plaintiff’s documents
                        alone;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_b"></a>(b)     that the
                        plaintiff’s documents would be the sole basis on which the defendant
                        could reject the claims;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_c"></a>(c)     the quantum saved on the claims would be the whole amount
                        of S$2,165,798.90.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Teo pointed out that the defendant did not
                    even have an opportunity to verify the authenticity of the plaintiff’s
                    Burmese documents. Further, as of 21 August 2008, the claims had not been
                    legally completed. For insurers, legal completion under the LOA took place when
                    the defendant’s claim files had been closed. Teo referred to the fact that
                    Goh resorted to asking for advances (from $50,000 to $300,000) as evidence that
                    Goh was aware that the claims had not been legally completed and the
                    plaintiff’s fee was not yet due.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Teo explained that the defendant instructed
                    Webster to write to the consignees on 19 January 2009 to reject the claims as a
                    strategy to preserve the defendant’s position pending further
                    investigations. It was what every prudent insurer in the position of the
                    defendant would do. Sending out a rejection letter in the initial stages did not
                    mean that the defendant as the insurer had shut out negotiations for a
                    settlement later if it was warranted on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Teo reiterated that the defendant did not deny
                    that the plaintiff was entitled to be paid for work done pursuant to the LOA.
                    The defendant’s position was that the plaintiff would be paid only when
                    the claims were legally completed <em>ie</em>. when the
                    defendant closed its files and the quantum saved had been ascertained. That took
                    place only after the defendant reached agreement with the consignees to pay the
                    settlement sum on or about 26 June 2009. Based on the settlement sum, the
                    plaintiff’s entitlement under the LOA was $157,394.84 (based on
                    $2,165,798.90 less US$770,000) which the defendant had paid. In fact, on
                    2 October 2009, the defendant paid the plaintiff $174,503.47 under the
                    order dated 2 September 2009 at [35] as
                    costs and interest were also paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Consequently, Teo contended the
                    plaintiff’s claim for the balance of $182,715.87 was unfounded and he
                    asked for the claim to be dismissed with costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Ong joined the defendant as claims manager in
                    February 2009 after the plaintiff had commenced this suit. Consequently, he had
                    no personal knowledge of the events that transpired in 2008 and which led to the
                    filing of the suit. What Ong did was to look at the claims afresh as to whether
                    the consignees had breached the policies’ conditions as alleged in
                    Webster’s letter of rejection to Malikha dated 19 January 2009. That
                    consignee had written to the defendant on 30 December 2008 inquiring as to its
                    claims. Presumably no response was received by Malikha since, on 3 March 2009, a
                    firm of Singapore solicitors wrote a letter of demand on its behalf to the
                    defendant for payment of the insured sum of US$1,023,588 within 14 days failing
                    which legal proceedings would be commenced. A similar letter was not received
                    from solicitors representing SSL the reason being (according to Ong) that it
                    made its claim through Webster. The defendant’s voluntary payment to SSL
                    without a demand from the latter was criticised in the plaintiff’s
                    submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Upon taking over the claim file, Ong sought
                    legal advice. The defendant’s legal advisers Ang &amp; Partners
                    (“A&amp;P”) gave their views in a letter dated 18 March 2009
                    to the defendant. Contrary to the simplistic view taken by Goh that the claims
                    were fraudulent and should be rejected, A&amp;P rendered a seven page opinion
                    setting out in detail the events leading to the destruction of the goods and the
                    evidence the defendant needed to obtain if it was to be able to successfully
                    reject the claims. The weaknesses in the defendant’s position were also
                    pointed out. It was noteworthy that A&amp;P opined that the position taken by
                    Webster by its appointed agent MMCL (who participated in the survey of the
                    damaged goods and witnessed their destruction) was contradictory to that taken
                    by Goh.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Ong revealed that the defendant held several
                    rounds of discussions with A&amp;P after receiving its letter dated 18 March
                    2009. The defendant was faced with the uphill task of obtaining more evidence in
                    a country which was neither open nor accessible to foreigners and mindful that
                    securing the assistance of Goh if the claims went to trial was highly improbable
                    (as he had sued the defendant and it no longer had his original
                    documents).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     On Ong’s recommendation, the
                    defendant’s management decided to explore the possibility of settling the
                    claims with the consignees. Ong was given the mandate to settle the claims at
                    40% of the total sum insured. The consignees had appointed as their
                    representative Zaw Win (see [5]) so Ong
                    contacted him in May 2009 to negotiate which negotiations eventually led to the
                    settlement sum. The settlement sum in actual fact amounted to 46% of the total
                    sum insured which was US$1.6m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     In cross-examination, Ong testified that the
                    consignees had given prior notification to MMCL of the destruction of the goods
                    but the latter failed to inform Webster in turn and/or to obtain the
                    defendant’s consent for the goods to be destroyed. Consequently, MMCL
                    acted without authority in witnessing the burning of the goods and, had the
                    consignees sued the defendant, may well have prejudiced the defendant’s
                    position thereby.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     I should make one observation at this juncture
                    – the defendant’s Release and Subrogation Form dated 25 November
                    2009 agreeing to accept the settlement sum was signed not only by the consignees
                    but also by the shipper, Idea Giant Ltd. Ong was not questioned on this curious
                    fact but presumably it was because (according to A&amp;P’s letter dated 18
                    March 2009) the shipper had title to sue as the consignees had assigned to the
                    shipper all nine policies on 26 June 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Notwithstanding the misgiving and doubts
                    voiced by Goh over the propriety of the settlement sum and its payment to the
                    shipper and the consignees (see <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above),
                    Ong confirmed when questioned by the court, that no party had come back to the
                    defendant to make any claims under the policies after the settlement sum was
                    paid.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The submissions </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Counsel for the plaintiff had made much of the
                    fact (both at the trial and in his closing submissions) that as the defendant
                    had drafted the LOA, the <em>contra proferentum</em> rule
                    should apply against the defendant in the event there was any ambiguity in its
                    terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     The plaintiff’s closing submissions
                    complained that the defendant’s conduct had been unconscionable and that
                    in drafting the LOA, the defendant had taken advantage of Goh. The plaintiff
                    argued that to interpret the LOA to mean the plaintiff would only be paid when
                    the defendant had settled the claim was grossly unfair to the plaintiff as the
                    act of settling the claims was entirely an act within the defendant’s
                    control. It would also render the quantum of the plaintiff’s remuneration
                    uncertain. The plaintiff submitted that it could not have been the
                    parties’ intention that either of them could rely on its own breach of
                    duty to obtain a benefit therefrom. Finally, the plaintiff alleged that this
                    suit arose because of the defendant’s unilateral act of settling a claim
                    which it could have legally rejected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The defendant submitted (which submission I
                    accept and which Goh had conceded to during cross-examination) that under the
                    terms of the LOA, there was no obligation or legal requirement on its part to
                    refer to the plaintiff where the settlement of claims and its quantum was
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The defendant also submitted that the
                        <em>contra proferentum</em> rule would not apply. It
                    was pointed out that Goh was given every opportunity at the August meeting to
                    read and make amendments to the LOA when it was drafted. Contending that
                    drafting of the document was a joint effort, the defendant submitted that the
                        <em>contra proferentum</em> rule has no application
                    here, citing <em>The Interpretation of Contracts</em> by
                    Kim Lewison (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed, 2004) at p
                    209 and the cases <em>Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Malaysia Mining Corp
                        Bhd</em> [1989] 1 All ER 785 and <em>Levison and others
                        v Farin and others</em> [1978] 2 All ER 1149. The defendant asserted
                    that in any case, there was no ambiguity in the terms of the LOA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     The issues for determination are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_a"></a>(a)     Was the plaintiff entitled to its
                        commission of 10% and 5% bonus commission?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_b"></a>(b)     Is the plaintiff entitled to the balance
                        commission it now claims?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_c"></a>(c)     If the answer to (a) and/or (b) is in the positive, when
                        was the plaintiff entitled to be paid?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     I had earlier (at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> to <a href="#p1_43">[43]</a>) made certain
                    observations on Goh’s testimony. On the whole, I did not find him a
                    credible witness. I disagree with his counsel’s description that Goh
                    “is a straight talking honest businessman” who knew nothing about
                    contracts and who had no hand or input in the drafting of the LOA. Goh prided
                    himself on being a successful businessman and was certainly not naive – he
                    should not be allowed to contradict himself when it suited his purpose. Even if
                    he gave no input on other aspects of the LOA, he most certainly would have given
                    his views on his remuneration and when he would be paid. I prefer the testimony
                    of the defendant’s witnesses Tan, Teo and Ong, who came across as far more
                    reliable and credible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     As stated earlier (at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>), Goh had no idea of how claims under marine insurance
                    policies could be repudiated. I entertain little doubt that had the defendant
                    repudiated the claims based only on Goh’s Burmese documents (which he
                    claimed they could), it was highly unlikely they would have succeeded had the
                    consignees sued them in Singapore. I need only highlight one instance of
                    Goh’s lack of knowledge/expertise of the burden of proof needed to
                    successfully reject marine insurance claims. Tee had posed the following
                    question to Goh in his email dated 26 November 2008 referred to at [20]) in reply to Goh’s earlier email of
                    the same day:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">With due respect, I wish I could turn down the claim based on the
                        translation of the law and the comments given by the retired judge provided
                        by you. And that the adjuster would share our view. You mentioned I could
                        show the letter to the adjuster or the claimant? In the meeting you
                        mentioned that I could show the letter to the adjuster, can I show it to the
                        claimant as you are confident that they will withdraw the claim when they
                        see this letter. If that is the case, I will show the letter to the
                        claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In his email reply three days later, Goh did not give an affirmative
                    answer to Tee; instead he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…If your strategy is to work with M/s Webster the adjuster to
                        reject the claim in total, then you can show to the adjuster that SLORC law
                        &amp; the Retired Judge letter with the hope they would advise you that the
                        claim is not payable. Once the claim is not payable from the Adjuster point,
                        that what is the need to show to the claimant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The SLORC Law &amp; the letter from the Retired Judge can stand the
                        requirements of the courts in Singapore when you reject the
                        claim…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     In its letter dated 23 September 2008 to the
                    defendant, Webster had set out the events leading to the consignees’
                    claims. One premise if not the entire premise for Goh’s bold assertion
                    that the defendant could reject the claims was the information Goh had received
                    from his Myanmar sources that there had been no flooding in the area where the
                    goods were stored upon their arrival from Singapore. He had also received the
                    tidal tables of Myanmar in May 2008 from his sources. What Goh completely
                    overlooked was the fact that cyclone Nargis caused almost continuous rainfall
                    lasting 24 hours in Myanmar including the material areas. The goods came into
                    contact with rain, and not seawater, due to poor storage and or inadequate
                    packing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Consequently, it was reasonable and indeed
                    prudent of the defendant to decide it should negotiate with the consignees and
                    reach an out-of-court settlement with the latter which it did. In this regard,
                    it bears remembering (which the plaintiff obviously did not) that the consignee
                    Malikha had engaged Singapore solicitors to pursue its claim and the defendant
                    on its part also had a firm of shipping lawyers as its advisers. I had earlier
                    (at <a href="#p1_54">[54]</a>) alluded to the advice of A&amp;P
                    where they set out the many gaps in the evidence that the defendant needed to
                    plug should it decide to contest the consignees’ claims in
                court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     It would be appropriate at this juncture to
                    take a closer look at the correspondence between the defendant and Webster as
                    well as at A&amp;P’s letter dated 18 March 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     First, I refer to Webster’s letter dated
                    23 September 2008. Webster’s letter was based on information it had
                    received from its surveyors (presumably that would be MMCL). Webster advised
                    that Myanmar has four ports which included Asia World Port (“Asia
                    Port”) and Myanmar International Terminal Thilawa (“MITT”)
                    which were the only two ports at which the consignees’ goods were
                    discharged. All warehouses in Myanmar are owned and controlled by the Myanmar
                    Port Authority/the government. Both ports were then open yards. Webster’s
                    surveyors could not comment on how the containers which held the goods were
                    stacked in the container yard to which the surveyors had no access. What the
                    surveyors were certain of was that the containers were stored at the open yard.
                    The goods which comprised coffee powder, malt cereal and creamers appeared to be
                    packed in plastic bags and placed into cardboard boxes or bagged while the
                    consignment of foils was shipped bare. Because of the long holiday in Myanmar
                    between 12 and 21 April 2008 due to a water festival, cargo owners had to wait
                    their turn for customs clearance after 22 April 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     One day before the cyclone struck Myanmar, the
                    public was given warning in the local newspaper. On 2 May 2008, there was
                    continuous rainfall from 11pm until 8am or 9am of 3 May 2008. On 3 May 2008, the
                    government of Myanmar declared five divisions (including Yangon) as disaster
                    zones. As Myanmar does not have independent health authorities, the department
                    head of the divisional health in Yangon issued all the destruction certificates
                    for the cargo. The cargo was wet. In the case of the foils, they came into
                    contact with dirty water while the coffee and related items were wet presumably
                    from the flooding that took place at Asia Port where the waters rose to 1.5 to 2
                    feet. (There were no records of flooding at MITT). The surveyors estimated
                    damage to be 40%. Salvage was not possible because the cargo emitted a bad
                    odour. Moreover, the Myanmar authorities were reluctant and in fact rejected the
                    surveyors’ request for salvage. Laboratory test of the goods showed no
                    seawater was present but the cargo was wet, presumably due to rainwater contact
                    at the open yard. Further, Webster understood from the representative of Malikha
                    (Zaw Win) who met with Webster on 25 November 2008 that not all government
                    bodies in Myanmar issued documents with their letterheads.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     At this juncture, I need to digress and look
                    at the legal opinion rendered by Hlaing (see [36]) upon which Goh had advised the defendant that the claims
                    of the consignees could be rejected. Needless to say, had the consignees sued in
                    Singapore, Hlaing would have been a most material witness for the defendant.
                    Hlaing’s undated opinion was part of Goh’s exhibit in his AEIC.
                    Hlaing pointed out that not all the goods were affected by typhoon Nargis
                    particularly when the two ports Asia Port and MITT were not the main areas
                    affected. He opined there was insufficient proof and no supporting documents
                    that the goods supposedly damaged were actually destroyed. Hlaing doubted
                    whether proper procedure was adopted in the destruction of the goods as he
                    questioned the instructions of a township medical officer in this case to
                    destroy the goods when the SLORC required the goods to be first examined and
                    analysed in a laboratory and the goods surveyed by a licensed surveyor followed
                    by the rendering of a chemical assay report. Hlaing noted that there was no
                    documentation to show that the medical officer’s report (that the goods
                    were contaminated) and his directive to destroy the goods (to stop the spread of
                    disease) were supported by his superiors and other authorised personnel.
                    Further, there were no independent witnesses confirming that the goods were
                    indeed destroyed by the police force and fire brigade members.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Next, I turn to A&amp;P’s letter dated
                    18 March 2009. It was clear therefrom that the defendant needed to do
                    considerably more groundwork should it decide to repudiate the consignees’
                    claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The defendant’s solicitors noted that
                    apart from what Goh said, there was no evidence of what the proper procedure in
                    Myanmar was for the destruction of the goods, let alone that the burning
                    exercise on 28 to 30 May 2008 was carried out without such proper procedures.
                    The position taken by Webster and MMCL (which seemed to favour the consignees)
                    was completely contradicted by the stand taken by Goh and unless the defendant
                    accepted at face value what Goh reported, the defendant’s solicitors had
                    nothing to rely on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The defendant’s solicitors requested the
                    defendant to look for investigators to verify the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_a"></a>(a)     the movement of the goods after
                        discharge from the vessels until their alleged
                    destruction;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_b"></a>(b)     how
                        the goods were stored after discharge;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_c"></a>(c)     the actual condition of Asia Port and MITT in the week of
                        2 May 2008 as well as the weather during that period;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_d"></a>(d)     in relation to the destruction of the
                        goods, the authenticity of the documents said to be issued by the Department
                        Head of Divisional Health, Yangon division, the Shwe Pyi Tahr police station
                        and the township’s fire services camp (where the goods were
                        burnt);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_e"></a>(e)     the
                        procedure and documentary requirements for moving cargo from MITT and Asia
                        Port; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_75-p2_f"></a>(f)     the
                        allegations made by Goh in his report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     As was pointed out earlier (at <a href="#p1_57">[57]</a>) as well as in the defendant’s
                    solicitors’ letter, the conduct of Webster’s Myanmar agents MMCL in
                    witnessing the burning of the goods would have prejudiced the defendant. It
                    should be noted that a representative from the consignees was also present when
                    the goods were destroyed, in the persons of Bay Dar and Miyint Lwin, who were
                    directors of SSL and Malikha respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Legally, it would have been difficult for the
                    defendant to disavow the conduct of MMCL whose Captain Min Sein attended the
                    burning operation. Even worse, it appeared that MMCL had on 26 May 2008, without
                    the prior knowledge of Webster/the defendant, written to Malikha offering to
                    “witness on behalf of our principals in case you destroy the
                    cargo” and rendered its “certificate of destruction” to
                    Malikha on 2 June 2008. MMCL failed to alert its principal Webster on 26 May
                    2008 of the authorities’ intention to destroy the goods. In the survey
                    report of MMCL dated 18 June 2008 addressed to Webster, Captain Min’s
                    excuse for not objecting to the burning of all the goods was the refusal of the
                    health inspector (presumably Zaw Win) to allow Captain Min to sort out and
                    remove the bags which were not wet or had unpleasant odour. Zaw Win had
                    indicated the permission had to be obtained from higher authorities and Captain
                    Min must be prepared to accept responsibility for the consequences (which he
                    obviously was not).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The defendant was thus faced with the daunting
                    task of verifying the information/documents set out in <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a> above in a country which has a reclusive government. There
                    was not only lack of documentation but also lack of transparency in the manner
                    in which the goods were surveyed, condemned and purportedly destroyed.
                    Consequently, I accept the defendant’s submission that if the defendant
                    had repudiated the claims on the strength of the plaintiff’s Burmese
                    documents, the documents would not have stood up to scrutiny in court when
                    challenged by the defendant’s insured. At best, as Goh conceded the
                    plaintiff’s Burmese documents suggested that the procedure for destroying
                    the goods were suspicious, not fraudulent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     I can imagine the uphill task the defendant
                    would face had it been sued by one or both consignees in a Singapore court. The
                    defendant would have no answer if the consignees were to allege (as it would
                    most likely do) that the defendant had acquiesced in the destruction of the
                    goods and witnessed its total loss in the presence of Captain Min from MMCL
                    representing Webster, who in turn represented the defendant, at the burning
                    operation. I cannot imagine that a court would be sympathetic towards the
                    defendant for the predicament that was caused by its claims adjuster’s
                    Myanmar agent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Consequently, it is not surprising that the
                    defendant decided to negotiate a commercial settlement with the consignees
                    rather than face them in a court of law. I note in this regard that the goods by
                    the estimate of Webster were only damaged to the extent of 40% whereas the
                    settlement sum equated to 46% of the insured sum. Factoring in legal costs had
                    the claim come to court, the extra 6% paid by the defendant over and above the
                    40% damage was a small price to pay. The court had clarified with Teo that the
                    consignees made their claims on a total loss basis but the defendant settled and
                    paid on a partial loss basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Having reviewed the evidence in court, I would
                    answer the questions posed in <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> above as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_a"></a>(a)     the plaintiff was entitled to its
                        claim of 10% commission but not its claim of 5% bonus
                    commission;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        plaintiff is not entitled to the balance sum claimed of $182,715.87;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_81-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        plaintiff was entitled to be paid its commission only after the defendant
                        reached agreement with the consignees on the settlement sum in June
                        2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     On the clear and unambiguous wording of the
                    LOA at [10], (to which the <em>contra proferentum</em> rule has no application) the
                    plaintiff was entitled to be paid upon legal completion of the claims. In the
                    insurance industry, claims are paid either pursuant to judgments in court
                    proceedings or when amicably settled following negotiations or settled out of
                    court <em>ie</em>.when the insurer closes its file.
                    Goh’s interpretation (that his entitlement to be paid accrued after he
                    completed his investigations) was without basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The plaintiff was not entitled to a bonus
                    payment under clause (ii) of the LOA because Goh did not achieve a conclusion of
                    the claims within 90 days from his appointment on 1 August 2008. The defendant
                    had in effect overpaid the plaintiff $52,464.95.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Based on the evidence adduced from Goh (see
                        <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a> above), the plaintiff is not
                    entitled to the balance of its claim of $182,715.87. The defendant’s
                    settlement of the consignees’ claims at US$770,000 (see <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above) saved the defendant $1,049,929.89. Goh
                    was not entitled to make the plaintiff’s claim based on the insured sum of
                    $2,165,798.90 as he had done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Consequently, the plaintiff’s claim for
                    $182,715.87 is dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed on a standard
                    basis unless otherwise agreed.</p>
