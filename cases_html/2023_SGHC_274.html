An email chain is in fact a succession of emails each of which pulls along with it the emails that had previously been sent.

For privacy reasons I do not reproduce the email addresses in this judgment but instead describe them. The email address used in connection with the First Email Chain is stated to be the email address for communication to RBI in O&amp;B’s engagement letter, although the domain is “rbworld” and not specifically that of RBI. As far as communicating with O&amp;B is concerned, I assume it to be associated with RBI given its mention in the engagement letter. I will refer to it as the RB World Email Address. Some of the emails from the RB World Email Address to representatives of O&amp;B attached various documents. These emails, and their attachments, related to the RB Family Trust (the “Email Exchange”). Along with six additional attachments, the Email Exchange was forwarded from the RB World Email Address to Mr and Mrs Bothra’s son, Mr Harsh Bothra (“Mr Harsh”),

Legal advice privilege rests on a statutory footing. The principal statutory provisions are ss 128 and 131 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (“the EA”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Section 128(1) of the EA provides: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No advocate or solicitor is at any time permitted, unless with his or her client’s express consent, to disclose any communication made to him or her in the course and for the purpose of his or her employment as such advocate or solicitor by or on behalf of his or her client, or to state the contents or condition of any document with which he or she has become acquainted in the course and for the purpose of his or her professional employment, or to disclose any advice given by him or her to his or her client in the course and for the purpose of such employment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Evident from the wording of this provision is that it applies only where the disclosure of relevant communications or information is <span class="font-italic">by the </span><span class="font-italic">advocate or solicitor</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Section 131(1) of the EA provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No one may be compelled to disclose to the court any confidential communication which has taken place between him or her and his or her legal professional adviser unless he or she offers himself or herself as a witness, in which case he or she may be compelled to disclose any such communications as may appear to the court necessary to be known in order to explain any evidence which he or she has given, but no others.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 These sections drew upon and reflected the common law at the time of their enactment. Moreover, common law principles that are not inconsistent with the EA may either apply directly or inform the interpretation of the EA, in so far as they do not contradict any provision in it and are consistent with the purposes of the EA and of relevant or analogous provisions contained within it: see s2(2) of the EA and my discussion of the case law in <span class="font-italic">Mah Kiat Seng v Attorney</span><span class="font-italic">-General and others</span> [2022] 3 SLR 890 at [49]–[53]. For this reason, our courts continue to consider developments in modern case law in other common law jurisdictions concerning the common law principle of legal advice privilege.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The party asserting privilege bears the burden to prove the facts from which privilege is said to arise: <span class="font-italic">Boey Chun Hian (by his guardian and next friend, Boey Ghim Huat) v Singapore Sports Council (Neo Meng Yong, third party</span>) [2013] SGHCR 15<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [15]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Legal advice privilege supports the core value of access to justice by protecting the confidentiality of communications with lawyers whether in the course of seeking or receiving legal advice. Without it, persons might be least able to seek legal advice when they most need it, that is to say when they are in a legal “hole” and need a lawyer’s help to clamber out of it. At the same time, there is a public interest in evidence being available to the court in adjudicating disputes. The law relating to legal advice privilege strikes a balance between these two public interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Legal advice privilege protects communications for the purpose of  seeking or receiving legal advice. It protects such a communication as a whole. Thus, if it protects an email then it protects the documents attached to that email sent by the client to the lawyer, even if those documents are copies of documents that were created earlier for purposes other than seeking legal advice. However, the fact that a document or a copy of it is subsequently sent to a lawyer for the purpose of seeking legal advice does not clothe with privilege the original documents as they existed in the client’s possession. Depending on the purpose for which the originals were created they may not be privileged and may be discoverable separately.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The next situation is one where an otherwise privileged communication was in turn forwarded to a third party. This raises two further questions. The first is whether that further communication is privileged. The second is whether if it is not privileged, the further communication has deprived the original privileged communication of its privileged status. Whether the further communication is itself privileged depends on the purpose for which it is made. For example, a company that receives advice may circulate it or parts of it <span class="font-italic">internally</span> to those who have an interest to receive it. Further circulation within the group of persons having an interest to receive it does not amount to a waiver of privilege: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, the English Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Gotha </span><span class="font-italic">City v Sotheby’s</span> <span class="font-italic">and another </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Gotha</span>”) [1998] 1 WLR 114 at 118A–118E, <span class="font-italic">per</span> Staughton LJ.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 External communications are another matter. A communication to Y by X of legal advice received by X may well not be a privileged communication <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> Y, yet that would not entitle others to seek discovery of it, because X’s legal advice privilege may remain intact against the rest of the world. The textbook example approved in <span class="font-italic">Gotha</span> at 118H–119A contrasts a man reading out legal advice received by him on the evening news with his limited sharing of it with six friends. In the latter case, if any of the friends sue him, he cannot assert privilege, but he may continue to do so against others seeking discovery of the advice he received.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The top email of the First Email Chain was sent from Mr Bothra to Mr Mishra using the RB World Email Address. This top email did not seek legal advice. It does not contain legal advice. It did not forward legal advice previously received by RBI from O&amp;B. This was similarly so for the top email of the Second Email Chain. What the top emails essentially forwarded were emails previously sent to O&amp;B containing attachments. Such attachments were consequently attached to the top emails as well (and in the case of the First Email Chain, additional documents were attached to the top email). It appears to be the documents attached which the Private Trustees consider to be relevant to their intended examination of Ms Wong, rather than the body of emails passing to or from O&amp;B and incidentally forwarded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 These top emails do not fall within either ss 128 or 131 of the EA. There is no question of O&amp;B seeking to disclose anything, and so the prohibition in s 128 is not applicable. There is also no person being compelled to disclose their confidential communications with their legal professional adviser and so s 131 is not itself relevant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The next question is whether common law privilege would protect the top emails and the documents attached to them given that (some of) those documents were previously sent to O&amp;B, apparently on RBI’s behalf.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Assuming for the moment that the attachments to earlier emails to O&amp;B were protected by legal advice privilege prior to being sent to Mr Mishra, the question whether privilege protected the top emails would depend principally on why the top emails were sent to Mr Mishra with those attachments. This requires a factual inquiry into whether Mr Mishra was sent them as a member of a group of individuals involved in RBI’s affairs on which O&amp;B was being consulted.  This is where it becomes relevant whether Mr Bothra was an authorised representative of RBI <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>sending the top emails to Mr Mishra, and in turn whether Mr Mishra was an authorised representative of RBI to receive them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The burden is on RBI to prove that Mr Bothra and Mr Mishra were its authorised representatives. In my judgment, RBI has failed to discharge this burden. RBI asserts that Mr Bothra was acting as such repeatedly in its written submissions but fails to substantiate its assertions.

More relevant is Mr Mishra’s evidence that he considered that both of the top emails came from Mr Bothra personally. He asserts that Mr Bothra never informed him that the emails should be kept privileged and/or confidential.

</div> There is force in this point, but I do not need to arrive at a concluded view on this point given my other findings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 However, and for the avoidance of doubt, I do not accept that the attachments were of themselves protected by legal professional privilege. They do not appear to have been prepared for the purpose of seeking legal advice. Thus, other than within the context of emails sent to O&amp;B, they were not privileged, and as such versions of them before they were sent to O&amp;B and versions of them after they were sent to O&amp;B are not privileged. Further, it is a reasonable inference from the nature of the contents of the attachments that what Mr Bothra wanted to send to Mr Mishra were those attachments, as opposed to wanting to share with him the communications <span class="font-italic">per se</span> with O&amp;B. It would likely be the attachments on which Ms Wong might be examined, and not the fact that they were sent to O&amp;B, or the content of exchanges between O&amp;B and Mr Bothra or RBI. Indeed, not all the attachments had even been sent to O&amp;B – the top email in the First Email Chain attached six additional documents.

</div> There is no basis for suggesting that those additional documents should be privileged or inadmissible – sending them to a third party above a trailing email to a lawyer could hardly cloak them with legal advice privilege or impress them with confidentiality.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the Email Chains are impressed with a duty of confidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As I have found above, no legal advice privilege attaches to the top emails and hence to the Email Chains in the hands of Mr Mishra. Notwithstanding, the absence of privilege does not preclude a finding that Mr Mishra received the top email in circumstances where equity should intervene to restrain the use of the preceding emails under the law of confidence. In other words, the question remains as to whether Mr Mishra received the top emails with the understanding that they had forwarded to him documents that had been subject to privilege belonging to RBI and hence that he ought not to use or disclose them further without RBI’s consent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Where the privileged document has come into the hands of third parties, the leading case is the Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Wee Shuo Woon v HT </span><span class="font-italic">SRL</span> [2017] 2 SLR 94 (“<span class="font-italic">Wee Shuo Woon</span>”). In that case, the defendant to an action accessed emails that had been published on the Internet as part of a large trove of material hacked from the computer systems of, among others, a law firm. These emails were undoubtedly communications between the plaintiff and its lawyers and were originally subject to legal advice and/or litigation privilege. The defendant sought to use them in an attempt to strike out parts of the action. The Court of Appeal noted that as the emails had already come into the possession of the opponent, the issue was not one of privilege but of admissibility of evidence. The court considered the circumstances in which the emails were obtained in order to answer the question of whether equity should restrain their use and admission into evidence owing to a breach of confidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Indeed, while privilege presupposes confidentiality, obligations of confidentiality are not dependent on the existence of privilege: see the decision at first instance in <span class="font-italic">HT </span><span class="font-italic">SRL v Wee Shuo Woon </span>[2016] 2 SLR 442 (“<span class="font-italic">HT </span><span class="font-italic">SRL</span>”) at [21].

This affects the question of whether equity should restrain the use and admission of the Email Chains as a breach of confidence. There is an overlap with the inquiry concerning whether the top emails were privileged but it must still be considered separately and this I now do.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">My decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In relation to the First Email Chain, it is accepted that Mr Bothra had used the RB World Email Address on occasion, including on this one.

</div>
</div> This was a bare assertion, and she provided no details of how she in fact involved him if that was what she truly did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 My view that Mrs Bothra’s assertion should be rejected is fortified by the picture that emerged during the oral hearing. Quoting RBI’s counsel, Mrs Bothra was “a housewife”. This explained her reliance on her husband. There was also evidence sufficient to conclude, at least provisionally at this stage of the matter, that RBI had been Mr Bothra’s investment vehicle and that any exercise of restructuring or reorganisation of assets was in fact being driven by Mr Bothra and not Mrs Bothra. Therefore, it was unlikely that she took the initiative to involve Mr Mishra for the purpose of taking legal advice for RBI, and accordingly I reject any argument that Mr Mishra received the top emails in confidence <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> RBI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Further, in relation to the First Email Chain, I accept that nothing was said expressly about keeping the emails privileged or confidential. While continued confidentiality may be implied from the circumstances without any express intimation of it, the circumstances in this case do not support it. Unlike the situation where the forwarded document is, for example, obviously legal advice on a specific and confidential matter, nothing in what was sent to Mr Mishra would have clearly suggested to him that privilege of RBI was in play. Most importantly, I accept that Mr Mishra was not involved in RBI’s affairs or dealings. Nor was Mr Mishra RBI’s authorised representative. Rather, the Email Chains were sent to and received by Mr Mishra in his personal capacity, in connection with Mr Bothra’s affairs generally, as opposed to RBI’s affairs. Even if Mr Bothra’s affairs included what he should do (in view of the claims made against him) with RBI or RBI’s assets, this should not be conflated with RBI’s affairs. In other words, the top email, and the other contents of the Email Chain, were not imparted to or received by Mr Mishra in circumstances that give rise to an obligation of confidentiality owed by him to RBI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In relation to the Second Email Chain, this finding is further supported by the fact that the top email, including the attachment thereto, was sent from Mr Bothra’s Kobian Email Address, an email address unrelated to RBI. Accordingly, the obligation of confidence owed to Mr Bothra cannot be relied on by RBI, nor indeed would it be a shield available to Mr Bothra <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Private Trustees’ investigation of his affairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 I stress that my views do not depend on any identification of RBI with Mr Bothra nor on any lifting of the corporate veil. Those would be questions for another day, if at all.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Accordingly, I do not accept that Mr Mishra received the top emails in confidence <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> RBI. Any duty of confidence owed by Mr Mishra in relation to the top emails, if it arose at all, would be owed to Mr Bothra, as opposed to RBI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 This application does not concern any duty of confidence owed to Mr Bothra, and as far as I am aware Mr Bothra has thus far not sought to object to the use of the documents by the Private Trustees in their investigations of his estate. At least <span class="font-italic">prima </span><span class="font-italic">facie</span>, he would be unlikely to be able to do so successfully, given that they now stand in his shoes, where the matters said to be confidential to him precisely concern the Private Trustees’ investigations of his affairs, as opposed to some other collateral matter. This proposition is in fact consistent with the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Shlosberg</span><span class="font-italic"> v Avonwick Holdings Ltd</span> [2017] 2 WLR 1075 to the effect that a trustee in bankruptcy may take possession of records to which privilege attaches for the discharge of his duties in getting in, realising and distributing the bankrupt’s estate, except that he may not waive the bankrupt’s privilege in taking steps against third parties for the benefit of the bankrupt’s estate. Here, there is no issue of the Private Trustees taking steps against third parties, and indeed the general rule that the Private Trustees may take possession of privileged records for the discharge of their duties applies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 There are two further points that were not fully argued before me. The first point is that the present use of the Email Chains is in a proceeding that does not involve RBI, and so RBI is not in a position to restrain the admission of the Email Chains into evidence. In my view, examining persons with knowledge of a bankrupt’s affairs is a proceeding that belongs in both form and substance within the bankruptcy proceeding. It is not a proceeding against RBI. Thus, at this point no question of admissibility in relation to RBI arises, and it could be said that this application was in any event premature. The second is whether RBI’s bringing this application might indicate that RBI is being used to stymie investigations into Mr Bothra’s affairs, investigations that the Private Trustees are duty-bound to make. This raises the question of “clean hands” in seeking equitable injunctive relief. However, as neither point was fully argued, I have not relied on them in dismissing the application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 To recap, I have assumed for this application that the emails as sent to O&amp;B and the attachments to those emails could be subject to legal advice privilege in favour of RBI. However, when Mr Bothra forwarded them to Mr Mishra that communication was not privileged, nor did Mr Mishra receive such communication under any duty of confidentiality to RBI. These twin conclusions were broadly based on my view of the circumstances under which Mr Bothra communicated with Mr Mishra. In my view neither Mr Bothra nor Mr Mishra were authorised representatives of RBI in connection with the sending and receipt respectively of the top emails. Further, those top emails and their attachments concerned Mr Bothra’s affairs for which he desired Mr Mishra’s assistance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 For these reasons, I dismiss RBI’s application in its entirety. Parties are to seek to agree costs within 14 days of the date of this judgment, failing which they are to file costs submissions limited to three pages each within seven days after that. I will then proceed to determine and fix costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Philip Jeyaretnam <br/>Judge of the High Court </div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Vikram Nair, Foo Xian Fong, Liew Min Yi, Glenna and Ashwin Kumar Menon (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for the claimant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yeo Alexander Lawrence, Han Tiong, Ee Jia Min, and Tan Yen Jee (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the first and second respondents;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chua Sui Tong and Abigail Tang En-Ping (Rev Law LLC) for the third respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
