The second accused person, Muhammad Haikal Bin Abdullah (“Haikal”), was charged under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, for delivering two packets containing a total of not less than 28.22 grams of diamorphine to Saridewi. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 At the conclusion of the joint trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved the charges against the respective accused persons beyond reasonable doubt.

The evidence pertaining to the operations carried out by the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”), the arrests of the two accused persons, the seizure of exhibits, the reports produced by the Forensic Response Team (“FORT”), the analyses of the quantity of diamorphine and deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) were largely uncontroversial and undisputed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 On 17 June 2016, at about 3.35pm, Haikal drove a motorcycle bearing registration number JHH 4015 (“the Motorcycle”) into the carpark of Block 350 Anchorvale Road, Singapore (“Block 350”). After parking, he retrieved a white plastic bag from the Motorcycle and proceeded to the lift of Block 350. He took the lift up to the 17th floor. He met Saridewi on the 17th floor and handed a white plastic bag to her. In return, Saridewi handed him an envelope, with the marking “10.000” on it, to him. The movements of Haikal and Saridewi using the lifts of Block 350 at the material time were captured clearly on the CCTV cameras in the lifts, and this was not disputed when the camera footage was viewed in the course of the trial.

</div> The two then parted ways; Haikal proceeded back to the Motorcycle while Saridewi went back to the unit where she resided, located at #16-143 of Block 350 (“the Unit”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The CNB had received information of the drug transaction that was to take place at Block 350 that afternoon and various CNB officers were deployed at the vicinity in a covert operation. Shortly after riding off from Block 350 on the Motorcycle, Haikal was intercepted and placed under arrest by CNB officers at the junction of Anchorvale Road and Anchorvale Street. The officers recovered in his possession, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, an envelope with the marking “10.000” on it (later marked as “MHA-1”) found to contain cash totalling SGD$10,050 and a brown envelope (later marked as “MHA-2”) found to contain cash totalling SGD$5,500. Three mobile phones found in his possession were seized and sent to FORT for analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Meanwhile, CNB officers arrived at the Unit.

</div> Before the CNB officers could cut through her metal grille gate to effect entry, she opened the door to allow the CNB officers to enter the Unit. In the Unit, various exhibits including packets of crystalline substance, numerous glass tubes, a slab of tablets, numerous empty packets and straws, several unused envelopes, one digital weighing scale, one heat sealer, and a notebook were seized. From the construction site adjacent to Block 350, the CNB officers recovered a white “SKP” plastic bag (later marked as “A1”) containing another white “SKP” plastic bag (later marked as “A1A”), which contained two plastic packets (later marked separately as “A1A1” and “A1A2”), each containing one packet of granular/powdery substance (later marked as “A1A1A” and “A1A2A” respectively). On the ground floor of Block 350, CNB officers recovered, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, two stained packets (later marked as “B1”), some loose brown granular substance (later marked as “C1”), one packet (later marked as “D1”) containing eight packets of crystalline substance (“later marked as “D1A”), one packet containing three packets of granular/powdery substance (“later collectively marked as “D2A”), one packet containing two white straws and five blue straws each containing granular/powdery substance (later collectively marked as “D3A”), and one digital weighing scale. Four mobile communication devices were seized from Saridewi, later marked as “SBD-HP1”, “SBD-HP2”, “SBD- HP3” and “SBD-TAB” respectively, and sent to FORT for analysis. It was not disputed that the integrity and custody of all the exhibits seized from Haikal and Saridewi were not compromised in any way at any point in time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The HSA analysed the drug exhibits and found the quantity of drugs in the exhibits as follows:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">S/N</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Exhibit Marking</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Quantity of Drugs</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">1. </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">A1A1A (1 packet)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Not less than 9.39 grams of diamorphine</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">2. </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">A1A2A (1 packet)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Not less than 18.83 grams of diamorphine</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">3. </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">C1 (loose granular substance)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Not less than 1.77 grams of diamorphine</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">4. </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">D2A (3 packets)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Not less than 0.55 grams of diamorphine</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">5. </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">D3A (7 straws)</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Not less than 0.18 grams of diamorphine </div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The total amount of diamorphine contained in the exhibits listed above was not less than 30.72 grams. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The DNA analyses by the HSA showed, among other things, that Haikal’s DNA profile was found on the exterior and interior surface of exhibit “B1” (the two stained packets). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Seven investigation statements were recorded from Haikal and Saridewi respectively.

This drug transaction arose because Saridewi had placed an order of diamorphine with her supplier, whom she knew as “Bobby” or “Brown”, on 16 June 2016, the day before the transaction. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The Prosecution submitted that there was no break in the chain of exhibits – the white “SKP” plastic bag retrieved along with the two packets of diamorphine inside (A1, A1A1A and A1A2A) was the exact one that Haikal had delivered to Saridewi. It could not be seriously contended that someone else in Block 350 who was alerted to the presence of the CNB had thrown down exhibit A1, because the CNB operation was covert. To reduce the risk of the operation being uncovered, unmarked vehicles were used and CNB officers were dressed in civilian clothes.

Pursuant to the presumption of trafficking in s 17 of the MDA, she was presumed to be in possession of the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. The Prosecution submitted that she had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking with her defence of diamorphine consumption, because the evidence showed that she was not an abuser of diamorphine at the material time at all.

The Prosecution submitted that the opinions of Dr Julia Lam (“Dr Lam”), the defence psychologist, were flawed. Dr Lam opined that Saridewi “might not have the mental ability to give an accurate version of events during the statement taking process because of her mental conditions” and that Saridewi was suffering from persistent depressive disorder and severe amphetamine-type substance use disorder.

Extensive forensic evidence derived from her mobile communication devices showed messages and call exchanges which revealed that she was running a drug trafficking business. An example of such exchanges, the message communication on 4 June 2016 between Saridewi and a customer, Franco, is reproduced as follows:

The evidence would be prejudicial to Saridewi as it might lead the court to find that she had the propensity to traffic controlled drugs, and it had no probative value as it had no relevance to the charge against her.

</div> He opined that she did not fulfil the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Publishing, 5th Ed, 2013) (“DSM-5”) for persistent depressive disorder to be found. Specifically, he was of the opinion that Saridewi did not fulfil diagnostic criterion B, which states that two or more of the following characteristics need to be present to diagnose persistent depressive disorder: (a) poor appetite or overeating; (b) insomnia or hypersomnia; (c) low energy or fatigue; (d) low self-esteem; (e) poor concentration or difficulty making decisions; and (f) feelings of hopelessness. This was because he did not elicit any persistent low self-esteem, feelings of hopelessness or negative cognitions from her. Rather, she reported good concentration and energy levels after consuming methamphetamine, and any appetite loss and sleep disturbances could be confidently attributed to the abuse of methamphetamine.

</div> if the time frames for the tests were altered, the norms based on standardised administration could no longer be used.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 I was not persuaded that Dr Lam’s assessment of Saridewi’s mental state during the statement-recording process and diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder was reliable; I found Dr Jason Lee’s evidence to be more reliable. Firstly, Dr Lam’s assessment was not contemporaneous because she only assessed Saridewi about one and a half years after the statement-taking process. Dr Jason Lee, in contrast, assessed Saridewi on 15 July 2016, which was only about a month after the arrest, and he was in a better position than Dr Lam to obtain a more accurate mental state examination of Saridewi. Secondly, Dr Lam herself conceded that all the depressive symptoms she observed “overlapped a lot” with symptoms of Saridewi’s methamphetamine abuse.

</div>
</div>
</div> This meant that her assessment that Saridewi had persistent depressive disorder was flawed because she had failed to apply the exclusionary criterion to exclude symptoms attributable to the physiological effects of methamphetamine abuse during the period when Saridewi was abusing methamphetamine. Although Dr Lam testified that Saridewi was also having low self-esteem and feelings of sadness and hopelessness in June 2014 before she relapsed to taking methamphetamine, she conceded that during the period when Saridewi was on methamphetamine, her dysfunction was also a function of her methamphetamine abuse.

</div> Thirdly, Dr Jason Lee’s assessment was supported by the accounts of Saridewi’s mother and sister, who reported that Saridewi, other than her weight and appetite loss (attributable to her consumption of methamphetamine), “was otherwise not noted to have the features suggestive of a mood or psychotic disorder, or to have decline [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] in her functioning in recent times”.

</div> Lastly, the tests administered by Dr Lam were all based on Saridewi’s self-reporting, and the validity indices that could possibly reveal the degree of malingering were not included in her report. The reliance on BIS-11 to demonstrate that Saridewi had significant impulse control issues at the time of the statement-taking process was also flawed as the test was only suitable for finding the current mental state of the patient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In relation to Dr Lam’s diagnosis of substance abuse disorder, there was no evidence as to how the disorder affected Saridewi’s mental state in the statement-taking process.

Dr Rachel Chan testified that there were two components in an assessment for drug withdrawal – an objective assessment and a subjective assessment. Under the subjective assessment, she asked Saridewi questions stated in the standard form;

The Prosecution was correct to point out that Saridewi could not claim that her mental state was impaired during her statement-recording in the face of evidence of her clear lucidity and conscious deliberations in deciding how to craft her statements in a way beneficial to herself. She conceded that she had lied in her investigation statements about her drug trafficking activities because she had been aware of the severe punishments for drug trafficking.

Firstly, there was no mention of her rate of consumption of diamorphine at all in all of the statements taken from her, spanning from the date of arrest, 16 June 2016, to 30 June 2017 (which was not unexpected since there was no indication that she had already started consuming diamorphine in the first place).

</div> In this regard, Saridewi claimed on the stand that she consumed heroin three days before her arrest. However, her claim in court was clearly an afterthought as analysed in the context of all the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The Defence pointed out that the instant urine test (“IUT”) result showed that there was an amount of 79.64ng/mL of opiates in Saridewi’s urine, although the result was a negative reading. Saridewi pointed to this trace amount to support her claim that she did consume diamorphine. She explained that only traces of opiates remained in her urine because she had smoked diamorphine three days prior to the IUT, and because she had used “anti-detection methods” involving drinking plenty of fluid and taking laxatives to avoid being detected.

</div> However, Chan Si Jia, an analyst with the HSA, testified with certainty that the only conclusion to be drawn from the result was that there were 79.64 nanograms of opiates per millilitre of urine, but it could not be confirmed that the 79.64 nanograms per millilitre was morphine. It could not be said that there was morphine present in the urine, because the IUT was a general test and there was a possibility of cross-reactivity with the assay used to conduct the test for opiates. The presence of morphine could only be confirmed with a confirmatory test, which was not conducted in producing the IUT results.

</div> Thus, weight should be placed on the HSA analysis instead of the IUT result, and the analysis showed that there was neither codeine nor morphine in Saridewi’s urine. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In light of the numerous inconsistencies in her evidence, I found that Saridewi failed to provide a convincing account of her rate of consumption.  Her allegation of being a severe diamorphine addict was not credible.  More plausibly, she was not consuming diamorphine at all prior to her arrest, which was her account as recounted in her statements and provided to the four doctors who had examined her. The allegation of consumption was <span class="font-italic">ex post facto</span>, created to exonerate herself from the charge, and her alleged accounts were conveniently designed to fit the objective evidence. To work around the fact that there was no diamorphine detected in the HSA urine tests, she had to state a low rate of consumption. In order to account for the large amounts of diamorphine found in her possession, she claimed that it was in anticipation of an escalation in consumption. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Contrary admissions in statements and during investigations </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The Prosecution aptly pointed out that <span class="font-italic">the trial marked the first time</span> that Saridewi made mention of the quality and quantity of diamorphine that she had intended to keep for her own consumption. I agreed that her allegation made during the trial, that she had intended to keep the packet of better quality (A1A2A) for her own consumption, was yet another contrived afterthought conceived to apportion the amount of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking below the quantity attracting the death penalty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 If Saridewi had genuinely intended to traffic only a much smaller quantity of diamorphine while excluding what was purportedly the “better quality” diamorphine which she intended to stockpile for her own consumption, it would have been perfectly reasonable for her to have sought to put this explanation forward in her statements, or during her assessments by the various doctors. She had the opportunity to raise this account in the six statements taken from her from 16 June 2016 to 14 November 2016, but she did not do so. In her cautioned statement, she only stated that her intention was “that some [were] for selling and some [were] for consumption”.

In that case, the Court of Appeal held that the judge was entitled to draw an adverse inference against the accused person charged with drug trafficking for not mentioning his defence of consumption in his long statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In cases where an adverse inference has been drawn against an accused person for failing to mention any fact subsequently relied upon in his defence, there was a complete omission of a defence or an inclusion of an utter lie (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Saravanan Chandaram</span> [2017] SGHC 262 at [52]; <span class="font-italic">Kwek Seow Hock </span>at [19]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Fazali bin Mohamed</span> [2018] SGHC 23 at [29]; <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BLV</span> [2017] SGHC 154 at [87]; <span class="font-italic">Yap </span><span class="font-italic">Giau Beng Terence v Public Prosecutor</span> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 855 at [38]). It is less clear whether an adverse inference should be drawn in a case where an accused person did mention his defence but left out specific details. In any case, a court is entitled to disbelieve the evidence of a witness without having to draw an adverse inference against him for omitting to earlier mention some material fact which, if disclosed, would be in his favour (<span class="font-italic">Kwek Seow Hock</span> at [20]).

A consideration of all the evidence, especially her manifestations of stress at the non-receipt and possible reduction of maintenance payments and the enormous expense needed to sustain her methamphetamine consumption, showed that Saridewi had limited financial means.

</div> The prosecution submitted that these lies were corroborative evidence of guilt if the criteria established in <span class="font-italic">R v Lucas</span> [1981] QB 720 (“<span class="font-italic">Lucas</span>”), classically referred to as the <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> criteria, were met. <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> was approved in <span class="font-italic">Ng Beng Siang and others v Public Prosecutor</span> [2003] SGCA 17 at [52]. The <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> criteria are that: (a) the lie told out of court must be deliberate; (b) it must relate to a material issue; (c) the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; and (d) the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I agreed with the Prosecution that Saridewi’s lies corroborated her guilt, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that she had purchased the two packets of diamorphine delivered by Haikal for the purpose of trafficking, as part of her drug trafficking business. What she had stated in her statements were clearly shown to be lies told deliberately and consistently to ASP Peh, the recorder of her statements. Besides her outright admission, Saridewi’s drug trafficking business was also clearly evidenced by the communications relating to drug trafficking activities found in Saridewi’s communication devices as well as her handwritten drug trafficking records found in her notebook. The lies related to the material issue of her trafficking activities, and were conceived out of fear that the truth would be discovered, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that she had the two packets of diamorphine in her possession (A1A1A and A1A2A) for the purpose of trafficking. Her fear led her to cover up any previous drug trafficking activity; this was a clear case where the lies were crafted to cover up the truth of the matter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the overall analysis, Saridewi’s defence was materially inconsistent, indicative that it consisted of fabrications and afterthoughts. I was unable to accept that Saridewi had rebutted the presumption in s 17 of the MDA. I found that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that she was in possession of the entire quantity of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, and that she knew that the drugs in question were diamorphine. I was satisfied that the aggregate quantity of diamorphine which was retrieved had been in her possession for the purpose of trafficking.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Haikal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70  Haikal admitted that he had delivered a plastic bag to Saridewi containing “small stones that look[ed] like … the colour of chocolate” on the instructions of one Kunjai,

Since Haikal’s possession of the drugs was admitted and proved, I found that Haikal was presumed to have known the nature of the drugs pursuant to s 18(2) of the MDA. Section 18(2) of the MDA states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The burden is on the accused person to prove that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug on a balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja </span><span class="font-italic">Retnam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2012] 2 SLR 903 at [18]). The court has to assess the accused’s evidence as to his subjective knowledge by comparing it with what an ordinary, reasonable person would have known or done if placed in the situation that the accused was in. If such an ordinary, reasonable person would surely have known or taken steps to establish the nature of the drug in question, the accused would have to adduce evidence to persuade the court that nevertheless he, for reasons special to himself or to his situation, did not have such knowledge or did not take such steps. It would then be for the court to assess the credibility of the accused’s account on a balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 1 SLR 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort</span>”) at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Haikal claimed that he did not know the true nature of the substance he had delivered to Saridewi. His defence was essentially a bare denial. He described his belief of the nature of the substance in various ways, namely as something consumable, food and as medical drugs (see [20] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>). I found that Haikal had not proved, on the balance of probabilities, that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known that exhibit A1 contained diamorphine.

</div> These portions were not central to the analysis of Haikal’s belief as to the nature of the substance delivered to Saridewi. In any case, I found that all the statements recorded from Haikal were accurately recorded and due weight should be accorded to them. Haikal was capable of reading and understanding English but he did not point out any inaccuracies when the statements were being recorded. All the statements were also interpreted to him in Malay, which was the language he chose for the statement recording process. Importantly, Haikal confirmed on the stand, despite correcting the frequency and period of delivery, that he did deliver to Saridewi the same substance in one or two packets, on a total of five or six occasions.

</div> It was also during the trial that Haikal’s alleged belief that he was dealing with medical drugs first surfaced. The belief that he was dealing in food and the belief that he was dealing in medical drugs were clearly inconsistent. When confronted with this inconsistency, Haikal explained that he believed he was dealing with something consumable because he was told the substance was food, and “the word ‘drug’ meant something that [was] to be consumed as a drug”, something that one could obtain from “clinics or hospitals”.

In his re-examination, Haikal stated that it was not explained to him what kind of medical drugs he was dealing with and he thought that it was something that was to be taken when one was in pain or to give strength to the body.

</div> On the other hand, Haikal insisted that the choice of a carpark without anyone around was not because he suspected that he was dealing in something illegal but because he simply did not want anyone to steal the packets upon seeing them.

</div> This explanation defied logic – there were many conventional methods of keeping the packets without anyone seeing them, such as bringing them home. The method of concealing the packets went far beyond just preventing anyone from taking them; the method went towards the prevention of detection of the presence of the packets altogether. There was simply no reason why one would have to go so far to conceal food or medical drugs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The interaction between Haikal and Saridewi further revealed that the substance being dealt with was dangerous and illegal. Although the deliveries were always done at Block 350, Saridewi had never met Haikal at the same location in Block 350 to take delivery from him and Saridewi would inform him of the specific location only when he approached the block.

</div> plainly showed that Haikal knew that he might be in danger when delivering the substance to Saridewi. Haikal could only claim somewhat feebly that he did not know to what extent it was dangerous. Clearly, his own text message spoke volumes of his knowledge that he was engaging in dangerous and illegal activities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 All the circumstances surrounding how the substance was handled, along with the promised remuneration of RM500 to Haikal for each delivery done, made it blatantly obvious that Haikal was dealing with something illegal and was engaged in dangerous activity. An ordinary and reasonable person would have been alerted to the illegality of the substance, and would have enquired further into its nature. The evidence, especially the text message sent on 24 May 2016 and Haikal’s various concessions, showed that he was subjectively alerted to the danger and illegality of the substance he was delivering to Saridewi. I found that Haikal was aware that he was delivering an illegal drug. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Even though he was aware of that he was delivering an illegal drug, Haikal never made any enquiry as to its actual nature. The delivery to Saridewi for which Haikal was arrested was not the first time he had done a delivery for Kunjai. Haikal testified that he had delivered the same substance to Saridewi on a total of five or six occasions.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I therefore concluded that Haikal had failed to rebut the presumption in s 18(2) MDA and he was presumed to have known the nature of the drugs. Considering all the circumstances, I would have found in the alternative that Haikal was wilfully blind as to the nature of the illegal drug he was delivering to Saridewi. A finding of wilful blindness is the inference of actual knowledge that is drawn because it is the only rational and therefore irresistible inference on the facts (<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort</span> at [41]). Counsel for Haikal cited <span class="font-italic">Khor</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Lee v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 201 (“<span class="font-italic">Khor</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Lee</span>”) in support of the proposition that negligence or recklessness did not amount to wilful blindness (at [20]), and in that case, the court found that the appellant’s failure to check the contents of the package constituted only negligence or recklessness. The factual circumstances of <span class="font-italic">Khor</span><span class="font-italic"> Soon Lee</span> were unique and distinguishable from the present case. In that case, the Court of Appeal accepted that the appellant had an established practice of transporting only Erimin, Ketamine, Ice and Ecstasy, and not diamorphine. He had also sought assurances from the person instructing him that the deliveries would not involve diamorphine because he was afraid of the death penalty. Therefore, he had no reason to strongly suspect that the package he delivered contained diamorphine. In those circumstances, the court found that he was only negligent or reckless in not checking the package (at [28]). In contrast, Haikal had been delivering the same substance to Saridewi on five or six occasions, and he did not bother to get any assurance from Kunjai that he would not be delivering diamorphine or any other illegal drug. On the other hand, Haikal knew that it was dangerous for him to deliver the drugs and the activities were conducted in suspicious circumstances, but he did not check on the nature of the substance at all. I found that the high threshold for finding wilful blindness had been crossed, for the only rational inference was that Haikal knew he was likely delivering illegal drugs but turned a blind eye to their nature.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 In my assessment, Haikal had not proved, on the balance of probabilities, that he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known that exhibit A1 contained controlled drugs, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> diamorphine. I did not accept his strained and contrived claims that he thought that exhibit A1 only contained consumable items, medical drugs, or sex enhancement drugs. He knew full well that he was delivering something illegal for Kunjai and he would be paid handsomely for each delivery. He must have been further emboldened as he had managed to evade detection on the previous few occasions when he transported drugs into Singapore. I found that the presumption in s 18(2) MDA had not been rebutted and the Prosecution had proved the charge of trafficking against Haikal beyond reasonable doubt.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sentence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Where an accused person can satisfy the criteria set out in s 33B(2) of the MDA, the court has the discretion not to impose the sentence of death. On the facts, I found that Saridewi’s role was not confined to transporting, sending or delivering the diamorphine, or offering to do so, or doing or offering to do any acts preparatory to or for the purpose of transporting, sending or delivering the diamorphine (commonly collectively known as acts of a courier). Instead, she intended to repack the diamorphine found in her possession for sale to her customers. In any case, the Prosecution did not certify that Saridewi had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities. Thus, as both s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA were not fulfilled, Saridewi was sentenced to the mandatory death penalty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I found that Haikal’s role in delivering the two packets of diamorphine to Saridewi was that of a courier. The Prosecution certified that Haikal had substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities pursuant to s 33B(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA. Therefore, I exercised my discretion and sentenced Haikal to life imprisonment with the mandatory minimum 15 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The evidence established that Saridewi had the 30.72 grams of diamorphine in her possession for the purpose of trafficking, and Haikal had delivered two packets of diamorphine to her. I found that both accused persons had failed to rebut the operative presumptions under the MDA against each of them; in Saridewi’s case, she had not rebutted the presumption in s 17 MDA that she had possessed the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking and in Haikal’s case, he had not rebutted the presumption in s 18(2) MDA pertaining to his knowledge of the nature of the drugs. The Prosecution had proved the respective charges against both accused persons beyond reasonable doubt. I therefore found them both guilty and convicted them on their respective charges. Saridewi was sentenced to suffer the death penalty and Haikal was sentenced to life imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The Prosecution applied for the disposal of the case exhibits as set out in a specific list.
