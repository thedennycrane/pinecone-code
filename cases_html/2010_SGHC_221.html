        Tan Lee Meng J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present dispute between the parties arose as
                    a result of misleading advertisements placed by both parties in Indonesian
                    newspapers with respect to orders made by the Singapore High Court more than six
                    years ago in February 2004. The applicant, PT Makindo, an Indonesian investment
                    bank, applied for an order that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent,
                    Aperchance Co Ltd, a Hong Kong company, be fined for contempt of court. It also
                    sought an order that the 2<sup>nd</sup> respondent, Mr Otto
                    Rodusek, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> respondent, Mr Toh Keng
                    Siong, who are the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent’s only
                    directors be fined or committed to prison for aiding the said
                contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       On 22 November 2003, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent commenced Suit No 1149 of
                    2003/H (“Suit 1149”) against the applicant and three other
                    defendants for, <em>inter alia</em>, the repayment of
                    approximately US$126m. The three other defendants in that action were the
                    applicant’s officers, Rachmiwaty Jusuf, Gunawan Jusuf and Claudine Jusuf
                    (collectively referred to as the “Jusuf
                defendants”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       On 24 November 2003, pursuant to an
                        <em>ex parte</em> application, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent obtained a worldwide Mareva
                    injunction against the applicant and the Jusuf defendants (the “Mareva
                    injunction”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On 23 December 2003, the Jusuf defendants
                    filed two applications. The first application, Summons No 7795 of 2003/Q,
                    was to set aside the Mareva injunction. In the second application, Summons
                    No 7802 of 2003/K, the Jusuf defendants sought the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(i)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">a declaration that the Writ of Summons had not
                            been duly served on the applicant and the Jusuf defendants or, if it had
                            been purportedly served, an order that the purported service be set
                            aside;</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(ii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">an order that paragraph 7 of the Order of Court
                            dated 24 November 2003 granting leave to the
                                1<sup>st</sup> respondent to serve the Writ of
                            Summons on the applicant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
                                3<sup>rd</sup> defendants in Suit 1149 out of
                            jurisdiction be discharged and/or set aside; and</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(iii)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">a declaration that in the circumstances of the
                            case, the Singapore Courts had no jurisdiction over the applicant and
                            the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                            defendants in respect of the subject matter of the claim.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The two Summons filed by the Jusuf defendants
                    were heard by Lai Kew Chai J (“Lai J”) in February 2004.
                    On 27 February 2004, the Mareva injunction and the order for service of the
                    Writ were set aside by Lai J on the ground that the Court had no
                    jurisdiction over the defendants. Lai J, who did not consider the merits of
                    the case, ordered the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent to pay costs to
                    the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent
                    did not appeal against Lai J’s decision. On 3 September 2004, the
                    costs were taxed and the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent was ordered
                    to pay costs of $122,557.48 to the Jusuf defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Advised by its Singapore counsel that
                    Lai J’s orders did not affect its right to pursue its claim in
                    Indonesia, the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent instructed its
                    Indonesian lawyers, M/s Lucas SH &amp; Partners, to make representations to
                    various Indonesian government agencies with respect to the said claim. The
                        3<sup>rd</sup> respondent said that on 11 April 2008,
                    he was informed that the applicant’s representatives had been called for
                    an interview by the authorities. Hence, the respondents asserted that the
                    applicant and the Jusuf defendants were clearly aware that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent intended to pursue its claim for
                    the recovery from them of its monies in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       According to the respondents, the applicant and
                    the Jusuf defendants embarked on a scheme to discredit, embarrass, intimidate
                    and pressure the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent into dropping its
                    claim against them and that this plan involved the starting of a media war
                    against the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent to prejudice it in the
                    eyes of the relevant Indonesian authorities. Whether or not this accusation is
                    true, the applicant published a number of misleading advertisements in Bahasa
                    Indonesia in several Indonesian newspapers including <em>Bisnis
                        Indonesia, Kompas</em> and <em>Kontan</em> in
                    December 2009 and January 2010. The English translation of part of the
                    applicant’s advertisements is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That on 21 November 2003, Aperchance Company Limited has
                        filed a lawsuit to PT Makindo, Gunawan Jusuf, Rachmiwaty and Claudine in the
                        Singapore High Court where as if Aperchance Company Limited has savings
                        deposits in PT Makindo and based on the lawsuit from Aperchance Company
                        Limited, <em>proved after the trial in the Singapore High
                            Court, then on February 27 2004 the Singapore High Court has dismissed
                            the claim filed by Aperchance Company Limited to the entire party and on
                            August 11 2004, the Singapore High Court ordered Aperchance Company
                            Limited to pay compensation costs to PT Makindo, Gunawan Jusuf and
                            Rachmiwaty</em> in the amount of SGD 122,557.48 …. And it
                        turned out that Aperchance Company Limited did not file any legal appeal to
                        the Singapore High Court Verdict. <em>So the Singapore High
                            Court verdict becomes binding and has permanent legal
                            force……</em>..</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Based on the above mentioned facts, then it is proven that Pt Makindo
                            does not have obligation in any form to Aperchance Company Limited and
                            on the contrary, Aperchance Company Limited has acknowledged its
                            obligation to PT Makindo, Gunawan Jusuf and Rachmiwaty by paying the
                            compensation costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The applicant’s claim in its
                    advertisements that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent’s claim
                    in Suit 1149 had been dismissed by the Singapore courts following a trial in
                    2004 was clearly untrue as Lai J had only considered the issue of
                    jurisdiction and not the merits of the case. As for the applicant’s claim
                    that it no longer owed any obligation to repay the monies claimed in that suit
                    to the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent, this was regarded as untrue by
                    the respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The 1<sup>st</sup> respondent
                    retaliated by placing Bahasa Indonesia advertisements, mostly in the same
                    Indonesian newspapers that carried the applicant’s earlier advertisements,
                    between 7 and 11 January 2010. The English translation of part of the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent’s advertisements is as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">IMPEDING AND BLOCKAGE. THE ENTIRE ASSETS/CAPITAL OF PT MAKINDO TBK,
                        RACHMIWATY JUSUF, GUNAWAN JUSUF AND CLAUDINE JUSUF ALL OVER THE WORLD
                        PURSUANT TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE SINGAPORE HIGH COURT NO S 1149/2003/H DATED
                            24<sup>th</sup> NOVEMBER 2003. IN THE CASE BETWEEN
                        APERCHANCE COMPANY LIMITED (the “PLAINTIFF”) AGAINST PT
                        MAKINDO TBK, RACHMIWATY JUSUF, GUNAWAN JUSUF AND CLAUDINE JUSUF (the
                        “DEFENDANTS”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Like the applicant’s advertisements, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent’s advertisements were also
                    misleading as the Mareva injunction in question had been discharged by
                    Lai J on 27 February 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The applicant, who had fired the first salvo
                    in what the respondents termed as “the media war”, claimed that it
                    was “shocked” by the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    respondent’s advertisements. On 20 January 2010, the
                    applicant’s lawyers, Rajah &amp; Tann wrote to the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> respondent to state that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent’s advertisements were
                    calculated to cause serious harm and damage to their client, who would be
                    seeking to “recover substantial damages and reliefs … against [the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent] and its
                directors.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Subsequently, on 18 February 2010, the
                    applicant filed Originating Summons No 190 of 2010/D (“OS
                    190”) on an <em>ex parte</em> basis for leave to
                    make an application for an order of committal for contempt of court against the
                    respondents. The applicant did not disclose its own earlier misleading
                    advertisements to the court. The requisite leave was granted to the applicants
                    on 2 March 2010 and the application was heard on 24 May 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Respondents are liable for Contempt of Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Section 7(1) of the Supreme Court of
                    Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) and O 52 r 1 of the
                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) give the High Court
                    power to punish for contempt of court. The rationale for punishing such contempt
                    has been explained on numerous occasions. In Attorney-General v Times Newspapers
                    Ltd <em>[1974] 1 AC 273</em>, Lord Morris of
                    Borth-y-Gest stated at 302:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In an ordered community courts are established for the pacific settlement
                        of disputes and for the maintenance of law and order. In the general
                        interests of the community it is imperative that the authority of the courts
                        should not be imperilled and that recourse to them should not be subject to
                        unjustifiable interference. When such unjustifiable interference is
                        suppressed it is not because those charged with the responsibilities of
                        administering justice are concerned for their own dignity: it is because the
                        very structure of ordered life is at risk if the recognised courts of the
                        land are so flouted and their authority wanes and is supplanted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The views of Lord Morris were endorsed by the Singapore Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC
                        and others</em> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 518 (“<em>Pertamina</em>”) at [22].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Contempt of court must be proven beyond
                    reasonable doubt: see <em>Pertamina</em> at [35]. Lord
                    Denning MR explained why this is so in In re Bramblevale Ltd <em>[1970] 1 Ch 128 at 137 as follows</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A contempt of court is an offence of a criminal character. A man may be
                        sent to prison for it. It must be satisfactorily proved. To use the
                        time-honoured phrase, it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As the court’s jurisdiction to punish
                    for contempt is draconian in nature, it must be exercised sparingly. In
                        <em>Parashuram Detaram Shamdasani v King- Emperor</em>
                    [1945] 1 AC 264, Lord Goddard observed at 270:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Their Lordships would once again emphasize what has often been said
                        before, that this summary power of punishing for contempt should be used
                        sparingly and only in serious cases. It is a power which a court must of
                        necessity possess; its usefulness depends on the wisdom and restraint with
                        which it is exercised, and to use it to suppress methods of advocacy which
                        are merely offensive is to use it for a purpose for which it was never
                        intended.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In attempting to prove contempt of court on
                    the part of the respondents, the applicant must confine its case for an order of
                    committal to the grounds raised in its Statement filed under O 52
                    r 2(2) of the Rules of Court (“Statement”) because O 52
                    r 5(3) provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Except with the leave of the Court hearing an application for an order of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Mr Davinder Singh SC, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent’s counsel, pointed out that
                    his client did not breach the above-mentioned terms of the Order. He explained
                    in his written submission at para 16(b):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order for the Applicant to succeed, the order will have to be
                        interpreted in a way which flies against its clear and express wording. The
                        order expressly required the 1<sup>st</sup> Respondent to
                        serve copies of it “<em>on all parties in Singapore
                            who were notified of the Mareva Order and/or on which the Mareva Order
                            was served”</em>. Not only was the Order of Court dated
                            27<sup>th</sup> February couched in the past tense
                        (therefore only referring to parties who had already been notified and/or
                        served as of 27 February 2004), it was also limited to parties who were
                        in Singapore. The undisputed evidence is that this was done. In any event,
                        even if (which is denied) there is any ambiguity in the terms of the Order
                        of Court dated 27 February 2004, it will be resolved in favour of the
                        Respondents, thereby precluding any finding that there has been a breach of
                        the order amounting to civil contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Mr Singh is correct because the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent’s then solicitors,
                    M/s Yeo Wee Kiong Law Corporation (“YWK”), had delivered
                    copies of the said Order to Credit Suisse/Credit Suisse First Boston, UBS AG and
                    HSBC Singapore on 5 March 2004. These were the parties in Singapore on whom
                    the Mareva injunction had been served.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Although contempt of court has been described
                    as the Proteus of the legal world and assumes an almost infinite diversity of
                    forms (see the oft-cited article by Joseph Moskovitz, "<em>Contempt of Injunctions, Civil and Criminal</em>" (1943) 43 Colum
                    L Rev 780 at p 780), acts of contempt are generally classified as acts
                    that scandalise the courts or interfere with the course of
                justice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In the present case, the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent did not scandalise the court as it
                    did not impugn the impartiality, integrity or independence of the judiciary.
                    Neither did it interfere with the administration of justice. The misreporting of
                        <em>continuing</em> proceedings may, depending on
                    circumstances, be a contempt of court if further proceedings are likely to be
                    prejudiced or if this effect was intended by the misreporting but different
                    considerations arise when the proceedings in question have already ended. If a
                    judgment is misrepresented in a way that injures the reputation of one of the
                    parties to the action, the remedy open to the injured party is, without more, to
                    sue for defamation. In <em>Dunn v Bevan; Brodie v
                        Bevan</em> [1922] 1 Ch 276, Sargant J explained at
                    285:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me that applications for alleged contempt ought to be very
                        carefully scrutinised, and that the Court ought not in any way to enlarge
                        the jurisdiction or apply it to matters which are outside the well
                        established lines. It is suggested … that there is a third form of
                        contempt, not consisting either in scandalising the Court or in interfering
                        with the course of justice; and that that form of contempt consists in a
                        misrepresentation of the judgment of the Court and of the proceedings in
                        Court for the purpose of injuring one of the parties. In my judgment there
                        is not such a third class of contempt …. <em>It seems
                            to me that if the proceedings in a Court are ended, then, unless there
                            is an attack on the Court itself, the mere making of statements as to
                            the proceedings must be dealt with by the ordinary law of libel or
                            slander if they are misrepresentations and go beyond what is legally
                            permissible</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The facts in <em>Dunn v
                        Bevan</em> bear some resemblance to the present proceedings before
                    this court. In that case, the plaintiffs, who were members of a trade union,
                    instituted proceedings against the defendants, the Executive Council of the
                    union, to prevent them from proceeding on the result of certain ballots which
                    had been improperly conducted. Sargant J, who restrained the defendants
                    from acting on the result of the ballots, absolved the defendants from the
                    charges of fraud brought against them. The Executive Council sent to its members
                    a circular letter which was not in every respect accurate. It was erroneously
                    stated that the charges brought by the plaintiffs had been withdrawn when there
                    had been no such withdrawal. There were other inaccuracies. In response to this
                    circular, the plaintiffs issued their own circular and suggested in it that the
                    defendants had not been cleared of fraud. The defendants sought an injunction to
                    restrain the issuance of the circular on the basis that it was a contempt of
                    court. In making it clear that the issue of contempt of court did not arise,
                    Sargant J pointed out (at 287) that if the court was “to be burdened with
                    examining statements of this kind between rival parties as to what exactly took
                    place in proceedings in <em>an action which has come to an end
                        and has been terminated by a formal judgment</em>, <em>the Court might</em> for many a long day be occupied with such
                    applications, and <em>have its burdens very considerably
                        increased without any good result”</em> (emphasis added).
                    Sargant J added (at 284) that as he had already given judgment in the
                    action, the Court ought not to trouble itself with the matter unless it was
                    absolutely compelled to do so, as would be the case if the report scandalised
                    the court by making attacks on the judge who presided at the
                trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In the present case, the proceedings in Suit
                    1149 ended more than six years ago on 27 February 2004. As such, the court
                    should not trouble itself with the misleading advertisements of both parties,
                    and especially so when the applicant can sue the respondents for defamation.
                    After all, an order of committal is regarded as a measure of last resort and
                    such an order should not be sought when there are other reasonable alternatives:
                    see <em>Danchevsky v Danchevsky</em>
                    [1975] Fam 17. This is also set out in <em>Singapore
                        Civil Procedure 2007</em> (G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell
                    Asia, 2007) at para 52/1/6:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Remedy of last resort/other remedies</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The general principle is that if a reasonable alternative to committal
                        proceedings exist, that should be used first. The courts commit a person to
                        prison for contempt only after other options have been exhausted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     At this juncture, two cases relied on by the
                    applicant will be considered. To begin with, the applicant relied on <em>Pertamina</em> for its assertion that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent thwarted and frustrated the
                    purpose of the Mareva injunction in February 2004. In that case, X obtained a
                    Mareva injunction in Singapore against Y. Exception 2 of this injunction did
                    "not prohibit [Y] from dealing with or disposing of any of [its] assets in the
                    ordinary and proper course of business" but Y was required to "account to [X]
                    weekly for the amount of money spent in that regard". X’s Singapore
                    lawyers were informed on 26 January 2005 that funds intended for Y’s
                    course of business in Hong Kong would be transferred from a Singapore bank to
                    Dah Sing Bank in Hong Kong. Y made it clear that the disclosure was pursuant to
                    Exception 2 of the Singapore injunction and itemised the payments that will be
                    made out of the funds transferred to Hong Kong. X’s Singapore lawyers
                    forwarded the information to X’s Hong Kong solicitor, who quickly applied
                    for and was granted an order to garnish the money transferred by Y to Dah Sing
                    Bank. Y applied for an order of committal against X and its Hong Kong solicitors
                    for contempt of court on, <em>inter alia</em>, the ground
                    that X had thwarted and frustrated the operation of Exception 2 of the Singapore
                    injunction by directly preventing X from dealing with its assets in the ordinary
                    and proper course of business. The Court of Appeal held that X was in contempt
                    of court and that its Hong Kong solicitor had aided and abetted in that
                    contempt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The facts in <em>Pertamina</em> are quite different from those in the present case. In
                        <em>Pertamina</em>, the Mareva injunction was still in
                    force when X tried to undermine it by garnishing money that Y had forwarded to
                    Hong Kong in accordance with Exception 2 of the injunction. This thwarted and
                    frustrated Exception 2 of the injunction. In the present case, the Mareva
                    injunction was lifted six years ago and the applicant’s money has not been
                    siphoned to the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent in breach of the court
                    order that lifted the Mareva injunction. As such, <em>Pertamina</em> is not relevant to the present
                proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Another case relied on by the applicant is
                        <em>Re Bineet Kumar Singh</em> [2003]
                    3 LRI 375. In that case, an Indian sports college’s petition to
                    the court to allow its students to sit for an examination conducted by the
                    appropriate authority was dismissed. The college forged a court order directing
                    the State Government of Maharashtra to conduct the examination for its students.
                    In holding that those college officers responsible for transmitting the
                    fabricated court order to the State Government had acted in contempt of court,
                    the Court held at [6]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Nothing is more incumbent upon the courts of justice than to preserve
                        their proceedings from being misrepresented…. When a person is found
                        to have utilised an order of a court which he or she knows to be incorrect
                        for conferring benefit on persons who are not entitled to the same, the very
                        utilisation of the fabricated order by the person concerned would be
                        sufficient to hold him/her guilty of contempt, irrespective of the fact
                        whether he or she himself or herself is the author of fabrication.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The facts in <em>Bineet</em> are very different from those in the present case. The
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent did not fabricate a Mareva
                    Injunction and he did not cause banks holding the applicant’s money to
                    freeze the latter’s accounts. As such, <em>Bineet</em> is irrelevant to the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Thus far, I have found that the
                        1<sup>st</sup> respondent had complied with the
                    27 February 2004 Order and that if the applicant believed that its
                    reputation has been injured as a result of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    respondent’s advertisements, it should sue the latter for
                    defamation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The respondents relied on yet another ground
                    for dismissing the present application. This concerns the failure of the
                    applicant to serve a copy of the Order of Court dated 27 February 2004 or
                    an order endorsed with the requisite penal notice personally on the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    respondents. The requirement for a penal notice to be personally served is
                    provided for by O 45 r 7 of the Rules of Court. The position is
                    explained in <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em>
                    (Jeffrey Pinsler SC gen ed) Lexis Nexis at para 45/7/2:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Penal notice</b>. The copy of the order must be
                        endorsed with a notice (in form 81) informing the person on whom the copy is
                        served that if he neglects to obey the order within the time specified
                        therein, or, if the order is to abstain from doing an act, that if he
                        disobeys the order, he is liable to process of execution to compel him to
                        obey it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The significance of a penal notice was
                    elucidated in <em>Allport Alfred James v Wong Soon Lan</em>
                    [1988] 2 SLR(R) 520 by Chao Hick Tin JC, who stated at
                    [8]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court’s powers to punish any person for civil contempt are
                        quasi-criminal in nature. <em>Where there is prescribed any
                            procedural step in the exercise of that jurisdiction, that rule should
                            be scrupulously observed and strictly complied with…</em>
                        [T]he rationale for a penal notice is to ensure that the person against whom
                        the order is made fully appreciates the consequences of any
                        non-compliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As the applicant had failed to effect personal
                    service of the 27 February 2004 Order and the requisite penal notice on the
                        2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
                    respondents, its application against them cannot succeed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Finally, it ought to be noted that the
                    respondents also pointed out that the application should be dismissed because
                    the 27 February 2004 Order did not specify a time frame for compliance. As
                    I have held that the 1<sup>st</sup> respondent did not breach
                    the 27 February 2004 Order, this point need not be considered
                    further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     For the reasons stated, the applicant’s
                    application is dismissed with costs.</p>
