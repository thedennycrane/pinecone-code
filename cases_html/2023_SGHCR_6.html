It cannot be disputed that there was no documentary evidence to support this fact. Further, the defendant did not actually say that he had returned the difference of $1,050.00 to the tenant in May 2021 (or at any other time). Rather, in his table of calculations of the rental income, the line item for May 2021 had the statement, “<span class="font-italic">(S$7,600.00 – S$1,050.00 (return of deposit))</span>”.

The plaintiff accepted the evidence of PW1 whereas the defendant said that PW1 only paid, in total, $13,600.00. The difference of $40.00 in total for the four months September to December 2022 apparently arose from fees of $10.00 per month for the use of the internet. The defendant submitted that due to a dispute between PW1 and PW2, PW1 paid this $10.00 to the defendant who handed it over to PW2; the defendant also relied on exhibit P1, being PW1’s handwritten note on which the words “<span class="font-italic">Internet $10</span>” were written.

</div> Amongst other reasons, the plaintiff pointed out that the defendant had maintained throughout the TAI proceedings, starting with his accounting affidavit on 6 June 2022 and including an Answers to Interrogatories on 15 August 2022, that there was no rental income for No 12A. This position was repeated in sworn statements as well as correspondence through his then-lawyers. The plaintiff tracked down the tenants and compelled them to testify. It was only in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) on 13 January 2023, two working days before the TAI hearing started, that the defendant disclosed that he had collected rental income from No 12A since at least January 2021, for which he had to account to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In his AEIC, the defendant dealt with this <span class="font-italic">volte face</span> by saying that (i) there had been miscommunications or gaps in his instructions to his then-lawyers, (ii) he thought that the rental barely covered the utilities and so there was little utility in disclosing the rental, (iii) the tenancy agreements were informal arrangements which need not be declared, and finally (iv) he had signed the Answers to Interrogatories in a rush.

</div> When cross-examined, the defendant was unable to provide any better explanation. I do not accept the defendant’s reasons. A miscommunication with one’s lawyers, or being in a rush, may excuse one error but it cannot excuse repeating the error over a period of seven months and embedding it in both correspondence and sworn documents. Even if the rental had barely covered the utilities (which does not appear to be the case based on the evidence before me) and even if the tenancy agreements were informal (which also does not appear to be the case as the tenants seem to have dealt with the defendant at arms’ length rather than being, for instance, family members), it was not for the defendant to decide that he therefore did not have to disclose the rental to the plaintiff. The defendant was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings and should have been properly advised about what he was required to do pursuant to the Judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Under s 116(<span class="font-italic">g</span>) of the Evidence Act 1893, the Court may presume that evidence which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavourable to the person who withholds it. It appears to me that the defendant had not wanted his tenants to testify in these TAI proceedings because he realised that they would say that they had been renting rooms at No 12A for certain periods of time and had paid rental to the defendant for the same. This desire to prevent that evidence from surfacing would be consistent with the defendant’s conduct as described in [17] and [18] above. It is also consistent with what PW1 told the Court – PW1 said the defendant’s wife had brought a letter to the tenants some time in September 2022

</div> In the end, the plaintiff compelled the tenants to testify and the evidence came to light. To that extent it has become unnecessary for me to draw an adverse inference against the defendant generally as regards the evidence of the tenants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 However, the plaintiff urged me to draw an adverse inference against the defendant specifically in relation to Huang’s tenancy and to find that Huang started renting a room at No 12A from January 2021 as the plaintiff suggested, rather than from March 2022 as the defendant suggested. I took into account PW4’s testimony under cross-examination that Huang had started living at No 12A in 2022 although she could not recall the month.

</div> PW4 did not appear to be making any particular effort to support the defendant’s case in her testimony. The defendant’s attempts, as described above, to stop the tenants from testifying seemed to have been directed at all of them collectively rather than against Huang specifically. Also, apart from the dispute about the internet fees in respect of PW1, I note that the occupancy dates and rental amounts set out in the defendant’s AEIC in relation to PW1, PW2, and PW4 were consistent with their testimony. I thus accept that Huang started renting a room at No 12A from March 2022 onwards and the amount of rental he paid totalled $6,160.00.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 On issue (2), I find that the total amount of rental collected from No 12A from January 2021 to December 2022 is $37,560.00.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rental that could have been collected but was not</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In addition to the rental actually collected from No 12A, the plaintiff sought an order that the defendant should also account to the plaintiff for rental that the defendant could have collected from renting out one of the remaining two untenanted rooms in No 12A but did not (the “Unlet Room”).

Another significant difference is that the accounting party carries a much more substantial burden of proof when accounting on the basis of a wilful default than that which applies in the case of a common account (see, <span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie </span><span class="font-italic">Hoa and Others</span> [2005] SGCA 4 at [55]; <span class="font-italic">UVJ and others v UVH and others and another appeal</span> [2020] 2 SLR 336 at [23]-[26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I had considered whether the effect of this decision is that I would be putting the plaintiff to the need to institute a fresh action dealing specifically with the claim for the Unlet Room (and, perhaps, the other room), and whether this in turn would lead to a waste of costs.

He first said that he had borne the utilities bills for the tenants and did not pass on the cost of the utilities to them as these tenants were only renting individual rooms, whereas he had or would have passed on the cost of the utilities to the tenant if the tenant rented the entire space.

</div> I accept their testimony and I find it to be consistent with a situation where the defendant bore the cost of the utilities but reflected that cost implicitly in the monthly rental. In other words, whilst the defendant may not have exercised a contractual right to directly pass the utilities cost to the tenants, the amount of the rental did factor in the utilities cost. The defendant’s later answer, where he suggested that he had been gracious in light of the tenants’ financial abilities, seemed to me to be an afterthought.

</div> I need not make a finding on forgery because, as I will explain below, I disagree with the defendant on his first argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 As to the defendant’s first argument, I understand from the decision in <span class="font-italic">Baker</span> that the trustee’s duty to provide proper, complete, and accurate justification and documentation may be fulfilled in different ways or to different degrees, and the question of what is, or is not, sufficient, is fact-centric and depends on, amongst others, whether the trustee is a lay trustee or a professional trustee, the type of expenses in question, the quantum in issue, and evidence of the surrounding factual context. As the Court of Appeal reiterated, “while the legal burden is on an accounting party to justify payments made for the benefit of the beneficiary, “how that burden is discharged will vary from case to case”” (see, <span class="font-italic">Baker </span>at [36]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 However, the documents which the defendant sought to rely on in the present case to prove the expenses incurred for the repair and maintenance of the Properties were challenged on their <span class="font-italic">admissibility</span> and not just on their <span class="font-italic">sufficiency</span>. Thus, it appears to me that in relying on <span class="font-italic">Baker</span>, the defendant has missed the anterior question of whether the disputed documents were admitted in evidence for TAI 1/2023 in the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The question is whether the seven PCV and the six 3P RI were proved by primary evidence, meaning the document itself produced for the inspection of the Court, as required by s 66 read with s 67 and s 64 of the Evidence Act 1893. The defendant cannot dispute that he did not produce for the inspection of the Court any of the documents of the seven PCV or six 3P RI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The defendant relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals </span>[2006] 3 SLR(R) 769 (“<span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span>”). Specifically, the defendant submitted, firstly, that if the documents are marked and admitted into evidence without objection, the other party cannot object to the admission of the documents later.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I will deal with the defendant’s three arguments in turn. First, <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span> does not assist the defendant. The passage which the defendant relied on in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span> at [51] expressly refers to documents having been marked and admitted into evidence and there is discussion elsewhere in <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span> about the use of an agreed bundle of documents to surmount any problems of authenticity (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Jet Holding</span> at [44], [56]). There was no agreed bundle of documents in TAI 1/2023. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Secondly, even if the plaintiff’s Notice of Non-Admission of Authenticity of Documents was served on 28 July 2022, more than 14 days after the original documents were inspected by the plaintiff on 27 June 2022, the deemed admission of authenticity under Order 27 r 4(1) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court 2014”) does not apply as the seven PCV and three of the six 3P RI which the plaintiff inspected were disclosed in the defendant’s accounting affidavit filed on 6 June 2022, not by way of a list of documents served pursuant to Order 24 or pursuant to an order made under Order 24. The remaining three of the six 3P RI were only disclosed in the defendant’s AEIC for the TAI proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Thirdly, I do not understand how the defendant could have suggested that the defendant was not questioned during the hearing about the authenticity of the seven PCV. On the contrary, he was questioned at length about the seven PCV and also the six 3P RI. It is also not right to suggest that the onus was on the plaintiff to ask the defendant to produce the originals for the inspection of the Court. This argument turns the burden of proof on its head and is unmeritorious.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The plaintiff served a Notice of Non-Admission of Authenticity of Documents which clearly stated that the plaintiff did not admit the authenticity of, and required the defendant to prove at trial, the seven PCV.

</div> In light of my finding on authenticity, it is unnecessary for me to consider the arguments based on hearsay. The defendant should have adduced the seven PCV and the six 3P RI for the purposes of the TAI proceedings but failed to do so. Without the documentary evidence, there is simply unsupported oral evidence from the defendant, which is insufficient to discharge the burden of proving that he had incurred a significant sum of $62,642.93 in various repair and maintenance works on the Properties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As for the miscellaneous works amounting to $4,500.00 which the defendant did not proffer any documents for, it is difficult to accept that there is a reasoned basis for this claim. I can understand a party making an estimate in the absence of documents, perhaps due to the passage of time or the relative size of the amounts incurred. However, after the Judgment which ordered the defendant to account was delivered on 30 March 2022, the defendant could have begun to accumulate the necessary receipts relating to miscellaneous expenses. When the accounting affidavit was filed on 6 June 2022, the defendant gave a figure of $4,000.00 for the miscellaneous works with no supporting documents.

Instead, in the AEIC, he repeated, almost word-for-word, what had been stated in his accounting affidavit but simply increased the figure to $4,500.00.

</div> I think the defendant has misunderstood the situation. I am not making a finding that none of the costs for miscellaneous works at the Properties had been incurred.

</div> The plaintiff disagreed with the defendant and in any event said, for similar reasons as with the seven PCV, that the defendant had not properly proved these expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In light of the Honourable Judge’s decision that the Arrangement ended by 1 January 2021, I find no merit in the defendant’s argument and I do not allow the defendant to set off any part of the expenses supposedly incurred by him for the Dedap Residence from 1 January 2021 onwards on the basis of fairness, expediency, or justice. What the defendant is really saying is that as a matter of good conscience, the plaintiff should be contributing towards maintenance, renovation, repairs and utilities for the Dedap Residence since he is also living there. Whether or not that is so is not something I can or should decide. Because of my finding on this issue, it is not necessary for me to address the dispute over whether the expenses for the Dedap Residence were properly proved by the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-justify font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue (5): the costs to be awarded in respect of these TAI proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The plaintiff sought indemnity costs for the TAI proceedings, relying mainly on the defendant’s conduct in attempting to conceal the fact that he had received rental income from No 12A until two working days before the TAI hearing started, as well as the defendant’s apparent attempts from late November 2022 onwards to delay the TAI proceedings.

</div> The OTS was served on 17 October 2022 and the defendant offered to pay the plaintiff $50,000.00 from the defendant’s share of the net proceeds of sale of the Properties pursuant to HC/OA 659/2022 (“OA 659”) and within seven days of his receipt of those proceeds. The OTS also stipulated that the plaintiff was to discontinue this case with no order as to costs within seven days from accepting the OTS. OA 659 was an application filed by the defendant on 13 October 2022 asking the Court to order that the Properties be sold.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 To attract the costs consequences under Order 22A of the Rules of Court 2014, an OTS must be a reasonable, serious or genuine offer aimed at inducing or facilitating settlement, and should not be made just to entail the payment of costs on an indemnity basis, and should not be one where the offeror effectively expected the other party to capitulate (see, <span class="font-italic">Resorts World at Sentosa Pte Ltd v Goel </span><span class="font-italic">Adesh Kumar and another appeal </span>[2018] 2 SLR 1070 (“<span class="font-italic">Resorts World</span>”) at [20], [22]). What would constitute a serious and genuine offer must depend on the circumstances and issues of the case (see, <span class="font-italic">Man B&amp;W Diesel S E Asia Pte Ltd and another v PT </span><span class="font-italic">Bumi International Tankers and another appeal </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 267 (“<span class="font-italic">B&amp;W</span>”) at [10]). There must be a legitimate basis for the offer made; a modest but realistic offer may be reasonable, serious or genuine for the purposes of Order 22A as it is a defendant’s right to assess the likely sum which the plaintiff may be awarded and to make an appropriate offer to settle in order to protect himself from adverse costs consequences (see, <span class="font-italic">Resorts World</span> at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the present case, what troubles me about the OTS is not the amount that was offered ($50,000.00 might indeed have been modest but realistic) but the fact that the amount was to be paid after selling the Properties pursuant to OA 659 whereas the plaintiff was to discontinue this case with no order as to costs within seven days from accepting the OTS. Given that OA 659 was filed by the defendant two working days before the OTS was served, this suggests that the defendant was using the OTS as leverage to get the order he wanted in OA 659 rather than to facilitate or induce settlement of this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Another difficulty with the OTS is that because the offered payment was contingent on the happening of future events namely, the defendant’s receipt of sale proceeds from the sale of the Properties, the assessment of whether the amount awarded in this TAI is not more favourable than the terms of the OTS should take into account interest lost during that time period. However, the amount of that interest cannot be ascertained at this stage as OA 659 has not concluded and there is no indication that the parties have agreed on a sale of the Properties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Even leaving aside the element of interest lost, which would be a factor that reduces the value of the OTS, the amount awarded by me in this TAI is more favourable than the amount of $50,000.00 that was offered in the OTS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 In any event, Order 22A r 9(5) of the Rules of Court 2014 provides that the Court shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent any costs are to be paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In this regard, there are two particular factors which have an impact on costs in this TAI. These factors are first, proportionality and second, the defendant’s conduct from the time of his accounting affidavit on 6 June 2022 until his AEIC on 13 January 2023. The point as to proportionality is self-evident. I also note in this connection that the defendant had applied to transfer the TAI to the State Courts on the basis that the value of the claim brought it within the jurisdiction of the State Courts. That application was taken out on 29 December 2022 and I heard it three working days later on 4 January 2023. At that time, the TAI proceedings were fixed to start on 16 January 2023. I dismissed the application and the defendant’s appeal against my decision was subsequently dismissed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As for the defendant’s conduct, I have said above that I do not accept several of his explanations. The accounting affidavit he signed on 6 June 2022 said, “As for [No 12A] there has been no rental income from 1 January 2021 to date<span class="font-italic">.</span>”

</div><span class="font-italic"> </span>I have considered both the accounting affidavit signed on 6 June 2022 and the AEIC signed on 13 January 2023. They were very similar both in presentation and in detail: they both reiterated that the plaintiff had denied the Arrangement and commenced this suit, they both stated that the defendant was providing an account for the Properties from 1 January 2021 onwards pursuant to the Judgment, they both set out what the defendant had incurred for upkeep etc for the Properties which should be set off, and they both maintained that the defendant had incurred various sums for upkeep etc for the Dedap Residence which should also be set off. The main point on which they differed was as to the rental for No 12A. It is difficult not to conclude that the defendant consciously concealed the rental for No 12A when he signed his accounting affidavit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 There were also attempts made by the plaintiff in between the two affidavits, through correspondence between counsel as well as Interrogatories, to elicit the truth about the rental for No 12A. Unfortunately, the defendant did his best to deliberately conceal the rental he had collected from No 12A until he knew he no longer could.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Taking into account all the factors and in the exercise of my discretion, I will award the plaintiff the costs of the TAI proceedings as guided by Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions 2013 which applies to matters in the High Court rather than using the scale of costs applicable to matters heard in the Magistrate’s Courts, and I award costs on the standard basis rather than the indemnity basis. Section III.A.<span class="font-italic">(</span><span class="font-italic">i)</span> item 4 of Appendix G provides a range of $25,000.00 to $70,000.00 for pre-trial work, $6,000.00 to $16,000.00 as a daily trial tariff, and up to $30,000.00 for post-trial work. The plaintiff sought $25,000.00 in costs and $2,106.08 in disbursements for pre-trial work, $45,000.00 in costs and $7,516.07 in disbursements for the three hearing days, and $15,000.00 in costs and $390.66 in disbursements for post-trial work, on an indemnity basis, which totalled $95,012.81.

I have taken into account, in particular, the defendant’s conduct starting with the accounting affidavit and until the AEIC was served two working days before the first day of the TAI hearing, as well as the urgent getting-up and other preparatory work which plaintiff’s counsel would have had to do since the defendant’s AEIC was served only two working days before the TAI hearing commenced. I have also borne in mind that some time, although not a great deal, was spent during the TAI hearing on the issue of whether rental could have been earned on the Unlet Room. I have factored in that additional submissions were requested by me on a few discrete points, after the parties’ respective closing and reply submissions.

The starting point for the interest calculation on the net amount is the day following the date on which the amount was payable to the defendant; by way of illustration, if monthly rental was due to the defendant on 31 January 2021, interest will start on 1 February 2021.
