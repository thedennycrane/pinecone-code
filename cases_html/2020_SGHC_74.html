For the reasons given below, I decided that costs incurred in enforcing a claim protected by a possessory lien should be accorded the same priority as the possessory lien.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The plaintiff, Keppel FELS Ltd (“Keppel FELS”), provided various services to the vessel, <span class="font-italic">Songa</span><span class="font-italic"> Venus </span>(“the Vessel”), including repairs, modifications, supply of materials and equipment as well as berthing. Having failed to obtain payment for the said services from the owner of the Vessel, Keppel FELS commenced the present proceedings, arrested the Vessel, and obtained an order for the Vessel to be appraised and sold <span class="font-italic">pendente lite </span>“without prejudice to [Keppel FELS’] possessory lien over the Vessel, if any”. Pursuant to the order, the Vessel and the bunkers on board were sold by the Sheriff for US$3,749,463.14.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Thereafter, Keppel FELS obtained final judgment in default of appearance for the sum of US$1,169,370 with interest. In granting the final judgment, Belinda Ang Saw Ean J also declared that Keppel FELS had a possessory lien over the Vessel<span class="font-italic"> </span>in respect of the portion of its claim relating to repair and modification works, as well as supply of various materials, equipment and services. This portion amounted to US$328,723. Belinda Ang J also awarded Keppel FELS the costs of its action, fixed at S$10,000 in addition to reasonable disbursements (“Costs of the Action”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The intervener, Songa Offshore SE (“Songa Offshore”), commenced a separate <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action against the Vessel for sums outstanding under a seller’s credit agreement which was secured by a second preferred mortgage over the Vessel. Songa Offshore obtained final judgment in default of appearance for the sum of US$34,200,000.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The present application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Keppel FELS then filed the present application for determination of the priority of the relevant claims and payment out of the proceeds of sale. The only other party that appeared at the hearing of the application was Songa Offshore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The parties were not in dispute that the priority of claims should be in the following order:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Sheriff’s commission, costs and expenses.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Costs of the producer of the fund (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> Keppel FELS’ costs of and incidental to the arrest, appraisement and sale of the Vessel and bunkers on board, as well as the costs of the present application).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Keppel FELS’ judgment debt in respect of the portion of its claim for which it had a possessory lien, amounting to US$328,723.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Songa Offshore’s judgment debt of US$34,200,000 in respect of its claim as mortgagee.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The remainder of Keppel FELS’ judgment debt in respect of the portion of its claim for which it had no possessory lien.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The dispute between the parties was over the treatment of the Costs of the Action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Keppel FELS submitted that the Costs of the Action should be prioritised in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) costs attributable to the portion of Keppel FELS’ claim for which Keppel FELS had a possessory lien should be accorded the same priority as limb (c) of [6] above (“the Disputed Costs”);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) costs attributable to the portion of Keppel FELS’ claim for which there was no possessory lien should be accorded the same priority as limb (e) of [6] above; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) an appropriate apportionment would be 40-60, with the result that 40% of the Costs of the Action should be accorded the same priority as limb (c) of [6] above, while the remaining 60% of the Costs of the Action should be accorded the same priority as limb (e) of [6] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Songa Offshore objected to the Costs of the Action being prioritised in this manner. Instead, Songa Offshore submitted that all of the Costs of the Action should be accorded the same priority as limb (e) of [6] above. Since Songa Offshore’s judgment debt (limb (d) of [6] above) exceeded the amount that would remain from the sale proceeds after payment out of Keppel FELS’ judgment debt in respect of the portion of its claim for which it had a possessory lien (limb (c) of [6] above), the practical effect of giving all of the Costs of the Action the same priority as limb (e) of [6] above was that Keppel FELS would not receive a single cent of the Costs of the Action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 As for the quantum of apportionment, Songa Offshore accepted that, if the court were to find in favour of Keppel FELS on the issue of priority as set out at [8(a)–8(b)] above, the 40-60 apportionment proposed by Keppel FELS at [8(c)] above would be reasonable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ submissions</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Keppel FELS referred to Nigel Meeson &amp; John A Kimbell, <span class="font-italic">Admiralty Jurisdiction and Practice </span>(Informa, 4th Ed, 2011) (“<span class="font-italic">Meeson</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Kimbell</span>”), which contained the following passage (at para 6.78):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The costs of the action will normally be afforded the same priority as the substantive claim out of which they arise, except in so far as they have priority as being the costs of the producer of the fund.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The authority cited in <span class="font-italic">Meeson</span><span class="font-italic"> &amp; Kimbell </span>for the foregoing proposition was <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Margaret” </span>(1835) 3 Hag Adm 238 (“<span class="font-italic">The Margaret</span>”), a decision of the High Court of Admiralty of England concerning a claim for crew’s wages, where the court held, at 240, that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The ship is liable for wages and costs. The costs are as much due as the <span class="font-italic">sors</span><span class="font-italic"> principalis</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Although <span class="font-italic">The Margaret </span>did not involve competing claimants with claims of different priorities, it<span class="font-italic"> </span>was cited and followed by the Federal Court of Australia in <span class="font-italic">Patrick Stevedores No 2 Pty Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Proceeds of Sale of the Vessel MV Skulptor Konenkov </span>(1997) 144 ALR 394, which was a case involving competing claims of different priorities. In that case, after dealing with the validity and priority of various claims, Sheppard J remarked, at 404, that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">There is a question in relation to costs. Although costs are discretionary, the general rule is that in actions against the proceeds of sale of property arrested in rem, <span class="font-italic">costs have the same priority as the claim in respect of which they have been incurred</span>: see <span class="font-italic">The Margaret </span>(1835) 3 Hag Adm 238 and <span class="font-italic">The William F Safford </span>(1860) Lush 69 and also Meeson, supra, p 167. I propose to treat costs in accordance with the ordinary rule. There was no submission that I should do otherwise. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The case of <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">“William F Safford” </span>(1860) Lush 69 referred to in the above quotation was a decision of the Right Honourable Dr Lushington in the High Court of Admiralty of England. After dealing with the priorities of various claims against the arrested ship, Dr Lushington held, at 71, that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The costs in each action will be paid with the principal sums in the order I have named.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Songa Offshore did not dispute that the foregoing cases stood for the general rule that costs incurred in enforcing a particular maritime claim should enjoy the same priority as the substantive claim. Instead, Songa Offshore submitted that the proper application of this rule should result in the Disputed Costs being afforded only the priority of a statutory lien. Songa Offshore put forward two lines of arguments in support of this submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 First, the common law possessory lien is a passive remedy which confers no right of action. There is no legal provision that permits the invocation of the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court for the purpose of enforcing a possessory lien. Where a maritime claimant who enjoys a possessory lien wishes to invoke the admiralty jurisdiction of the court to enforce his claim, he would need to commence an action to enforce the underlying maritime claim by invoking a statutory right of action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>. Therefore, Songa Offshore submitted that any costs incurred in such an action should be classified as costs incurred to enforce a statutory lien, and not as costs incurred to enforce a possessory lien. Consequently, such costs should only be afforded the priority of a statutory lien, and not the priority of a possessory lien.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Secondly, the common law possessory lien is accorded a high priority by the admiralty court as part of the admiralty court’s undertaking to protect the possessory lien in return for the possessory lien holder giving up possession of the vessel. This is so that a judicial sale can be conducted for the benefit of all parties having <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>claims against the vessel. This undertaking extends only to claims properly coming within the scope of the possessory lien and no more. The courts have been strict about what claims come within the scope of a possessory lien. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Somes</span><span class="font-italic"> v British Empire Shipping Co </span>(1860) 8 HL Cas 338, dock charges incurred by a shipwright did not fall within the scope of the shipwright’s possessory lien over the vessel, even though they were reasonably incurred to keep the vessel under the shipwright’s detention to safeguard his possessory lien. In this regard, Songa Offshore submitted that costs incurred in invoking a statutory right of action <span class="font-italic">in rem</span> in respect of a claim over which a possessory lien also subsists do not come within the scope of the possessory lien. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Songa Offshore also pointed out that none of the three cases cited at [12]–[14] above concerned claims protected by possessory liens. Against this, Keppel FELS cited <span class="font-italic">The “Honey I” </span>[1987] SLR(R) 239 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Honey I</span>”), a case involving possessory liens. In that case, Singapore Slipway &amp; Engineering Co (“Singapore Slipway”) commenced an <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action to arrest the vessel <span class="font-italic">Honey</span><span class="font-italic"> I </span>to recover the sum of $24,000 for repair works (“ADM 676/1984”). The vessel was arrested while she was in the possession of Singmarine Shipyard (Pte) Ltd (“Singmarine Shipyard”), who claimed a possessory lien over the vessel in respect of its repair bills totalling $1,681,768. After the vessel was arrested, Singmarine Shipyard commenced a separate <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action against the vessel (“ADM 774/1985”) and obtained judgment in default of appearance with costs. There were also other claimants, such as Robina Credit Ltd who held a mortgage over the vessel and Hutton (Plant and Spares) Ltd who had supplied necessaries to the vessel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The vessel was sold by the court for the sum of $518,586. Singmarine Shipyard, as plaintiff in ADM 774/1985 and intervener in ADM 676/1984, applied in ADM 676/1984 for, and obtained, the following orders (<span class="font-italic">The Honey I </span>at [2]; [14]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1 That the priorities of the various claimants against the balance of the proceeds of sale of the ship ‘HONEY I’ ex ‘CASSIO’ amounting to $518,586 be determined in the following order:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The abovenamed plaintiffs’ taxed costs until the date of sale of the vessel in this action.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The taxed costs of Singmarine Shipyard (Pte) Ltd and their claim in [ADM 774/1985].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2 That a sum of $40,000 estimated to cover the aforesaid taxed costs be retained pending taxation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3 That there be payment out to the interveners, Singmarine Shipyard (Pte) Ltd, the balance sum of $478,586 in accordance with the aforesaid order for priority.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4 That the costs of and incidental to this motion be taxed and paid out of the proceeds of sale to the interveners, Singmarine Shipyard (Pte) Ltd, in priority to all other claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Keppel FELS highlighted that Prayer 1(b) combined Singmarine Shipyard’s costs in ADM 774/1985 with its substantive claim and accorded the same priority to both the costs and the claim. Since an order in terms was granted for Prayer 1(b), Keppel FELS submitted that <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Honey I </span>supported its position.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Songa Offshore submitted that the issue in dispute in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Honey I </span>was Singmarine Shipyard’s entitlement to a possessory lien, and not the priority to be accorded to Singmarine Shipyard’s costs. As Singmarine Shipyard’s claim far exceeded the available proceeds of sale, there would be nothing left to pay either Singmarine Shipyard’s costs or the claims of the other claimants which ranked lower in priority than Singmarine Shipyard. Therefore, the issue of Singmarine Shipyard’s costs simply did not arise for consideration. <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Honey I </span>therefore could not be regarded as authority supporting Keppel FELS’ position.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 It is well settled that, <span class="font-italic">as a general rule</span>, in actions against the proceeds of sale of property arrested <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>, costs have the same priority as the claim in respect of which they have been incurred. This general rule is supported by the authorities cited at [11]–[14] above. Neither party disputed the correctness of this general rule. The dispute between the parties was whether the proper application of this general rule should result in the Disputed Costs being accorded the same priority as a possessory lien or a statutory lien. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In this regard, I agreed with Songa Offshore that the three cases cited by Keppel FELS at [12]–[14] above threw no light on this issue in so far as none of them dealt with a claim protected by a possessory lien. As for <span class="font-italic">The Honey I</span>, while it provided some support for Keppel FELS’ position given that it was a case concerning possessory liens, I agreed with Songa Offshore that it was not a strong authority for present purposes because the issue of the priority of the possessory lien holder’s costs was not argued and did not arise for consideration. But <span class="font-italic">The Honey I </span>was not alone in according the costs of a possessory lien holder the same priority as the possessory lien.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Immacolata Concezione </span>(1883) 9 PD 37 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Immacolata Concezione</span>”), besides the crew claiming a wage maritime lien, there were three parties claiming to be entitled to possessory liens:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Alfred Carter (“Carter”), who was a shipwright and the owner of the dock where the vessel was arrested. His entitlement to a possessory lien over the vessel was not disputed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Seaward &amp; Co, who was engaged by the shipowner to undertake part of the ship repair together with Carter. Seaward &amp; Co claimed that it had an agreement with Carter that Carter would protect Seaward &amp; Co’s possessory lien such that both their claims would rank equally.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Robertson &amp; Co, who claimed a possessory lien over certain sails. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Butt J held, at 42–43, that he would:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… give priority to Carter over all the other claimants, except the mariners, so far as regards the claim of the latter for wages up to the 2nd of April … With regard to the rest of the wages claim it will rank after Carter’s claim, and also after that of Seaward &amp; Co., if on a reference back of the special case it is shewn that the latter are by arrangement entitled to rank equally with Carter. … As regards Robertson &amp; Co., the sailmakers, if they had the sails in their possession and were deprived of them by the marshal, their rights must be protected, and they must rank before Carter and Seaward &amp; Co. <span class="font-italic">As regards the costs of these claims, in each action the decree will include costs, and in each case, also, they must rank with the claim</span>, and in the wages action they must rank with what I may term the best part of the claim, that is, for wages dues to the 2nd of April. I will now only add that Seaward &amp; Co.’s claim must be referred back to the registrar, and it must be found whether there was an arrangement between [the shipowner], Seaward &amp; Co., and Carter that Carter was to protect Seaward &amp; Co.’s lien. If he was to do so, then the decree will be that Seaward &amp; Co. are to rank with Carter, and if not, then they must be postponed to Carter. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Thus, when Butt J issued the foregoing judgment, it was still unclear if Seaward &amp; Co and Robertson &amp; Co had possessory liens. These questions were referred back to the registrar by Butt J for fact-finding. Yet, in spite of this uncertainty, Butt J held that the costs of each claim “must rank with the claim”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The implications of this holding were as follows. If Seaward &amp; Co succeeded in establishing its entitlement to a possessory lien, its costs would be accorded the priority of a possessory lien to rank together with Carter’s costs. Otherwise, Seaward &amp; Co’s claim would have priority only as a statutory lien<span class="font-italic"> </span>and its costs would also rank accordingly. Similarly, if Robertson &amp; Co were to succeed in establishing its possessory lien, its costs would rank ahead of Carter’s and Seaward &amp; Co’s claims. In other words, <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Immacolata Concezione</span> supports Keppel FELS’s position that the existence of a possessory lien in respect of a claim would affect the priority to be given to the costs incurred in enforcing that claim in an admiralty action <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">rem</span>. Had Songa Offshore’s submission at [16]–[17] above been correct, Butt J would not have held that costs must rank with the respective claims. Instead, he would have held that the costs of Carter, Seaward &amp; Co and Robertson &amp; Co should be accorded only the priority of a statutory lien, to rank <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu inter se</span> irrespective of whether any of them succeeded in establishing a possessory lien.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 For the foregoing reasons, I accepted that the authorities support Keppel FELS’ position. Moreover, quite apart from the foregoing authorities,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Keppel FELS’ position is also supported by reference to first principles. In this regard, a key principle is that the determination of priority is an equitable jurisdiction. Consequently, the admiralty court has adopted a broad discretionary approach by reference to considerations of equity, public policy and commercial expediency, with the ultimate aim of doing that which is just in the circumstances of each case (D R Thomas, <span class="font-italic">Maritime Liens</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(Stevens &amp; Sons, 1980) at para 418, cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Ruta </span>[2000] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 359 at [21]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 As for the admiralty court’s approach towards the common law possessory lien, it is useful to start with the following observation by Phillimore J in <span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Tergeste </span>[1903] P 26 (“<span class="font-italic">The </span><span class="font-italic">Tergeste</span>”) at 32–33:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The view which the Admiralty Court took with regard to conflicting claims by shipwrights having a possessory common law lien, and claims which have been sustained by process in the Admiralty Court, has been well established, and has been accepted by this Division of the High Court of Justice. It is that it is the duty of the material man not to contend with the Admiralty marshal; to surrender the ship to the officer of the Court, and let the officer of the Court, under the order of the Court, remove and sell her; but when he has done that, <span class="font-italic">the Court undertakes that he shall be protected, and that he shall be put exactly in the same position as if he had not surrendered the ship to the marshal</span>. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The possessory lien holder thus surrenders the ship<span class="font-italic"> </span>to the admiralty court in return for an undertaking from the admiralty court to put him “exactly in the same position as if he had not surrendered the ship”. This raises the question of what the position of a possessory lien holder would have been if he had not surrendered the ship. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 As noted in <span class="font-italic">Hammonds v Barclay </span>(1802) 2 East 227 at 235, the possessory lien is “a right in one man to retain that which is in his possession belonging to another, till certain demands of him, the person in possession, are satisfied”. In other words, a possessory lien holder may retain possession of the <span class="font-italic">res</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>until he has been paid what is due to him, in return for its release. Since the possessory lien holder need not initiate legal proceedings to enforce the possessory lien, such payment for the release of the <span class="font-italic">res </span>would be payment in full (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> without deduction for legal costs and without the lien holder incurring any legal costs to enforce the underlying claim protected by the possessory lien). However, once the possessory lien holder surrenders the <span class="font-italic">res</span> to the admiralty court, he would have to commence an <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action against the <span class="font-italic">res</span>, in order to obtain a judgment so that he could participate in the distribution of the proceeds of the judicial sale of the <span class="font-italic">res</span>. It therefore stands to reason that, in order to make good the admiralty court’s undertaking to put the possessory lien holder “exactly in the same position as if he had not surrendered the ship”, the admiralty court ought also to protect the possessory lien holder’s costs incurred in the said <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action to the same extent as the possessory lien itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Therefore, reasoning from first principles, I decided that considerations of justice and equity required the court to accord the Disputed Costs the same priority as the portion of Keppel FELS’ claim for which it had a possessory lien. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Finally, I was fortified in the foregoing conclusion by the fact that a similar result would obtain pursuant to another provision in the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) which similarly provides for the surrender of possession by a possessory lien holder in return for protection by the court of his possessory lien. O 29 r 6 of the ROC provides:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Recovery of movable property subject to lien, etc. (O. 29, r. 6) </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">6.</span>  Where the plaintiff, or the defendant by way of counterclaim, claims the recovery of specific movable property and the party from whom recovery is sought does not dispute the title of the party making the claim but <span class="font-italic">claims to be entitled to retain the property by virtue of a lien or otherwise as security for any sum of money</span>, the Court, at any time after the claim to be so entitled appears from the pleadings (if any) or by affidavit or otherwise to its satisfaction, may order that the party seeking to recover the property be at liberty to <span class="font-italic">pay into Court, to abide the event of the action, the amount of money in respect of which the security is claimed and such further sum (if any) for interest and costs</span> as the Court may direct and that, upon such payment being made, the property claimed be given up to the party claiming it, but subject to the provisions of the Exchange Control Act (Cap. 99).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Under this provision, the court may order a possessory lien holder to surrender the property in question to its owner, upon the owner paying into court the sum claimed by the possessory lien holder together with interest and costs. This situation is similar to that explained at [28] above, where the court requires a possessory lien holder to surrender possession while undertaking to put the possessory lien holder in the same position as if he had not surrendered possession. The differences between the two processes are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) in an admiralty <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action, possession is surrendered to the Sheriff, while under O 29 r 6, possession is surrendered to the owner; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) in an admiralty <span class="font-italic">in rem </span>action, the interest of the possessory lien holder is protected by transferring the possessory lien to the proceeds of judicial sale, while under O 29 r 6, the interest of the possessory lien holder is protected by the owner paying the claimed amount into court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Under O 29 r 6 of the ROC, the sum to be paid into court by the owner includes an amount to secure the possessory lien holder’s costs of establishing his claim in the action. The rationale appears to be that, in order to put the possessory lien holder in the same position as if he had not surrendered possession, he must be made whole for costs he would not otherwise incur to establish his claim, had the owner simply paid his claim in full to secure the surrender of the property. In my view, similar considerations apply to the treatment of the common law possessory lien in the context of maritime claims, and therefore similar results should obtain as a matter of justice and equity. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 For the reasons given above, I considered it just and equitable, as well as principled, to accord the Disputed Costs the same priority as the portion of Keppel FELS’ claim for which it had a possessory lien. Consequently, I ordered 40% of the Costs of the Action to rank in priority together with limb (c) of [6] above, and 60% of the Costs of the Action to rank in priority together with limb (e) of [6] above. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Pang Khang Chau  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Boon Yong Thomas and Josiah Fong (Haridass Ho &amp; Partners) for the plaintiff;<br/>Liang Junhong Daniel (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the intervener.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
