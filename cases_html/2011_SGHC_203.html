        Woo Bih Li J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       There were various matters before me on 1 and
                    2 September 2011. The main matter was the application by the
                    plaintiff, Jane Rebecca Ong (“JRO”) by way of Summons No 3655 of
                    2011 (“the Present Summons”). This was an application to vacate
                    trial dates fixed for Suit No 156 of 2006 (“the Present Action” or
                    “Suit 156”) between 26 September to 21 October 2011 and
                    for consequential directions including the extensions of time in respect of
                    various timelines fixed at a pre-trial conference (“PTC”) on
                    1 April 2011. After hearing arguments, I vacated only the first week of
                    trial dates from 26 September to 30 September 2011 and gave various
                    directions for parties to meet in order for the trial to commence on
                    3 October 2011. I also directed that if JRO failed to comply with my
                    directions, her claim was to be struck out. I granted JRO leave to appeal. I
                    also directed her to seek urgent directions for an expedited
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In the Present Action, JRO is making a claim
                    against three defendants for professional negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       JRO had appointed the first and second
                    defendants (“D1” and “D2” respectively) as her
                    forensic accounting experts and the third defendant (“D3”) as her
                    solicitors in Originating Summons No 939 of 1991 (“OS 939”). In
                    OS 939, she made a claim against, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    her mother-in-law Lim Lie Hoa (also known as (“aka”) Lim Le Hoa
                    aka Lily Arief Husni) (“LLH”) as trustee of the estate of
                    JRO’s father-in-law Ong Seng King (aka Ong King Seng aka Arief Husni),
                    deceased.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On or about 16 July 1996, the High Court in
                    OS 939 directed that an inquiry be held to determine, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, the quantum of JRO’s share in the
                    father-in-law’s estate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       JRO’s claim against the defendants in the
                    Present Action is apparently in respect of that inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       JRO claimed that she was of the view that the
                    defendants had acted negligently although it was not entirely clear when exactly
                    she came to that view. Nevertheless, it was her position that she had to file a
                    protective writ of summons in early 2006 to avoid any issue of limitation of
                    time for her claim against the defendants. She filed the writ on 20 March
                    2006 with the aid of the law firm Heng, Leong &amp; Srinivasan but did not have
                    sufficient funds to take further steps.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       For the time being, I will move forward to
                    1 April 2011. At a PTC on that date, the following directions were
                    given:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     Parties were to file and serve their
                        Supplementary List of Documents, if any, by 9 May
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     Inspection of
                        the documents set out in the Supplementary List of Documents, if any, was to
                        be completed by 16 May 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Order of Court in respect of the directions was to be
                        extracted by 6 June 2011, stating the names of all the respective
                        parties’ witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_d"></a>(d)     Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEICs”) of
                        witnesses of fact were to be filed and exchanged by 5 August
                        2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_e"></a>(e)     Objections
                        to AEICs of witnesses of fact, if any, were to be made by 19 August
                        2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_f"></a>(f)     AEICs of
                        expert witnesses were to be filed and exchanged by 2 September
                        2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_g"></a>(g)     Objections
                        to AEICs of expert witnesses, if any, were to be made by 9 September
                        2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_h"></a>(h)     Suit 156
                        was to be set down for trial by 12 September 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_i"></a>(i)     The trial of Suit 156 was fixed for
                        four weeks from 26 September 2011 to 21 October
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       D3 was also directed that day to file any
                    application by 15 April 2011 to strike out of part of JRO’s Statement
                    of Claim (Amendment No 1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       I will refer to the PTC on 1 April 2011 as
                    “the 1 April PTC” and the directions given in respect of the
                    extraction of the order and the filing of the AEICs as “the Present
                    Directions”. I will refer to the trial dates given then as “the
                    Present Trial Dates”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     JRO did not comply with the direction to
                    extract the 1 April 2011 order by 6 June 2011 or at all. Neither was
                    she ready to exchange the AEICs of her factual witnesses by 5 August
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Instead, on 3 August 2011, <em>ie</em>, two days before the deadline for parties to exchange
                    the factual AEICs, she telephoned Allen &amp; Gledhill
                    (“A&amp;G”), the solicitors for D1 and D2, to say that she would
                    not be able to comply with the Present Directions and that she would be filing
                    an urgent application “within 24 hours” to extend all the
                    timelines given under the Present Directions. Her application would include the
                    vacating of the Present Trial Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 4 August 2011, JRO filed and served a
                    Notice of Appointment of Solicitors on the defendants. The notice was really to
                    re-appoint her previous solicitors Engelin Teh Practice LLC
                    (“ETP”), who had been appointed between 24 June 2009 to
                    9 May 2011, as her solicitors. ETP had apparently been discharged in May
                    2011 as I shall elaborate below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 5 August 2011, ETP wrote to the
                    Registrar of the Supreme Court to request a PTC to deal with nine items
                    including fresh timelines in respect of the Present Directions and to vacate the
                    Present Trial Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     According to the defendants, their solicitors
                    wrote on the same day to JRO to state that they were ready to exchange factual
                    AEICs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 8 August 2011, D1 and D2 filed Summons
                    Nos 3491 and 3492 of 2011. Each sought an order that JRO file and serve her
                    factual witnesses’ AEICs within three days of the order to be made. They
                    also sought an “unless” order, <em>ie</em>,
                    if JRO failed to do so, her claim was to be struck out and in respect of the
                    application by D1, judgment was to be entered for D1’s
                    counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 11 August 2011, D3 filed Summons No
                    3542 of 2011 for reliefs which were similar to those sought by D1.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     These three applications came up for hearing
                    on 15 August 2011. According to counsel for D1 and D2, a PTC was also fixed
                    for that day. Assistant Registrar (“AR”) Lionel Leo made the
                    following orders on that day:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_1"></a>(1)     JRO was to file and serve on all the
                        defendants the AEICs of all her factual witnesses by 19 August
                        2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_2"></a>(2)     JRO was
                        to file and serve on all the defendants by 18 August 2011 her
                        application to vacate the trial dates for Suit 156.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_3"></a>(3)     JRO was to file and serve on all the
                        defendants her affidavit in reply to the “unless” order
                        applications by 19 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_4"></a>(4)     The hearing of the “unless” order
                        applications was adjourned to 22 August 2011 for the Court to determine
                        whether or not to grant the “unless” orders against
                        JRO.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In other words, although AR Leo directed JRO
                    to file and serve the factual AEICs by 19 August 2011 (<em>ie</em>, four days after the hearing on 15 August 2011), he
                    deferred making a decision on the “unless” orders sought by the
                    defendants until 22 August 2011. In the meantime, JRO was to file and serve
                    her application by 18 August 2011 to vacate the Present Trial Dates and to
                    file and serve her reply affidavit on the application for “unless”
                    orders by 19 August 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 18 August 2011, ETP filed and served
                    the Present Summons to vacate the Present Trial Dates and for consequential
                    directions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 19 August 2011, one of JRO’s
                    solicitors Mr Anthony Soh, filed and served his affidavit which contained a
                    draft affidavit of JRO as an exhibit. He said that JRO’s draft affidavit
                    was made in reply to the “unless” order applications and that the
                    engrossed copy of JRO’s affidavit would be signed the next day. In
                    reality, JRO’s draft affidavit had a dual purpose. First, it was to
                    support the Present Summons. Second, it was to resist the defendants’
                    applications for the “unless” orders. The engrossed and signed
                    affidavit of JRO was filed on 22 August 2011 (“the Main
                    Affidavit”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In the meantime, ETP filed three notices of
                    appeal on 19 August 2011 in respect of AR Leo’s decision on
                    15 August 2011 directing JRO to file and serve the factual AEICs by
                    19 August 2011. These were Registrar’s Appeal Nos 255, 256 and 257 of
                    2011 (“RAs 255, 256 and 257”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 22 August 2011, AR Leo dismissed that
                    part of the defendants’ applications seeking the “unless”
                    orders although he was of the view that JRO had disregarded timelines imposed by
                    the court on multiple occasions. According to the relevant minutes, AR Leo
                    thought that the making of such orders would be futile if JRO’s appeals to
                    a judge in chambers (in RAs 255, 256 and 257) were successful and the reason for
                    making such orders would be less compelling if a judge were to allow JRO’s
                    application in the Present Summons to vacate the Present Trial
                Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On 23 and 24 August 2011, the
                    defendants filed three notices of appeal (Registrar’s Appeal Nos 261, 262
                    and 263 of 2011 (“RAs 261, 262 and 263”)) against AR Leo’s
                    dismissal of their applications for the “unless”
                orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The Present Summons and the three appeals by
                    JRO against AR Leo’s decision made on 15 August 2011 and the three
                    appeals by the defendants against AR Leo’s decision made on 22 August
                    2011 were all fixed for hearing before me on 26 August 2011. I asked if
                    there was any objection to my hearing the matters in view of certain reasons
                    which I need not elaborate here. JRO’s counsel had to take instructions
                    while counsel for the defendants said they had none. The matters were then
                    adjourned to a date to be fixed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Shortly thereafter, ETP wrote to say that JRO
                    had no objection to my hearing the matters. They were fixed for hearing before
                    me in the afternoon of Thursday, 1 September 2011, and the morning of
                    Friday, 2 September 2011. The later date was the date when the AEICs of
                    expert witnesses were to be exchanged, but by then it was clear that JRO was not
                    complying with the earlier timelines.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     After hearing submissions, I made the
                    following orders on 2 September 2011 in respect of the Present Summons as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_1"></a>“(1)     Plaintiff is to provide
                        defendants a draft of today’s order stating the names of all her
                        witnesses by 5pm of 7 September 2011 and defendants to respond by 5pm
                        of 8 September 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_2"></a>(2)     Plaintiff to extract the order by 5pm of
                        12 September 2011 and serve it by 5pm of 13 September
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_3"></a>(3)     Parties are
                        to file and exchange AEICs of all witnesses by 4pm of Friday,
                        23 September 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_4"></a>(4)     Objections, if any, to any AEICs are to be filed and
                        served by 5pm of 29 September 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_5"></a>(5)     Trial dates of 26 September to
                        30 September 2011 are vacated. Other trial dates given on 1 April
                        2011 are to remain.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_6"></a>(6)     Parties to consider writing in for PTC for additional trial
                        dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_7"></a>(7)     If
                        plaintiff fails to comply with any of the above directions, her claim
                        against each and every defendant is struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_8"></a>(8)     If plaintiff is of the view that it is pointless
                        for her to attempt to meet any of the above directions, she or her
                        solicitors are to notify the defendants’ solicitors immediately in
                        writing whereupon her claim against each and every defendant is struck
                        out.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_9"></a>(9)     If the
                        plaintiff’s claim is struck out pursuant to para 7 or 8 above, the
                        defendants are nevertheless to continue with their
                    counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_26-p2_10"></a>(10)     Liberty to apply.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     JRO’s counsel orally applied for leave
                    to appeal to the Court of Appeal and I granted such leave with a direction that
                    she was to seek urgent directions to expedite the hearing of her
                appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     I would add that although I made costs orders
                    in respect of the Present Summons, I had inadvertently omitted to make costs
                    orders if JRO’s claim was struck out. Accordingly, I informed the
                    Registrar of the Supreme Court on 5 September 2011 to inform the various
                    solicitors that such orders should be included. In view of the orders I made in
                    respect of the Present Summons, I made no order in respect of the six
                    appeals.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether JRO needed legal advice to comply with the Present
                Directions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The main matter before me was the Present
                    Summons. The arguments in respect of that application would cover the matters
                    raised in the six appeals. My decision on the Present Summons might also affect
                    the outcome of the six appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Present Summons was supported by the Main
                    Affidavit and another affidavit by JRO to be filed later (the draft of which was
                    item 19 in JRO’s bundle of documents) (“the Draft
                    Affidavit”). The crux of the basis for the Present Summons was
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     JRO was unable to determine who her
                        witnesses should be or prepare AEICs for her witnesses or determine related
                        trial issues without the help of solicitors (see paras 13(m), 16 and 28 of
                        the Main Affidavit).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     In order to instruct solicitors, JRO needed funds. She was in
                        financial difficulties. Indeed, she had entered into an Individual Voluntary
                        Arrangement (“IVA”) in the United Kingdom (she holds a United
                        Kingdom passport and apparently resides there).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     Before 24 June 2009, JRO had received
                        funding to pursue Suit 156. That was the date she first appointed ETP to act
                        for her. However, her funding had to be reassessed as a result of various
                        steps taken and applications made and also because she had to provide the
                        defendants with security for their costs (see para 13(f) to (i) of the Main
                        Affidavit). As a result of the reassessment of her funding, there was a
                        freeze on her legal expenses. Thus, she told ETP on 3 March 2011 to
                        stop doing any substantive work although they continued to act for her and
                        represented her at the 1 April PTC. On 11 May 2011 (actually filed
                        on 10 May 2011), JRO formally filed a Notice of Intention to Act in
                        Person. Since March 2011, JRO has been without funding and without
                        substantive assistance from solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     The reassessment was delayed for various
                        reasons. On 3 August 2011, JRO informed A&amp;G that she would have to
                        apply to extend all timelines and to vacate the Present Trial Dates (see
                        para 12 of the Draft Affidavit and para 13(m) and (n) of the Main
                        Affidavit).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        funding arrangements were finalised only on 4 August 2011. She was then
                        able to immediately reappoint ETP to act for her (see para 13(n) of the Main
                        Affidavit). However, ETP needed time to be reacquainted with the matter and
                        to get up to speed and five weeks was not enough (see paras 36 and 39 of the
                        Main Affidavit).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     JRO also had three other reasons for the
                    Present Summons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_a"></a>(a)     D1 had not disclosed documents which
                        they had received from the execution of an Anton Piller Order
                        (“APO”) against LLH in OS 939. JRO’s own set of such
                        documents was incomplete and some were scanned copies which were of poor
                        quality.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_b"></a>(b)     All
                        the defendants had not made full discovery of relevant documents in that
                        they had not listed any notes of meetings, time sheets and working
                        papers.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_33-p2_c"></a>(c)     JRO
                        might also wish to amend her pleadings again. Although she said (in para 41
                        of the Main Affidavit) that this issue could be left aside as it could be
                        the subject of a separate application, she nevertheless saw fit to mention
                        it in the Main Affidavit, thereby suggesting this as yet another reason to
                        vacate the Present Trial Dates. Indeed, the first letter which ETP sent to
                        the Registrar dated 5 August 2011 after ETP was re-appointed mentioned
                        the amendment to pleadings as the first out of nine items to be considered
                        at a PTC which ETP was asking for. The ninth item was the vacating of the
                        Present Trial Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     D1 and D2 resisted the Present Summons on the
                    basis that JRO “had a clear history of flagrantly defaulting on the
                    directions given by the Court, and of causing repeated delays to the trial of
                    the Suit” (see para 6 of Chan Kheng Tek’s (“Chan”)
                    affidavit of 10 August 2011). They also alleged that any further delay in
                    the trial of the present Action, which was commenced in 2006, would be
                    prejudicial to them. In arguments, D3 adopted a similar approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I attach hereto Annex A which is a chronology
                    of the events referred to by the parties for the Present Summons. This will
                    facilitate understanding of the allegations and
                counter-allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The first and foremost of JRO’s
                    allegations was that she was unable to comply with the Present Directions and
                    determine related trial issues without the help of solicitors. This is different
                    from saying that it was preferable for her to have had such help. I did not
                    accept JRO’s allegation. My reasons were as follows (not in order of
                    importance):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     JRO is an intelligent
                    person.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     She has no
                        difficulty with the English language.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     At the main hearing of OS 939, she faced off with two
                        senior and experienced counsel acting for different
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_d"></a>(d)     She is
                        familiar with the Rules of Court. Counsel for D1 and D2 pointed to an
                        instance in Suit 156 when it was she who cited a provision from the
                        Rules.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_e"></a>(e)     The
                        initial Statement of Claim comprising 93 pages was “essentially
                        done” by JRO with help from a lawyer friend (see para 10 of the Main
                        Affidavit) although she also alleged that it became “clear to me that
                        I could not run this case by myself and that I needed legal
                        representation” (see para 28 of the Main
                    Affidavit).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_f"></a>(f)     On
                        27 May 2009, she filed further and better particulars comprising 176
                        pages (although part of it was subsequently struck out as they were not in
                        the nature of further and better particulars).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_g"></a>(g)     At the first hearing of Summons No 3051 of 2009
                        (filed by D1 and D2 to strike out part of JRO’s further and better
                        particulars) on 12 June 2009, she said that she was happy to file her
                        AEICs that day. This was still before she appointed ETP on 24 June
                        2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_h"></a>(h)     At the
                        1 April PTC, she did not disclose to the court or the solicitors for
                        the defendants that she would not be able to comply with the Present
                        Directions without help from solicitors which in turn depended on the
                        reassessment of her funding to be finalised.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_h_1"></a>(h)     JRO did not mention in the Main Affidavit that
                        she had asked ETP to set aside time to act for her to comply with the
                        Present Directions in the event she obtained the funding which she herself
                        suggested she was expecting. Indeed, her lead counsel Ms Engeline Teh,
                        SC (“Ms Teh”) had made her own travel plans to be away from
                        Singapore between 8 to 30 September 2011which is a critical time
                        just before and during the Present Trial Dates (commencing 26 September
                        2011) even though all the AEICs would have been exchanged by
                        2 September 2011 if timelines were met. Ms Teh later clarified
                        that she would be back in the office on 27 September 2011 but my point
                        remains the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The matters set out above suggested that JRO
                    was able to go it alone if need be, but that she was not intending to meet the
                    timelines under the Present Directions. She had decided to prolong the Present
                    Action by applying later rather than earlier to vacate the Present Trial Dates.
                    If a late application was successful, then new trial dates would probably be
                    after 2011. JRO was of course entitled to reappoint ETP, but she was not
                    entitled to use it as an excuse for not complying with the Present Directions
                    and to seek to vacate the Present Trial Dates. I accept that it would be
                    preferable for JRO to have the help of solicitors but, as mentioned above, that
                    is different from saying that she was unable to comply without such
                help.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether absence of legal advice is relevant </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Counsel for D1 and D2, Mr Ang Cheng Hock, SC
                    (“Mr Ang”) submitted that poverty and the absence of legal advice
                    was no excuse for a lay litigant to fail to comply with court orders or rules of
                    court. He relied on a High Court decision and two District Court decisions:
                        <em>Singapura Building Society Limited v Djie Sui Tjhiang and
                        others</em> [1996] SGHC 211, <em>Chong Fook
                        Choy v Alvin Liau</em> [2001] SGDC 187 and <em>DK v DL</em> [2004] SGDC 199. I hesitate to say
                    that the absence of legal advice is always irrelevant. It seems to me that it is
                    one factor in the assessment of the overall circumstances behind a
                    person’s failure to comply with court orders or rules of court. I need say
                    no more for the time being in the light of the circumstances leading to the
                    Present Summons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Why JRO did not inform A&amp;G that she was applying for extensions
                of time in respect of the Present Directions and Present Trial Dates until
                3 August 2011</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     I now come to JRO’s allegations about
                    the reasons for the delay in the reassessment of funding and for not making her
                    application earlier for an extension of time to comply with the Present
                    Directions or to vacate the Present Trial Dates. I did not accept JRO’s
                    allegations. She sought to explain the delay in her funding but made general
                    allegations without specific details or corroborating evidence. Indeed, some of
                    her explanations were contradicted by other evidence which I will elaborate on
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     According to JRO, she already knew that her
                    funding was being reassessed before 1 April 2011 and that she would not be
                    able to comply with the Present Directions without help from solicitors. She
                    alleged that she was not even able to determine who her witnesses would be
                    without such help. She implied that ETP was aware of this since she had already
                    told them on 3 March 2011 to stop substantive work. If all these were true,
                    then JRO had three options for the 1 April PTC which ETP attended:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     to disclose to the court and the
                        defendants that it was uncertain when the reassessment of her funding would
                        be finalised and that since that would in turn affect JRO’s access to
                        solicitors and the meeting of the timelines to be given, it would be
                        preferable to defer directions on the timelines till the reassessment was
                        finalised;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     to
                        disclose the above and receive the timelines first but with the
                        qualification that if the reassessment was not finalised by a certain
                        deadline, then new timelines would have to be sought; or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_c"></a>(c)     to remain silent about the
                        reassessment but to bear in mind internally some sort of deadline for the
                        reassessment to be finalised failing which she would have to inform the
                        court and other parties of her situation and make the necessary application
                        for extension of time and for vacating of the Present Trial
                    Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Ms Teh had two points. First, she suggested
                    that JRO was afraid for ETP to raise the question about the reassessment of her
                    funding at the 1 April PTC as JRO did not know whether it would be
                    well-received. Secondly, she also said that all parties knew at all material
                    times that JRO needed funding to progress with her case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I will deal with the second point first. It
                    was one thing to say that the defendants knew that JRO needed funding to
                    progress with her case. It was another to suggest that they knew that (a) her
                    funding was being reassessed and (b) without such funding she could not progress
                    with her case at all. It was not clear to me whether and when the defendants
                    knew about (a) and, in any event, Ms Teh did not suggest (b) at
                all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As regards the first point, ETP was still
                    acting for JRO as at 1 April 2011 although they were not supposed to do
                    substantive work for her in the meantime. It would have been a simple matter for
                    them to advise her that she had nothing to lose by being candid and taking
                    either of the first two options. After all, it was not a secret that JRO needed
                    funding if she wanted to engage solicitors. If the court was not sympathetic,
                    JRO would at least have been candid with the court and the defendants.
                    Furthermore, Ms Teh’s first point was not mentioned by JRO herself in
                    the Main Affidavit. JRO gave no explanation as to why she did not take the first
                    or the second option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Whatever the reason, JRO opted for the third
                    option.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Even then, if the help of ETP was truly
                    critical, then JRO and ETP would have discussed internally as to the deadline
                    when the reassessment would have to be finalised in order for her to continue
                    using ETP’s services given that ETP would themselves need time to help her
                    to meet the Present Directions. Once that deadline was passed, then JRO would
                    have to immediately go back to court to seek an extension of time and probably a
                    vacation of the Present Trial Dates. Yet, there was apparently no such
                    discussion and no internal deadline to look out for. That was why JRO never went
                    back to court until after she spoke to A&amp;G on 3 August
                2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     JRO’s position appeared to be that she
                    had good reason for expecting that the reassessment would be finalised in good
                    time for ETP to help her but that the reassessment was delayed because of
                    certain developments which I will come to later. However, even if the
                    allegations about delay were true, there would still have been some internal
                    deadline by which she would evaluate the need to seek an extension of time for
                    the Present Directions and the vacating of the Present Trial Dates. Yet, she did
                    not mention any internal deadline after which she had to make the necessary
                    applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     For all of JRO’s allegations about her
                    expectations and the purported delays in the reassessment, her allegations
                    remained vague and general without specific details. When was the initial date
                    that she expected the reassessment to be finalised and the reason for that date?
                    If there were really reasons that delayed the reassessment, what was the second
                    estimated date of finalisation and if there was further delay, what was the
                    third estimated date of finalisation and so forth? Such details were not
                    given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I come back to JRO’s allegation that the
                    reassessment of the funding was delayed. She gave two reasons which she alleged
                    were caused by the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     First, on or about 30 April 2011, D1
                    applied to bifurcate the trial so that only liability would be dealt with first.
                    If liability was established then the second tranche would deal with the quantum
                    of JRO’s damages. She alleged that because there might be two tranches,
                    the funders had to address the further concern of a yet further increase in the
                    budget. This further delayed the reassessment exercise. When the application was
                    heard on 15 June 2011, she had ceased engaging ETP (because of lack of
                    funding) and, as she was not sure what the proper considerations were with
                    regards to a bifurcation, she merely agreed to the application. There was no
                    corroboration by the funders about this reason for delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     I did not accept that the funders were further
                    concerned with a bifurcation. In my view, they would have welcomed the
                    bifurcation instead if they had truly been informed about it by JRO. A
                    bifurcation would allow them to see if JRO would first be successful in
                    establishing liability against the defendants. If she was, then they would be
                    encouraged to fund her for the next tranche. If she failed at the first tranche,
                    she would have incurred less costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Secondly, it was not true that JRO was not
                    sure as to what the proper considerations were with regard to a bifurcation. The
                    minutes of a hearing on 11 May 2011 for the application for bifurcation
                    recorded JRO as saying that when she was acting in person, the trial was already
                    bifurcated but it was D1 who asked for it not to be bifurcated. While counsel
                    for D1 disputed JRO’s allegation that it was D1 who had asked for it not
                    to be bifurcated, the point is that JRO already knew what the consequences of a
                    bifurcation was about.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     More importantly, the same minutes record that
                    JRO had said that the funding had been approved “already”. She was
                    then seeking an adjournment of three weeks for the funds to come in and her
                    solicitors would then be reappointed. In my view, she had either lied about
                    D1’s application causing a delay in the reassessment or about the funding
                    having been approved or both.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I also refer to a letter which JRO had
                    procured recently to show that her funding was in place and that there would be
                    no risk of the lack of further funding in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     This was a letter dated 16 August 2011
                    sent on behalf of Bob Gordon, managing director of 1st Class Legal (IS) Limited
                    (“1st Class Legal”) which represented “the Fund and the
                    After the Event Insurance providers” involved in funding JRO. It was not
                    signed by him as he was out of the United Kingdom and the name and designation
                    of the actual signatory were not disclosed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In any event, the second and third paras of
                    the letter also suggested that JRO’s allegation that D1’s
                    application had delayed the reassessment was untrue. These paras state:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We wish to inform this Honourable Court that due to some funding issues
                        that had arisen sometime in the first quarter of this year there was a
                        suspension of funding for Ms Ong for a period of time. This had led
                        unfortunately to a suspension of legal representation for Ms Ong in
                        this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, we confirm that Ms Ong’s new funding arrangements in
                        this suit have now been finalised and confirmed. Ms Ong has signed a
                        fee agreement with her lawyers, Engelin Teh Practice LLC such that there
                        will not be any further issue of legal representation for Ms Ong being
                        suspended before the conclusion of the trial for reasons of lack of
                        funding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     As can be seen, the funding issues which
                    caused a suspension of funding arose in the first quarter of the year. There was
                    no mention that there were further issues thereafter that delayed the
                    reassessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     I come now to JRO’s second reason which
                    caused the delay in the reassessment. She said that even as the funding was
                    being reassessed, D3 had applied on or about 11 May 2011 to strike out
                    substantial portions of her Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1). This caused the
                    funders even greater concern because if D3 was successful, the whole funding
                    might have to be aborted. As a result, the reassessment process was kept at a
                    standstill pending the resolution of this application (which was eventually
                    unsuccessful).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Yet, as I mentioned above, the letter dated
                    16 August 2011 did not mention that there were issues after the first
                    quarter of the year that delayed the reassessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     More importantly, I refer again to the minutes
                    of the hearing on 11 May 2011. I reiterate that she had then said that the
                    funding had been approved “already”. If the suggestion is that the
                    funding had been approved before D3’s application was filed and served
                    (and on this there was no elaboration by JRO), why then did she not immediately
                    tell the court and the defendants thereafter that D3’s application had
                    subsequently derailed the approval? Having said that the approval had been
                    given, it was incumbent on her to immediately correct the information if and
                    when it was no longer true. That she did not do so suggested that her allegation
                    about this reason for delay was also untrue. No specific details were given by
                    her as to what and when she told the funders about developments in the case and
                    what and when were their responses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     I add that in fact D3’s application was
                    not the surprise that JRO was implying. At the 1 April PTC, D3’s
                    counsel had already orally mentioned that D3 would be applying to strike out
                    parts of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1). That is why the court gave D3
                    a deadline to file his application, as I mentioned above at <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a>. This information would presumably have been
                    conveyed by ETP to JRO who would in turn have conveyed it to the funders if she
                    was being entirely candid with them. Yet she said on 11 May 2011 that the
                    funding had been approved “already”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In my view, JRO had not established that
                    either of the two reasons had delayed the reassessment.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Why was JRO unable to extract the order of 1 April 2011 by
                6 June 2011 with the names of witnesses?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     I come now to JRO’s failure to extract
                    the order of 1 April 2011 by 6 June 2011 which was supposed to contain
                    the names of the witnesses for all the parties. This failure in itself did not
                    jeopardise the Present Trial Dates but JRO’s failure to meet various
                    extensions of time to do so and her untrue reasons to explain herself
                    demonstrated her contumelious conduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Paras 13 to 19 of the affidavit of Chan of
                    10 August 2011 set out the sequence of events on this point from the
                    1 April PTC up to 3 August 2011 when JRO contacted A&amp;G. These
                    paras stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    In light of the aforesaid Court's directions,
                            A&amp;G wrote to the Plaintiff on 31 May 2011 on behalf of the 1st
                            and 2nd Defendants to request for a copy of her draft Order of Court
                            setting out the names and capacities of the witnesses that she intends
                            to call at the trial of the Suit, so that they could then endorse on the
                            draft Order of Court the names and capacities of the 1st and 2nd
                            Defendants' intended witnesses, in time for the Order of Court setting
                            out the names and capacities of the parties' witnesses to be extracted
                            by 6 June 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    The Plaintiff did not respond to A&amp;G's letter.
                            By 6 June 2011, the Plaintiff had yet to extract the Order of Court
                            setting out the names and capacities of the parties' witnesses. Instead,
                            at the hearing of an unrelated summons in the Suit on 16 June 2011,
                            the Plaintiff sought and obtained an extension of time until
                            30 June 2011 for the Order of Court setting out the names and
                            capacities of the witnesses to be extracted.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    Again, the Plaintiff failed to comply with the
                            Court's directions to extract the Order of Court setting out the names
                            and capacities of the witnesses by 30 June 2011. This was despite
                            the fact that A&amp;G had written to the Plaintiff to remind her of the
                            said deadline on 29 June 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    On or around 4 July 2011, the Plaintiff
                            contacted A&amp;G, requesting for a further extension of time for the
                            Order of Court setting out the names and capacities of the witnesses to
                            be extracted, to 7 July 2011. However, the Plaintiff again failed
                            to extract the Order of Court setting out the names and capacities of
                            the witnesses by that date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    On 15 July 2011, A&amp;G wrote to the
                            Plaintiff by way of email, requesting for the Plaintiff's draft Order of
                            Court setting out the names and capacities of the Plaintiff's intended
                            witnesses by 18 July 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    By 18 July 2011, the Plaintiff had not
                            provided the Defendants with her draft Order of Court setting out the
                            names and capacities of her intended witnesses. Neither did she even
                            respond to the email from A&amp;G.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    On 3 August 2011, I understand that A&amp;G
                            received a telephone call from the Plaintiff in the late afternoon.
                            During this call, the Plaintiff informed A&amp;G that she was in no
                            position to prepare and finalise the AEICs of her factual witnesses and
                            indicated that she would be filing an urgent application within "24
                            hours" to extend all timelines in the Suit, including a vacation of the
                            trial dates in the Suit. I must stress that this was the first time that
                            the Plaintiff had indicated that she would not be able to comply with
                            the existing timelines in the Suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     JRO did not dispute the above version of
                    events. Her reasons for not complying were the same, <em>ie</em>, that she could not determine who should be called as her
                    witnesses without the benefit of solicitors’ advice and she needed funding
                    to obtain such advice. She had sought various extensions of time as she was
                    hopeful that on each occasion the reassessment would be finalised and she would
                    be able to get such advice in time (see paras 31 to 33 of the Main
                    Affidavit).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As can be seen from Chan’s affidavit,
                    the following extensions of time came into play after JRO missed the first
                    deadline of 6 June 2011:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">30 June 2011, being an extension granted by
                            the court at JRO’s request;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">7 July 2011, being a date JRO herself had
                            suggested; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">18 July 2011, being an extension which
                            A&amp;G was giving to JRO but which she failed again to
                        meet.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Again, the Main Affidavit was bereft of
                    specific details and corroborating evidence to support JRO’s allegations.
                    For example, on what basis did she believe that the reassessment of her funding
                    would be completed and advice from solicitors obtained to meet her first
                    suggested extension of 30 June 2011 or even her own second suggested
                    extension of 7 July 2011? Furthermore, at that time, she did not disclose
                    to the court or the defendants any particular reason which hindered or precluded
                    her from complying.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     More importantly, her general allegation that
                    she could not determine who should be called as her witnesses without the
                    benefit of solicitors’ advice gave the wrong impression.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     As Ms Teh accepted in submissions before
                    me, Ms Teh’s colleague, Mr Anthony Soh, had already said at the
                    1 April PTC that JRO had five witnesses of fact. ETP knew that the major
                    ones were JRO and another person who was present at the relevant meetings. As
                    for expert witnesses, there were three – one for accounting, one for
                    valuation of property and one on the IVA (see [32(b)] above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     Ms Teh sought to give the following
                    elaboration from the bar. She said that the second main factual witness was one
                    David Chin (“Mr Chin”). However, Mr Chin had not been interviewed
                    yet and so it was unclear whether he would cooperate. The interview was to be
                    done by JRO’s solicitors after the reassessment of her funding had been
                    finalised. I found this explanation to be remarkable, <em>ie</em>, that over the time before ETP was appointed and even after
                    the time they were appointed from 24 June 2009 to 3 March 2011
                    including the time when ETP assisted JRO to prepare, file and serve a 270-page
                    Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1), they had no idea whether Mr Chin was going
                    to co-operate. They were apparently content to leave this dangling in the air
                    until her funding had been finalised and also without disclosing the
                    “truth” to explain JRO’s delay in meeting with the original
                    deadline and the various extensions of time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In any event, the name of Mr Chin could have
                    been provided first and likewise, for the other three witnesses of fact. If any
                    declined to co-operate, he/she could be dropped.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Secondly, Ms Teh said that while JRO did
                    initially have a report from her accounting expert, JRO was no longer calling
                    that expert. JRO did have a new expert in mind when Ms Teh’s
                    colleague referred to an accounting expert on 1 April 2011 but that expert
                    still had not been briefed. As for the other two experts, they had not been
                    briefed yet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     I found the explanation of Ms Teh about
                    the accounting expert even more remarkable. From what I understood from her,
                    this new accounting expert was someone from a different firm altogether. If that
                    was correct, how could JRO proceed to obtain trial dates without even knowing
                    what the new expert was going to say? His opinion might not support her pleaded
                    case or might cause her to amend her pleadings. Surely JRO had to obtain this
                    new opinion first unless the opinion was immaterial to most of the issues or she
                    already knew who he was and what he was going to say, in which case, she had no
                    reason to say she was unable to provide his name.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     As for the other two experts, JRO could also
                    have provided their names first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Ms Teh’s explanations raised even
                    more questions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Furthermore, I make the same point again. If
                    the lack of funding and the absence of solicitors’ advice was as critical
                    as JRO was saying, she would have had her own internal deadline as to when the
                    reassessment of funding had to be finalised, failing which she would have had to
                    seek an extension of time for the Present Directions and perhaps the vacating of
                    the Present Trial Dates. Also, there would have been no need for any funding for
                    ETP to inform JRO about simple points such as the time needed by ETP to assist
                    JRO in complying with each and every one of the Present
                Directions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In addition, Ms Teh’s explanations
                    for JRO’s failure to extract the order were not found in the Main
                    Affidavit. Indeed, para 31 of the Main Affidavit gave a different
                    explanation. JRO said that without the benefit of advice of solicitors, she
                    could not determine who should be called as witnesses for her,
                    “especially given the amendments that have taken place to the Statement
                    of Claim as filed on 27 January 2010”. That was an absurd
                    explanation. Those amendments had been completed about 14 months before the
                    1 April PTC and I reiterate that on 1 April 2011, one of her
                    solicitors had already mentioned the number of her witnesses and Ms Teh
                    accepted that ETP knew who they were.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     I would like to mention at this juncture one
                    other point. JRO gave the impression that she lacked access to legal advice from
                    3 March 2011 until 4 August 2011 because of lack of funds. However, a
                    litigation search conducted by A&amp;G disclosed that, in fact, the very same
                    legal firm (<em>ie</em>, ETP) had been doing substantive
                    work for JRO in another action, <em>ie</em>, Originating
                    Summons No 1022 of 2010 (“OS 1022”) between at least May and
                    July 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     OS 1022 was an action in which JRO was
                    applying to appoint an accountant, Chee Yoh Chuang as trustee of the estate of
                    JRO’s father-in-law, the same estate which was the subject of OS 939, in
                    place of LLH and another person. When this information was revealed, JRO’s
                    explanation was that that action was funded from a different source. Even if
                    this were true, it illustrated resourcefulness on her part and also suggested a
                    lack of full candour by her. She must have been in contact with ETP during the
                    relevant period and could have easily obtained their guidance as to the
                    estimated time they needed if they were truly needed to assist her in relation
                    to the Present Directions and the Present Trial Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Indeed, para 13(j) of the Main Affidavit
                    stated that “ETP had repeatedly cautioned me since 3 March 2011 that
                    ETP would not be able to conduct the trial of this Action should they be
                    reappointed too close to the trial dates and should the matters directed to be
                    done during the 1 April 2011 PTC remain outstanding”. Yet no
                    explanation was forthcoming from JRO as to why she left it so late to start
                    asking for extensions of time and the vacating of the Present Trial Dates. It
                    was not sufficient to say that the reassessment of her funding had been delayed.
                    Based on her own version of the facts, she must have known that it was not
                    forthcoming yet, whatever the reasons. She knew ETP needed time to help her but
                    did not bother to establish just how much time they needed. She did not act
                    until 3 August 2011 when she telephoned A&amp;G.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Past delays or defaults by JRO</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I come now to the past delays or defaults of
                    JRO as well as the vacation of the first set of trial dates from 6 July
                    2009 to 31 July 2009 which the defendants say was caused by her. The
                    defendants relied on these events to demonstrate JRO’s contumelious
                    conduct. Paras 8 to 10 of Chan’s affidavit of 10 August 2011
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8.    The Court first
                            fixed timelines for the filing and exchange of the parties' AEICs on
                            19 December 2008, at a PTC in the Suit. At that time, the Court had
                            directed parties to file and exchange their respective AEICs on
                            17 April 2009. The trial of the Suit was also fixed to be heard
                            from 6 July 2009 to 31 July
                            2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9.    However, as a result of
                            the Plaintiff's repeated failure to comply with the Court's directions,
                            the deadline for the filing and exchange of AEICs came to be extended
                            twice and the trial dates thereafter came to be
                            vacated.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10.    The sequence of
                            events leading up to the vacation of the trial dates fixed in July 2009
                            is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">i.    On 20 February 2009, at the hearing of a
                                PTC in the action, the 1<sup>st </sup>and
                                    2<sup>nd </sup>Defendants' solicitors, Allen
                                &amp; Gledhill LLP ("A&amp;G"), informed the Court about certain
                                documents or pages in the documents furnished to them from the
                                Plaintiff's List of Documents ("PLOD") which were extremely
                                illegible and/or missing. The Plaintiff, who was present at the PTC,
                                informed the Court that she would attend to their request for the
                                documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">ii.    On 4 March 2009, A&amp;G wrote to the
                                Plaintiff enclosing a list of the illegible and/or missing documents
                                and requesting for copies of the documents itemised in the said list
                                by 13 March 2009. The Plaintiff wrote to A&amp;G on
                                5 March 2009, confirming that she would arrange for copies of
                                the requested documents to be provided to A&amp;G by the close of
                                business on 13 March 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">iii.   The Plaintiff did not provide copies of the
                                requested documents to A&amp;G by the close of business on
                                13 March 2009, as initially agreed. Instead, on 17 March
                                2009, the Plaintiff wrote to A&amp;G again, indicating that she
                                hoped to respond to A&amp;G's request with copies of certain of the
                                documents by 20 March 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">iv.    In view of the large number of illegible
                                and/or missing documents which the Plaintiff had yet to provide to

                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants, the

                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants were of the view that
                                it would be extremely difficult for them to meet the deadline of
                                17 April 2009 to file and exchange the AEICs. Accordingly, on
                                18 March 2009, the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants filed an application
                                by way of Summons No. 1245 of 2009/Q, for an extension of time for
                                the date for the filing and exchange of parties' AEICs, on the basis
                                that the extension of time was necessary to afford the Plaintiff
                                further time to furnish A&amp;G with the requested documents and for
                                A&amp;G to review, consider and take the
                                    1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants' instructions on such
                                documents for the purposes of the AEICs.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">v.    Summons No. 1245 of 2009/Q was heard by the
                                Court on 25 March 2009. At that time, the Plaintiff had yet to
                                furnish A&amp;G with any of the requested documents, notwithstanding
                                that she had promised to do so by 20 March 2009. The Court granted
                                the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants' application,
                                extending the time for the filing and exchange of parties' AEICs to
                                29 May 2009, upon the assurance of all the parties, including the
                                Plaintiff, that the said extension of time for the filing and
                                exchange of parties' AEICs would not affect the trial of the Suit,
                                which was then scheduled for hearing between 6 July and 31 July
                                2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">vi.    On 26 March 2009 an affidavit sworn by the
                                Plaintiff was filed and served on the 1<sup>st</sup>
                                and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants. The Plaintiff stated
                                in her affidavit that she was objecting to A&amp;G's request for
                                copies of certain documents and that she would be arranging for
                                copies of the remaining documents to be made and for these to be
                                provided to A&amp;G by 27 March 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">vii.   Yet, on 27 March 2009, the Plaintiff failed
                                to furnish A&amp;G with any of the requested documents, even those
                                she did not object to.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">viii.   On 31 March 2009, the Plaintiff finally
                                furnished A&amp;G with copies of some of the requested documents,
                                but omitted a large portion of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">ix.    The 1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd </sup>Defendant thus had no choice
                                [but] to file an application on 9 April 2009, by way of Summons No.
                                1667 of 2009/L for an order that the Plaintiff furnish the
                                    1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants with copies of the
                                omitted documents. Summons No. 1667 of 2009/L was fixed to be heard
                                on 22 April 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">x.    On 20 April 2009, the Plaintiff informed
                                A&amp;G by way of a telephone call that she was agreeable to the
                                orders prayed for in Summons No. 1667 of 2009/L. Thus, at the
                                hearing of Summons No. 1667 of 2009/L on 22 April 2009, an
                                order-in-terms of the Summons was granted. The Plaintiff was
                                required to furnish the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants with copies of the
                                documents in question within ten (10) days of 22 April 2009, ie., by
                                2 May 2009. As 2 May 2009 was a Saturday, A&amp;G informed the
                                Plaintiff via email that they would be prepared to receive the
                                documents by the close of business the Monday the following week,
                                ie.,4 May 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">xi.    However, for the fourth time, and in utter
                                defiance of the Order of Court, the Plaintiff failed to furnish
                                A&amp;G with any of the documents in question by 4 May
                            2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">xii.   The 1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants thus had no choice but
                                to make yet another application for the deadline for the filing and
                                exchange of the parties' AEICs to be further extended. On 5 May
                                2009, the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants filed an application
                                in this regard by way of Summons No. 2085 of 2009/G. In the same
                                Summons, the 1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants also applied for an
                                "unless" order that the Plaintiff be required to furnish the
                                    1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants with copies of the
                                documents in question within 3 days of the order to be made therein,
                                failing which her claim be struck out as against the
                                    1<sup>st</sup> and
                                    2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants. It was only on that
                                date that A&amp;G received copies of the documents in question from
                                the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">xiii.   In view of the tight deadline, however, the
                                Court extended the date for filing and exchange of the parties'
                                respective AEICs to 12 June 2009, but with no change to the trial
                                dates scheduled in July 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">xiv.   On 15 May 2009, the
                                    1<sup>st</sup> Defendant served on the Plaintiff
                                a request for Further and Better Particulars. The request related to
                                only 9 sub-paragraphs in the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim and/or
                                Reply, and was 6 pages in length.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">xv.    However, on 27 May 2009, the Plaintiff filed
                                and served a set of Further and Better Particulars on the
                                    1<sup>st</sup> Defendant which amounted to 176
                                pages. The said Further and Better Particulars included, besides
                                those requested by the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant,
                                voluminous "voluntary particulars" filed by the
                            Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">xvi.   The bulk of the Plaintiff's Further and
                                Better Particulars were, in fact, not particulars but additions
                                and/or amendments to the Plaintiff's claims. Thus, upon the
                                application of the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant filed by
                                way of Summons No. 3051 of 2009 on 8 June 2009, the bulk of the
                                Plaintiff's Further and Better Particulars were struck out by the
                                Court on 17 June 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">xvii.  Pending the Court's orders on 17 June 2009,
                                the deadline for the filing and exchange of AEICs had been held in
                                abeyance. Thus, a PTC in the action was convened on 19 June 2009 for
                                parties to take fresh deadlines for the filing and exchange of
                                AEICs. Given that the trial was scheduled to commence on 6 July
                                2009, the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant was aware that
                                the deadlines for the filing and exchange of AEICs would be tight,
                                but was nevertheless prepared to proceed on that basis. However, the
                                Plaintiff informed the Court at the PTC that she would be applying
                                to amend her Statement of Claim in the action substantially. This
                                led the Court to then vacate the trial dates in the
                            action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Although the above sequence of events set out
                    by Chan was not disputed, Ms Teh sought to turn the table against the
                    defendants with the following arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     First, Ms Teh submitted that JRO’s
                    list of documents had been filed as early as 18 March 2008. It was only
                    about a year later on 20 February 2009 that A&amp;G chose to raise issues
                    with regard to documents disclosed by JRO. On the other hand, Mr Ang Cheng Hock,
                    counsel for D1 and D2 informed me that there was a stay of the proceedings for
                    part of that intervening period pending the provision of security for costs by
                    JRO to all the defendants.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     It seemed to me that even if, for the sake of
                    argument, A&amp;G had raised objections late, the point was whether the
                    objections were valid and would in themselves have affected the trial dates
                    between 6 to 31 July 2009 (“the First Trial
                Dates”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     JRO said she wanted to and did initially want
                    to object to a large part of A&amp;G’s request for the documents but the
                    fact of the matter is that she did agree to their requests and then failed to
                    comply with the requests by the timelines which she herself had agreed
                    to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Nevertheless, Ms Teh submitted that the
                    documents which A&amp;G were asking for were actually from documents seized from
                    others by D1 in OS 939 pursuant to an APO and subsequently retained by D1. The
                    documents (or copies) were then provided to JRO by D1. JRO’s set of
                    documents were scanned from the set that D1 had. If there were illegible or
                    missing documents, D1 would nevertheless have their own set of the
                    documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Ms Teh submitted that the conduct of D1 and
                    D2, through A&amp;G, in pressing for documents which D1 already had was
                    “reprehensible and disingenuous” and “reprehensible and
                    indefensible”. She submitted that these defendants had
                    “bombarded” JRO with their requests and this was a
                    “concerted attack” to prevent JRO from preparing her AEICs and
                    proceeding with the First Trial Dates (see paras 41 to 51 of Ms Teh’s
                    written submissions). In short, Ms Teh was submitting that JRO, who was not
                    then represented by solicitors, was at a disadvantage against unfair tactics by
                    these defendants and it was these tactics that caused both sides to be unable to
                    exchange their AEICs by the relevant dates. She even went so far as to submit
                    that the vacation of the First Trial Dates was effectively caused by such
                    conduct and not by JRO.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Yet, significantly, Ms Teh did not
                    suggest that JRO need not have disclosed documents in her possession which were
                    relevant to her claims just because such documents were also in the possession
                    of D1. Once it was accepted that JRO was obliged to disclose documents in her
                    possession (which she thought were relevant to her claims) then it followed that
                    she was also obliged to give copies of the same to D1 and D2. Indeed, this was
                    also not disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The copies which JRO forwarded to A&amp;G
                    should be as legible as possible. If JRO had forwarded the best copies she could
                    reasonably have done in the circumstances, then she should have told A&amp;G
                    accordingly and left it to them to make their own copies if they disagreed. She
                    did not take that stand. Instead, she agreed to provide better copies and asked
                    for extensions of time based on dates she herself had suggested or agreed to.
                    Furthermore, A&amp;G’s complaint was not only about illegible copies but
                    about missing copies too.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     It seemed to me that the various delays in
                    this regard have to be attributed to JRO and not D1 and D2.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     As for JRO’s attempt to include material
                    in further and better particulars which were in fact additions or amendments to
                    her claims, JRO suggested that she did not know better. She thought it was
                    better to give more than less information (see para 26 of the Main
                    Affidavit).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Assuming that she was to be believed, the
                    point was that A&amp;G was entitled to take steps to oppose any attempt by her
                    to raise new claims.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Ultimately, the point was still what caused
                    the vacation of the First Trial Dates. Ms Teh submitted that it was the
                    tactics of D1 and D2. That was the reason why parties like D1 and D2 and JRO
                    were unable to meet the then timelines to exchange AEICs. She also submitted
                    that D1 and D2 would not have been able to be ready for trial by the First Trial
                    Dates, a point which Chan did not agree with.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     It seemed to me that while various parties had
                    missed earlier timelines to exchange AEICs for the First Trial Dates, the real
                    reason why the court vacated such dates was JRO’s intention to amend her
                    Statement of Claim. That was the reason given by JRO in the Main Affidavit for
                    vacating such dates. That was the reason the court acted on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     This is reinforced by two facts. If JRO had
                    not mentioned at the PTC on 19 June 2009 her intention to amend the
                    Statement of Claim, the court could have given new timelines at that PTC to
                    exchange AEICs to meet the First Trial Dates commencing 6 July 2009. If
                    necessary, the court could also immediately have given new trial dates to
                    replace the First Trial Dates. The court did neither of these steps because
                    JRO’s intended application to amend had not even been filed at that
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Secondly, JRO was ordered to pay costs to all
                    the defendants for the vacation of the First Trial Dates. I rejected
                    Ms Teh’s submission that because the quantum of costs which JRO was
                    to pay was much lower than that sought by the defendants, this suggested that
                    JRO was not to blame. The fact that JRO was ordered to pay costs in principle
                    (whatever the quantum) supported the argument that she was responsible for the
                    vacation. Besides, the defendants had appealed against the quantum she was
                    ordered to pay and that issue was, on appeal, reserved to the trial judge (in
                    Registrar’s Appeal Nos 451 and 452 of 2009).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     I concluded that Ms Teh’s attempts
                    to shift the blame for the vacation of the First Trial Dates onto D1 and D2 were
                    themselves disingenuous. In addition, I was of the view that the defendants were
                    entitled to rely on the past delays and defaults by JRO to support their
                    contention that her present conduct in 2011 was contumelious.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Overview of the Present Action</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     JRO filed the writ in the Present Action on
                    20 March 2006 to avoid any issue of limitation. After that she apparently
                    did nothing to proceed with her action until about a year later on 5 March
                    2007 when she was directed to serve the writ by 7 May 2007 (not 5 May
                    2007 as alleged by JRO). The writ was served on 2 May 2007. At the next PTC
                    on 14 May 2007 (not 7 May 2007 as alleged by JRO), she was directed to
                    apply formally for an extension of time to serve a Statement of Claim. She did
                    so and her application was heard on 18 June 2007. It was then that she was
                    ordered to file and serve her Statement of Claim by 4pm of 22 June 2007.
                    She managed to prepare and file a 93-page Statement of Claim within that short
                    time frame. The inference is that she would have been content not to pursue her
                    action then until she was directed to do so by taking the steps mentioned
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     JRO explained the long delay from the time she
                    filed the writ on 20 March 2006 to 5 March 2007 by saying she could
                    not afford to pay solicitors to draft the Statement of Claim. Furthermore, she
                    had at that time been evicted from her home and the voluminous documents from OS
                    939 which were required to draft it were warehoused. These were two general
                    allegations. She did not elaborate as to how exactly these reasons caused the
                    long delay. As for her not being able to afford to pay solicitors to draft the
                    Statement of Claim, it transpired that when she was pushed by the court to file
                    and serve a Statement of Claim, she managed to come up with a lengthy one at
                    that time with some help from a lawyer friend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Moving forward to events after the PTC on
                    1 April 2011, I have already said above that I did not accept that she
                    needed the help of solicitors to comply with the Present
                Directions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    It was common ground that JRO spoke to
                    A&amp;G on 3 August 2011 to say that she would be filing an urgent
                    application to extend all timelines given previously as well as to apply to
                    vacate the Present Trial Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    No elaboration was given by JRO as to when
                    exactly she concluded and how she came to conclude that the Present Trial Dates
                    had to be vacated. It is one thing to say that the current timelines had to be
                    extended and another to say that the Present Trial Dates had to be vacated. An
                    extension of current timelines could have been sought without jeopardizing the
                    Present Trial Dates. It appeared that she had already concluded that such
                    vacation was necessary before she reappointed ETP the next day on 4 August
                    2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    JRO and ETP had slightly over seven weeks
                    from 4 August 2011 to 23 September 2011 before the trial would have
                    started on 26 September 2011. True, they might well have needed extensions
                    of time to comply with the timelines given but in my view, they could and ought
                    to have used the seven weeks to work within the start date of 26 September
                    2011 so as not to seek to vacate the Present Trial Dates. In other words, they
                    only needed to apply for extensions of the timelines under the Present
                    Directions but not to vacate the Present Trial Dates. Instead, ETP’s
                    attention was focused on seeking such a vacation as well as opposing the
                    subsequent applications of the defendants to compel JRO to exchange AEICs
                    without more delay and for “unless” orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    I have elaborated above that if JRO really
                    needed the help of ETP, she would have learned from them beforehand as to how
                    much time they needed to prepare and not wait until 4 August 2011 to speak
                    to them and try and apply for a vacation of the Present Trial
                Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Furthermore, when I asked Ms Teh on
                    1 September 2011 as to how much time ETP would need to file the AEICs for
                    JRO’s witnesses (assuming there were no fresh interlocutory applications
                    for discovery or amendments), she herself said that perhaps they needed three
                    weeks although she did say that they needed even more time to take JRO all the
                    way to trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Then at the next hearing on 2 September
                    2011, Ms Teh gave me a much longer time-table which went beyond
                    26 September 2011, just to file the AEICs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    I found such developments revealing just as
                    I did regarding the fact that Ms Teh would herself be out of Singapore in
                    the few weeks before 26 September 2011 (see [36(h)] above). Although
                    Ms Teh assured me that her absence had nothing to do with JRO’s
                    application to vacate the trial dates, I was of the view that it was not as
                    irrelevant as she said. Also, I reiterate that Ms Teh’s travel plans
                    must have been made on the basis that JRO had not requested her and ETP to set
                    time aside to help JRO to file the AEICs and prepare for the trial based on the
                    Present Directions and the Present Trial Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    So for all the protestations by JRO that as
                    the plaintiff she wanted to pursue her claims expeditiously, her conduct
                    demonstrated otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Prejudice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The Present Action has dragged on for more
                    than five years. One of the key witnesses for D1 and D2 would have been Chan Ket
                    Teck (not to be confused with Chan Kheng Tek). He passed away in late
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    With a longer delay, the risk of some other
                    witness passing away increases. A longer delay would also mean a higher risk of
                    memories fading.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    JRO’s serious allegations have been
                    hanging over the heads of the defendants, who are professionals, for a long
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    I was of the view that there was prejudice
                    to the defendants if there was further delay to the trial but I did not rest my
                    decision on this ground alone. This was but one of the factors I took into
                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Possible application for discovery and amendment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    As mentioned above at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>, JRO mentioned that she might wish to file
                    interlocutory applications for discovery and to further amend her Statement of
                    Claim (Amendment No 1).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    As these applications had still not been
                    filed by the time of the hearing of the Present Summons before me, I did not
                    take them into account as factors in favour of the vacation of the Present Trial
                    Dates.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Nevertheless, I should mention that the
                    question of JRO amending her Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) was raised
                    before 1 April 2011. Indeed, JRO was even directed by the court on
                    16 February 2011 to serve the draft Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) on
                    the defendants by 21 March 2011 and to file and serve her formal
                    application to amend by 30 March 2011 if she intended to proceed with an
                    amendment. This was not done. At the 1 April PTC, her counsel confirmed
                    that there was no instruction from her to amend. There was no reservation by her
                    counsel then that she might want to resurrect this issue if her funding was
                    finalised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    The current suggestion that she would want
                    to re-visit the issue of amendment is troubling. I say no more about it for the
                    time being.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">No further issue about funding</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    According to JRO, there will be no further
                    issue of legal representation being suspended now that her funding has been
                    finalised (see para 14 of the Main Affidavit). This implied that she had
                    received such a high level of support to meet all legal expenses whatever the
                    future developments may be. For this proposition, she relied on the letter dated
                    16 August 2011 from 1st Class Legal. I have cited the second and third
                    paras above at <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>. In my view, the third
                    paragraph meant something different. It meant that there would not be any
                    further issue about lack of legal representation due to lack of funding because
                    of a fee agreement which JRO had signed with ETP. It also did not elaborate what
                    it meant by “the conclusion of the trial”. Did that mean the
                    Present Trial Dates only without any further complications or extensions, or did
                    it include all trial dates including new or extended ones and all new
                    interlocutory applications in between?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    While Ms Teh also submitted that there
                    would no longer be a problem about lack of funding, she simply referred to the
                    letter without actually confirming the fee agreement mentioned or the full
                    meaning of the letter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    In any event, I was of the view that
                    assuming that there would be no further problem about a lack of funding, it was
                    still for JRO to first satisfy the court that there was merit in her application
                    to vacate. If she could not cross this threshold, then the letter from 1st Class
                    Legal would not assist her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    I concluded that JRO had abused her position
                    as a lay litigant and her need to obtain funding for legal representation. There
                    was no strong reason to support the Present Summons. There was also a history of
                    failure by her to comply with timelines agreed to by herself and/or imposed by
                    the court. Her explanations were also not bona fide. In the circumstances, I
                    declined to vacate all the Present Trial Dates. Nevertheless, I was of the view
                    that she should be given one more chance to carry out the steps ordered under
                    the Present Directions. For that purpose, I extended the timelines as mentioned
                    above and vacated the first week of the Present Trial Dates as mentioned above
                    (at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>). In the circumstances, I also made
                    “unless” orders as mentioned above (likewise at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>).</p>
