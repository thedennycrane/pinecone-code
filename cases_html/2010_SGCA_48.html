        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an appeal against the decision of the
                    judge (“the Judge”) in <em>ZF v Comptroller of
                        Income Tax</em> [2010] 2 SLR 350 (“<em>ZF
                        (HC)</em>”) holding that certain prefabricated dormitories
                    (“the dormitories”), which were both portable and demountable and
                    intended to be used as temporary accommodation, were not “plant”
                    within the meaning of ss 19 and 19A of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134,
                    2008 Rev Ed) (“the ITA”). Although the ITA is one of the most
                    detailed pieces of legislation in the Singapore statute book, the central
                    concept in the present appeal, the concept of “plant”, is
                    surprisingly not defined in the ITA. Instead, that definition has been
                    elaborated upon in case law. The flexibility that such an approach affords is
                    laudable in light of the myriad forms that “plant” might take.
                    However, the flexibility afforded by such an approach does not come without its
                    difficulties, the chief of which being that the development of case law has, in
                    certain respects, led to the need for a little trimming and pruning as there has
                    been a little bit of overgrowth that has generated, for a time at least, some
                    ambiguity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       It is worth highlighting that it has often been
                    said, and not without justification, that income tax law is intensely factual in
                    its application. This stems from the very nature of this particular sphere of
                    the law itself. The present appeal is no exception. With that in mind, let us
                    now turn first to a brief description of the factual background of this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Appellant and taxpayer in this appeal is
                    [ZF] (“the Appellant”). It was awarded a contract to build and
                    operate workers’ dormitories on a site at [XXX] Road (“the
                    Site”), an area located within an industrial estate. The Site was leased
                    from the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) by a company
                    called [C] Pte Ltd. [C] Pte Ltd had awarded a contract to design, build and
                    operate the workers’ dormitories to a company named [Z] Pte Ltd in June
                    2001. [Z] Pte Ltd did not build the dormitories itself as it wanted to put in
                    place a professionally competent team to operate and manage the dormitories. To
                    this end, the Appellant was incorporated as a joint venture between [Z] Pte Ltd
                    and another company, [F] Pte Ltd. [Z] Pte Ltd then awarded the Appellant the
                    contract to build and operate the dormitories.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The tenancy agreement between BCA and [C] Pte
                    Ltd stipulated that the lease for the Site was for a term of three years
                    beginning 1 December 2001 and that BCA could, at its absolute discretion,
                    grant a fresh tenancy for a another three years, plus a further term of three
                    years subject to certain terms and conditions. Crucially, the tenancy agreement
                    also provided that BCA could require the Site to be vacated within 90 days
                    of any notice given by it in the event that the Site was requisitioned for
                    industrial or other use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Because of the relatively short term of the
                    lease and the 90 days’ notice period to vacate the site, the
                    Appellant found it necessary to construct dormitories that were not permanent
                    structures and which could be dismantled at short notice and minimum cost. Thus,
                    the dormitories were constructed from pre-fabricated structures which were
                    portable and demountable. These portable structures were modular in nature and
                    could be rearranged to fit different configurations and sizes depending on
                    requirements. This also meant that the structures could be dismantled, stored
                    away and re-used on another site.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The dormitories comprised six blocks of
                    three-storey workers’ quarters and a two-storey administration block. Each
                    block was mounted on a concrete foundation and reinforced by steel columns. The
                    “skeleton” of each dormitory was made of steel members assembled
                    together with bolts and nuts, after which panels were inserted between the steel
                    members to form walls. The floor was made of timber and a metal roof was bolted
                    onto each dormitory.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The total cost of installing the dormitories was
                    $3,755,455. From this amount, the Appellant deducted the sum of $1,100,669 as
                    non-qualifying expenditure. Counsel for the Appellant, Mr Leung Yew Kwong
                    (“Mr Leung”), explained at the hearing before the Income Tax
                    Board of Review (“the Board”) that this sum of $1,100,669 related
                    to expenditure on permanent structures which the Appellant accepted did not
                    qualify for capital allowances. He cited examples such as the foundational works
                    for the dormitories as well as a brick building which had been used as a canteen
                    for the workers. A further $37,198 was also deducted by the Appellant as revenue
                    expenditure. This left a balance of $2,617,588 which constituted capital
                    expenditure incurred on the movable parts of the dormitories. The Appellant made
                    a claim for capital allowances for the Year of Assessment 2004 in respect of
                    this sum on the basis that the dormitories constituted “plant”
                    within the meaning of ss 19 and 19A of the ITA. The claim was disallowed by
                    the Comptroller of Income Tax (“the Respondent”) and the Appellant
                    appealed to the Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Board’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Board dismissed the Appellant’s
                    appeal. In its grounds of decision (see <em>ZF v Comptroller of
                        Income Tax</em> [2008] SGITBR 2 (“<em>ZF
                        (ITBR)</em>”)), the Board reviewed the authorities and held (at
                    [32]) that a building or structure may constitute “plant” where it
                    was more appropriate to describe it as an apparatus for carrying on the
                    business, rather than the place in which the business was conducted. Applying
                    the law to the facts, the Board found that the Appellant’s business was
                    the provision of accommodation to workers. The fact that the dormitories
                    happened to be portable or demountable was of no consequence because the
                    Appellant was not required, for the purposes of its trade, to use portable or
                    demountable structures to construct the dormitories. Accordingly, the Board
                    concluded (at [47]) that the dormitories were not “plant” because
                    they remained as the buildings or premises used for the conduct of the
                    Appellant’s trade or business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judge’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Appellant’s appeal from the Board to
                    the High Court was similarly dismissed. In his Judgment, the Judge held (see
                        <em>ZF (HC)</em> at [11]) that for a particular asset
                    to constitute “plant”, it had to pass two tests: (1) the
                    “functional” or “business use” test; and
                    (2) the “premises” test. The “functional” test
                    entailed looking at the function of the particular asset in the context of the
                    taxpayer’s business (see <em>ZF (HC)</em> at [13]).
                    Under the “premises” test, an asset would not qualify as
                    “plant” if it functioned as premises (see <em>ZF
                        (HC)</em> at [31]). On the facts, the Judge concluded that the
                    dormitories passed the “functional” test but failed the
                    “premises” test because their only function was to provide
                    accommodation, this being the typical function of premises (see <em>ZF (HC)</em> at [35]–[37]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Appellant had argued below that its
                    business was not just the mere provision of accommodation but, viewed in the
                    entire context of its business cycle, involved the dismantling and relocation of
                    the dormitories to other sites. As such, it was argued that the portability and
                    demountability of the dormitories was an additional function, and that,
                    accordingly, the dormitories were not just used to provide accommodation. This
                    argument was rejected by the Judge. Although he accepted that it was
                    commercially necessary for the Appellant to construct portable and demountable
                    dormitories given the nature of the lease over the Site, he held (at [37]) that
                    the portability and demountability of the dormitories were their <em>properties</em> and not additional <em>functions</em> as such.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Appellant’s arguments on appeal are
                    essentially the same as those canvassed in the High Court. Mr Leung
                    submitted that the Judge had erred in taking a snap-shot view of the
                    Appellant’s overall business, which was not just the provision of
                    dormitories for the accommodation of workers, but also involved their
                    dismantling and re-installation at future sites. Viewed in this context,
                    Mr Leung argued that the dormitories were, in principle, no different from
                    the scaffolding, portable toilets or pre-fabricated site offices used by a
                    contractor at construction sites, or tents put up by a circus operator. At the
                    end of their use, these items were dismantled to be re-used elsewhere and were
                    very much the tools of the taxpayer’s trade. Similarly, the dormitories in
                    the present case did not function solely as premises since their portability and
                    demountability were additional functions crucial to the nomadic nature of the
                    Appellant’s business.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Counsel for the Respondent, Mr Irving Aw
                    (“Mr Aw”), submitted, on the other hand, that the portable
                    dormitories were clearly being used as premises, regardless of where they might
                    be sited. Mr Aw pointed out that the cases in which buildings or structures
                    were held to be “plant” were rare and that the buildings or
                    structures in such cases functioned mainly as apparatus or equipment instead of
                    as premises. In the present case, Mr Aw argued that the portability and
                    demountability of the dormitories made them purpose-built buildings instead of
                    “plant”. Insofar as the analogies drawn by Mr Leung were
                    concerned, Mr Aw submitted that scaffoldings and portable toilets were not
                    buildings and would not be considered premises, whereas site offices and circus
                    tents also functioned as premises and would not qualify as
                    “plant”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Mr Aw also submitted, in the alternative,
                    that even if this court was not minded to agree with the Board and the Judge,
                    the question of whether the dormitories constituted “plant” was
                    one of fact and degree. As the Board and the Judge had neither misapplied the
                    law nor arrived at a conclusion which was clearly unreasonable, there was no
                    basis for an appellate court to interfere with the decisions arrived at
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The applicable legal principles</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Policy background and the legislative distinction between
                “plant” and “buildings” or
                “structures”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The relevant statutory provisions in this
                    appeal are ss 19 and 19A of the ITA, which provide for initial and annual
                    allowances (s 19) or accelerated allowances (s 19A) in respect of
                    capital expenditure incurred by a person carrying on a trade, profession or
                    business “on the provision of machinery or plant for the purposes of that
                    trade, profession or business”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Before we address these provisions in detail,
                    it would be useful to first briefly examine the <em>policy</em> governing this area of tax law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     With regard to income tax generally,
                    Sir Wilfred Greene MR observed, in the English Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>Commissioners of Inland Revenue v British Salmson
                        Aero Engines, Limited</em> [1938] 2 KB 482, as follows (at
                    498):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Income tax, as has been said over and over again, is a tax on income. It
                        does not tax capital. As the corollary to that, in ascertaining profits,
                        payments of a capital nature may not be deducted. It is income all the time
                        which has to be considered under the Income Tax Acts ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The above passage was also referred to in the Singapore High Court
                    decision of <em>ABD Pte Ltd v Comptroller of Income
                        Tax</em> [2010] 3 SLR 609 (“<em>ABD Pte
                        Ltd</em>”), where it was clearly stated (at [40]) that any
                    expenditure of a capital nature may not be deducted from a taxpayer’s
                    income unless such deduction is expressly provided for in the ITA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Although capital expenditure is generally not
                    deductible for the purposes of income tax, Parliament has acknowledged that the
                    depreciation of capital assets used in a trade, profession or business
                    represents a real business cost to taxpayers. Hence, <em>in
                        addition to</em> allowable deductions, Part VI of the ITA also
                    grants allowances for certain types of capital expenditures made for the
                    purposes of a taxpayer’s business. The rationale behind this scheme of
                    capital allowances was elaborated upon by Yong Pung How CJ, in the decision
                    of this court in <em>Comptroller of Income Tax v GE Pacific Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 948, as follows (at [27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the cost of fixed assets like plant and machinery cannot be considered
                        expenditure and so deducted from taxable income. However, since such assets
                        depreciate, <em>the Act recognises this inherent and periodic
                            “loss” suffered by those who use machinery or plant in the
                            course of their business and grants allowances to reflect this
                            additional cost of producing the income</em>. The rationale for
                        capital allowances is the depreciation of fixed assets. Obviously, it is the
                        taxpayer who owns and uses the plant or machinery that suffers this
                        “loss” of depreciation and it is to him that the Act grants
                        the allowance. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Currently, Part VI of the ITA provides
                    for capital allowances in respect of three broad categories of capital assets,
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_a"></a>(a)     Industrial buildings and structures
                        (ss 16–18 ITA);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_b"></a>(b)     Plant and machinery (ss 19, 19A, and 20–22
                        ITA); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_18-p2_c"></a>(c)     Certain intangible assets (ss 19B, 19C and 19D
                    ITA).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Of particular relevance to the present appeal is the
                    fact that the ITA draws a distinction between plant and machinery, on the one
                    hand, and buildings and structures, on the other. This distinction can be traced
                    back to the time when capital allowances first originated in 1878. At that
                    particular point in time, s 12 of the UK Customs and Inland Revenue Act
                    1878 (c 15) provided for deductions from chargeable income in respect of
                    “wear and tear ... of any machinery or plant used for the purposes of the
                    concern”. No allowances for buildings or structures were given then and,
                    even for plant and machinery, deductions could only be claimed in respect of
                    physical deterioration and not depreciation in value <em>per
                        se</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     This scheme of wear and tear allowances was
                    subsequently extended to mills, factories and similar premises by the UK Income
                    Tax Act 1918 (c 40), under which a taxpayer was able to deduct a proportion
                    of the annual value of the mill, factory or other premise in computing his
                    taxable income, on the basis that the vibrations of the machinery housed therein
                    caused wear and tear to the building. The scheme was substantially revamped by
                    the UK Income Tax Act 1945 (c 32) (“the 1945 UK Act”) which
                    replaced the previous system of wear and tear allowances with a new system of
                    initial and writing-down allowances coupled with balancing allowances and
                    charges. Under the new system, capital allowances were granted in respect of the
                    actual decrease in an asset’s value which might not necessarily be due to
                    physical deterioration. Capital allowances for mills and factories were also
                    extended to encompass industrial buildings in general.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The new system of capital allowances found in
                    the 1945 UK Act was eventually incorporated into Singapore’s tax
                    legislation as ss 16–22 of the Income Tax Ordinance (No 39 of
                    1947) (“the 1947 Ordinance”). The draftsman of these provisions,
                    Mr R B Heasman, explained in his report (see <em>Income Tax: A Report to Their Excellencies the Governors of the Malayan
                        Union and Singapore, with Recommendations, including a Draft Bill and
                        Proposals for Administration and Staffing</em> (Kuala Lumpur, Malayan
                    Union Government Press, 1947)) (“the Heasman Report”), as follows
                    (at p 18):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of the United Kingdom legislation [<em>i.e</em>. the 1945 UK Act] was to provide for the allowance,
                        over a period of years, of capital expended on buildings, plant and
                        machinery, and certain other types of asset, in the process of modernisation
                        and re-equipment during the post-war period. I anticipate that the
                        deductions authorised by Clauses 13 to 19 inclusive of the draft Bill
                            [<em>ie</em>, ss 16–22 of the 1947
                        Ordinance] will be found to be of considerable assistance in the
                        regeneration and development of Malayan trade and industry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     It is thus clear that the term
                    “plant” does <em>not</em> encompass <em>buildings or structures</em>. Allowances for plant and
                    machinery were initially introduced to recognise their physical deterioration as
                    a cost of producing income. It was only after World War II, when a general
                    scheme of capital allowances was introduced to encourage industrialisation, that
                    buildings and structures were included as a <em>separate</em> category. Even then, it was only industrial buildings
                    and structures which qualified for capital allowances. This is why, even today,
                    building allowances are not given for dwelling-houses, shops and offices (see
                    s 18(6) ITA) even though such buildings are subject to depreciation like
                    any other asset. <em>Further</em>, the allowances accorded
                    by the ITA to <em>plant and machinery</em> are <em>much more generous</em> compared to the allowances given to
                    industrial buildings and structures, since assets belonging to the <em>latter</em> category <em>naturally depreciate
                        at a much slower rate</em>. <em>These are points of the
                        first importance because this basic distinction between plant on the one
                        hand and buildings or structures on the other also constitutes, in point of
                        fact, the crucial distinction drawn in the case law itself as the courts
                        sought to define what constitutes “plant”</em>. Indeed,
                    this would be an appropriate point at which to turn to the definition of
                    “plant” itself.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The definition of “plant”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     What, then, constitutes “plant”?
                    Although the ITA does not define the term, the traditional starting-point is the
                    following statement of principle by Lindley LJ in the English Court of
                    Appeal decision of <em>Yarmouth v France</em> (1887)
                    19 QBD 647 (“<em>Yarmouth</em>”) (at
                    658):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is no definition of plant in the Act: but, in its ordinary sense, it
                        includes whatever <em>apparatus</em> is <em>used</em> by a business man <em>for
                            carrying on his business</em>, not his stock-in-trade which he
                        buys or makes for sale; but all the goods and chattels, fixed or moveable,
                        live or dead, which he keeps <em>for permanent employment
                            in</em> his business. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although <em>Yarmouth</em> concerned the
                    definition of “plant” under the UK Employers’ Liability Act
                    1880 (c 42), Lindley LJ’s definition has consistently been
                    adopted in subsequent income tax cases. Indeed, in the English Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>Cole Bros Ltd v Phillips (H M Inspector of
                        Taxes)</em> (1981) 55 TC 188 (“<em>Cole
                        Bros</em>”), Oliver LJ observed (at 210) that the passage
                    just quoted “is the bedrock, and all subsequent cases may be regarded as
                    glosses imposed on Lindley L.J.’s central
                proposition”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Lindley LJ’s definition of
                    “plant” in <em>Yarmouth</em> is admittedly a
                    wide one, and case law has demonstrated that the term is capable of encompassing
                    a wide variety of assets such as railway locomotives and carriages (<em>Caledonian Railway Co v Banks</em> (1880) 1 TC 487),
                    knives and lasts used in the manufacture of shoes (<em>Hinton
                        (Inspector of Taxes) v Maden and Ireland Ltd</em> [1959] 1 WLR
                    875), a barrister’s law books (<em>Munby v Furlong
                        (Inspector of Taxes)</em> [1977] 1 Ch 359), and decorative
                    screens (<em>Leeds Permanent Building Society v Procter (H M
                        Inspector of Taxes)</em> [1982] 3 All ER 925). Bearing in mind
                    the general policy behind capital allowances for “plant” and
                    machinery, as well as the distinctions the ITA draws with respect to buildings,
                    structures and intangible assets (as set out above at <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>–<a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>), we are of
                    the view that any tangible asset (other than a building or structure, or an
                    asset forming part of a building or structure) used permanently for the purposes
                    of a taxpayer’s trade, profession or business can be considered
                    “apparatus” and would thus qualify as
                    “plant”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     It comes as no surprise then that the issue
                    most often litigated upon in this branch of the law is whether a particular
                    asset falls on the “plant” or “buildings” side of
                    the boundary. The present appeal is no exception. As is customary with income
                    tax law generally, whilst the legal principles are relatively easy to state, the
                    real difficulty lies in their application. Looked at in this light, the
                    following observation by Megarry J in the English High Court decision of
                        <em>Cooke (Inspector of Taxes) v Beach Station Caravans
                        Ltd</em> [1974] 1 WLR 1398 (“<em>Cooke</em>”) (at 1402) is apposite:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To some extent the matter must be one of impression, though it is
                        important that the impression should not be untutored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">So, also, is the learned judge’s further (and astute)
                    observation in the context of that case but which, in our view, would be of
                    general application to both this as well as other cases, as follows (see
                        <em>ibid</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Many interesting difficulties emerged during the argument which I forbear
                        to pursue: for my duty is merely to decide this case, and not to attempt to
                        define and rationalise the whole of this difficult branch of the law. Doing
                        the best I can, with the aid of the authorities that I have mentioned and
                        the other authorities that have been put before me, my conclusions are as
                        follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     This court would also do well to heed the
                    following observations by Oliver LJ in <em>Cole
                        Bros</em> where the learned judge stated thus (at 209):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whatever one might think about the ordinary meaning of the word
                        “plant” in the English language, it is now beyond doubt that
                        it is used in the relevant section in an artificial and largely judge-made
                        sense. The difficulty lies in discerning what is the principle which
                        distinguishes one item of equipment from another – a task which almost
                        of necessity involves reviewing yet again an extensive line of authorities
                        which have already been reviewed in previous cases but without, so far as I
                        at any rate can see, any very clear distillation of principle.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And as Oliver LJ later observed (at 211):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It cannot, however, be pretended that all the authorities are all easy to
                        reconcile.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In a similar vein, Stephenson LJ also
                    observed (at 220) as follows (although, as we noted at [18]–[21], the
                    distinction drawn between “plant” and buildings is still very much
                    a part of the landscape of tax law):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The philosopher-statesman, Balfour, is reported to have said it was
                        unnecessary to define a great power because, like an elephant, you
                        recognised it when you met it. Unhappily plant in taxing and other statutes
                        is no elephant (though I suppose an elephant might be plant). It has lost
                        what resemblance to machinery it may once have had and any contrast with
                        buildings or structures is now misleading, however strong the temptation to
                        go back to those simple similarities and differences which the word might
                        have suggested before repeated difficulties of application drove judges to
                        gloss over them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">With these observations in mind, we now turn to the authorities to see
                    how various courts have attempted to determine whether a particular asset falls
                    to be classified as a “plant” or as a building.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Preliminary observations on terminology</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     A few preliminary observations on the use of
                        <em>terminology</em> may be apposite. Although the
                    substantive distinction is (as we have seen) between “plant” on
                    the one hand and buildings on the other, the case law has tended to utilise the
                    terms “setting” and “premises” when referring to
                    buildings. This difference in terminology is very important to note because the
                    terms “setting” and “premises” have been used by
                    various courts in <em>two different
                senses</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In the <em>first</em>
                    sense, the court, in referring to these terms, had <em>actually
                        intended</em> to refer to a building and in this sense, the basic
                    distinction between “plant” and buildings (as referred to above)
                    remains unchanged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The <em>second</em> sense
                    in which the terms “setting” and “premises” have
                    been used centres on their ordinary (and <em>broader as well as
                        more general</em>) meaning in the English language and, in this
                    particular regard, one must be wary of using these terms interchangeably with
                    the term “buildings”. This is because, while the terms
                    “setting” and “premises” are useful in describing
                    what the typical characteristics of a building are, it <em>does
                        not follow</em> that assets which provide the setting or premises of a
                    business are <em>necessarily</em> buildings. It must be
                    remembered that, under the scheme of the ITA, the only distinction is between
                    “plant” and buildings and all other terms are merely descriptions
                    to guide the court in its inquiry. Unfortunately, the various cases dealing with
                    this particular issue have not been precise in the use of terminology and this
                    has, as we will demonstrate below, resulted in not inconsiderable ambiguity. In
                    order to avoid any further confusion, we will (for the present) refer to
                    buildings solely as buildings, whereas the terms “setting” and
                    “premises” will be used in their more general, ordinary English
                    sense (<em>ie</em>, they might <em>or might
                        not</em> refer to buildings as such).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     We also note that the Judge referred to
                    various tests, namely, the “business use” and
                    “functional” tests (which he equated as being one and the same) as
                    well as the “premises” test. With respect, there is, in our view,
                    just one basic and overarching test – whether the item concerned is
                    utilised for the purposes of the trade or business as “plant” or
                    as a building. To the extent that the item will <em>always</em> need to satisfy the <em>threshold
                        requirement</em> that it be used for the purposes of the trade or
                    business, the term “business use” is, in our view, <em>too broad</em>. Indeed, this term would <em>also</em> cover the situation where the item concerned, <em>although a building</em>, could also satisfy this particular
                    criterion, simply because that building would house the trade or business of the
                    taxpayer (and, in that sense, is used for the purposes of the trade or
                    business). <em>However</em>, it would <em>not</em> follow that that building thereby constitutes
                    “plant”. On the <em>contrary</em>, it would
                    be the <em>opposite</em> of “plant” since it
                    is, <em>ex hypothesi</em>, <em>a
                        building</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We are also of the view that the term
                    “functional” is similarly unhelpful because whether or not a
                    particular item “functions” as “plant” or as a
                    building is <em>precisely the question that needs to be
                        answered</em>. Put simply the term “functional” is, at
                    best, neutral and, at worst, circular in nature. Similarly, as we have pointed
                    out above, the term “premises” is not interchangeable with
                    “buildings” and, insofar as the nomenclature suggests otherwise,
                    it is misconceived. In the circumstances, we are of the view that the various
                    terminology utilised in the court below is, with the greatest of respect,
                    unhelpful.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Ambiguity introduced</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     A classic illustration of the ambiguity
                    referred to earlier may be found in the decision of <em>Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Barclay, Curle &amp; Co
                        Ltd</em> [1969] 1 WLR 675 (“<em>Barclay
                        Curle</em>”) where the House of Lords held that <em>a dry dock simultaneously</em> constituted a building or
                    structure (in which the taxpayer’s business of inspection and ship repair,
                    of the bottoms and sides of ships, was conducted) <em>as well
                        as</em> “plant” (insofar as it <em>also</em> performed the function of a hydraulic lift for raising the
                    ships and holding them in position). The items at issue in that case comprised
                    the cost of the work of excavation of earth and rock to form <em>a rectangular basin</em> for the dry dock as well as the cost of
                    concrete which was used to line that basin. At first blush, it would appear that
                    these items should have constituted <em>at least part
                        of</em> a <em>building or structure</em> and,
                    hence, should <em>not</em> have constituted <em>“plant”</em>. Indeed, it is significant, in
                    this regard, to note that the House held in favour of the taxpayer by a
                        <em>bare majority of 3 to 2</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The majority was of the view that these items
                    had to be viewed in a <em>holistic</em> manner –
                    together with the <em>other</em> parts of the dock which
                    constituted “plant”. In particular, Lord Reid observed, as
                    follows (at 679):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As the commissioners observed, buildings or structure and machinery and
                        plant are not mutually exclusive... Undoubtedly this concrete dry dock is a
                        structure but is it also plant? The only reason why a structure should also
                        be plant which has been suggested or which has occurred to me is that it
                        fulfils the function of plant in the trader’s operations. And, if that
                        is so, no test has been suggested to distinguish one structure which fulfils
                        such a function from another. I do not say that every structure which
                        fulfils the function of plant must be regarded as plant, but I think that
                        one would have to find some good reason for excluding such a structure. And
                        I do not think that mere size is sufficient.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Here it is apparent that there are two stages in the respondents’
                        operations. First the ship must be isolated from the water and then the
                        inspection and necessary repairs must be carried out. If one looks only at
                        the second stage it would not be difficult to say that the dry dock is
                        merely the setting in which it takes place. But I think that the first stage
                        is equally important, and it is obvious that it requires massive and
                        complicated equipment. ... It seems to me that every part of this dry dock
                        plays an essential part in getting large vessels into a position where work
                        on the outside of the hull can begin, and that it is wrong to regard either
                        the concrete or any other part of the dock as a mere setting or part of the
                        premises in which this operation takes place. The whole dock is, I think,
                        the means by which, or plant with which, the operation is performed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Lord Guest, who concurred with the
                    majority, added (at 685–686):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In order to decide whether a particular subject is an "apparatus" it seems
                        obvious that an inquiry has to be made as to what operation it performs. The
                        functional test is, therefore, essential at any rate as a preliminary. The
                        function which the dry dock performs is that of a hydraulic lift taking
                        ships from the water onto dry land, raising them and holding them in such a
                        position that inspection and repairs can conveniently be effected to their
                        bottoms and sides. It is unrealistic, in my view, to consider the concrete
                        work in isolation from the rest of the dry dock. It is the level of the
                        bottom of the basin in conjunction with the river level which enables the
                        function of dry docking to be performed by the use of dock gates, valves and
                        pumps. To effect this purpose excavation and concrete work were
                        necessary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is said that the dry dock is similar to premises like a factory
                        building in which the trade is carried on. But this comparison is not, in my
                        view, accurate. The factory is by itself a building or structure in which
                        trade can be carried on. But the excavation and concrete work is useless for
                        any trade purpose unless used in conjunction with the rest of the equipment.
                        As Pearson LJ (as he then was) said, the subject is part of the plant
                        with which the business is carried on as distinct from the premises in which
                        the business is carried on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Under the majority’s approach, an asset
                    which would normally be regarded as a building or structure could also be
                    classified as “plant” if it performed some independent operation
                    in the taxpayer’s business beyond providing the setting or premises in
                    which the business was carried out. On the facts of <em>Barclay
                        Curle</em>, the rectangular basin played a (albeit indirect) role in
                    the process of raising and lowering ships alongside the rest of the dry dock and
                    was thus more than simply the setting or premises in which the taxpayer’s
                    business was conducted. Looked at in this light, the <em>characterisation</em> adopted by the majority resulted in the entire
                    dry dock in this case being construed as <em>simply a large piece
                        of apparatus or equipment or machinery</em> (<em>only
                        part</em> of which happened to overlap with what would otherwise have
                    been at least part of a conventional building or structure, which would
                        <em>not</em> constitute
                “plant”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The decision in <em>Barclay
                        Curle</em> may be usefully contrasted with the High Court of
                    Australia’s decision in <em>Wangaratta Woollen Mills
                        Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of
                        Australia</em> (1969) 119 CLR 1, where, although a dyehouse was
                    held to be “plant”, its <em>external walls as well
                        as roof</em> were <em>not</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On the other hand, in <em>Jarrold (Inspector of Taxes) v John Good &amp; Sons Ltd</em> [1963]
                    1 WLR 214 (“<em>John Good</em>”), the
                    English Court of Appeal held that movable internal partitions used by the
                    taxpayer company to adjust its office space to cope with variations in its
                    number of staff were “plant”. In an oft-quoted passage,
                    Pearson LJ said (at 215):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There can be no doubt, therefore, as to the main principles to be applied,
                        and the short question in this case is whether the partitioning is part of
                        the premises <em>in which</em> the business is carried
                        on or part of the plant <em>with which</em> the
                        business is carried on. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     A case not dissimilar to <em>Barclay Curle</em> is the Court of Appeal of Northern Ireland
                    decision of <em>Schofield (H M Inspector of Taxes) v
                        R &amp; H Hall Ltd</em> (1974) 49 TC 538
                        (“<em>Schofield</em>”), which in fact
                    cited and applied <em>Barclay Curle</em>. In that case, the
                    court held that <em>silos simultaneously</em> constituted a
                    building or structure (in which the taxpayer’s business of grain importing
                    and distribution was conducted) <em>as well as</em>
                    “plant” (insofar as they <em>also</em>
                    performed the function of conveniently discharging the grain contained therein
                    to customers). Significantly, in our view, it was observed (by Jones LJ at
                    556) that “the silos are <em>really collections of
                        built-in bins rather than buildings capable of housing bins</em> which
                    could be put to any other use as buildings” [emphasis added]. In other
                    words, as was the case in <em>Barclay Curle</em>, the silos
                    in this case also constituted <em>large apparatus or equipment or
                        machinery</em> (as opposed to buildings proper). Indeed, it is
                    important to note that the Crown in this case had taken the view that the silos
                    were not “plant” but were <em>industrial
                        buildings</em> instead – a view that was rejected by the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Yet another decision in which <em>Barclay Curle</em> was applied is <em>Cooke</em>. However, that case concerned <em>a
                        swimming pool as well as a paddling pool</em>, constructed on a
                    caravan site, that were held to be “plant”. It should be noted,
                    though, that neither would be considered to be a building in the conventional
                    sense of the word (<em>viz</em>, buildings proper). A
                    contrasting case is the English High Court decision of <em>Dixon
                        (Inspector of Taxes) v Fitch’s Garage Ltd</em> [1976] 1 WLR
                    215, where a canopy erected over a self-service petrol station to provide
                    adequate lighting and shelter was held not to be “plant”.
                    Brightman J held that the only purpose of the canopy was to provide shelter
                    to motorists and was not part of the means by which the taxpayer’s
                    operation of supplying petrol was performed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Similarly, in <em>Benson
                        (H M Inspector of Taxes) v Yard Arm Club Ltd</em> (1979)
                    53 TC 67, it was held that <em>a second-hand ship which had
                        been converted into a floating restaurant</em> (which was, in turn,
                    attached to a barge, both of which were moored at a permanent site on the
                    Victoria Embankment) did <em>not</em> constitute
                    “plant”. It is significant to note that the ship concerned merely
                    provided the <em>setting</em> in which the business of a
                        <em>restaurant</em> was being conducted. In other
                    words, the premises <em>per se</em> did <em>not –</em> apart from functioning as a setting
                        - constitute (simultaneously) the <em>means (or part of the means) by which</em> the business was
                    conducted. Put simply, although the premises did aid in housing the business, it
                    was, in essence, a <em>building</em>. Indeed,
                    Oliver LJ perceptively observed, at the Court of Appeal stage in <em>Cole Bros</em> (at 212), that “no doubt if the ship
                    had been engined and used as a vehicle for gastronomic cruises on the river, it
                    would have qualified as plant because it would have served an additional
                    function in a composite business of restaurateurs and carriers”. The
                    following observations by Lord Lowry in the House of Lords decision of
                        <em>Inland Revenue Commissioners v Scottish &amp; Newcastle
                        Breweries</em> [1982] 1 WLR 322 (“<em>Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries</em>”) (at 333–334)
                    with regard to the fact situation in <em>Benson</em> may
                    also be usefully noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">But the distinction is that the ship, although a chattel, was the
                            <em>place in which</em> the trade was carried on
                        and was therefore the equivalent of the various premises in which the
                        present taxpayers company carry on their trade and not of the apparatus used
                        as an adjunct of the trade carried on in those premises. Thus the ship, with
                        all its novelty and atmosphere, could no more be called plant than a
                        restaurant consisting of an Elizabethan manor house, a thatched cottage, a
                        barn or a converted windmill, although like all those buildings, it could be
                        embellished and adorned with ‘plant’ suitable to the
                        surroundings and to the purposes of the trade. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In the English High Court decision of
                        <em>St John’s School v Ward (H M Inspector of
                        Taxes)</em> (1974) 49 TC 524 (“<em>St
                        John’s School</em>”), which was affirmed on appeal to the
                    Court of Appeal, it was held that gymnasiums and chemical laboratories
                    (constructed from prefabricated panels which were not fixed to the ground or a
                    concrete base and whose layout could be rearranged) did <em>not</em> constitute “plant”. It is significant to note,
                    however, that the business concerned related to <em>a school and
                        the concomitant provision of education</em>. In the circumstances,
                    therefore, the premises concerned merely provided the <em>setting</em> in which such business was conducted and (more
                    importantly) did <em>not –</em> apart from
                    functioning as a setting - constitute (simultaneously) the
                        <em>means (or part of the means) by which</em> the
                    business was conducted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Finally, in <em>Cole
                        Bros</em>, Oliver LJ attempted to summarise the applicable
                    principles governing the (hitherto) decided cases. The learned judge observed
                    (at 211):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That “plant” may include not only equipment fixed to and
                        forming part of a structure built into or permanently affixed to land, but
                        also the structure itself, appears from three cases: [<em>Barclay Curle</em>; <em>Cooke</em>; and
                            <em>Schofield</em>] – which were concerned
                        respectively with a dry-dock, a swimming-pool and paddling pools and a grain
                        silo, and in each of which the structure itself was held to be plant. The
                        importance of these is, first, that they emphasise that what is important is
                        not, or not primarily, the nature of the item in question – that is to
                        say whether it is a “chattel” or a “structure”
                        or a “building” – but the function that it performs in
                        the taxpayer’s business activity; and, secondly, that in [<em>Barclay Curle</em>] the House of Lords adopted and
                        affirmed the distinction propounded by Pearson L.J. in [<em>John Good</em>]. It is, however, important to bear in
                        mind what Pearson L.J. was referring to when he referred to “the
                        premises in which the business is carried on”. As indicated above,
                        the notion which, as I read his judgment, he was seeking to convey was that
                        of the building which did no more than “house” the business. I
                        emphasise this because it does seem to me that in some of the later cases
                        this has become identified (as I think, erroneously) with the specific
                        function of providing shelter from the elements, so that it is said that
                        nothing whose sole function is shelter can be plant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Oliver LJ continued (at 212):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The truth is, in my judgment, that much of the apparent difficulty of
                        deciding whether expenditure on a particular item as allowable as
                        expenditure on “plant” arises from attempting to treat as
                        precise criteria tests which have been propounded as alternative
                        formulations or expositions of the short question asked by Pearson L.J.
                        in [<em>John Good</em>]. Whether the test be expressed
                        as the provision of “shelter”, as a “building”
                        or “premises”, as “the functional test”, or, to
                        adopt the homely vernacular suggested by Megarry J. in [<em>Cooke</em>], “where it’s at”, the
                        underlying concept is, I think, the same and comes back ultimately to that
                        short question, upon which it is difficult to improve. At risk of
                        propounding yet a further refinement, it seems to me that the authorities,
                        with one possible exception, demonstrate that the question (however
                        expressed) which the Court must ask itself is whether the particular
                        subject-matter under consideration either itself performs, or is a necessary
                        or integral part of that which performs, simply and solely the function of
                        “housing” the business or whether, as its sole function or as
                        an additional function, it performs some other distinct business
                        purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In summary, it appears that most of the
                    earlier cases up to <em>Cole Bros</em> appeared to have
                    confused the concept of a building with the idea of “setting” or
                    “premises”, with the unfortunate effect that the term
                    “building” appears to have been dissolved or subsumed within the
                    latter two terms. As we have mentioned earlier, these terms are <em>not necessarily interchangeable</em>. Assets like tents and
                    makeshift shelters for road stalls can be described as the setting or premises
                    in which a taxpayer’s trade or business is carried on, but it would be
                    incongruous to hence conclude that they were buildings or structures, since the
                    idea of a building carries with it a certain connotation of magnitude and
                    permanence. Further, as we also mentioned above, the allowances granted under
                    the ITA to “plant” and machinery are much more generous than the
                    allowances granted to industrial buildings because of the difference in their
                    relative rates of depreciation. This suggests that, as a matter of policy
                    itself, the ITA envisions “plant” and machinery generally to be of
                    a more temporary nature than buildings or structures. Assets which merely
                    provide the setting or premises for a business may not <em>ipso
                        facto</em> be of such a permanent nature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Another difficulty generated by some of the
                    cases cited above (such as <em>Barclay Curle</em> and
                        <em>Schofield</em>) is that an asset could
                    simultaneously be classified as a “plant” and a building. The
                    implication is that any asset which is <em>prima facie</em>
                    a building or structure can be fully depreciated as “plant” if it
                    can be shown that these assets performed some independent business purpose
                    besides simply acting as the setting or premises of the business. We are of the
                    view that this approach is overly broad and should not be adopted in Singapore,
                    where the ITA draws a clear distinction between “plant” and
                    buildings. It is noteworthy that the judgments in <em>Barclay
                        Curle</em> and <em>Schofield</em> expressly
                    referred to s 276 of the UK Income Tax Act 1952 (c 10) and s 14
                    of the UK Capital Allowances Act 1968 (c 3), respectively, in arriving at
                    the conclusion that an asset could be both “plant” and a building
                    (see <em>Barclay Curle</em> at 681, 685, and 691; and
                        <em>Schofield</em> at 546). Both these provisions are
                    similar and are based on s 13 of the 1945 UK Act, which reads as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Exclusion of double allowances,
                            etc</b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>13</b>.—(1) No allowance shall be made
                        under, or by virtue of, any of the provisions of this Part of this Act
                        [which deals with industrial buildings and structures] in respect of, or of
                        premises including, or of expenditure on, a building or structure if, for
                        the same or any previous or subsequent year of assessment, an allowance is
                        or can be made under any of the provisions of Part II [which deals with
                        machinery and plant], Part III or Part IV of this Act in respect
                        of, or of expenditure on, that building or structure.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Without prejudice to the provisions of the preceding subsection, any
                        reference in this Part of this Act to the incurring of expenditure on the
                        construction of a building or structure does not include expenditure on the
                        provision of machinery or plant or on any asset which has been treated for
                        any year of assessment as machinery or plant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The significance of this provision is that the
                    UK scheme of capital allowances anticipated that a particular asset could both
                    be “plant” and an industrial building or structure and accordingly
                    provided that there would be no double claim to capital allowances. However,
                    s 13 of the 1945 UK Act (or any provision to like effect) cannot be found
                    in the ITA because it was never incorporated into Singapore’s tax
                    legislation. Instead, the ITA simply provides for capital allowances in respect
                    of different classes of assets. We are therefore of the view that these classes
                    of assets should remain mutually exclusive. An asset may be considered
                    “plant” in some respects and a building in others but, ultimately,
                    it can only be depreciated purely as “plant”
                    <em>or</em> purely as a building for the purposes of income
                    tax. Put simply, if it is depreciated as “plant”, the taxpayer can
                    claim capital allowances under ss 19 or 19A of the ITA. If it is
                    depreciated as a building, capital allowances are unavailable unless the
                    building is industrial in nature. Since the two categories are mutually
                    exclusive, where an asset possesses the features of both, the question is
                    whether the asset can be <em>more appropriately</em>
                    described as “plant” or as a building. In our view, to simply ask
                    whether the asset does anything more than to provide the setting or premises for
                    the business does nothing to further this inquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Fortunately, the ambiguity generated by the
                    case law was soon clarified by a return by the courts in more recent decisions
                    to the basic distinction between “plant” on the one hand and
                    building on the other. It is to these more significant decisions that our
                    attention now turns.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The celebrated pioneer cartographer was Lindley LJ, who
                        gave the following description of the territory in <em>Yarmouth v France</em> (1887)
                        19 QBD 647 at 658:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">‘... in its ordinary sense, it includes whatever apparatus is
                            used by a business man for carrying on his business,-not his
                            stock-in-trade which he buys or makes for sale; but all goods and
                            chattels, fixed or moveable, live or dead, which he keeps for permanent
                            employment in his business.’</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is important to notice the various discriminations which are stated or
                        implied in this description. <b><em>First</em></b>, it
                        excludes [<b><em>from the definition of plant</em></b>]
                        anything which is not used for carrying on the business. <b><em>Secondly</em></b>, it excludes stock-in-trade both expressly and
                        because, although used for the purposes of the business, its use lacks
                        permanence. <b><em>Thirdly</em></b>, it <em>excludes</em> things which are not ‘apparatus ... goods and
                        chattels, fixed or moveable, live or dead’
                        <em>or not</em><b><em>employed</em></b><b>in</b> the business. <b><em>This
                            excludes the premises or place in or upon which the business is
                            conducted</em></b>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Before going any further I must say something about <em>the
                            third distinction</em> and the way in which <em>the
                            courts in subsequent cases</em> have <b><em>refined
                            the boundary</em></b><em>between plant and premises</em> ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It will be seen, therefore, that although the <b><em>three
                            distinctions</em></b> in <em>Yarmouth v France</em> (1887) 19 QBD 647 each
                        involves a test which can be called functional, <b><em>they are
                            subtly different from each other</em></b>. If the item is neither
                        stock-in-trade nor the premises upon which the business is conducted, the
                        only question is whether it is used for carrying on the business. I shall
                        call this <b><em>the ‘business use’
                        test</em></b>. However, under the <b><em>second</em></b>
                        distinction, an article which passes the ‘business use’ test is
                        excluded if such use is as stock-in-trade. And under the<b><em>
                            third</em></b> distinction, <b><em>an item used in
                            carrying on the business is excluded if such use is as the premises or
                            place upon which the business is conducted. The fact that an item may
                            pass the ‘business use’ test but fail what I may call the
                            ‘premises’ test is central to this case</em></b>.</p>

                        turned out, the happiest choice of words. Uthwatt J was using
                        ‘setting’ to refer to things which were upon the premises but
                        were neither a part of the premises nor used in carrying on the business.
                        However, as Pennycuick J later pointed out in <em>Jarrold (Inspector of Taxes) v John Good &amp; Sons Ltd</em>
                        [1962] 1 WLR 1101 at 1108 ..., the ‘setting’ in which a

                        ‘setting’ is not the most precise tool for applying the
                        ‘business use’ test <em>when the provision of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     It appears from the above observations that
                    the learned judge was referring to “premises” in the sense of
                    “buildings” and, more importantly, that he did <em>not</em> consider <em>buildings proper</em> to
                    constitute “plant”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Reference may also be made, in this regard, to
                    the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Carr (H M
                        Inspector of Taxes) v Sayer</em> (1992) 65 TC 15
                        (“<em>Carr</em>”). In this case, the
                    taxpayers carried on a business of providing quarantine kennels and transport
                    services for cats and dogs. They used two types of kennels in their business.
                    The first type consisted of movable, wooden kennels and the second type
                    consisted of immovable kennels. These immovable kennels were permanent
                    structures which had concrete flooring, brick and mortar walls, and built-in
                    drainage. Although the movable and immovable kennels both served, in a sense, as
                    the setting or premises in which the business was housed, only the former was
                    held to be “plant”. In arriving at his decision, Sir Donald
                    Nicholls VC articulated the following principles (at 22–23):</p>

                            <em>The premises, whether an office or a factory or a
                            warehouse or whatever, at which or in which a business is carried on

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Secondly, the expression ‘machinery or
                            plant’ is apt to include equipment of any size. If fixed, a large
                            piece of equipment may readily be described as a structure, but that by
                            itself does not take the equipment outside the range of what would
                            normally be regarded as plant. The equipment does not cease to be plant
                            because it is so substantial that, when fixed, it attracts the label of
                            a structure or, even, a building. Thus a dry dock which affords the
                            means for getting large vessels into a position where work on the
                            outside of the hull can be done can properly be regarded as

                            Ltd. ..</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Thirdly, and this follows from the above, equipment
                            does not cease to be plant merely because it also discharges an
                            additional function, such as providing the place in which the business

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>Fourthly, and conversely, buildings</em></b>, which
                        I have already noted would <b><em>not normally</em></b> be
                        regarded as plant, <em>do</em><b><em>not</em></b><em>cease to be buildings and become plant</em><b><em>simply because they are purpose-built for a particular
                            trading activity</em></b>. Such a distinction would make no sense.
                        Thus the stables of a racehorse trainer are properly to be regarded as
                        buildings and not plant. <b><em>A hotel building remains a
                            building even when constructed to a luxury specification</em></b>. I
                        say nothing about particular fixtures within the building. <em>Similarly</em> with <b><em>a hospital for
                            infectious diseases</em></b>. This <b><em>might require
                            special lay-out and other features</em></b>, <em>but</em> this does <em>not</em> convert the
                        building into plant. A purpose-built building, as much as one which is not
                        purpose-built, prima facie is <em>no more than the premises
                            on which the business is conducted</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Fifthly, <em>one of the functions of a building is to
                            provide shelter and security for people using it and for goods inside

                            purposes is being used as a building. Thus a building does not partake
                            of the character of plant simply, for example, because it is used for
                            storage by a trader carrying on</em><b><em>a storage business</em></b>. <b><em>This
                            remains so even if the building has been built as a specially secure

                        proper</em>”, in the terminology utilised in this judgment)
                    would <em>not</em> constitute “plant”. Hence,
                    in, for example, the English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Gray
                        (Inspector of Taxes) v Seymours Garden Centre (Horticulture)</em>
                    (1995) 67 TC 401, a planteria (a form of glasshouse), which was used to
                    provide an appropriate mini-climate in its different parts for the growth and
                    nurturing of plants, was held to be a purpose-built structure rather than
                    “plant”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Similarly, in another decision of the English
                    Court of Appeal decision in <em>Attwood (Inspector of Taxes) v
                        Anduff Car Wash Ltd</em> [1997] STC 1167, a wash hall specially
                    designed to wash the maximum number of cars in the shortest possible time was
                    held to be a building, although the inspector of taxes was willing to accept
                    that <em>the machinery</em> housed within the wash hall
                    constituted <em>“plant”</em>. Peter
                    Gibson LJ referred to Lord Lowry’s judgment in <em>Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries</em> and noted (at 1175)
                    that it was only in “rare” instances where an asset that would
                    normally be described as a building or structure would be held to be
                    “plant” instead. Indeed, an examination of these rare cases
                    demonstrates that the assets in question were more akin to large, integrated
                    pieces of machinery or equipment than to buildings or structures as
                such.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     One example of such large equipment can be
                    found in the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision of <em>Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Waitaki International Ltd</em>
                    [1990] 3 NZLR 27 (“<em>Waitaki</em>”),
                    where it was held that the entire cold-store or freezer used in the business of
                    meat works was “plant” inasmuch as (consistently with the approach
                    of the majority in <em>Barclay Curle</em>) everything was
                    to be considered as an integrated whole. Interestingly, Richardson J also
                    observed thus (at 32):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Except for differences in relative size</em>, the
                        freezer and cold-store <em>may be likened to a domestic or
                            commercial deep freeze</em>. Each is essentially a refrigerator
                        box all six walls of which are heavily insulated to facilitate efficient
                        refrigeration. The structure is part and parcel of the process and for his
                        part [the expert witness for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue] said that
                        he would call [the taxpayer’s] cold-stores a freezer complex and would
                        describe the freezer in a butcher’s shop as plant. I consider those
                        proper concessions and that the freezer and cold-store form part of the
                        taxpayer’s operations and are to be characterised as plant. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In a similar vein, Bisson J observed as follows (at 35):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A small refrigerated unit such as the domestic deep freeze I would regard
                        as a piece of equipment but when the whole building serves as a cool-store
                        or freezing chamber as these buildings did, I regard them as plant, being
                        used for the purpose of processing the product essential to carrying on the
                        business of a meat works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And Hardie Boys J stated thus (at 36):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The buildings in issue in this case are not only built for the purpose of
                        a particular process but are also part of the process itself. The chilling
                        process requires a particular kind of equipment placed in a particular kind
                        of structure, <em>the whole functioning as an entity. The
                            analogy to a deep freeze is almost complete</em>, <b><em>apart from size and mechanics</em></b>. I therefore conclude
                        that the cold stores were plant for the purposes of the section. [emphasis
                        added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In other words, although one could conceivably
                    characterise the cold-stores or freezers in <em>Waitaki</em> as buildings proper, the New Zealand Court of Appeal
                    took the view that these structures were in fact and in substance, in the nature
                    of <em>large apparatus or equipment or machinery</em>.
                    Crudely put, they were <em>large
                refrigerators</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The basic distinction between
                    “plant” and buildings was also highlighted in the High Court of
                    Australia decision of <em>Imperial Chemical Industries of
                        Australia and New Zealand Limited v Commissioner of Taxation of the
                        Commonwealth of Australia</em> (1970) 120 CLR 396
                        (“<em>Imperial Chemical
                    Industries</em>”), where it was held that the ceiling panels and
                    electric fittings in a building did <em>not</em> constitute
                    “plant” (reference may also be made to the English High Court
                    decision of <em>J Lyons &amp; Company, Limited v
                        Attorney-General</em> [1944] 1 Ch 281 (which concerned electric
                    lamps and fittings); <em>Cole Bros</em> (which also
                    concerned the installation of electrical apparatus); as well as <em>Wimpy</em> (which concerned, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, shop fronts, light fittings and wiring, raised floors,
                    floor and wall tiles, wall panels and mirrors, suspended ceilings, balustrading,
                    cold water piping and water tanks, decorative brickwork, murals, built-in
                    storage units and dispensers)). In <em>Imperial Chemical
                        Industries</em>, Kitto J observed, <em>inter
                        alia</em> (at 398), that “[t]he ceilings are there for the sake
                    of the building, not the building for the sake of the ceilings” and that
                    they were “no more than parts of the shelter, so to speak, in which the
                    Appellant chooses to carry on its activities”. The learned judge also
                    observed that the electrical fittings were “also parts of the general
                    equipment of the building” (<em>ibid</em>). In his
                    view (at 399), “[t]he construction of the building as a building of the
                    general type to which it belongs would be incomplete without them, and their
                    function does not go beyond making the building a suitable general setting for a
                    wide range of possible activities”. The cases just mentioned relate, in
                    fact, to the issue (dealt with below at <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>–<a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>) of whether
                    or not an asset that is not a building proper as such can be so inextricably
                    connected with a building such that it could be regarded as part of the building
                    for income tax purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     A significant and related issue that then
                    arises is this: what constitutes a “building” (or a
                    “building proper” in the terminology utilised in this judgment)
                    for the purposes of the distinction between “plant” on the one
                    hand and building on the other? This is an issue to which our attention now
                    turns.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">What constitutes a “building”?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Unlike Stephenson LJ’s observations
                    in <em>Cole Bros</em> (cited above at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>), it is probably easier to recognise a
                    building when we encounter it than it is in the case of “plant”
                    (which the learned judge was concerned with). Indeed, in the vast majority of
                    cases, we will know a building when we see it. However, with the myriad of
                    possible permutations, there will be the so-called grey areas. Indeed, as we
                    shall see, the assets that are the subject matter of the present appeal may well
                    fall within such a grey area. In any event, it would, as a matter of logic as
                    well as commonsense, be appropriate that we set out the main criteria that would
                    guide the court in ascertaining whether or not a given asset is a
                    “building”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The operational role of the asset in the taxpayer’s
                business</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     As Nicholls VC aptly mentioned in
                        <em>Carr</em>, “plant” carries with it a
                    connotation of equipment or apparatus. Accordingly, an asset which operates as a
                    large piece of equipment cannot be said to be a building or structure, since the
                    normal purpose of the latter is to provide a setting or premises for the
                    business (bearing in mind our earlier caution that setting and premises are
                        <em>not</em> to be <em>automatically
                        equated</em> with buildings or structures). Where a very large asset
                    can be considered both equipment and the setting or premises in which the
                    business is carried on (like the grain silo in <em>Schofield</em>,), the question then is whether the asset is more
                    appropriately described as equipment (and hence “plant”) <em>or</em> as a building. This would in turn depend on the
                        <em>extent</em> to which the asset plays the role of
                        <em>equipment</em> in the taxpayer’s business, as
                    well as the other factors indicated below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   The physical nature of the asset</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Another obvious criterion in determining
                    whether an asset is a building is <em>the physical
                        nature</em> of the asset itself, which would encompass, for example,
                    its size, shape, durability, as well as the material it is constructed of. The
                    more an asset resembles a conventional building or structure, the more unlikely
                    it will be held to be “plant”. If the asset concerned looks like a
                    building and is constructed from permanent materials (such as brick and mortar),
                    it should almost certainly be described as a “building” (unless,
                    of course, it falls into one of those rare cases where it can be more
                    appropriately described as a piece of equipment rather than a building).
                    Conversely, assets which are constructed from temporary and ephemeral materials
                    cannot, in the vast majority of cases, be said to be buildings in any sense of
                    the word. However, there remain intermediate situations such as the present case
                    (where the dormitories are constructed of <em>pre-fabricated
                        material</em>). In such instances, we are of the view that the
                    intention of the taxpayer in relation to the use and location of the asset could
                    be a decisive factor, and we will elaborate on this below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Whether the asset is intended to be only temporarily located </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     As we mentioned earlier, buildings or
                    structures carry with them a certain connotation of permanence and, hence, an
                    asset is less likely to be considered a building if it does not remain on any
                    one site permanently. In such circumstances, the <em>intention</em> of the person who incurred the expenditure on the
                    asset will, in our view, be a crucial factor. If it can be demonstrated, via
                    objective evidence, that that person only intended for the asset to be <em>temporarily</em> located and moved around from place to
                    place, then that asset is unlikely to constitute a building. Conversely, if it
                    can be demonstrated, again via objective evidence, that that person brought the
                    asset into existence with the intention that it be <em>permanent</em> in nature, then that asset is more likely to
                    constitute a building, notwithstanding the fact that it may not be as
                    permanently constructed as a normal building. Indeed (as we shall see below at
                        <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>), this particular criterion will be
                    of critical significance in the context of the facts of the present appeal.
                    Insofar as the former is concerned (<em>viz</em>, an
                    intention that the asset concerned was to be only temporarily located and would
                    be moved around from place to place), reference may be made to two Australian
                    decisions which were, in fact, cited by the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In the High Court of Australia decision of
                        <em>Quarries Ltd v Federal Commissioner of
                        Taxation</em> (1961) 106 CLR 310 (“<em>Quarries</em>”), the taxpayer’s business was to quarry
                    and crush stone at various remote places. As it was required to move from site
                    to site, part of its train of equipment consisted of portable sleeping units,
                    which were small enclosed sheds or cubicles which were transported upon a
                    trailer. The taxpayer claimed capital allowances on the basis that the sleeping
                    units were ““plant” or articles owned by a taxpayer and
                    used by him “for the purpose of producing assessable income” under
                    s 54 of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act
                    1936–1957 (Cth). The court held in favour of the taxpayer. Taylor J
                    observed thus (at 314):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Of course, “article” cannot ordinarily be taken to
                        comprehend a structure erected or built <em>in
                            situ</em> (cf. <em>In the Matter of Application for
                            the Registration of Designs by R. H. Collier &amp; Co
                            Ltd</em> (1937) 54 RPC 253) though in some circumstances a
                        structure in the nature of a building may be “plant”
                            (<em>The Australian Gas Light Co v The
                            Valuer-General</em> (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126 at 141). <em>However the sleeping units, are not structures in the nature of
                            buildings in the ordinary sense of that expression; they were, as
                            appears, designed and constructed as portable or movable equipment for
                            use in connexion with the nomadic type of business which the taxpayer
                            carries on</em>. As such they were just as much
                        “articles” as were the tents which, earlier during the year of
                        income in question, were provided by the tax-payer. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Similarly in <em>Case
                        A43</em> (1969) 69 ATC 244, the taxpayer’s business
                    consisted of the manufacture as well as on-site erection of power plants and,
                    like the taxpayer in <em>Quarries</em>, this required the
                    taxpayer to move from site to site. The taxpayer erected sheds on its different
                    work sites which were used as offices, stores, workshops, changing rooms, and
                    toilets <em>etc</em>. The Australian Income Tax Board of
                    Review held that the sheds were “plant”.
                    Mr R E O’Neill, whom the rest of the board agreed with,
                    stated (at [23]) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... At any particular time sheds upon a contract site are there only
                        temporarily for the duration of and for the purposes of and in relation to
                        the particular job which the company has contracted to do at that site. In
                        such a context it seems to me that the sheds have the character of
                        “plant” rather than that of “setting”
                        <em>even though like structures would be
                            “setting” if located permanently on the company’s
                            own business premises for similar uses in relation to its continuing
                            operations at those premises</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The decisions in these two cases demonstrate
                    that an item is less likely to be classified as a building if it was not
                    intended to remain at one particular site. The above passage (in the preceding
                    paragraph) from <em>Case A43</em>, in particular,
                    clearly indicates that the temporary presence of an item can be the decisive
                    factor making it “plant” whereas another item with the exact same
                    function and physical characteristics but located permanently might not be
                    “plant”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(5)   Parts of a building proper</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We note that more difficult questions of
                    application might arise in relation to <em>parts</em> of a
                    building proper. Whether or not these constitute “plant” or
                    building would depend very much upon the precise factual matrix. Given the
                    myriad of permutations of possible fact situations, it would be invidious to
                    generalise. Nevertheless, we are of the view that if the item (or items)
                    concerned, although not a building proper as such, is inextricably connected
                    with a building, it can be regarded as part of the building for income tax
                    purposes. In this regard the following observations of Hoffmann J in
                        <em>Wimpy</em> are instructive (at 173):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the question seems to me to be whether it would be more appropriate to
                        describe the item as having become part of the premises than as having
                        retained a separate identity. This is a question of fact and degree, to
                        which some of the relevant considerations will be: whether the item appears
                        visually to retain a separate identity, the degree of permanence with which
                        it has been attached, the incompleteness of the structure without it and the
                        extent to which it was intended to be permanent or whether it was likely to
                        be replaced within a relatively short period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Some examples of the application of this
                    principle can be found in <em>Imperial Chemical
                        Industries</em> (considered above at <a href="#p1_55">[55]</a>), in <em>Wimpy</em> itself, and in the
                    English High Court decision of <em>Hampton (Inspector of Taxes) v
                        Fortes Autogrill Ltd</em> (1979) 53 TC 691, where the taxpayer
                    carried on business as a caterer and had installed false ceilings in its
                    restaurants to provide cladding for various pipes and electrical conduits. The
                    court held that the false ceilings were part of the premises in which the
                    taxpayer’s business was carried on.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(6)   Some illustrations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     Taking all the above factors into account, we
                    would, by way of <em>illustration only</em>, postulate the
                    following examples of what, in our view, might (or might not) constitute
                    “buildings”:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_a"></a>(a)     A crane used to lift and lower bulky
                        objects would qualify as “plant” even if it is permanently
                        fixed to a certain spot and is constructed such as to last for decades. This
                        is because it obviously functions as a giant piece of equipment or machinery
                        and cannot be likened to a building or structure.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_b"></a>(b)     Curtains and movable partitions in a
                        shophouse or office would also be “plant” even if their sole
                        purpose was simply to exist as part of the premises because they cannot be
                        said to physically resemble buildings or structures in any way, nor would
                        they be sufficiently connected with the shophouse or office to form an
                        inextricable part of the building.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_c"></a>(c)     An office put up at a construction site and made of brick
                        and mortar would be considered a building instead of “plant”,
                        even if the contractor or developer intended to demolish it in a couple of
                        years after the construction is complete. This is because the office
                        functions as premises, is constructed of permanent materials, and so
                        obviously resembles a building.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_d"></a>(d)     Wooden sheds and storehouses located permanently at a
                        site would also be considered buildings instead of “plant”.
                        Although constructed of less durable materials than concrete buildings, they
                        have the sole function of housing and are also not meant to be moved around.
                        Thus, they are also just as permanent as concrete
                    buildings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_66-p2_e"></a>(e)     Tents
                        used for accommodation and shelter are definitely “plant”.
                        They have very little resemblance to actual buildings or structures and are
                        meant to be moved from place to place.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     While it would of course be impossible to set
                    out an exhaustive list of what is (or is not) “plant”, we are of
                    the view that the framework we have just described should provide a principled
                    basis for a court or tribunal concerned to decide a particular case. We also
                    recognise that, even with this framework in place, there would inevitably be
                    cases falling on the borderline, of which the present appeal is a perfect
                    example. In such cases, where it is reasonable to conclude that an asset can be
                    either “plant” or a building, an appellate court should not
                    interfere with the decision rendered at first instance. This position is made
                    clear by s 81(2) of the ITA which states that any appeal from the Board to
                    the High Court (and consequently any appeal from the High Court to the Court of
                    Appeal) can only be on a question of law or of mixed law and fact. As Judith
                    Prakash J noted in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>NP v Comptroller of Income Tax</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 599,
                    s 81(2) reflects a similar rule in the United Kingdom and the rationale for
                    such rule was explained by Lord Radcliffe in <em>Edwards
                        (Inspector of Taxes) v Bairstow</em> [1956] AC 14 (at 38):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As I see it, the reason why the courts do not interfere with
                        commissioners’ findings or determinations when they really do involve
                        nothing but questions of fact is not any supposed advantage in the
                        commissioners of greater experience in matters of business or any other
                        matters. The reason is simply that by the system that has been set up the
                        commissioners are the first tribunal to try an appeal, and in the interests
                        of the efficient administration of justice their decisions can only be upset
                        on appeal if they have been positively wrong in law. <em>The
                            court is not a second opinion, where there is reasonable ground for the
                            first</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     More specifically in relation to the issue of
                    whether an asset is “plant” or a building, Lord Lowry said in
                        <em>Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries</em>
                    (at 327):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) It is a question of law what meaning is to be given to the word
                        “plant”, and it is for the courts to interpret its meaning,
                        having regard to the context in which it occurs. <em>(2) The law does not supply a definition of plant or prescribe a
                            detailed or exhaustive set of rules for application to any particular
                            set of circumstances, and there are cases which, on the facts found, are
                            capable of decision either way. (3) A decision in such a case is a
                            decision on a question of fact and degree and cannot be upset as being
                            erroneous in point of law unless the commissioners show by some reason
                            they give or statement they make in the case stated that they have
                            misunderstood or misapplied the law in some relevant
                            particular</em>. (4) The commissioners err in point of law
                        when they make a finding which there is no evidence to support. (5) The
                        commissioners may also err by reaching a conclusion which is inconsistent
                        with the facts they have found. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     This would be an appropriate juncture to draw
                    the various threads together and summarise the applicable legal
                    principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">A summary</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The applicable legal principles may be
                    summarised as follows (bearing in mind the caveat that, in the final analysis,
                    the precise factual matrix as well as context is of the first importance and
                    that the following propositions are only the most basic ones and do not include
                    the nuances that are to be found in the relevant case law):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_a"></a>(a)     There is a basic distinction between
                        “plant” on the one hand and buildings on the
                    other.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_b"></a>(b)     “<em>Plant</em>” consists in
                            <em>apparatus</em> that is utilised <em>for carrying on the trade or business
                        concerned</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_c"></a>(c)     “<em>Building</em>”, on the other
                        hand, consists of a permanent structure or part of a permanent structure
                        that houses the trade or business. It is often described, in a shorthand
                        manner, as the place in which a trade or business is carried on. To the
                        extent that a “building” houses the trade or business, it is,
                        to that extent, an asset with which a trade or business is carried on.
                        However, because of their qualitative difference <em>vis-à-vis</em> “plant”, buildings are granted lower
                        rates of capital allowances, and even then, capital allowances are only
                        granted in the specific circumstances set out in the ITA. In order to
                        ascertain whether or not a particular asset is a “building” or
                        ““plant””, the following factors are
                        helpful:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_70-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       The exact operational role
                            which the asset plays in the taxpayer’s
                        business.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_70-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The physical nature and characteristics of the
                        asset.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_70-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       Whether the asset concerned is intended <em>only</em> to be <em>temporarily</em>
                            located.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_70-p2_c-p3_iv"></a>(iv)       Where it appears that the asset, although not a building proper
                            as such, is nevertheless inextricably connected with a building, it can
                            be regarded as <em>part</em> of the building for
                            income tax purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_70-p2_c_1"></a>(c)     In the final analysis, much will depend upon <em>the precise factual matrix and context</em>
                        concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Let us now proceed to apply these legal
                    principles to the facts of the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether this court should interfere with the conclusions of the Board
                and the Judge </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     We turn first to Mr Aw’s
                    alternative argument, that the question of whether the Appellant’s
                    dormitories were “plant” is one of fact and degree and that the
                    answer given by the Board should be treated as decisive unless it was an
                    unreasonable conclusion on the facts. While we agree completely with
                    Mr Aw’s statement of the law, we are of the view that both the Board
                    and the learned Judge below had, with respect, erred in law (as opposed to fact)
                    by focusing on the sole factor of the dormitories being used as the
                    “setting” or “premises” for the taxpayer’s
                    business without taking into consideration other relevant factors. The Board, in
                    arriving at its decision, had expressly disregarded the fact that the
                    dormitories were portable and demountable, and that they were only intended to
                    be situated at the Site for nine years at the most.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Similarly, this was the approach adopted by
                    the Judge. Although the Judge had correctly cited the cases of <em>Wimpy</em> and <em>Carr</em> (which
                    addressed the basic distinction between “plant” and buildings), he
                    went on to conclude that the dormitories were not “plant” because
                    they were used solely as the premises for the taxpayer’s business of
                    providing accommodation and did not have any additional function (see <em>ZF(HC)</em> at [35]–[37]). With respect, it appears
                    that the Judge had inadvertently applied the wrong legal test because he had
                    reverted to the former approach of buildings being treated as being <em>equivalent to</em> setting or premises. In doing so, the
                    learned Judge had not taken into consideration the portability and
                    demountability of the dormitories, nor the fact that they were meant to be
                    temporarily situated at the Site. We agree with the Judge that portability and
                    demountability were not the <em>functions</em> of the
                    dormitories but this did not mean that they were irrelevant to the final
                    enquiry.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     If the Board or the Judge had taken into
                    account the temporary nature and the physical characteristics of the dormitories
                    in the context of whether or not the dormitories were “<em>buildings</em>” (or “<em>buildings
                        proper</em>” in the context of the terminology utilised in this
                    judgment), and still decided that the dormitories were not
                    “plant”, we would probably not have disturbed such a finding
                    because it would not have been clearly unreasonable on the facts. As we
                    mentioned earlier at <a href="#p1_67">[67]</a>, we consider the
                    present case to be very much on the borderline. Nevertheless, since the Board
                    and the Judge had, with respect, not applied the correct legal test and we do
                    not know what the result would have been if they had, we consider it open to us
                    to arrive at our own conclusion on the facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the portable dormitories are “plant”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The Judge held, in effect (and leaving aside
                    the terminology he utilised (<em>cf</em> above at <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a>–<a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>)), that the dormitories were indeed utilised for the
                    purposes of the Appellant’s business. We agree. Indeed, these dormitories
                    were the very tools of trade without which the Appellant would not have been
                    able to conduct its business at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     However, could it be argued that,
                    notwithstanding the finding referred to in the preceding paragraph, the
                    dormitories in the present proceedings were nevertheless
                    “buildings”, thus bringing them <em>outside</em> the purview of “plant”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Although the dormitories in the present case
                    could reasonably have been held to be either “plant” or buildings,
                    a final decision has to be made on the facts. Having considered the
                    circumstances, we are of the view that the dormitories qualify as
                    “plant” for the purposes of ss 19 and 19A of the ITA. Even
                    though they were definitely not large pieces of equipment and also resembled
                    buildings from a physical perspective, they were not made of such lasting
                    materials so as to fall inextricably on the buildings side of the boundary.
                    Further, as already noted at the outset of this judgment, the dormitories
                    concerned were never intended to be permanent structures in the manner that
                    buildings proper are intended to be. Indeed, the relevant conditions were such
                    that the taxpayer might have had to dismantle the dormitories within
                    90 days (this is to be contrasted, for example, with the <em>permanent</em> quarantine kennels in <em>Carr</em>). In the circumstances, the dormitories were more akin to
                    apparatus or equipment or machinery (albeit like, for example, the dry dock in
                        <em>Barclay Curle</em> and the silos in <em>Schofield</em>, being rather large in size). <em>Indeed, the Appellant had intended that they be located only
                        temporarily and would be moved around from place to place when the need
                        arose</em>. It was clearly <em>never</em> the
                    intention of the Appellant to locate the dormitories <em>permanently</em> at the Site. They would, at the extreme end of the
                    spectrum, be located at the Site for nine years <em>at
                        most</em>, and could in fact even have been moved much earlier. Looked
                    at in this light, we are of the view that the dormitories were <em>not</em> buildings proper but constituted, instead,
                    “plant”. That an item is not necessarily precluded from
                    constituting “plant” just because it provides temporary
                    accommodation to actual persons is illustrated by the High Court of Australia
                    decision of <em>Quarries</em> where, it will be recalled,
                    it was held that <em>portable sleeping units</em> (which
                    comprised small enclosed sheds or cubicles constructed of galvanized iron and
                    timber and were capable of being readily and conveniently moved by crane and
                    which were transported by a trailer attached to a prime-mover) constituted
                    “plant”. These sleeping units were provided for the accommodation
                    of the taxpayer’s employees whilst they were engaged in the
                    taxpayer’s business of quarrying and crushing stone. The duration of the
                    operations of quarrying and crushing at each site appeared to vary between three
                    and six months, with the average period being approximately six months. It
                    should be noted, however, that the Income Tax Board of Review, in the present
                    proceedings, had <em>distinguished</em> the decision in
                        <em>Quarries</em> in the following manner (see
                        <em>ZF (ITBR)</em> at [26]–[27]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26.    However, we agree with the Respondent that, in
                            relying on the <em>Quarries</em> case, the
                            Appellant had not given due consideration to the trade of the taxpayer
                            in the <em>Quarries</em> case. In the <em>Quarries</em> case, the taxpayer was in the trade of
                            quarrying and crushing stones, and pursuant to a contract with the South
                            Australian highway authority, was required to win and crush stone at
                            various, frequently remote, places. The duration of its operations at
                            each site was on average six months, and the sleeping units in question
                            were transported upon a trailer attached to a prime mover when it was
                            time to relocate. It is clear that the sleeping units in the <em>Quarries</em> case were deployed to enable the
                            taxpayer to carry out its business of stone quarrying and
                            crushing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">27.    In contrast, the Appellant does not, for the
                            purposes of its trade, require the use of the Dormitories to be portable
                            or demountable in order for the Appellant to carry out its business,
                            which is the provision of accommodation to workers. The fact that the
                            Appellant has assembled the Dormitories using Pre-Fabricated Structures
                            is for its own convenience in the event it is required to vacate the
                            Site at short notice. This must be distinguished from a situation where,
                            due to the particular circumstances or nature of the Appellant’s
                            business, the Dormitories are to be constructed using Pre-Fabricated
                            Structures (as in the case of the portable sleeping units in the
                                <em>Quarries</em> case). In the present
                            circumstances, the Appellant could just as well have carried on its
                            business of providing accommodation without using Pre-Fabricated
                            Structures, and the Dormitories are no more than the building or
                            premises in which the Appellant carries out its trade. The fact that the
                            Dormitories happen to be demountable or portable does not change this
                            analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     With respect, we do not agree with the above
                    analysis. In our view, given the specific <em>context</em>
                    of the factual matrix in the present proceedings, the Appellant <em>did</em>, in fact, require –
                    <em>for the purposes of its trade –</em> that the
                    dormitories be portable or demountable in order for it to carry out its business
                    of providing accommodation on a temporary basis. The very nature of its
                    business, the provision of accommodation for workers on a temporary basis,
                    requires the Appellant to use this kind of facility. It would have made no
                    commercial sense for the Appellant to have built, presumably at greater expense,
                    dormitories made of permanent (as opposed to pre-fabricated) materials,
                    particularly since it might have had to vacate the premises concerned at
                    relatively short notice. Further, dormitories made of permanent materials could
                    not be moved around from place to place. Looked at in this light, the factual
                    situation in the present proceedings was not dissimilar, in substance, to that
                    in <em>Quarries</em>. Indeed, the focus in <em>Quarries</em> (especially at 317) was on the issue as to
                    whether or not the sleeping units were necessary in order to enable the taxpayer
                    concerned to carry out its trade. Likewise, in the present proceedings, the
                    dormitories were in fact necessary to enable the taxpayer to carry out its
                    business. Indeed, these dormitories constituted the very tools <em>without which</em> it would have been <em>impossible</em> for the Appellant to carry out its business <em>at all</em>. The <em>nature</em> of the
                    dormitories relates more to the issue as to whether or not they were buildings
                    proper. And, for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph, we are of the
                    view that the dormitories were <em>not</em> buildings
                    proper and constituted <em>“plant”</em>
                    instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     The dormitories, which are the subject of the
                    present appeal, might, however, be <em>contrasted with
                        hotels</em> which are, <em>ex hypothesi</em>,
                    permanent structures that therefore constitute buildings proper. Indeed, absent
                    specific statutory provision (for example, in respect of hotels on the island of
                    Sentosa pursuant to s 18(1)(<em>h</em>) of the ITA), a
                    hotel would not even qualify for capital allowances as “industrial
                    building or structure” (see s 18(6) of the ITA). In the present
                    case, however, the dormitories concerned were not unlike <em>temporary</em> structures such as <em>tents</em>. Similarly, if the Appellant had used cargo containers,
                    stacked on top of one another and modified for the purposes of providing
                    accommodation to the workers, such containers would not have been considered as
                    buildings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In the circumstances and for the reasons set
                    out above, we allow the appeal with costs both here and below (both in the High
                    Court as well as before the Board). The usual consequential orders are to
                    follow.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Postscript</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     We also take this opportunity to clarify a
                    peripheral issue pertaining to income tax appeals before this court in general.
                    Counsel for the Appellant had written in to the court prior to the hearing of
                    this appeal requesting for the appeal to be heard <em>in
                        camera</em>. Counsel’s request came about as a result of the
                    decision of this court in <em>JD Ltd v Comptroller of Income
                        Tax</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 484 (“<em>JD
                        Ltd</em>”), where the application of s 83(1) of the Income
                    Tax Act (Cap 134, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the 2004 Act”) was
                    considered. This provision is <em>in pari materia</em> with
                    s 83(1) of the present ITA and reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Proceedings before Board and High
                            Court</b>

                        and (3), all proceedings before the Board and in appeals to, or in cases

                        and in appeals from decisions of the High Court under section 81(5) shall be
                        heard in camera.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Section 81 of the 2004 Act is also
                        <em>in pari materia</em> with s 81 of the present
                    ITA and subsection (5) thereof reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Appeals to High
                        Court</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                        right of appeal from decisions of the High Court under this section as
                        exists in the case of decisions made by that Court in the exercise of its
                        original civil jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In <em>JD Ltd</em>, this
                    court (at [59]) interpreted s 83(1) to mean that all proceedings before the
                    Board and the High Court under Part XVIII of the 2004 Act were required to
                    be held <em>in camera</em>. However, Yong Pung How CJ,
                    delivering the judgment of the court, went on to state, as follows (<em>ibid</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... As for proceedings before the Court of Appeal, there is
                        no blanket rule that all such appeals must be held <em>in
                            camera</em>. Indeed, s 83(1) only stipulates that
                        “appeals from decisions of the High Court <em>under
                            section 81(5) shall be heard in camera</em>” [emphasis
                        added]. Section 81(5), in turn, provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">There shall be such further right of appeal from decisions of the High
                            Court ... as exists in the case of decisions made by that Court in the
                            exercise of its <em>original</em> civil
                            jurisdiction. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It must mean, therefore, that s 83(1), read with s 81(5),
                        provides that appeals before the Court of Appeal will only be held <em>in camera</em> if the High Court had heard the case at
                        first instance, that is, if the High Court had heard the case in the
                        exercise of its <em>original</em> civil jurisdiction.
                        The Act remains silent as to the case where the taxpayer appeals against the
                        decision of the High Court exercising its <em>appellate</em> jurisdiction, as is the situation in the present
                        appeal where the case was first heard by the Board of Review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     What the learned Chief Justice was saying, in
                    other words, was that s 81(5) of the 2004 Act gave a right of appeal from
                    the High Court to the Court of Appeal if the High Court had heard an income tax
                    appeal against the assessment of the Comptroller at first instance. Read
                    together with s 83(1), it would mean that income tax appeals before the
                    Court of Appeal would normally not be required to be heard <em>in
                        camera</em> unless the High Court had heard the case at first
                    instance. Nevertheless, Yong CJ went on to state that the Court of Appeal
                    retained the discretion to hear an appeal <em>in
                        camera</em> and accordingly granted the taxpayer’s request for
                    it to do so. The Appellant in this case had thus made a similar request on this
                    basis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     With respect, we do not agree with Yong
                    CJ’s interpretation of s 83(1) of the 2004 Act as only extending to
                    proceedings before the Board and the High Court, but not to proceedings before
                    the Court of Appeal. Section 81(5) provides that “[t]here shall be
                    such further right of appeal from decisions of the High Court under this section
                    as exists in the case of decisions made by that Court in the exercise of its
                    original civil jurisdiction”. The words “in the exercise of its
                    original civil jurisdiction” are not a reference to the proceedings from
                    the Board to the High Court because the High Court would, in such a case, be
                    exercising its appellate, not original, jurisdiction. Hence, we are of the view
                    that the words “as exists” in that subsection simply mean that
                    “just as” in the case of the High Court exercising its original
                    jurisdiction in other cases, there is a further right of appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Accordingly, for future appeals to this court
                    in an income tax matter, it would not be necessary for any party to apply for
                    the appeal to be heard <em>in camera</em>. All such appeals
                    will be heard <em>in camera</em>.</p>
