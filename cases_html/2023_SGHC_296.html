In particular, he noted that the Appellant had made full restitution, by way of redeeming the remaining 17 pieces of gold jewellery and returning them to the Temple. This was done by the Appellant before the Temple lodged a police report, thereby indicating genuine remorse. Further, no loss was caused to the Temple. These mitigating factors, therefore, warranted a reduction of one year’s imprisonment for each of the two CBT Charges.

</div> in the present case where the Appellant was “rolling” the pieces of jewellery which he pawned (see [7] above). Given his modus operandi, the Appellant states that most of the pawn proceeds were, in fact, used by him to pay off the principal sums as well as the interest which he owed to the respective pawnshops when he sought to redeem the pawned items. Therefore, he states that his only real benefits were the sums totalling $141,054.90 as reflected in the CDSA Charges.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I am unable to agree with this argument. When the Appellant pawned the pieces of gold jewellery, he received the pawn proceeds as reflected in the CBT Charges. These pawn proceeds represented the value of the pieces of gold jewellery which the Appellant had misappropriated. How the Appellant chose to use the pawn proceeds <span class="font-italic">subsequently</span> is irrelevant to determining the sum misappropriated in each of the CBT Charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In asking this Court to focus only on the fact that the Appellant was ultimately able to remit just the sum of $141,054.90 out of jurisdiction, the Appellant seeks to minimise the extent of his criminal conduct. While the Appellant may not have been able to transfer the pawn proceeds in full out of jurisdiction, this was because he had instead used the pawn proceeds to pay off the amounts owed to the pawnshops in order to redeem the pieces of gold jewellery belonging to the Temple, and to continue his scheme of “rolling” the pieces of gold jewellery undetected. It was always open to the Appellant to redeem the pieces of gold jewellery from the pawnshops at his own expense and cease his offending conduct. Instead, he perpetrated a scheme where he could repeatedly pawn pieces of gold jewellery belonging to the Temple and cover the amounts owed to the pawnshops by using the pawn proceeds obtained. Here, it is also important to remember that the sums which he owed to the pawnshops were a result of his own unlawful conduct of pawning items which had been misappropriated. In my view, therefore, the Appellant cannot now point to his use of a portion of the pawn proceeds to continue his offending conduct and avoid detection to argue that the sums misappropriated were lower. This is simply a disingenuous argument.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 More significantly, as the Prosecution highlights, it is clear from the proceedings in the court below that the Appellant never particularised how much of the pawn proceeds were actually used to redeem the pieces of gold jewellery which he had pawned and to pay the sums which he owed to the pawnshops.

</div> I do not agree with this characterisation of the Appellant’s offences. It is clear from the Statement of Facts that the Appellant’s offences were carefully designed so as to allow him access to immediate funds as and when he required. The Appellant gained access to such funds by pawning the pieces of gold jewellery to which he had unfettered access because of his position in the Temple. Further, the Appellant even took active steps to avoid detection. From 2016 to 2019, the Appellant would borrow money to redeem and return the pawned pieces of jewellery on each occasion when he learnt that an audit was scheduled.

</div> The Appellant’s scheme was thus carefully planned to avoid detection. The DJ, therefore, did not err in finding that that there was a high degree of planning and premeditation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The Appellant submits that the DJ erred in considering that there was a high degree of trust reposed in the Appellant.

</div> In my view, the Appellant’s argument fails to account for the fact that there was a special responsibility and degree of trust reposed in the Appellant in the present case. The Appellant was initially the Chief Priest’s second-in-charge, and later, the Chief Priest. By virtue of his position, he was the <span class="font-italic">only</span> employee entrusted with the keys and combination number code to the safe in the Temple. As the Prosecution correctly highlights, it is trite that the quality and degree of trust reposed in an offender in such offences is a factor relevant to determining the appropriate sentence.

In fact, in his subsequent decision in<span class="font-italic"> Chong Kum Heng v Public Prosecutor</span> [2020] 4 SLR 1056 (“<span class="font-italic">Chong Kum Heng</span>”), See J stated unequivocally (at [70]) that he had not commented specifically on the appropriateness of the sentencing ranges set out in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Second, the Appellant points to the fact that the sentencing ranges in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> were considered and applied in the subsequent High Court decisions of <span class="font-italic">Chong Kum Heng</span> and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Juandi bin Pungot </span>[2022] 5 SLR 470 (“<span class="font-italic">Juandi</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Pungot</span>”). In my view, it is important to carefully examine the court’s treatment in these decisions of the sentencing ranges in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span>:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Chong Kum Heng</span>, See J commented on the sentencing ranges set out in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span>, stating (at [70]) that it would be more rational and helpful when setting out a general guide <span class="font-italic">to ensure that the respective sentencing ranges suggested do not leave gaps in between the respective bands</span>. See J then set out indicative broad sentencing bands for CDSA charges which involve amounts up to $40,000 (without commenting further on charges where the amounts are above $40,000, since that did not feature in <span class="font-italic">Chong Kum Heng</span>).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">Juandi</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Pungot</span>, Hoo J considered the sentencing ranges issued in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span>, because the ranges were relied on by both the prosecution and the defence. Hoo J stated that she broadly agreed with the approach (at [73]), but <span class="font-italic">only</span> made reference to two of the ranges set out in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk </span>(for amounts of $100,000 to $300,000, and $300,000 to $500,000). However, even then, Hoo J found (at [76]) that an uplift from the ranges was necessary to take into account that the facts in <span class="font-italic">Juandi</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Pungot</span> were more egregious than <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 What this means, therefore, is that the sentencing ranges which have been issued by the District Court in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> have not been specifically endorsed <span class="font-italic">in its entirety</span> by an appellate court thus far. While the sentencing ranges in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> have sometimes been used as a reference point for determining the appropriate sentence, adjustments have had to be made to the sentencing ranges for two reasons: (a) the sentencing ranges do not sufficiently address the fact that s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA is an offence-creating provision which can capture a wide range of offences with differing severity, given that the sentencing ranges are only based on one consideration (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the amounts in the charge); and (b) the sentencing ranges have a clear shortcoming as seen by the gaps left in between the respective bands. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 More crucially, as was noted in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v </span><span class="font-italic">Sindok Trading Pte Ltd (now known as BSS Global Pte Ltd) and other appeals</span> [2022] 5 SLR 336 at [29], sentencing frameworks and benchmarks should generally be left to the appellate court. Further, sentencing frameworks and benchmarks should only be imposed when there are sufficient cases, and should not be imposed <span class="font-italic">a priori </span>generally.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Given the above, my views are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, I do not find that the sentencing ranges set out by the District Court in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> were binding on the court below in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, as was observed in <span class="font-italic">Chong Kum Heng </span>(at [70]), I note that there is a glaring issue with the sentencing ranges set out in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span>, since they leave gaps in between the respective bands. Further, the sentencing ranges set out in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> was designed specifically to cover cases where the moneys which are the subject of the offence under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA are recovered. Therefore, the ranges may only apply to a <span class="font-italic">limited </span>set of cases and may have limited utility in the wider range of offences falling under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA. Finally, as the Prosecution has correctly observed, while the decision in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> set out sentencing ranges principally based on the <span class="font-italic">amounts</span> reflected in the CDSA charges, the quantum laundered cannot be the only determining factor for such CDSA offences.

</div> There are other factors which need to be factored into the analysis (as laid out in the harm-culpability framework in <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>which I will consider below). For these reasons, I do not endorse the sentencing ranges in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span>, and the sentencing ranges should not be regarded as operative.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Further, I do not seek to lay down a sentencing framework or benchmark for offences under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA in the present case. The parties in this appeal have not proposed the laying down of such a framework or benchmark. Further, given the unique facts of the present case, I do not find that this is an appropriate case for a sentencing framework or benchmark to be laid down covering offences under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 While I have already stated that I do not endorse the sentencing ranges in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> and that the sentencing ranges should not be regarded as operative, I should nevertheless add that the individual sentences of 12 months’ imprisonment imposed by the DJ in relation to the CDSA Charges cannot be said to be manifestly excessive even if the sentencing ranges in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> are considered (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, five to nine months’ imprisonment for charges covering amounts from $40,000 to less than $100,000):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the sentencing ranges in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk </span>were set out on the basis that the monetary sum in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> was recovered. In the present case, there was no recovery of the sums which were the subject of the CDSA charges (being the amount totalling $141,054.90 which was remitted by the Appellant to bank accounts in India). While the Appellant had made full restitution, this was in relation to the pieces of gold jewellery belonging to the Temple which the Appellant redeemed and returned to the Temple (see [11] above). In my view, such restitution is only relevant in so far as the CBT Charges are concerned. However, the point remains that, in relation to the CDSA Charges, the amounts were transferred out of jurisdiction and were not recovered.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the duration of offending in relation to the CDSA charges here was four years, which is significantly longer than the duration of offending in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> of seven days. Further, the total number of remittances and transfers was also higher (40 in the present case versus a maximum of 26 for one of the offenders in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span>).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the circumstances surrounding the offences were also more egregious in the present case, given the manner in which the Appellant had abused the trust reposed in him as Chief Priest by remitting the criminal proceeds derived from his sustained offending, as opposed to the offenders in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> whose CDSA offences were borne out of opportunistic conduct while at a casino.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Whether the DJ erred by considering the offence-specific factors set out in <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Given my above finding that the sentencing ranges set out by the District Court in <span class="font-italic">Ho Man Yuk</span> were not binding on the court below, I find that the DJ correctly considered the offence-specific factors set out in <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 While it is correct that the offence which arose for consideration in <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun </span>and for which a sentencing framework was devised was an offence under s 44(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the CDSA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an offence for assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct), I agree with the Prosecution that many of the offence-specific factors set out in <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun</span> would be equally applicable to a case involving an offence under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an offence<span class="font-italic"> </span>of laundering one’s own benefits from criminal conduct). As the Prosecution observes, the underlying criminality of both type of offences under the CDSA are the same, given that they target conduct seeking to conceal, remit or transfer criminal benefits. Further, the prescribed punishments for both offences are also the same.

</div> In my view, therefore, the offence-specific factors in <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun </span>are relevant to offences under s 47(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CDSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 As is clear from the DJ’s GD (at [43]–[44]), the DJ had carefully considered the offence-specific factors set out in <span class="font-italic">Huang Ying-Chun</span> which featured in the present case.

</div>
</div> While I agree with the Appellant generally that unreported precedents have little precedential value given that they are unreasoned (as I had previously stated in<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Toh Suat Leng Jennifer v Public Prosecutor</span> [2022] 5 SLR 1075 at [51]), I do not find that the DJ <span class="font-italic">significantly</span> relied on unreported precedents in arriving at the sentences for the CDSA Charges. The DJ’s GD makes clear that his decision was ultimately founded on his assessment of the offence-specific factors which featured in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 For the above reasons, I do not find that the individual sentences imposed by the DJ were manifestly excessive. Neither can the total sentence of five years’ and 12 months’ imprisonment be said to be manifestly excessive in view of the aggravating factors in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In fact, if at all, the individual sentences imposed on the proceeded CBT Charges and CDSA Charges were lenient, given that the charges were amalgamated under s 124(2) of the CPC. This meant that s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the CPC applied, which <span class="font-italic">doubled</span> the court’s sentencing jurisdiction. As I had previously stated in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Song </span><span class="font-italic">Hauming Oskar and another appeal</span> [2021] 5 SLR 965 (at [69]), the device of amalgamation is not merely administrative or procedural in nature. Rather, amalgamation may be used to signal the higher criminality of an accused person and the gravity of his criminal conduct. This is precisely why s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) doubles the maximum punishment which may be imposed. While I had stated the point above in the context of amalgamation under s 124(4) of the CPC, this would similarly apply to amalgamation under s 124(2) of the CPC. However, the Prosecution did not file an appeal in the present case. The Prosecution also did not make any arguments on the effect of amalgamation in the court below or in the course of this appeal. Therefore, I see no reason to disturb the sentences imposed by the DJ.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Appellant’s appeal against sentence is therefore dismissed.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Vincent Hoong<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"></div><div class="txt-body text-right"><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">Divanan s/o V Narkunan (Phoenix Law Corporation) for the appellant;</span></div><div class="txt-body text-right">Lynn Tan and Benjamin Low <span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)">(Attorney-General’s Chambers)</span><span style="color: rgba(33,37,41,1)"> for the respondent.</span></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
