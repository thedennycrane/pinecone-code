</div> The defendant denies that the KL Property was sold at his direction or under his control and that he received the net proceeds, whether in the joint account or in any other way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In order for the plaintiff to establish that the defendant is any sort of trustee for this $100,000, he must prove on the balance of probabilities that the defendant received the net proceeds of sale of the KL property. The plaintiff has failed to discharge this burden. More precisely, he has failed to prove any one of these three necessary propositions: (a) that the defendant directed or controlled the sale of the KL Property in 1995; (b) that the defendant deposited the net proceeds of sale into the joint account; or (c) that the defendant received the net proceeds of sale by some other means or in some other account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The plaintiff cannot prove any of these three propositions from his personal knowledge or from the personal knowledge of any witness he called at trial. He is therefore unable to prove these propositions by direct evidence as defined in s 62(1) of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “EA”). The plaintiff therefore has no alternative but to attempt to prove these propositions by relying on two categories of non-direct evidence: (a) circumstantial evidence; and (b) oral statements which the Mother made to the plaintiff’s wife from March to May 2013.

The recordings and transcripts of them were produced at trial. The plaintiff’s wife gave evidence and proved the recordings. The defendant does not allege that the recordings or the transcripts are an inaccurate record of the contents of these conversations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The conversations covered a number of topics. The critical conversation for present purposes took place in April 2013. The transcript of this conversation records the Mother making four statements of relevant fact to the plaintiff’s wife. First, the Mother did not want to sell the KL Property and wanted to continue to earn rental income from it. Second, it was the defendant who persuaded her to sell the KL Property. Third, the defendant directed and controlled the sale of the KL Property. Finally, the defendant used the net proceeds of sale to buy a property in Johor Bahru in the Mother’s name.

</div> If the Mother had been alive and able to give evidence at trial, her evidence would have been inadmissible to prove that the defendant had received the net proceeds of sale.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I accept the defendant’s evidence as to his reason for withdrawing the emergency money. I therefore find that he withdrew the emergency money and deposited it in his account for the Mother’s benefit, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in order to make provision for the anticipated future costs of her medical and long-term care.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the defendant has a duty to account to the Estate for the emergency money. It is not his case that he withdrew the emergency money on the Mother’s instructions or with her consent. His case is only that he did so for her benefit. I have accepted that aspect of his case. But that means simply that he did not act in breach of trust by transferring the emergency money into his account. It does not relieve him of his obligation to account to the Estate for the emergency money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The defendant denies any liability to account for the emergency money by asserting that he is entitled to set it off against expenses at least $200,000 that he incurred out of his own money for the benefit of the mother in looking after her during her lifetime. I do not accept that he is entitled to exercise any such set-off. A trustee cannot exercise self-help in this way, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by appropriating trust property, or the traceable proceeds of trust property, for a particular purpose and then, when asked to account for it, claiming a right to set it off against expenses that the trustee has incurred for that same purpose.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The trustee can, of course, exercise a set off with the beneficiary’s consent. In the absence of consent, the trustee can bring a claim – or, in an action such as this, a counterclaim – for that sum to be paid to him out of the trust property. The defendant has not done either of these things. He is therefore liable to account to the Estate for the emergency money in full.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The only relief that the plaintiff prays for in relation to the emergency money is an order for the defendant to return the money to the Estate together with simple interest under s 12 of the Civil Law Act 1909 (2020 Rev Ed). That is a purely personal claim against the defendant. Of course, the defendant’s liability to account for the emergency money has both personal and proprietary consequences. The Estate could, in principle, assert a proprietary right in the traceable proceeds of the emergency money in the hands of a defendant or even a third party in accordance with the equitable rules of tracing, following, and accessory liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The plaintiff has not established the factual basis for any such proprietary claim and, in any event, does not pursue any such proprietary claim. The plaintiff suggested in evidence, and suggests in submissions, that the defendant used the emergency money to purchase a property in Vietnam in the name of a third party. These are mere suggestions. He has far from proven on the balance of probabilities that the suggestion is in fact true. In any event, the plaintiff had not joined the third party as a defendant to this action. I am therefore unable to make any orders with proprietary consequences in relation to the emergency money. Nor is the plaintiff seeking to recover from the defendant as a personal claim the equivalent of any capital appreciation in the value of the Vietnam property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The plaintiff’s pursuit of only personal relief against the defendant amounts to abandoning any proprietary claim against him. So too, the plaintiff’s prayer for only simple interest on the emergency money amounts to abandoning any claim for compound interest on it in equity on the principle in <span class="font-italic">Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC </span>[1996] 1 AC 669).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In relation to the emergency money, the plaintiff is therefore entitled to the following orders:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) a declaration that that the defendant holds on trust for the Estate the sum of $200,000;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) an order that the defendant pay to the Estate the sum of $267,260.22 being the principal sum of $200,000 together with simple interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date this action was commenced to the date of judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The $418,000</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The remaining sum in the joint account for which the defendant must account to the Estate is the sum of $418,000 that the defendant withdrew as the Mother’s contribution towards the purchase of the JC Court Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I shall analyse the Estate’s claim to this sum together with my analysis of its claim to the JC Court Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The JC Court Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiff claims that the defendant holds the entire beneficial interest in the JC Court Property on trust for the Estate.

</div> From the plaintiff’s perspective, therefore, the defendant knowingly applied his own funds towards the purchase of the JC Court Property contrary to the Mother’s express intent and instruction. It is on this basis that the plaintiff denies that the defendant holds any part of the beneficial interest in the JC Court Property at all for himself, even a beneficial interest that is merely proportionate to the funds of his own that he applied towards the purchase. The plaintiff does accept, however, that the defendant should be entitled to the return of the sum of $300,000 which he applied from his own funds towards the purchase, together with interest that has accrued on it as at 30 March 2017, which he claims totals $390,898.84 (<span class="font-italic">cf</span> [17] above).

</div> I therefore do not need to consider the January 2000 undertaking any further.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The terms of the September 2001 undertaking are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I, Mohamed Saleh … wishes [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] to state that I am … a joint owner of the apartment at … JC Court, with [the Mother] <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">as her trustee only</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in bold and underline]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The first point I make is that the September 2001 undertaking came two years after the Mother and the defendant purchased the JC Court Property. The question I must now decide is whether the defendant's intention to subject the JC Court Property to a trust obligation was sufficiently certain at the time it was purchased, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in 1999. Having a sufficiently certain intention to subject the JC Court Property to a trust obligation in 2001 cannot create an express trust of it in 1999.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The only evidential use to which the plaintiff can put the September 2001 undertaking is therefore as circumstantial evidence of the defendant’s intention at the time of purchase. This requires me to: (a) find that the defendant had the necessary certainty of intention in September 2001; and (b) to infer from that that he had had the same intention at the time of purchase. It is this use of the September 2001 undertaking that I now examine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The defendant’s case is that the September 2001 undertaking does not reflect his true intention in September 2001 because he signed it under “duress”. As I told the defendant at trial and during oral closing submissions, duress as a legal concept is a very narrow one, quite different from the ordinary meaning of the word and quite different also from the defendant’s apparent understanding of the word. Duress as a legal concept is a vitiating factor in the law of contract. In that context, it is confined to duress of the person, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, to an outward manifestation of a person’s consent secured by actual or threatened violence against that person. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The defendant’s evidence is that the duress he faced when he signed the September 2001 undertaking was “duress of losing his job”.

</div>
</div> What the defendant is actually referring to is not duress of the person but economic duress. Economic duress is a contractual doctrine which does not vitiate a contract. Instead, it renders a contract voidable, and even then only if a party can establish that: (a) the counterparty applied pressure which amounted to compulsion of that party’s will; and (b) the pressure that the other party exerted was illegitimate (<span class="font-italic">E</span><span class="font-italic"> C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd and another (Orion Oil Ltd and another, interveners) </span>[2011] 2 SLR 232 at [48]). I do not accept that the defendant has discharged his burden of proving that he signed the September 2001 undertaking under economic duress such that it would, if it were a contract, be voidable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I nevertheless accept the factual basis of the defendant’s submission of economic duress, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he signed the September 2001 undertaking in circumstances in which affixing his signature did not represent his genuine subjective intention. This finding suffices to exclude the subjective intention required to establish certainty of intention in September 2001. The September 2001 undertaking therefore is no evidential basis whatsoever from which I can draw any inference as to the defendant’s intention when he signed it in 2001, let alone at the time of purchase in 1999.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Without certainty of intention, there can be no express trust. It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider certainty of subject matter and certainty of objects. Nevertheless, for completeness, I find that the other two certainties are satisfied. The subject matter of the trust is sufficiently certain: it is the JC Court Property. The object of the trust is also sufficiently certain: it is the Mother. Contrary to the plaintiff’s submission, the objects of a trust are the persons who are to benefit from the trust, and not the objectives or the purposes of the trust (<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span> at [60]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The plaintiff having failed to prove certainty of intention, I reject the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant holds the entirety of the beneficial interest in the JC Court Property on express trust for the Estate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The plaintiff’s alternative submission is that the defendant holds the entirety of the beneficial interest in the JC Court Property on constructive trust for the Estate. This submission proceeds on two alternative grounds. First, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant was a fiduciary for the Mother and earned a secret profit by withdrawing $418,000 from the joint account to purchase the JC Court Property with himself as a joint tenant. Second, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant and the Mother had a common intention that the defendant was to hold the entirety of the beneficial interest in the JC Court Property on trust for the Mother. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 For the reasons which follow, I reject both alternatives. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Secret profit in breach of fiduciary duty</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 As the Court of Appeal held in <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale </span>at [126], a constructive trust arises when a fiduciary uses his position to gain a benefit for himself contrary to his fiduciary obligations:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The basis for arguing that an institutional constructive trust should be imposed in the present circumstances is more specific and arises in a class of its own – namely, where there has been an abuse of a fiduciary position. The principle underlying the imposition of an institutional constructive trust in these circumstances is that a person must not use his position <span class="font-underline">to gain a benefit for himself</span> when he owes obligations of the utmost good faith and loyalty to another. This area of the law is not without controversy, and much ground has been traversed in England both in judicial and academic discourse. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in underline]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I am prepared to assume in the plaintiff’s favour that the defendant was an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary for the Mother (<span class="font-italic">Philip Antony Jeyaretnam and another v Kulandaivelu Malayaperumal and others (Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pamabayan, third party; Pramela d/o Govindasamy and another, non-parties) </span>[2020] 3 SLR 738 at [20]–[21]). In any event, as I have found, he was a resulting trustee of the joint account for the Mother. He was therefore, in that sense, a fiduciary for the Mother.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 I do not accept that the defendant earned a secret profit in breach of either an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty or a breach of his fiduciary duty as a resulting trustee of the joint account by withdrawing $418,000 from the joint account and applying it towards the purchase of the JC Court Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The $418,000 was not any sort of a profit, secret or otherwise. The money in the joint account was trust property. When the defendant withdrew the $418,000 from the joint account, it retained its character as trust property. It did not, in any sense of the word, become a “profit” that he earned from his status as a fiduciary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The defendant withdrew the $418,000 from the joint account in order to purchase the JC Court property for the Mother. That is a purpose for the Mother’s benefit, even if the defendant was to be a joint tenant with her. The withdrawal is therefore not, in itself, a breach of the fiduciary duty that he owed to the Mother. It would have been a breach of his fiduciary duty if he had withdrawn the $418,000 to purchase the JC Court Property for his <span class="font-italic">sole</span> benefit. In that situation, the increase in the value of the JC Court Property from 1999 to 2023 would be a profit that the defendant had earned in breach of trust. If that is what happened, the defendant would today hold the entirety of the beneficial interest in the JC Court Property on trust for the Estate as a constructive trustee. But that is not what happened. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The plaintiff accepts that the defendant applied $418,000 from the joint account for the Mother’s benefit when he purchased the JC Court Property. His submission is that the defendant breached his fiduciary duty to the Mother by applying <span class="font-italic">only</span> $418,000 from the joint account towards the purchase and by purchasing the property in <span class="font-italic">joint</span> names. The plaintiff submits that the defendant should instead have paid for the JC Court Property <span class="font-italic">in full</span> from the joint account and should have purchased the Property for the Mother as its <span class="font-italic">sole</span> owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 To succeed in this submission, the plaintiff would have to advance a case that the mere <span class="font-italic">opportunity</span> to buy the JC Court Property in 1999 itself “belonged” – in some notional sense in equity – to the Mother such that that the defendant held that<span class="font-italic"> opportunity</span> subject to an equitable obligation to exploit it for the sole benefit of the Mother. The diversion of that opportunity to his benefit, even in part, would then be a breach of his fiduciary duty to his mother

</div>
</div> The plaintiff also alleges this common intention was shared by the plaintiff and Fatima.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiff’s and Fatima’s intentions are irrelevant to the existence of a common intention constructive trust. Neither the plaintiff nor Fatima claim any interest in the JC Court Property under a common intention constructive trust. The sole beneficiary of that trust is alleged to be the Mother. The only money used to purchase the JC Court Property came from the Mother and the defendant. The only relevant intentions are therefore the Mother’s and the defendant’s. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The common intention necessary to support a common intention constructive trust is an intention that the property is to be shared beneficially (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun</span> [2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) at [96] citing <span class="font-italic">Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset</span> [1991] 1 AC 107 at 132. The common intention must subsist at the time the property is purchased (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span> at [114] and [153]) or exceptionally, and only in relation to the quantification of their interest, at a later date. But there must be sufficient and compelling evidence of any such change in their common intention (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [114], [153], [160(f)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The plaintiff has not discharged his burden of proving that the Mother’s intention was an intention that she held in common with the defendant at the time the JC Court Property was purchased (<span class="font-italic">Ng So Hang</span><span class="font-italic"> v Wong Sang Woo </span>[2018] SGHC 162 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng So Hang</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [42]). I find that the Mother subjectively intended – at all times from the time the joint account was opened in 1995 until her death in 2017 – that <span class="font-italic">only</span> her money should be used to purchase a residence for her and to make her its <span class="font-italic">sole</span> owner. I also find that the defendant held that intention in common with the Mother at some point before the JC Court Property was purchased. But it is clear that, by the time the JC Court Property was purchased and at all times thereafter, the defendant had abandoned any such intention. That is why he used $300,000 of his own money towards the purchase. Any such intention therefore and thereby ceased to be a common intention at the time the JC Court Property was purchased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Further, the intention that the defendant had, at some time before the JC Court Property was purchased, held in common with his Mother on my assumption was not formed in any manner which obliged him, either at law or in equity, not to abandon it unilaterally. Using <span class="font-italic">only</span> $418,000 of the Mother’s funds to purchase the JC Court Property was not, in itself, a breach of any fiduciary duty to the Mother. He therefore committed no legal or equitable wrong by abandoning that intention. The defendant’s conduct in abandoning an intention held in common with the Mother does not confer any right on the Mother in equity to the entirety of the beneficial interest in the JC Court Property. As I have already pointed out, the mere opportunity to buy JC Court was not, in itself, an opportunity which “belonged” in equity to the Mother. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 There being no common intention at the time the JC Court Property was purchased, there is no basis for a common intention constructive trust over it. No constructive trust having arisen over it, there is no basis for any inquiry as to whether there was a change in the parties’ common intention as to the quantification of their respective beneficial interests in it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Resulting trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 The plaintiff next submits that the defendant holds the entire beneficial interest in the JC Court Property on a resulting trust for the Mother. I accept that the defendant holds the JC Court Property on a presumed resulting trust for the Mother, but only in proportion to her contribution to the purchase of the property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 I begin my analysis by determining the Mother’s and the defendant’s contributions to the purchase of the JC Court Property. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The Mother’s contribution to the purchase of the JC Court Property is the sum of $418,000. This comprises: (a) her contribution of $388,000 to the purchase price; and (b) her contribution to pay in full the stamp duty and legal costs of $30,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The $62,000 which the defendant claims to have paid from the Mother’s money for renovations and furnishings cannot be included as the Mother’s contribution (<span class="font-italic">Neo Hui Ling v Ang Ah Sew</span> [2012] 2 SLR 831 (“<span class="font-italic">Neo Hui Ling</span>”) at [17]–[18]). This is because only direct contributions to the purchase are relevant for the resulting trust analysis (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [114], citing Robert Pearce and John Stevens, <span class="font-italic">The Law of Trusts and Equitable Obligations</span> (Oxford University Press, 4th Ed, 2006) at p 243). The $62,000 could be treated as a direct contribution by the Mother if the renovations had been carried out contemporaneously with the purchase and increased the value of the property (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [126]). But that is not the plaintiff’s case. The plaintiff denies that the defendant spent any such sum on renovations or furnishings at all. Even if that were the plaintiff’s case, there is no evidence before me as to: (a) what proportion of the $62,000 was spent on renovations as opposed to furnishings; and (b) whether the renovations increased the value of the JC Court Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The $30,000 paid from the Mother’s money for the stamp duty and legal fees must be included as the Mother’s contribution. This is because payment of that sum had causative force in vesting legal title to the JC Court Property in the defendant and the mother as joint tenants at law.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 The total cost of purchasing the JC Court Property was $718,000. The Mother’s contribution to the purchase is limited to $418,000. The defendant’s contribution is the remaining $300,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 The Mother and the defendant therefore made unequal contributions to the purchase of the JC Court Property. Upon purchase as joint tenants at law, they held the beneficial interest in the property as tenants in common in equity in proportion to their contributions. Calculated to two decimal places for convenience, their contributions are 58.22% by the Mother and 41.78% by the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The defendant submits that the operation of his right of survivorship at common law entitles him to the entire beneficial interest in the JC Court Property. This is a misunderstanding of a right of survivorship. The right of survivorship has two facets. First, it operates at common law to vest the legal interest of the dead joint tenant in the surviving joint tenants. The interest of the dead joint tenant disappears, and the surviving joint tenants continue to hold the property at common law as joint tenants (<span class="font-italic">Ng So Hang </span>at [47]). Survivorship does not affect any underlying beneficial interests which may subsist in the co-owned property, whether they arose during the lifetime of the joint tenants (<span class="font-italic">Neo Hui Ling </span>at [39]) or after one joint tenant died (<span class="font-italic">Ng So Hang </span>at [46]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 The Mother’s death therefore effected no change in the beneficial interests in the JC Court Property. The defendant is no doubt now recorded on the register of titles as the sole owner of the JC Court Property.

</div>
</div> But that is only at common law, by operation of the right of survivorship under the joint tenancy at law. The Mother’s 58.22% beneficial interest in the JC Court Property remains unaffected by the defendant’s acquisition of legal title in his sole name. The Mother’s beneficial interest has simply devolved upon her Estate. So too, the defendant’s 41.78% beneficial interest in the JC Court Property remains unaffected by his registration as it sole owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The defendant is therefore correct when he says that he became the sole legal owner of the JC Court Property upon and by reason of the Mother’s death in August 2017. But the defendant is wrong when he says that he thereby now also owns the entire beneficial interest in the JC Court Property. The Mother’s death had no effect on the beneficial interest she acquired in the JC Court Property by reason of her unequal contribution to its purchase in 1999.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 In the analysis thus far, I have assumed to be true the defendant’s evidence that he withdrew the Mother’s contribution of $418,000 from the joint account for the Mother’s benefit, and therefore not in breach of trust. But even if I assume that the defendant did so in breach of trust, the practical result is the same. On that assumption, the Estate is now entitled to trace the $418,000 into the JC Court Property. On either alternative, therefore, the ultimate result is that the Mother is entitled in equity to 58.22% of the value of the JC Court Property today.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendant’s alternative submission</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The defendant submits in the alternative that – even if the Mother’s larger contribution gave rise to a presumed resulting trust in her favour and a tenancy in common in equity of the JC Court Property – it was nevertheless the Mother’s and his common intention when purchasing the JC Court Property that the entire beneficial interest in the property should go to the surviving joint owner.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Although the defendant did not put his alternative submission in this way, and did not support it with the relevant authority, it amounts to a submission that the presumed resulting trust arising from the Mother’s larger contribution to the purchase of the JC Court Property gave her a beneficial interest in proportion to her contribution only during her lifetime and did not extend to the remainder which was free of any trust and therefore passed to him at common law upon the Mother’s death under his right of survivorship.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Authority for the defendant’s alternative submission can be found in an <span class="font-italic">obiter dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span>. In that case, at [105], the Court of Appeal suggested that the presumption of a resulting trust need not relate to the entire beneficial interest in the trust property such that, for example, it is possible for one joint owner: (a) to hold the life interest free of any trust while holding the remainder on a presumed resulting trust for the joint owner who made the larger contribution; or (b) to hold the life interest on a presumed resulting trust for the joint owner who made the larger contribution while holding the remainder free of any trust:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">105 …[A] resulting trust need not necessarily relate to the entire interest in the property. The presumption of <span class="font-italic">resulting trust </span>may be rebutted as to a life interest, but may still operate in respect of the interest in remainder: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Napier v Public Trustee</span> (1980) 32 ALR 153. Conversely, the intention may be that the contributing party should receive the income from the purchased property during his life – to this extent the resulting trust prevails, but the property should belong to the benefiting party after his death, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the resulting trust is rebutted as to the remainder: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Young v Sealey</span> [1949] Ch 278. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 I am prepared to assume in the defendant’s favour, without deciding the issue, that this <span class="font-italic">dictum</span> is indeed authority for the proposition that the right of survivorship arising under a joint tenancy at law is capable of being the subject matter of a trust, whether resulting or otherwise, and is therefore a proprietary right of some sort. But even on that assumption, I do not consider that the defendant’s alternative submission makes any difference to my conclusion that the defendant now holds 58.22% of the beneficial interest in the JC Court Property on a presumed resulting trust for the Estate. I say that for three reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 First, for me to entertain this submission at this stage would operate unfairly to the plaintiff. The defendant made this assertion belatedly, only in the course of his oral closing submissions. But in substance, his assertion amounts to evidence of fact. He ought therefore to have given evidence of this alleged common intention on oath or affirmation in chief. And the plaintiff ought to have had an opportunity to cross-examine the defendant on this evidence at trial. The defendant cannot take advantage of his status as a litigant in person to advance evidence of this contentious and self-serving assertion of fact unsworn from the bar and without submitting to cross-examination. I consider that it would be irretrievably unfair to the plaintiff to allow the defendant to add an alternative case in this belated way.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Second, and in any event, I do not accept as being true the defendant’s assertion that it was the Mother’s and his common intention when the JC Court Property was purchased that the entire beneficial interest in the property should go to the surviving joint owner. The assertion is a self-serving afterthought. The defendant made it at a very late stage: after pleadings, after affidavits of evidence in chief, after trial, after written closing submissions and even after presenting his case in his oral closing submissions. It emerged only in response to a leading question from me during his oral closing submissions. Further, the assertion is contrary to the inherent probabilities. The defendant asserts that the Mother and he formed <span class="font-italic">one</span> intention as to how the JC Court Property was to be held during their lifetimes and formed a <span class="font-italic">separate</span> intention as to how it was to be held after either one of them died. Lay persons, particularly family members, do not generally think about the manner in which they are to hold the beneficial interest in property at all, let alone at such depth and in such sophisticated terms.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Third, the defendant’s entire case in this action has been that there is no trust whatsoever in relation to the JC Court Property. He takes this position even in the additional written submissions I allowed him to file in support of his alternative submission based on this belated assertion of fact. In those written submissions, he continues to reiterate that his and the Mother’s joint tenancy took effect absolutely, without any equitable constraints on either the Mother’s or the defendant’s right of survivorship. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I therefore find that both the Mother and the defendant formed no intention as to how the beneficial interest in the JC Court Property was to be held when they made their unequal contributions to its purchase in 1999. Accordingly, the Mother lacked the intention to benefit the defendant by her larger contribution to the purchase of the property. This is precisely the situation that the presumption of resulting trust is intended to cater for.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 Accordingly, I find that the beneficial interests dictated by the presumption of resulting trust bind the parties in equity. The Estate is therefore entitled to 58.22% of the beneficial interest in the JC Court Property and the defendant to a 41.78% interest in it. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Presumption of advancement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 I turn to consider whether the presumption of advancement arises to rebut the presumption of resulting trust (<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan </span>at [160(e)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The presumption of advancement applies in Singapore in favour of a child and against a parent regardless of whether the parent is a father or a mother (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [62]–[68]). That was not always the case. The presumption of advancement developed as the law’s recognition of a man’s moral or equitable obligation, in traditional societies, to provide financially for his wife and children (<span class="font-italic">Low Gim Siah and others v Low Geok Khim and another </span>[2007] 1 SLR(R) 795 at [44]). But in modern societies, women invariably share the burden of providing financially for their children (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [63]). The Singapore courts have accordingly extended the presumption of advancement to cover the mother-child relationship and not just the father-child relationship. The Court of Appeal has even held that the presumption of advancement applies in the context of a joint tenancy between a father, a mother, their son and their daughter-in-law (<span class="font-italic">Low Yin Ni and another v Tay Yuan Wei Jaycie (formerly known as Tay Yeng Choo Jessy) and another) </span>[2020] SGCA 58 at [1] and [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 The presumption of advancement in a parent-child relationship is capable of applying in favour of a child who is an adult and who is no longer dependent on the parent (<span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">an Chin Hoon and others v Tan Choo Suan</span> <span class="font-italic">(in her personal capacity and as executrix of the estate of Tan Kiam Toen, deceased) and others and other matters </span>[2015] SGHC 306 at [235]). The Court of Appeal considered this question briefly in <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> (at [68]). The consideration was <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> <span class="font-italic">dictum </span>because <span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim</span> was a case between spouses, not between parent and child. But the Court of Appeal did indicate in <span class="font-italic">dict</span><span class="font-italic">um</span> that it<span class="font-italic"> </span>was more inclined to apply the presumption of advancement to all transfers from a parent to a child, even if the child was an adult and even if the child was no longer dependent on the parent<span class="font-italic"> </span>(<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [68]). The court at [68] cited with approval the minority view of Abella J in in <span class="font-italic">Pecore v Pecore </span>[2007] 1 SCR 795 (“<span class="font-italic">Pecore</span>”). In her decision, Abella J regarded the presumption of advancement as emerging from both dependency and natural affection. The natural affection being an enduring one, the presumption therefore arises in all gratuitous transfers from a parent to a child, regardless of how old the child is and regardless of whether the child is then dependent on the parent (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [68], citing <span class="font-italic">Pecore </span>at [90]–[103]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The two justifications for the presumption of advancement – dependency and affection – underlie the two key elements that are crucial in determining the strength with which the presumption of advancement arises in any given case: (a) the nature of the relationship between the parties; and (b) the state of the relationship between the parties (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [78]). The first element allows a consideration of the degree of dependency between the parties, bearing in mind the source of the obligation from which the dependency arises. The second element allows a consideration of the degree of affection between the parties at the time of the gratuitous transfer, bearing in mind whether the relationship is at that time a close and caring one or more formal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 On the facts of this case, I hold that the presumption of advancement arises only weakly and has been rebutted by the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The key elements are to be assessed at the time of the gratuitous transfer, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, in 1999 when the JC Court Property was purchased. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 On the key element of dependency, it was the Mother who was dependent on the defendant in 1999. Although the Mother had a substantial sum of money in the joint account, the evidence is clear that she was dependent on the defendant to manage her affairs, including her financial affairs, and to cater for her day-to-day needs. Further, it is the defendant’s own case that he decided to use the Mother’s money to purchase the JC Court Property so that the Mother would have a home of her own. This indicates that the Mother was dependent on the son to manage her financial affairs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 On the key element of affection, it is relevant to consider the number of children that a parent has. The more children a parent has, the less likely it is that the parent intended to make a gift to only one of the children without making similar provision for the other children (<span class="font-italic">Lau Siew Kim </span>at [68]). But this proposition is not writ in stone. If one child is unique in some respect, the fact that the parent had other children will not necessarily operate to the detriment of that one child (<span class="font-italic">Ranjit Singh s/o Ramdarsh Singh (suing as co-executor of the estate of Ramdarsh Singh s/o Danukdhari Singh (alias Ram Darash Singh), deceased and as a beneficiary of the estate) v Harisankar Singh (sued as co-executor of the estate of Ramdarsh Singh s/o Danukdhari Singh (alias Ram Darash Singh) deceased and in his personal capacity)</span> [2021] SGCA 66 (“<span class="font-italic">Ranjit Singh</span>”) at [5]). In <span class="font-italic">Ranjit Singh</span>, a father had six children. All of the children were adults. Three were sons and three were daughters. But only one child was in a unique position in that he was present with the father in Singapore throughout and was financially dependent on the father for his living. Given that this child was in a unique position, the fact that the father had six children, and the fact that the unique child was one of three sons, did not operate to the detriment of that child. The Court of Appeal therefore agreed with the trial judge that the presumption of advancement in favour of this child was not weakened (at [4]–[5]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The presumption of advancement arises in favour of the defendant, but only weakly. The defendant is only one of the Mother’s five children. Although the Mother lived with him from 1995 to 2016, there is no evidence that the Mother considered him unique in any way amongst her five children. Even if I assume that the defendant owed an <span class="font-italic">ad hoc</span> fiduciary duty to the Mother (see [89] above), and even if it was the defendant on whom the Mother was dependent, there is no evidence that the Mother had greater affection for the defendant than for her four other children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 As against this, there is clear and unqualified evidence that the Mother intended that her money in the joint account be used to purchase the JC Court Property to belong to her solely. As I have found, this intention was no longer a common intention at the time of purchase in the sense that the defendant had abandoned it unilaterally. But my finding as to the Mother’s intention is nevertheless sufficient to rebut any presumption of advancement in respect of the Mother’s money which the defendant used to make the larger contribution towards the purchase the JC Court Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the presumption of advancement in favour of the defendant arises only weakly and has been rebutted. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Remedial constructive trust</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 The plaintiff next submits that I should impose a remedial constructive trust on the defendant over the entire beneficial interest in the JC Court Property.

</div> I have thus far made three critical findings. First, the defendant did not breach any fiduciary duty by purchasing the JC Court Property, in part, with his own money (see [89]–[94] above). Second, I have found that the defendant is under a duty to account to the Estate for the emergency money (see [55]–[59] above). Third, I have found that the defendant holds 58.22% of the JC Court Property on a resulting trust for the Estate (see [108]–[112] above). There is no remaining wrong by the defendant for me to remedy by imposing a constructive trust on the entire beneficial interest in the JC Court Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 For the same reasons as I have dismissed the plaintiff’s claims of an express trust (see [71]–[85] above) and an institutional constructive trust (see [86]–[100] above), I decline to impose a remedial constructive trust over the entire beneficial interest in the JC Court Property.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Income from the JC Court Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 The plaintiff seeks an account of the rent that the defendant earned or ought to have earned from the JC Court Property from the date of the Mother’s death in August 2017 to the date the defendant delivers vacant possession of the JC Court Property to the Estate.
