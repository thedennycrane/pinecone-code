<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is an application under Part IVA of the
                    Supreme Court Practice Directions for the discovery and inspection of
                    electronically stored documents (“<b>Part
                    IVA</b>”) for the court to determine the keywords which are to be
                    used to conduct a reasonable search for discoverable documents following the
                    execution of an Anton Piller Order. A summary of the personalities, issues and
                    procedural history leading up to this application is set out in <em>Littau Robin Duane v Astrata (Asia Pacific) Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 361, [1]–[4] &amp; [6], which I adopt for these
                    grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_1"></a>1    The plaintiff was a former group
                        regional director of the defendant. Between March 2005 and December 2009, he
                        was employed in various senior executive and managerial positions in the
                        Asia-Pacific region. During his employment, he signed a Confidentiality,
                        Restrictions &amp; Intellectual Property Agreement (“<b>the non-compete agreement</b>”) with the
                        defendant. On 11 September 2009, the plaintiff gave three months’
                        notice of his resignation. His last day of employment would therefore have
                        been 10 December 2009. However, on 9 December 2009, the defendant purported
                        to dismiss him summarily with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_2"></a>2    The defendant was incorporated in Singapore in
                        October 2003. It is in the business of designing and developing
                        location-based information technology services and solutions (telematics).
                        These solutions enable businesses and government organizations to monitor,
                        trace and control the movement and status of machinery, vehicles, personnel
                        and other assets. The defendant’s business dealings are often
                        confidential as they pertain to matters of security and defence. It is part
                        of the Astrata Group of companies which comprises Astrata (Singapore) Pte
                        Ltd (“<b>ASP</b>”) and Astrata Group
                        Inc (“<b>AGI</b>”), a USA company. AGI
                        is the parent company of the defendant which is in turn the parent company
                        of ASP.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_3"></a>3    The
                        plaintiff commenced an action for the salary due to him from September to 10
                        December 2009 and for payment of expenses and accrued leave. The defendant
                        filed its defence and counterclaim alleging that the plaintiff had breached
                        his duties by giving information to certain entities (“<b>the US parties</b>”) resulting in the defendant
                        having to incur extra costs to defend a Chapter 11 proceeding in the USA.
                        Just before the defendant applied for an interim injunction and a search
                        order against the plaintiff, it sought leave to amend its defence and
                        counterclaim to include a new claim for breach of the non-compete agreement.
                        Its application was allowed save for the prayer asking for leave to use the
                        evidence obtained in this action in any other proceedings between the Tridex
                        Companies and the defendant’s group of companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_4"></a>4    On 21 June 2010, the defendant applied
                        for and obtained an interim injunction and search orders against the
                        plaintiff. These orders were extracted as order no. 2968 of 2010
                            (“<b>the injunction</b>”), order
                        no. 2969 of 2010 and order no. 2986 of 2010 (“<b>the
                            search orders</b>”). Among other things, the defendant
                        alleged that the plaintiff had approached its customers and business
                        partners (namely COSEM, the Tridex Companies and TNT). The injunction
                        enjoined the plaintiff from giving confidential information to third parties
                        and from breaching the non-compete agreement. The search orders were
                        directed at evidence that the plaintiff had given information to the US
                        parties as well as his breach of the non-compete agreement. The search
                        orders were extended by the court on 25 June 2010, extracted as order no.
                        3082 of 2010, as the physical imaging of the plaintiff’s gmail
                            [<em>sic</em>] account could not be completed in
                        time. A moratorium of two weeks was ordered against perusal of any materials
                        obtained as a result of these orders and if the plaintiff should apply
                        within two weeks to set aside or to vary the orders, the prohibition against
                        perusal would continue until further notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_1-p2_6"></a>6    After
                        hearing the parties … I [] lifted the moratorium against perusal
                        … I directed the parties’ solicitors to review the disputed
                        documents obtained and try to come to an agreement whether they fall within
                        the ambit of the search orders, failing which the plaintiff may apply to
                        court to resolve the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In addition to the above, the following facts
                    need also be borne in mind. This action, although commenced in the Subordinate
                    Courts, was transferred to the High Court in March 2010. General discovery was
                    given when the defendant and plaintiff filed their lists of documents on 22
                    April 2010 and 26 April 2010 respectively. Hence, the search orders were
                    obtained in June 2010 after general discovery had been given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Pursuant to the search orders, the defendant had
                    seized, <em>inter alia</em>, the contents of the hard disk
                    of the plaintiff’s Apple iMac 24” desktop computer and his
                    PowerBook G4 notebook computer; as well as the contents of the plaintiff’s
                    e-mail accounts — Gmail account with e-mail address <u>rlittau@gmail.com</u>, LinkedIn account for <u>rlittau@gmail.com</u> and AOL account with e-mail address <u>rlittau@AOL.com</u> (“<b>the seized
                        items</b>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Forensic images of the seized items had also
                    been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the search orders. The
                    volume of data in the seized items is sizeable as shown in the following table,
                    which provides the size of the forensic image for each of the seized
                    items:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Following Tay J’s decision, parties
                    engaged in attempts to agree on the manner of reviewing the forensic images of
                    the seized items. Parties were able to reach agreement that keyword searches
                    ought to be conducted to identify relevant documents, but they were not able to
                    agree on either the list of keywords or the procedure to be adopted after
                    keyword searches have yielded a set of documents that are responsive to the
                    keywords used (“<b>the search
                    results</b>”). On the other hand, parties were able to agree on
                    the use of keyword searches to identify documents which were subject to
                    litigation privilege for exclusion from the review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Framework for conducting review of electronic documents</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Parties appeared before me on two occasions to
                    settle the approach which ought to be adopted in the review. At the hearing on
                    15 November 2010, I made directions that the following 3-stage process be
                    adopted for conducting the review. First, parties are to come to an agreement on
                    a list of keywords to be used to conduct the reasonable search. Thereafter, the
                    reasonable search is to be conducted on the forensic images of the seized items.
                    The search results would then, in the third stage, be reviewed by counsel to
                    identify confidential information and information subject to privilege. The
                    search results, less privileged documents and documents which are otherwise
                    unnecessary for disclosure, will form part of general or further discovery. The
                    application was adjourned for parties to reach an agreement on the list of
                    keywords to be used in the first stage.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 13 December 2010, parties returned before me
                    and appeared to have reached an impasse on the keywords. I ordered that a
                    preliminary search be performed using the list of 251 keywords proposed by the
                    defendants solely for the purpose of identifying the number of hits against each
                    keyword, but with no right to review the underlying documents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Parties came back before me on 12 January 2011
                    for submissions on the disputed keywords; and on 19 January 2011, I heard
                    parties on the limits which ought to be applied on the reasonable search. I set
                    forth hereunder my reasons and the considerations for each stage of the
                    framework for conducting the review.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">First stage: Determining relevance of keywords</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       It was common ground that ocular examination of
                    the electronic documents stored in the seized items was not feasible both by
                    reason of the large volume of documents which had to be reviewed and the legal
                    costs which such a review would have incurred. Parties agreed that the use of
                    keywords to perform a reasonable search on the forensic images of the seized
                    items in order to identify discoverable documents was the preferred approach.
                    However, there was an impasse on the list of keywords which should be
                    used.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether the test for determining relevance of keywords in the review
                of search orders is different from that which is applicable for discovery in the
                pending suit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On behalf of the plaintiff, it was argued that
                    the keywords to be used in the keyword search had to be relevant to issues in
                    dispute. Further, after the keyword search is conducted, a review of the
                    documents which form the search results should be conducted in order to identify
                    documents which are to be finally disclosed. On the other hand, the defendant
                    sought to draw a distinction between its ability to conduct keyword searches on
                    the seized items under the powers given pursuant to the search orders –
                    which it thought should not be fettered by a list of keywords – and the
                    use of keyword searches for the purpose of identifying relevant documents for
                    discovery. The defendant sought to persuade me that its powers under the search
                    orders were somewhat broader and less fettered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I did not agree with the defendant’s
                    submission as I do not see any distinction between the test applicable to
                    determine relevance for compliance with the search orders and relevance for the
                    purposes of discovery in the pending suit. Search orders (previously known as
                        <em>Anton Piller</em> orders) are draconian in nature
                    and, by reason of the very drastic effect and far-reaching consequences such
                    orders may have when executed, they are granted only in exceptional cases:
                        <em>Computerland Corp v Yew Seng Computers Pte Ltd</em>
                    [1991] 2 SLR(R) 379; [1991] SGCA 28, at [17]. The primary purpose of a search
                    order is to preserve evidence relevant to the case from destruction or
                    concealment where there is solid evidence of a real risk that such destruction
                    or concealment might take place: <em>Petromar Energy Resources
                        Pte Ltd v Glencore International AG</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1152; [1999]
                    SGCA 28, at [6].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Documents which are within the scope of a
                    search order has to be, in the first place, relevant to the pending suit in with
                    the search order is made: see for example <em>Asian Corporate
                        Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore
                        Branch)</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 901; [2006] SGCA 1, at [14] where it was
                    noted that one of the four requisites which had to be satisfied before an
                        <em>Anton Piller</em> order is issued is a real
                    possibility that relevant documents will be destroyed. In the execution of
                    search orders, only documents within the scope of the <em>Anton
                        Piller</em> order may be seized. The obligation lies on the party
                    executing the order to ensure full compliance with its scope. It has been
                    observed that 95% accuracy in compliance is not good enough – the
                    draconian nature of <em>Anton Piller</em> orders meant
                    that, “if they are not to become instruments of oppression, their limits
                    must be meticulously obeyed and enforced”: <em>per</em> Yong Pung How J (as he then was) in <em>Peters Edition Ltd and another v Renner Piano Co and another
                        suit</em> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 505; [1989] SGHC 98, at [9].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     If documents falling beyond the scope of a
                    search order are seized, these have to be returned. This is exemplified in the
                    case of <em>Peters Edition Ltd v Renner Piano Co</em>,
                    where the <em>Anton Piller</em> order in question permitted
                    the removal of infringing copies of music books. The defendant had in its stock
                    both genuine copies which it had purchased and unauthorised reproductions.
                    During execution of the <em>Anton Piller</em> order, some
                    genuine copies were also removed. Upon the defendant’s application, the
                    court held the plaintiff to strict compliance with the scope of the <em>Anton Piller</em> order and ordered the return of the genuine
                    copies as these fell beyond the scope of the <em>Anton
                        Piller</em> order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     From the above analysis, it is clear to me
                    that only evidence relevant to the pending suit in which the search order is
                    obtained may be seized. Further, the draconian nature of search orders require
                    that the courts maintain a vigilant watch over the execution of search orders in
                    order to ensure that there is no abuse.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The search orders in this case were obtained
                    for documents which fell within the scope set out in Schedule 2
                        (“<b>the Listed Items</b>”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any and all documents, regardless of medium, including but not limited to,
                        all letters, correspondence, instructions, memoranda, facsimile messages,
                        electronic mail messages, back up [<em>sic</em>] tapes,
                        minutes of meetings, chat transcripts and other communications or documents
                        relating directly or indirectly to:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    Communications between the Plaintiff and/or any of
                            the Named Companies and any permutation thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    Communications between the Plaintiff and/or any of
                            the directors, employees and shareholders of the Named Companies,
                            including but not limited to, Peter Martin, Jed Frost, John Clough,
                            Winston Choo, Govinder Rasu, Victor Chua, Lim Soon Huat, Lau Ming Chiew,
                            Lim Chee Kiat, Lim Chee Kian and James Tan Chan Seng.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    Communications between the Plaintiff and/or any of
                            the former employees of the Defendant and its related companies,
                            including but not limited to Lau Hui Jen and Hoyt Layson.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    Full details of any external storage devices in
                            which any of the Listed Items are stored.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    Any residue system data or text fragment to
                            indicate the presence of relevant files which have been deleted or
                            copied to an external storage device (including data and record of file
                            names) relevant to the listed item.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Further, the search order permitted the imaging of “the
                    entire hard disk or other digital or media storage devices” if any of the
                    Listed Items are found.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     It is clear upon a perusal of the definition
                    of the Listed Items that the definition of the Listed Items confines itself to
                    the types of documents, regardless of medium, which may be seized. However, it
                    does not mean that all documents falling within these descriptions are subject
                    to the search orders. The case law surveyed above has made it clear that before
                    a document may be seized, it has also got to be relevant to the pending suit. In
                    traditional executions of <em>Anton Piller</em> orders, a
                    printed document which falls within any one of the categories above can and has
                    to be examined before it is seized. In the modern context where keyword searches
                    are performed on “the entire hard disk or other digital or media storage
                    devices” which have been seized and imaged, the keywords assist to
                    identify electronic documents for subsequent review. If the purpose of the
                    review is to ensure that only relevant documents are seized, then the keywords
                    which are used during the performance of the keyword search must also be
                    relevant to the issues in the pending suit.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     To my mind, the vigilance which the courts
                    have traditionally kept over executions of <em>Anton
                        Piller</em> orders is all the more necessary in the context of modern
                    day search orders, where electronic recording devices (eg hard disks and USB
                    flash-based removable devices) and storage media (eg optical discs) are often
                    seized and forensic images made. These recording devices and storage media are
                    best regarded as the proverbial filing cabinet, which may contain a surfeit of
                    electronic documents, only part of which are relevant to the pending suit. On
                    this analysis, the party who has seized the recording device or storage medium
                    ought not to be permitted untrammeled access to its entire contents. To do so
                    would, in my view, offend the trite discovery principles which prevent trawling
                    or the emptying of the opponent’s filing cabinets under the guise of
                    discovery: see for example <em>Thyssen Hunnebeck Singapore Pte
                        Ltd v TTJ Civil Engineering Pte Ltd</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 75; [2002]
                    SGHC 247. Indeed, the court in <em>Alliance Management SA v
                        Pendleton Lane P and another and another suit</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R)
                    343; [2007] SGHC 133, which had to consider an application for inspection of a
                    hard disk, required that a protocol be put in place to ensure that the
                    inspecting party is not allowed to trawl through the entire database under the
                    guise of the inspection order.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     For the reasons set out above, I did not agree
                    with the submission that there may be keywords which may be relevant for
                    compliance with the search orders but which may not be relevant for the pending
                    suit. I had, on 15 November 2010, directed that parties discuss and attempt to
                    agree on a list of keywords which are to be used to perform the keyword search.
                    I had also directed that the relevance of any particular keyword may be
                    demonstrated by reference either to the search orders or the pleadings.
                    Additionally, if parties were able to agree on a list of issues, then relevance
                    may be demonstrated by reference to such list. For the purposes of disclosure, I
                    had emphasised that the underlying test ought to be the same as that adopted for
                    discovery under O 24, r 1 or r 5. If parties were not able to agree on any
                    particular keywords, then the court will determine its relevance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary keyword search to aid in determining relevance of
                disputed keywords</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 13 December 2010, as parties had reached an
                    impasse on the list of keywords, I fixed the application for a special hearing
                    date in order to determine relevance of the disputed keywords. To facilitate
                    parties’ submissions and assist the court in determining whether any
                    particular keyword was relevant, the defendant was permitted to run a
                    preliminary search against the forensic images of the seized items using the
                    list of keywords that it had proposed. However, this preliminary search was
                    intended solely for the purpose of identifying the number of hits – ie
                    instances of documents which corresponded to the keyword – and the
                    defendant was not permitted to view any of the documents forming the search
                    results.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     As it turned out, after performing this
                    preliminary search using the defendant’s proposed list of 251 keywords,
                    parties were able to agree to abandon keywords which returned no hits —
                    and the defendant also withdrew two additional keywords — leaving only 92
                    disputed keywords on which a ruling was required. During submissions on 12
                    January 2011, the preliminary also provided much assistance, particularly when
                    refining the disputed keywords and determining the search conditions which ought
                    to be attached to the keywords when the search is eventually performed. In the
                    present case, the preliminary search was conducted at a cost of only $500 to the
                    defendant, who had volunteered to bear this cost. Given its relatively low cost
                    and usefulness during arguments before me, I think that this practice of
                    performing a preliminary search using disputed keywords in order to identify the
                    number of hits should, so far as practicable, be adopted in all cases where
                    keywords are disputed. This will help to identify red herrings (ie keywords
                    which yield no hits) and assist parties to refine search conditions or the
                    keywords proper, whether as part of negotiations or during arguments before the
                    court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The complete list of keywords which were
                    considered and my reasons for allowing them (with or without modifications or
                    restrictions) or disallowing them, are set out in the tables annexed to these
                    grounds. As the relevance of keywords is specific to the issues of each suit,
                    they will have to be determined on a case by case basis. However, the following
                    observations may be noted. <em>First</em>, keywords have to
                    be carefully chosen to avoid words which are commonly used. The reason is
                    obvious: this is to avoid a situation where an inordinately large number of
                    documents are returned as part of the search results. This would defeat the
                    purpose of making use of keyword searches. Similarly, keywords which commonly
                    form part of a word should be avoided or should only be used where the search
                    engine is capable of identifying their occurrence as a discrete word and not as
                    part of the word: see below, paragraph 25. <em>Second</em>,
                    the availability of the preliminary search (see above, paragraph 19) proved to
                    be very helpful in determining whether a particular keyword should be permitted
                    or how it should be modified or constrained. I must emphasise that the number of
                    hits returned in the preliminary search results does not have any bearing on
                    relevance. However, they were helpful in determining whether a particular
                    keyword was unsuitable as too many hits had been returned thereby highlighting
                    those keywords which needed to be refined or restricted, <em>after</em> relevance had been determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Second Stage: Conducting the reasonable search</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In the second stage, the list of keywords
                    settled in the first stage would be used to conduct a reasonable search of the
                    forensic images of the seized items. The term “reasonable search”
                    as it is used in Part IVA should not be confused with a similarly named concept
                    under the UK Civil Procedure Rules, which is used to denote a search for
                    documents, electronic or pulp, for the purpose of disclosure. Under Part IVA,
                    the term “reasonable search” means that the keyword search for
                    electronic documents has to be reasonably constrained by, at least, limits on
                    the time period and the number of repositories of electronic documents. In other
                    words, there must be reasonable limits to the keyword search in order to
                    prevent, on the one hand, the trawling or emptying out of your opponent’s
                    filing cabinets which is eschewed by trite discovery principles, and on the
                    other, returning a surfeit of documents responding to the keywords but which is
                    well neigh impossible to review properly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In the present case, the number of electronic
                    repositories is limited to the seized items. The plaintiff tendered his notice
                    of resignation on 11 September 2009 and his alleged breaches of the terms of his
                    employment and his duties of confidentiality to the defendant date back to July
                    2009. Parties therefore agreed that it was reasonable in the circumstances to
                    limit keyword searches for documents, to those created, modified or deleted on
                    or after 1 January 2009 and for emails, to those which were received or sent on
                    or after the same date. These limits applied to all keywords which were to be
                    used when conducting the keyword search.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevance of search engine’s capabilities</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Additionally, it was necessary to specify
                    additional limits for some keywords in order to ensure that the number of
                    documents which were returned as part of the search result was not inordinately
                    high by reason of overly broad keywords resulting in potentially irrelevant hits
                    in the search results: see above paragraphs 20 and 21. Some examples of the
                    additional limits specified are that certain pairs of keywords have to appear in
                    the document – in other words, using the ‘AND’ Boolean
                    operator – or for certain keywords to be used as a discrete word and not
                    as part of a word (eg “TC”, “TP”,
                    “AGI” and “BB”, see Table 1 below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     During the course of arguments, one of the
                    considerations which arose was whether the search engine which the
                    defendant’s experts were using to conduct the keyword search was capable
                    of certain functions, for example, whether the search engine was capable of
                    distinguishing certain keywords as discrete words from occurrences when the
                    keyword was part of a word. For example, “AGI” (which was an
                    abbreviation of the defendant) was permissible as a keyword only if it occurred
                    in a document as a discrete word, but not when it was part of a word like
                    “magic”. During arguments, the defendant was not able to state
                    definitively the capabilities of the search engine that was to be used. Hence,
                    certain of the orders which were made were made on the assumption that the
                    search engine probably had the capabilities, and if eventually it turned out
                    that the search engine did not, then the keyword would not be
                allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     This provides useful guidance for parties in
                    future cases. In discussing the use of keyword searches, parties should also
                    agree on the search engine which is to be used and ascertain its capabilities.
                    If, for example, I was informed that the search engine which was to be used was
                    able to conduct proximity searches (ie a search that returns a positive result
                    only if the pair of keywords are within a certain number of words from each
                    other), then the option for limits to the keywords will be increased for the
                    discovery orders sought. The capabilities of the search engine are therefore
                    relevant and should ideally be placed before the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether keyword search of unallocated space is reasonable</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Another point which arose during arguments was
                    whether keyword searches should be conducted on both allocated and unallocated
                    space. Allocated space refers to the parts of the recording device or storage
                    media which is allocated to files and directories (or folders). Unallocated
                    space includes file slack and refers to portions of the recording device or
                    storage media which, although previously allocated to files or folders, is now
                    no longer allocated and is therefore available as free space. Until the
                    unallocated space is completely written over by a new file, the contents of the
                    pervious file may still exist (in full or partially) and may be retrieved by the
                    use of the correct forensic techniques. File slack refers to parts of allocated
                    space that are not occupied by the newly written file such that the contents of
                    the previous file which occupied the unused space are still accessible using
                    forensic tools and techniques.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Part IVA and Appendix E Part I thereto
                    establishes a <em>de facto</em> standard that for the
                    purposes of general discovery, unallocated space or file slack are not
                    ordinarily within the scope of general discovery. Paragraph 1(c) of Appendix E
                    states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>For the avoidance of doubt, electronically stored documents
                        residing in folders or directories in storage locations, media or devices,
                        including folders or directories where temporarily deleted files are located
                        (for example the Recycle Bin folder or Trash folder) are within the scope of
                        general discovery; deleted files or file fragments containing information
                        which are recoverable through the use of computer forensic tools or
                        techniques during a forensic inspection of the unallocated file space or
                        file slack are not within the scope of general
                discovery,</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The rationale is that conducting keyword
                    searches into unallocated space requires the application of costly computer
                    forensic skills, techniques and tools. This exercise is also extremely
                    intrusive. The purpose of searching in unallocated space is to recover fragments
                    of deleted files. It is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty
                    whether any such file fragments still exists to be recovered, or whether, if
                    recovered, they will contain anything useful. For these reasons, keyword
                    searches of unallocated space in recording devices and storage media as part of
                    general discovery would usually be unnecessary by reason of their costs and the
                    uncertainty that such searches will turn up anything which may contribute to the
                    fair disposal of the cause or matter. Therefore, I would not ordinarily have
                    permitted a keyword search to reach into unallocated space unless discovery of
                    the recording device had been given and an order for forensic inspection
                    obtained in accordance with Part IVA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     However, it was argued on behalf of the
                    defendant that the search orders in this case had specifically included
                    unallocated space within its scope as one of the Listed Items:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    Any residue system data or text fragment to
                            indicate the presence of relevant files which have been deleted or
                            copied to an external storage device (including data and record of file
                            names) relevant to the listed item.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The defendant submitted that this formulation permitted the
                    performance of a keyword search on unallocated space: an interpretation which
                    was not contested and which I accepted. By reason of the scope of the search
                    orders, the keyword search was permitted to be performed on the unallocated
                    space of the seized items.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Third stage: Review for relevance, privilege and confidentiality </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     In the third stage, the search results are
                    reviewed to ensure compliance with the search order and to identify confidential
                    documents or documents subject to privilege. Compliance with the search order,
                    as discussed above, involves determining whether a document is firstly, within
                    the range of documents described in the search order, and secondly, whether the
                    document is relevant. The categories of documents which fall within the scope of
                    a search order are usually described in broad terms and consequently, review for
                    this aspect of compliance is frequently unnecessary. The definition of Listed
                    Items in this case is a typical example:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any and all documents, regardless of medium, including but not limited to,
                        all letters, correspondence, instructions, memoranda, facsimile messages,
                        electronic mail messages, back up [<em>sic</em>] tapes,
                        minutes of meetings, chat transcripts and other communications or documents
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Review for relevance unnecessary if relevance of keywords determined
                in first stage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     During submissions, counsel for the plaintiff
                    had suggested that a further review of the search results may be necessary in
                    order to identify for disclosure only documents which are relevant. While I
                    understood the thrust of her submissions, I could not agree with them. Since the
                    relevance of each keyword which is to be used in performing the keyword search
                    is either agreed by parties or determined by the court during the first stage, I
                    am of the view that the search results are <em>prima
                        facie</em> relevant. One must of course accept the possibility that
                    there may be some documents in the search results which, while responsive to the
                    keywords used to perform the search, are nevertheless not relevant to the issues
                    in the pending suit. However, the number of irrelevant documents turning up in
                    the search results should be small if the relevance of the keywords had been
                    determined prudently. The risk of such disclosure must be weighed against the
                    legal costs that will be incurred if a further review for relevance is carried
                    out. Lord Justice Jacob’s observations in <em>Nichia Corp v
                        Argos Ltd</em> [2007] EWCA Civ 741 (19 July 2007) comes to
                    mind:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50.    … “Perfect justice” in one
                            sense involves a tribunal examining every conceivable aspect of a
                            dispute. All relevant witness and all relevant documents need to be
                            considered. And each party must be given a full opportunity of
                            considering everything and challenging anything it wishes. No stone,
                            however small, should remain unturned. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51.    But a system which sought such “perfect
                            justice” in every case would actually defeat justice. The cost
                            and time involved would make it impossible to decide all but the most
                            vastly funded cases. The cost of nearly every case would be greater than
                            what it is about. Life is too short to investigate everything in that
                            way. So a compromise is made: one makes do with a lesser procedure even
                            though it may result in the justice being rougher. Putting it another
                            way, better justice is achieved by risking a little bit of
                            injustice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Adapting from the language of O 24, I think
                    that that a further review for relevance will usually be unnecessary in view of
                    the costs that are likely to be incurred. In any event, disclosure is for the
                    purpose of giving discovery. Having received copies, parties will be reviewing
                    the documents in preparation for the eventual trial. It is in this review that a
                    core set of documents which parties intend to rely on for the trial is
                    identified. With this perspective, I ordered that the search results, less
                    privileged documents and documents otherwise unnecessary for disclosure, should
                    form part of general discovery in the pending suit without the need for further
                    review for relevance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I wish to emphasise that the approach adopted
                    here is applicable only where relevance of keywords have been agreed or
                    determined by the court. This approach may also be taken if parties adopt an
                    agreed electronic discovery protocol for the conduct of general discovery which
                    includes a list of agreed keywords. The protocol can provide by agreement that
                    all documents responding to the list of agreed keywords are to be given in
                    general discovery without the need for a further review for relevance. My
                    reasons for saying so is that a list of keywords which is agreed by parties or
                    determined by the courts will usually have been closely scrutinised and the
                    relevance of each keyword determined prudently. It follows that the risk of
                    irrelevant documents turning up in the search results will be small. This may be
                    contrasted with the use of keyword searches by a party on his own documents in
                    order to facilitate his review to identify relevant documents to be given during
                    discovery. The keywords are decided by the party on his own view of what is
                    relevant to the issues in the pending suit, without the benefit of his
                    adversary’s counter-check. I would think that the keywords may either be
                    too broad or too exclusive. A review will have to be carried out in order to
                    ensure that his discovery obligations are properly discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Privilege and confidentiality review</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However, it is still necessary to safeguard
                    any privileged documents and confidential information which are irrelevant to
                    the pending suit. For the purpose of identifying documents which privileged from
                    disclosure, it was possible to call on the aid of keyword searches. For
                    documents which are subject to litigation privilege, parties were able to agree
                    on using keyword searches to identify all e-mail communications passing between
                    the plaintiff and its solicitors and documents which contain the name of the
                    plaintiff’s solicitors’ firm. Parties were also able to establish
                    that the plaintiff had sought legal advice from another set of solicitors after
                    1 January 2009 and hence were able to identify documents which are thus subject
                    to legal advice privilege in a similar fashion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     With regards to confidential information,
                    parties were reminded of the <em>Riddick</em> principle
                    which does not prevent the disclosure of relevant confidential information.
                    However, there was a possibility that a document may contain confidential
                    information which are irrelevant for the proceedings and which may properly be
                    redacted in order to safeguard its confidentiality and to prevent prejudice to
                    the plaintiff. If such documents are identified, parties could come to an
                    agreement on the redaction of such documents, or apply to court for directions
                    in the event of disputes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     I had initially ordered that the
                    plaintiff’s confidentiality and privilege review be completed within 3
                    weeks. Concurrently, the defendant could commence his substantive review of the
                    documents provided that this was a solicitors-only review. The documents should
                    only be released to clients upon the completion of the confidentiality and
                    privilege review, and after parties have put in place appropriate measures to
                    safeguard confidentiality and privilege. Having in mind the possibility of
                    disputes, I also gave liberty to apply for further directions. Parties came back
                    before me on 7 March 2011 as there was disagreement on the manner in with the
                    confidentiality and privilege review should proceed. By this time, parties had
                    completed the reasonable search which yielded 34,000 documents in the search
                    results. Additionally, parties had also managed to identify privileged documents
                    using keyword searches. However, parties were unable to agree on how to complete
                    the confidentiality and privilege review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff had proposed the use of a
                    document review platform provided by his computer experts to allow both
                    parties’ solicitors concurrent access to the search results for the
                    purposes of the review. The plaintiff would then be able to identify, within the
                    document review platform, documents (in addition to those already identified
                    using keyword searches) which it claimed privilege over and documents containing
                    confidential information. The defendant was reluctant to incur the costs of
                    using a document review platform and had suggested that duplicates of the search
                    results, excluding the documents identified to be subject to privilege
                    (“excluded material”), be made in order that each party’s
                    solicitors may commence their review. The defendant’s solicitor pointed
                    out that his was a substantive review of the search results (less excluded
                    material) for the purpose of preparing for the eventual trial. In the event that
                    the plaintiff identified any additional privileged documents or confidential
                    documents, these may be identified using the file name and directory path or
                    folder. He had reservations and doubted the necessity for his substantive review
                    to be conducted on a document review platform provided by the plaintiff’s
                    computer experts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Having heard parties, I was persuaded by the
                    fact that the majority of privileged documents had already been identified using
                    keyword searches. Hence, the probability of additional privileged documents
                    existing in the search results would be lowered significantly. The remainder of
                    the privilege and confidentiality review will be primarily for the purpose of
                    identifying confidential information. Confidentiality <em>per
                        se</em> is no bar to discovery although “the court should order
                    a controlled measure of discovery … upon terms ensuring that there should
                    be neither use nor further disclosure of the confidential information to the
                    prejudice of the party concerned”: see Singapore Civil Procedure 2007,
                    paragraphs 24/3/37–38; and the <em>Riddick</em>
                    principle prevents the use of documents (confidential or otherwise) disclosed in
                    court proceedings for any purpose other than the proceedings in which it was
                    disclosed: see <em>Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd and another v Koh Chye
                        Heng</em> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 526; [1998] SGCA 60. In the event that
                    confidential information is identified, the prejudice to the plaintiff is low
                    since this was still a solicitors-only review for the defendant and the
                    documents concerned would not have been shown to the defendant. The plaintiff
                    may still claw back the confidential document or redact the irrelevant portions.
                    It was therefore crucial that the plaintiff complete his privilege and
                    confidentiality review within the allotted time. However, I was also mindful of
                    the perception which the defendant held that it had been deprived of access to
                    documents which had been seized under the search orders by reason of the time
                    that the plaintiff is taking to complete his privilege and confidentiality
                    review.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In order to expedite the pending suit, which
                    had been stalled for some time by reason of the dispute over the how the
                    confidentiality and privilege review should be completed, I granted an extension
                    of time for the plaintiff to complete his confidentiality review within 4 weeks
                    and permitted defendant’s solicitors to commence substantive review of the
                    search results (less excluded material). During these 4 weeks, only the
                    defendant’s solicitors may review the search results (less excluded
                    material). After the expiry of 4 weeks, the defendant would then be permitted
                    access to the documents. For the plaintiff, since these are his documents, he
                    was permitted access so that he can properly instruct his solicitors. I further
                    granted liberty to apply in the event that parties are unable to agree on the
                    claw back or redaction of any confidential document which is not relevant to
                    these proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Giving discovery and inspection</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I turn now to the mode and manner of giving
                    discovery of the search results (less excluded material). As these were
                    documents in the possession, power and custody of the plaintiff’s, I
                    directed that discovery of the documents forming the search results (less
                    excluded material) be given by the plaintiff. I further directed that in
                    addition to the usual requirement of an affidavit verifying list of documents
                    filed by the plaintiff, the computer experts who were involved in the
                    performance of the reasonable search should also depose to the methodology and
                    process of performing the keyword searches in a joint affidavit. This is because
                    the plaintiff, who is giving these documents in discovery, is relying on their
                    expertise to conduct the keyword searches using the list of relevant keywords,
                    which in turn identify the documents that are given in discovery. Hence, it was
                    appropriate that the computer experts who conducted the keyword searches should
                    file a joint affidavit (if possible) on how the searches were conducted. In the
                    event that they are unable to agree on the text of a joint affidavit, then each
                    should file an affidavit to the same effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Parties also informed me that copies of the
                    search results (less excluded material) have been made and were available for
                    release to parties in encrypted thumb drives; these are currently in the custody
                    of the supervising solicitor. I did not think that it was necessary for the
                    plaintiff to incur the costs of enumerating 45,000 documents in the
                    supplementary list of documents since both parties are going to receive
                    identical copies of the search results (less excluded material). Hence, I
                    directed that the search results (less excluded material) be disclosed as part
                    of the plaintiff’s further discovery and further directed that the
                    plaintiff is dispensed from enumerating each document in the search result (less
                    excluded material) in his supplementary list of documents: all that is required
                    is to provide a meaningful description of the contents of the encrypted thumb
                    drive. Further, I also directed that the release of the encrypted thumb drive
                    containing the search results (less excluded material) be taken as both
                    inspection and the provision of copies for the purposes of
                discovery.</p>
