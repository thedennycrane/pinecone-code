Apart from his bare assertion, there was no evidence that concerns over costs led to him being unable to engage solicitors to defend against the claim in Singapore. Further, he clearly had the financial means to challenge the registration of the judgments in Australia. The defendant argued that he had no choice but to defend the matter in Australia. I agreed with the plaintiff that this was incorrect. Clearly, as the defendant conceded during oral submissions, he could have applied to stay the proceedings in Australia earlier and he should have come to Singapore to defend against the plaintiff’s claim. I also noted the fact that the defendant had no hesitation in commencing proceedings in Myanmar (after he had been served in the present action), not just once but twice, seeking a declaration that there was no financial settlement to be made by him to the plaintiff.

I rejected this submission. First, this reason did not appear anywhere in the defendant’s affidavits. Second, it was clearly not reasonable for the defendant to ignore the Singapore proceedings on this basis. If he believed that the dispute should be dealt with in Myanmar, he ought to have entered an appearance in this action and applied to stay the present action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 With respect to his fourth reason, the defendant submitted that if he had known that the plaintiff was seeking damages in the sum of US$66m, he “would not have taken the same course of action that he had when initially faced with the suit”.

The defendant’s claim that he thought the plaintiff’s claim was for US$585,143.67 was not believable.

</div> I found that the defendant’s fifth reason was plainly without any basis and rejected it accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In my view, the predominant (if not sole) reason for the defendant’s omission to participate in the present action was his belief that the plaintiff would not be able to enforce a judgment of this Court against him. He was clearly prepared to let the plaintiff enter judgment against him in this action and to do nothing about it until the plaintiff registered the Default Judgment and the Assessment Judgment in Australia. It was only after his attempt to challenge the registration of the Default Judgment and the Assessment Judgment in Australia failed, that he sought to defend the claims in Singapore. There was no doubt that his decision not to participate in this action earlier was a deliberate one. The defendant’s inordinate delay in participating in the present action could only be described as deliberate and contumelious.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Effect of delay: the legal principles</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 A defendant’s delay in applying to set aside a default judgment will be viewed differently depending on whether the default judgment is entered <span class="font-italic">without a trial</span> (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>in default of appearance, pleadings or discovery) or <span class="font-italic">after a trial</span> in the defendant’s absence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Where a defendant applies to set aside a default judgment entered <span class="font-italic">without a trial</span>: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the question of whether there is a defence on the merits is the dominant feature to be weighed against the applicant’s explanation for the default and any delay as well as against prejudice to the other party: <span class="font-italic">Su Sh-Hsyu v Wee Yue Chew</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 673 (“<span class="font-italic">Su Sh-Hsyu</span>”) at [42]–[43]; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the court will scrutinise the reasons for the delay; where the delay is deliberate, with the intent to gain some litigation advantage, a late application should <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>be viewed uncharitably. Procedural rules must not occasion injustice by unfairly depriving a party of an opportunity to argue its case but the indolent cannot as a matter of course be awarded the same measure of justice as the diligent. The greater the delay, the more cogent the explanation must be as to why a miscarriage of justice would be occasioned if the default judgment were allowed to stand: <span class="font-italic">Mercurine Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 4 SLR(R) 907 (“<span class="font-italic">Mercurine</span>”) at [32] and [35]–[36]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 However, where the defendant applies to set aside a default judgment entered <span class="font-italic">after a trial</span>: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the <span class="font-italic">predominant</span> consideration in deciding whether to set aside the judgment is the reason for the defendant’s absence; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the reasons for non-attendance will be “most severely viewed” in instances where the defendant’s omission was deliberate and contumelious. In such cases, the approach of the court is generally unforgiving. The court will be most reluctant to set aside the judgment even though there may be other persuasive countervailing factors in favour of setting aside. Any such countervailing factors would necessarily have to be <span class="font-italic">very compelling</span> to tilt the balance in favour of setting aside the judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">See <span class="font-italic">Su Sh-Hsyu </span>at [44]–[45], [49] and [57].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Thus, in the case of a default judgment obtained without a trial, if the defendant is able to show triable issues, the Court would be slow to refuse to set aside the judgment on the ground of delay (even if the delay is deliberate and contumelious) unless the delay was to gain some litigation advantage or the prejudice to the plaintiff outweighs the fact that there are triable issues. However, where the default judgment has been obtained after a trial, the Court would be most reluctant to set aside the judgment in the face of deliberate and contumelious delay unless there are very compelling countervailing factors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Applying the legal principles to the delay in the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to set aside the Default Judgment for US$585,143.67 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 As stated earlier, the Default Judgment included a final judgment for a liquidated sum of US$585,143.67 being the amount that the plaintiff claimed was due under the Loan Agreement (see [29(c)] above). The Default Judgment for this amount was obtained without a trial and therefore the merits of the defence were the dominant factor to be considered. The defendant asserted that this claim was time-barred, and the plaintiff properly conceded that it was difficult for it to assert otherwise. The plaintiff also could not point to any prejudice that it would suffer as a result of the judgment being set aside. In the circumstances, it was clear that the delay notwithstanding, it would be wrong not to set aside the judgment for this sum. I therefore set aside the Default Judgment for this sum.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Application to set aside the Assessment Judgment and Default Judgment for damages to be assessed</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The Assessment Judgment was entered after a trial in the defendant’s absence. Therefore, in considering the defendant’s application to set aside the Assessment Judgment, the reason for the defendant’s absence was the predominant consideration and any countervailing factors had to be very compelling to tilt the balance in favour of setting aside the judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The Default Judgment for damages to be assessed was obtained without a trial. However, setting aside the Default Judgment for damages to be assessed would have resulted in the Assessment Judgment being set aside as well.

</div> The plaintiff alleged that it had contributed US$5.1m towards the cost of construction of Tarmway Plaza and that it had legal possession of Tarmway Plaza pursuant to a resolution of the directors of TMDC, the joint venture company that owned Tarmway Plaza. The Yangon Eastern District Court dismissed the plaintiff’s claim.

Leaving aside the reason for the decision, Criminal Case 102/2003 concerned a finding that the plaintiff had not proved its case against the defendant in criminal proceedings. I agreed with the plaintiff that that did not necessarily mean the plaintiff would fail in civil proceedings. As for Case 2275/2004, it was not even clear what the Myanmar court had decided as regards “Issue 1”, much less whether there was a final and conclusive finding that TCC did not receive the Plaintiff’s Investment Moneys.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Time-bar and laches</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 As dealt with earlier, the plaintiff’s claim for the sum of US$585,143.67 under the Loan Agreement was time-barred and the Default Judgment for that amount has been set aside (see [62] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Under the exception in s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed), there is no fixed limitation period for claims by a beneficiary under a trust “in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which the trustee was a party or privy”.  A breach of trust is fraudulent if it is dishonest: <span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line Ltd (in liquidation) v Sukamto Sia and another and another appeal </span>[2014] 3 SLR 277 (“<span class="font-italic">Dynasty Line</span>”) at [54], citing <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong v Panweld Trading Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 1 SLR 173 at [52]. I agreed with the plaintiff that its claims against the defendant for breach of trust and/or breach of fiduciary duties were in respect of fraud or fraudulent breaches of trust within the scope of s 22(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). Therefore, there was no fixed limitation period for these claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 The defendant submitted that the plaintiff’s claims were nevertheless barred by the equitable doctrine of laches. The defendant relied on <span class="font-italic">Cytec Industries Pte ltd v APP Chemicals International (Mau) Ltd </span>[2009] 4 SLR(R) 769 (“<span class="font-italic">Cytec</span>”), in which the High Court held (at [46]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Laches is a doctrine of equity. It is properly invoked where essentially there has been a substantial lapse of time coupled with circumstances where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy either because the party has by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver thereof; or, where by his conduct and neglect he had, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him, if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted (<span class="font-italic">Sukhpreet Kaur Bajaj d/o Manjit Singh v Paramjit Singh Bajaj</span> [2008] SGHC 207 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Re Estate of Tan Kow Quee</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 417 at [32]). This is a broad-based inquiry and it would be relevant to consider the length of delay before the claim was brought, the nature of the prejudice said to be suffered by the defendant, as well as any element of unconscionability in allowing the claim to be enforced (<span class="font-italic">Re Estate of Tan Kow Quee</span> at [38]). ...</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Cytec </span>was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">eSys Technologies Pte Ltd v nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 2 SLR 1200 at [37]–[38].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 It did not seem to me that the facts of the present case presented a strong case for the application of the doctrine of laches. The plaintiff commenced proceedings in Myanmar seeking different reliefs. Nothing in the plaintiff’s conduct could be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of the claims it has pursued in this action. There was also no reason why allowing the plaintiff to proceed with this action would be unconscionable nor any evidence as to how the plaintiff’s delay in commencing this action prejudiced the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In its statement of claim, the plaintiff also pleaded that the defendant’s fiduciary duties “continue to apply until the business purpose of the Joint Venture is achieved”.

<div class="txt-body text-left">  Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1), at para 38.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I agreed with the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant was therefore in continuing breach of his fiduciary duties and the defendant’s assertion that the claim was time-barred was a non-starter.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 The defendant’s delay in applying to set aside the Default Judgment for assessment of damages and the Assessment Judgment was deliberate and contumelious. The defendant had raised triable issues in its defence. However, this was a relatively low threshold for the defendant to cross. In my judgment, the defendant had not shown a such a compelling case as to tilt the balance in favour of setting aside the Default Judgment and the Assessment Judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The plaintiff also relied on <span class="font-italic">Ang Kim Soon v Sunray Marine Pte Ltd</span> [1997] 1 SLR(R) 714 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Kim Soon</span>”). There, the plaintiff sued his employer in connection with an injury suffered in an accident while working aboard a vessel. The employer sued the vessel owner for an indemnity in respect of the accident. The employer did not enter a defence to the plaintiff’s claim and the plaintiff entered interlocutory judgment. Subsequently, the Court found that the shipowner was entirely responsible. The employer applied to set aside the interlocutory judgment nearly six months later. The employer’s explanation for the delay was that if the shipowner succeeded, then it would be pointless to set aside the default judgment and if the shipowner failed, there would be little difficulty in having the default judgment set aside. Despite finding the employer’s rationalisation to be “somewhat attractive and sensible”, the High Court dismissed the defendant’s application on the ground that once liability was disputed, the employer was “bound to set aside the interlocutory judgment at the earliest opportunity” and “not play a cat-and-mouse game with the shipowner using the plaintiff as cheese” (at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 I agreed with the plaintiff that <span class="font-italic">Ang Kim Soon</span> supported its case against the defendant’s application to set aside the Default Judgment for damages to be assessed.  The defendant was bound to set aside this interlocutory judgment at the earliest opportunity, instead of challenging the registration of the judgments in Australia and seeking to defend in Singapore only after having failed in that challenge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 I also noted that all of the defences raised by the defendant related to the issue of his <span class="font-italic">liability</span> (see [66] above). The defendant did not raise any issue relating to the <span class="font-italic">quantum </span>of the damages that were assessed and awarded to the plaintiff. The defendant complained about not being served with the plaintiff’s AEICs for the assessment hearing. This has been dealt with at [54]–[55] above. In any event, the defendant would have had sight of the AEICs since then. However, all of his submissions in respect of the Assessment Judgment related only to the issue of liability.

In that case, the Court of Appeal held (at [84]) that any challenge to the exercise of jurisdiction by the court named in a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause amounted to an attempt to be released from the clause; a defendant applying to set aside a court order granting leave to serve out of the jurisdiction would have to show strong cause to justify such a result. The Court of Appeal explained (at [96] and [98]) that it would be difficult for a defendant to show strong cause unless he could point to factors which were not foreseeable at the time of contracting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The plaintiff also relied on the fact that, after being served in the present action, the defendant had failed twice in his applications to the Myanmar Courts for declarations that there was no financial settlement to be made by him to the plaintiff.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The defendant’s appeal to the Yangon Divisional High Court was dismissed on 18 August 2017. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I agreed with the plaintiff that, on balance, Singapore was the natural forum. The defendant had not shown any strong cause to justify his release from his contractual obligations under the non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses in the JVA and Loan Agreement. The plaintiff’s proceedings in Myanmar were for different reliefs; I saw no basis for the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff was estopped from asserting that Singapore was the natural forum in the present action. Further, given the view expressed by the Yangon Divisional High Court in Case 341/2016, Myanmar was not the more appropriate forum. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Full and frank disclosure</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The defendant submitted that the plaintiff failed to make full and frank disclosure in its <span class="font-italic">ex parte</span> application for the Service Order because the plaintiff did not highlight the following facts:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Criminal Case 102/2003, Case 330/2003 and Case 2275/2004 had been decided against the plaintiff and the Myanmar Courts had made found that the Plaintiff’s Investment Moneys had not been paid by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Under the Loan Agreement, the last instalment repayment in respect of the sum of US$585,143.67 fell due in February 1999. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The test of materiality is whether the facts in question are matters that the court would likely take into consideration in making its decision: <span class="font-italic">Shanghai Turbo</span> at [105]. In my view, the facts set out at [98(a)] above could not be described as material. As stated earlier: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Criminal Case 102/2003 was a private criminal prosecution and the Myanmar Courts’ decisions were based mainly on the absence of evidence of permission from the Myanmar Central Bank for the plaintiff to remit funds to TCC.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Case 330/2003 was dismissed because the plaintiff’s advocate did not have the requisite power of attorney to appear in the case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In Case 2275/2004, it was not even clear what the Myanmar court’s decision in respect of “Issue 1” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether US$5.1m of the total construction cost was money borrowed by TCC from the plaintiff) was. According to the plaintiff, the Myanmar court had not considered “Issue 1”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(See [17]–[22]  and [73]–[75] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Even if the facts set out at [98(a)] above were material, in my view, they were not so material in all the circumstances as to warrant setting aside the Service Order (see <span class="font-italic">Zoom Communications Ltd v Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 500 at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 As regards the fact set out at [98(b)] above, the Default Judgment for the sum of US$585,143.67 had been set aside (see [62] above). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In my judgment, the defendant had not shown a such a compelling case as to tilt the balance in favour of setting aside the Service Order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 For the reasons set out above, I set aside the Default Judgment for the liquidated sum of US$585,143.67 and dismissed the rest of the defendant’s appeal against the AR’s decision.
