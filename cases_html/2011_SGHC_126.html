<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiffs, Mr Chua Tian Chu
                    (“Mr Chua”) and Ms Cheang Poh Ling Pauline, were the
                    purchasers of a property located at 22A Kheam Hock Road, Singapore
                    (“the property”), pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement
                    (“the Agreement”) entered into with the defendants, Mr Chin
                    Bay Ching (“Mr Chin”) and Ms Tjia Mui Kui on
                    30 November 2006. The defendants were the vendors as well as the developers
                    of the property. The agreed purchase price of the property was
                    $5,680,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Prior to the sale of the property to the
                    plaintiffs, Mr Chin had intended to renovate the detached bungalow standing
                    on the land, built sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Mr Chin
                    engaged the services of an architectural firm by the name of Formwerkz
                    Architects (“FA”) and a main contractor, Kian Hong Seng
                    Construction Pte Ltd (“KHSC”), to carry out re-construction works
                    on the property. Upon submission of the original building layout plans
                    (“BP01”) drawn up with the assistance of FA, Mr Chin obtained
                    the Building and Construction Authority’s (“BCA”) approval
                    on 21 August 2006.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Shortly thereafter, in or around November 2006,
                    the plaintiffs began negotiations with the defendants to purchase the property.
                    The negotiations were principally in relation to BP01 (the original building
                    layout plans designed by FA) and resulted in a list of amendments thereto to be
                    incorporated into the Agreement. The finalised list of amendments was
                    incorporated by way of the Fourth and Fifth Schedules annexed to the Agreement.
                    While the Fourth Schedule consolidated the plaintiffs’ amendments to BP01,
                    the Fifth Schedule predominantly related to renovation works as well as
                    additional fixtures and fittings to be integrated into the property. Additional
                    changes were made to the Fifth Schedule on 4 December 2006, after the Agreement
                    was signed and an amended list replaced the Fifth Schedule originally attached
                    to the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       By 26 January 2007, a revised building layout
                    plan (“BP02”) had been drawn up. The defendants submitted the
                    second application for BCA’s approval in July 2007 which was subsequently
                    approved on 7 September 2007. It is worthwhile noting that FA also prepared
                    three other building layout plans on 1 February 2007, 23 October 2007
                    and 16 July 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Clause 9.1 of the Agreement imposed a
                    contractually stipulated deadline for the delivery of the notice to take vacant
                    possession of the property as “not later than
                        31<sup>st</sup> December 2007”. Clause 9.3 of
                    the Agreement provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Vendor <em>shall deliver vacant possession</em>
                        of the Property to the Purchaser by <em>delivering a
                            notice</em> to the Purchaser to Take Possession in respect of the
                        Property. <em>On delivery</em> of vacant possession of
                        the Property to the Purchaser, the Vendor <em>must</em>
                        deliver to the Purchaser or his solicitors <em>a copy of the
                            Temporary Occupation Permit</em> for the Property together
                            <em>with the certificate from the Vendor’s
                            architect</em> that the building, drainage, sewerage and
                        electrical works serving the Property have been constructed in accordance
                        with the plans and specifications approved by the Building Authority and
                        that water and electricity supplies have been duly connected to the
                        Property. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 6 January 2009, more than a year after
                    the contractually stipulated date, the defendants gave notice to the plaintiffs
                    to take vacant possession of the property following BCA’s issuance of the
                    temporary occupation permit (“TOP”) on 6 January 2009. The
                    plaintiffs took the position that the defendants’ notice to take vacant
                    possession was only valid upon delivery of a copy of the TOP, <em>as well as</em> the architect’s certificate referenced under cl
                    9.3 of the Agreement. At the plaintiffs’ insistence, the defendants
                    forwarded the architect’s certificate on <em>16 January 2009</em> which attested to the fact that the
                    building, drainage, sewerage and electrical works serving the property complied
                    with approved plans and requisite specifications. In accordance with their
                    interpretation of cl 9.3 of the Agreement, the plaintiffs took the view that the
                    defendants’ notice to take vacant possession was only valid upon delivery
                    of the architect’s certificate, on 16 January 2009
                onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Clause 4 of the Agreement set out the payment
                    schedule agreed by the parties for the progress instalment payments of the
                    purchase price. As at 15 January 2009, the plaintiffs had completed the
                    payment of 20% of the purchase price in accordance with the time line set out in
                    cll 4.1.1, 4.1.2 and 4.1.3. Under cl 4.1.4 of the Agreement, a further 70% was
                    payable “<em>within 14 days</em> after receipt by
                    the Purchaser or his solicitors of the Vendor’s notice to take
                    possession” with a photographic copy of the TOP issued by
                BCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On <em>30 January
                    2009</em>, 14 days from the date that the plaintiffs received the
                    architect’s certificate, the total sum of $3,976,000 fell due (<em>ie</em>, 70% of the purchase price). The plaintiffs only made
                    payment of $3,834,077.81 having unilaterally deducted $141,922.19 from the total
                    sum which fell due. The plaintiffs’ deduction of $141,922.19 from the
                    purchase price due was based on their calculation of the liquidated damages
                    accrued from 1 January 2008 until 15 January 2009. The plaintiffs
                    computed the quantum of liquidated damages deducted based on the contractually
                    agreed interest rate of 12% per annum on the sum of $1,136,000 (<em>ie</em>, 20% of the purchase price paid) for the delay period
                    of 380 days (<em>ie</em>, 1 January 2008 until
                    15 January 2009). By 30 January 2009, having paid 90% of the purchase
                    price less the deduction, the plaintiffs nevertheless declined to take
                    possession of the property owing to alleged defects and incomplete
                works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Clauses 12.1 and 4.1.5 of the Agreement provided
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On <em>2 February
                        2009</em>, the defendants solicitors gave the plaintiffs the Notice to
                    Complete the sale. Pursuant to cll 12 and 4.1.5(a) of the Agreement set out
                    above, $418,000 fell due upon the defendants’ delivery of the Notice to
                    Complete, to be paid to and held by the defendants’ solicitors as
                    stakeholders. Pursuant to cl 4.1.5(b), the remaining sum of $150,000 was payable
                    to the defendants 12 months from the date of completion of the sale and purchase
                    of the property, subject to deductions made for defects liability under cl
                    11.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The plaintiffs withheld payment of the
                    $418,000 due under cl 4.1.5(a) on the basis that the property was not fit for
                    occupation. They demanded that rectification works be conducted immediately by
                    the defendants. The defendants were informed by the plaintiffs’ solicitors
                    to complete all the outstanding works identified in a list prepared by
                    Mr Chua dated 30 January 2009. Furthermore, the plaintiffs gave the
                    defendants one month’s notice, expiring on 6 March 2009, to put the
                    property in a state fit for occupation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Clause 6.1 of the Agreement provided:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In addition to the charge of interests under <b>Clause

                        14 days or more after the due date of payment, or to comply with any or all

                        own election (i) deem that the Purchaser is in breach and (ii) further deem

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 4 March 2009, the defendants served 21
                    days’ notice on the plaintiffs under cl 6.1 of the Agreement demanding
                    payment of the sum of $418,000 overdue under cl 4.1.5(a). The plaintiffs’
                    repeated failure to complete the sale and purchase of the property,
                    notwithstanding multiple extensions arranged between the parties, culminated in

                    non-payment of the sums which fell due under the Agreement as a repudiatory act
                    under cl 6.2 of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The plaintiffs commenced this action by way of
                    writ on <em>11 September 2009</em> seeking specific
                    performance, liquidated damages, the cost of the rectification works and,
                    alternatively, damages. In the course of the trial, the parties managed to agree
                    on the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The defendants decided not to
                        challenge the plaintiffs’ unilateral deduction of $141,922.19 in
                        liquidated damages for delay occasioned from 1 January 2008 to
                        15 January 2009; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     A global sum of $410,000 as the rectification costs
                        attributable to the defects in the property was agreed. (Curiously, counsel
                        for the defendants said that the issue of liability was left for the

                    at p 216 defines repudiation as a “clear indication of absence of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">‘Repudiation’ is <em>a drastic

                    Court of Appeal affirmed the common law position that the mere failure or delay
                    in making payment <em>per se</em> would not amount to a
                    repudiation of the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 16 June 2009, the defendants served on the
                    plaintiffs the final 21 days’ notice under cl 6.1 demanding the
                    payment of $418,000 by <em>2 July 2009</em>. The plaintiffs
                    repeatedly protested their willingness to complete the Agreement by way of their
                    solicitor’s letters on 22 June 2009, 27 July 2009 and 31 July
                2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Curiously, on 19 June 2009, three days after
                    the final 21-day notice under cl 6.1 was served on the plaintiffs, Mr Chua
                    received a set of keys to the property for the first time. Prior to the expiry
                    of the notice period, on 22 June 2009 the plaintiffs informed the
                    defendants’ solicitors that they were “<em>willing
                        and ready to complete the matter</em>” subject to the proviso
                    that liquidated damages accrued in the region of $600,000 would be off-set from
                    the payment owed. In spite of the defendants’ decision to rescind the
                    Agreement, a week later on 31 July 2009, the plaintiffs reiterated that they
                    were willing to complete the transaction by offering to transfer the sum of
                    $418,000, albeit under protest. The plaintiffs’ conduct was antithetical
                    to the conduct one would expect of a party intending to terminate an
                    agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Right of set-off under the Agreement</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is suggested that <em>it would not be sufficient if the

                            liability for liquidated damages or defective work</em>. ...

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Admittedly, the plaintiffs’ decision to
                    withhold the payments due under cl 4.1.5 gave rise to the defendants’
                    election to rescind the Agreement under cll 6.1 and 6.2. However, the
                    plaintiffs’ act of non-payment should not be viewed in isolation. On 22
                    June 2009, prior to the expiry of the 21-day notice period, the plaintiffs were
                    willing to complete the sale and purchase of the property, albeit under protest.
                    While the right to “annul” the Agreement was conferred upon the
                    defendants by cll 6.1 and 6.2, the plaintiffs were also given the right to
                    deduct liquidated damages and rectification costs under cll 9.5, 12.5 and
                    11.3 from the instalment sums due under cll 4.1.5(a) and (b). Accordingly, the
                    plaintiffs were merely exercising their right of set off by offering to make
                    payment of the $418,000 due under protest. The relevant clauses were as
                    follows:</p>

                                carry out the rectification works to make good the defect within the
                                specified time, the Purchaser has the right to cause the
                                rectification works to be carried out and to recover from the Vendor
                                the costs of those rectification works. The Purchaser may deduct the
                                cost of those rectification works from clauses 4.1.5(a) and 4.1.5(b)
                                of the Payment Schedule.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The plaintiffs were operating on the basis
                    that cll 9.5 and 12.5 were triggered by reason of the Notice to Take Vacant
                    Possession and the corresponding Notice to Complete having been delayed in
                    excess of a year and a half from the contractually stipulated dates.
                    Furthermore, cl 11.3 was also triggered by the fact that from 5 March 2008
                    onwards the plaintiffs gave the defendants repeated notices to rectify the
                    meticulously identified defects. From the plaintiffs’ perspective, by
                    reason of the defendants’ conduct over the period of 1 January 2008 until
                    23 July 2009, a right to deduct liquidated damages and rectification costs under
                    cll 9.5, 12.5 and 11.3 of the Agreement had arisen.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defendants were incorrect in maintaining
                    that the setting off mechanism to deduct sums accrued for liquidated damages or
                    rectification costs was only triggered after payment was first made in
                    accordance with cll 4.1.5(a) and (b). As I pointed out in the course of
                    proceedings, “If there are accrued sums due, does it stand to reason that
                    the stakeholder should be paid in full nevertheless, and then refund in the next
                    second?” Furthermore, cll 9.5 and 12.5 expressly accorded the plaintiffs
                    the right to set off any liquidated damages rightfully accrued. Accordingly, the
                    plaintiffs’ refusal to make payment of the remaining 10% of the purchase
                    price was in pursuance of their right to set off liquidated damages and
                    rectification costs accrued rather than evincing “clear indication of the
                    absence of readiness or willingness to perform”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiffs did not breach cl 6.1 by taking
                    the position that they would only furnish the outstanding sums under protest, as
                    this position was consistent with the rights they believed were accorded to them
                    under cll 9.5, 12.5 and 11 of the Agreement. Rather than evincing an
                    unwillingness to complete the Agreement, the plaintiffs’ conduct was
                    clearly consistent with their stand that liquidated damages and rectification
                    costs accrued should be set off before any payment to the defendants was
                    made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Operation of cll 4.1.5(a) and (b)</p>

                        Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha</em> Ltd [1962] 2 QB 26) was
                    endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Alliance Concrete
                        Singapore Pte Ltd v Comfort Resources Pte Ltd</em> [2009]
                    4 SLR(R) 602 at [31] wherein
                    the court found that a party may validly elect to rescind the contract when the
                    other contracting party’s non-payment deprived it of substantially the
                    whole benefit which it intended to obtain from the Agreement. By 23 July 2009,
                    in accordance with the time line set by the agreement, the plaintiffs had
                    already paid the defendants about 90% of the total purchase price. As outlined
                    above, the final 10% of the purchase price was payable in accordance with the
                    terms of cll 4.1.5(a) and (b).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     However, under cl 4.1.5(a), when payment fell
                    due, the moneys were to be paid to and held by the defendants’ solicitors
                    as stakeholders until the issuance of the Certificate of Statutory Completion
                    (“CSC”). Pursuant to cl 4.1.5(b), the remaining sum of
                    $150,000 was payable to the defendants only after 12 months had elapsed from the
                    date of completion of the conveyance of the property. Furthermore, the sums
                    payable under cl 4.1.5(b) were also <em>subject to</em> any
                    deductions made for liability incurred for rectification works under cl
                    11.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Under the Agreement, the defendants were not
                    going to <em>immediately</em> receive the payments made
                    under either cl 4.1.5(a) or (b). It was clear that under the Agreement, the
                    remaining 10% of the purchase price was intended to be set aside to safeguard
                    the interests of the plaintiffs in the event that difficulties with the
                    certification of the property or expenses for defects liability were incurred.
                    Accordingly, I do not think that the defendants were substantially deprived of
                    the benefit of the Agreement they entered into. In light of the fact that the
                    sums withheld by the plaintiffs amounted to only 10% of the total purchase price
                    and, in any event, would not have been in the defendants possession either until
                    the issuance of the CSC or till the expiry of the 12-month defects liability
                    period, a finding that the plaintiffs’ conduct gave rise to the
                    defendants’ right to rescind the Agreement would be unsound.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As rectification costs were fixed at a lump
                    sum of $410,000, the issue of liability was to be determined on a global basis.
                    Both the plaintiffs’ and defendants’ cases lacked precision owing to
                    a failure to separate liability arising from <em>defects</em> pursuant to cl 11 from <em>incomplete
                        works</em>. Due to the parties’ quantification of rectification
                    costs on a lump sum basis, I was spared the tedious task of determining, one by
                    one, whether the plaintiffs’ “defects” listed were truly
                    defects, and the attendant costs of rectification.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiffs persuasively argued that the
                    defendants had agreed to rectify the “defects” which were
                    meticulously identified by way of Mr Chua’s regularly updated lists.
                    Mr Chua compiled the first list of “defects” in the property
                    on 5 March 2008. The markings (which I understood to be cancellations) on
                    items 1, 9, 10, 15, 33, 36 and 38 of the said list supported the
                    plaintiffs’ contention that the items remaining (<em>ie</em>, those that were not marked off the list) were
                    “defects” which the parties had mutually agreed were part of the
                    scope of rectification works expected of the defendants. Mr Chin’s
                    signature under the term “<em>Agreed by</em>”
                    on the said document supported the plaintiffs’ contention. In the absence
                    of contradictory evidence, this document established that the defendants had
                    agreed to rectify 37 out of 44 items.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     BCA’s representative, Mr Chan Sin
                    Kai, highlighted that during the joint on-site visit on 13 February
                    2009:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... the developer [Mr Chin] agreed to complete all outstanding items
                        as listed by you [the Plaintiffs] ... and he confirmed that he would be

                        [Mr Chua].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The document in question was an updated defects list dated 30 January
                    2009, prepared by Mr Chua and contained 64 outstanding items which required
                    rectification. BCA’s correspondence independently corroborated the
                    plaintiffs’ assertion that the defendants agreed to rectify the
                    “defects” identified. In fact, under cross-examination,
                    Mr Chin conceded that he was “definitely responsible for part of the
                    defects because no house can come with no defects”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     In light of the weight of the evidence as to
                    the existence of the defects and the defendants’ acceptance of liability
                    to rectify at least some, the agreed sum of $410,000 is to be paid by the
                    defendants to the plaintiffs by way of rectification costs.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In the plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim

                    claim for $1,476,102.67. The plaintiffs have already succeeded in obtaining

                    claimed additional liquidated damages amounting to $1,476,102.67 calculated in
                    accordance with the table below:</p>
<p>[LawNet Admin Note: Table is viewable only to LawNet subscribers via the PDF in the Case View Tools.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     An examination of the plaintiffs’
                    sub-claims will show that four of the plaintiffs’ six sub-claims pursuant
                    to cl 9.4 and/or cl 12.4 were for overlapping periods of alleged delay.
                    (Sub-claim 3 under cl 12.4 was for the identical sum of $141,922.19 in sub-claim
                    1. Similarly, sub-claim 5 duplicated sub-claim 4. Curiously, the last sub-claim
                    did not involve duplication, a choice between cll 9.4 and 12.4 being left
                    open.) This was on the basis that concurrently with time running against the
                    defendants for failure to deliver Notice to Take Vacant Possession under cl 9.4,
                    time could also run against the defendants for failure to give Notice to
                    Complete under cl 12.4. Effectively, therefore, the plaintiffs were claiming
                    twice the agreed rate of 12% for liquidated damages computed on the same amount
                    of progress instalment paid. Instinctively, one recoils at such exorbitant
                    claims sounding more in penalty than in liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     A closer examination reveals that one does not
                    have to depend on instinct alone. The plaintiffs simply misinterpreted cll 12.1
                    and 12.4. Time did not begin to run under cl 12.4 until 14 days after the date
                    that Notice to Take Vacant Possession was actually given. The giving of Notice
                    to Take Vacant Possession under cl 9.1 was thus a condition precedent to the
                    operation of cl 12.4. The plaintiffs’ error was to start time running
                    14 days after the contractual date fixed for the giving of Notice to Take Vacant
                    Possession. A plain reading of cl 12.1 shows this was
                untenable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     I move on now to consider sub-claim 5. It will
                    be recalled that Notice to Take Vacant Possession was given, at the latest, by
                    16 January 2009 when, at the insistence of the plaintiffs, the defendants
                    forwarded the architect’s certificate to the plaintiffs. It will also be
                    recalled that the plaintiffs duly paid 14 days thereafter (on 20 January
                    2009) the 70% progress payment which fell due, albeit, with a deduction of
                    $141,922.19 for liquidated damages under cl 9.4. On the face of it
                    therefore, the plaintiffs appeared to accept that the Notice to Take Vacant
                    Possession had been given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     However, the plaintiffs’ position was
                    that notwithstanding their payment, the defendants’ Notice to Take Vacant
                    Possession was not properly given because the premises were not fit for
                    occupation. (Presumably, in line with that position, in sub-claim 2 the
                    plaintiffs sought a further sum of $5,228.72 by way of liquidated damages under
                    cl 9.4 for the period 16 to 29 January 2009. In other words, despite
                    receipt of the architect’s certificate they requested for, the
                    plaintiffs’ still considered Notice to Take Vacant Possession as not
                    having been validly given right up to the date they made payment on
                    30 January 2009. This sub-claim, however, appears to be an afterthought for
                    if it had earlier occurred to the plaintiffs, they would not only have deducted
                    liquidated damages of $141,922.19 for delay up to 15 January 2009 but would
                    have computed damages right up to the day they made payment and deducted it from
                    the 70% progress instalment.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Coming back to sub-claim 5, it may be that the
                    plaintiffs sought to recover liquidated damages on an alternative basis. Instead
                    of saying that Notice to Complete ought to have been given 14 days after the
                    contractual date fixed for the giving of Notice to Take Vacant Possession, it
                    may be that the plaintiffs contended that Notice to Complete ought to have been
                    given 14 days after Notice to Take Vacant Possession was actually given.
                    But if the plaintiffs accepted that Notice to Take Vacant Possession was
                    actually given, no further liquidated damages should have been sought under cl
                    9.4 for failure to give valid Notice to Take Vacant Possession. If, on the other
                    hand, the plaintiffs insisted that Notice to Take Vacant Possession was never
                    validly given, then the claim for liquidated damages under cl 9.4 continued but
                    the claim under cl 12.4 should not have commenced. The plaintiffs could not blow
                    hot and cold, arguing that Notice to Take Vacant Possession was never validly
                    given for purposes of cl 9.4 but was indeed actually given for the purpose of
                    cl 12.4.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was valid notice given?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Clause 9.2 of the Agreement reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

                            delivering vacant possession of the Property to the Purchaser, the
                            Vendor <em>must</em> ensure that the Property has
                            been completed <em>so as to be fit for occupation and
                                must remove all surplus materials and rubbish from the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The plaintiffs submitted that the defendants
                    gave notice to take vacant possession of a property that was
                    “uninhabitable and unsafe let alone fit for occupation”. In
                        <em>Topfell Ltd v Galley Properties Ltd</em> [1979] 1
                    WLR 446, vacant possession in relation to a property was defined as “a
                    state in which it can be occupied and enjoyed”. Owing to the state of the
                    property, the plaintiffs argued that vacant possession was not delivered under
                    cl 9.1. From their claims, the plaintiffs appeared to be arguing that from 16
                    January 2009 till the last day of trial on 22 November 2010, vacant possession
                    of the property had not been delivered to them. The following defects were
                    identified by the plaintiffs in support of their position:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_a"></a>(a)     the main door was not
                        erected;</p>

                        house was not painted and cleaned;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_c"></a>(c)     failure to clear construction debris, surplus materials
                        and rubbish; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_d"></a>(d)     hazardous works and incomplete works such as a gap in the roof
                        terrace.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The plaintiffs relied on the case of <em>Yin-Marguerite v Pt Jaya Putra Kundur</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 309 to establish that the question whether notice was
                    correctly issued was one of fact. The court found that valid notice could not be
                    issued when the units were not ready merely in an effort to forestall liability
                    for liquidated damages. The crux of the plaintiffs’ argument was that due
                    to the safety hazards and other incomplete works identified, the property was
                    not in a state fit for occupation. On their argument, the notice to take vacant
                    possession was invalid and should not have been issued on 16 January
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Issuance of the TOP on 6 January 2009</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Examining the effect of BCA’s issuance
                    of the TOP was a convenient starting point to crystallise the salient issues
                    relating to the validity of the notice issued. The architect,
                    Mr Tay’s, evidence clarified the specific compliance requirements
                    imposed by BCA on developers prior to the issuance of a TOP:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You as a QP [Qualified Person of the project] said
                            that you have to comply with statutory requirement to obtain TOP.
                                <em>What is it that you have to comply as a QP in
                                order to satisfy the statutory requirement to obtain
                            TOP</em>?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Okay. Usually ... you have to do a site inspection
                            to ensure that the builder built according to the approved plan and to
                            check for any deviation and to ensure that the site or the project
                            itself is ready for a TOP inspection to be jointly carried out with a
                            BCA officer. And after the inspection itself, the BCA officers will
                            usually give us a list of comment or directions whether there are things
                            that doesn’t comply or doesn’t meet their stipulated safety
                            requirement. Usually we have to either seek waiver or to ensure that the
                            work is sort of rectified to comply to this comments. And after all this
                            is being done, and BCA is satisfied with the works, they will issue us
                            TOP.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Under s 12(4) of the Building Control Act
                    (Cap 29, 1999 Rev Ed), a TOP is <em>prima
                        facie</em> evidence that a building is suitable for occupation. The
                    issuance of the TOP by BCA prior to the issuance of the defendants’ Notice
                    to Take Vacant Possession weighed against the plaintiffs’ submissions.
                    Moreover, although the plaintiffs had made multiple written complaints to BCA
                    regarding the condition of the property, BCA had dismissed their complaints and
                    maintained the validity of the TOP. Three main issues were identified by the
                    plaintiffs as capable of invalidating the Notice to Take Vacant Possession,
                        <em>viz</em>, the safety hazard posed by the gap in the
                    roof terrace, the defendants’ failure to install a main door and, under cl
                    9.2, the failure to remove all “surplus material and rubbish” from
                    the property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     BCA’s representative, Mr Tan Eng
                    Huat (“Mr Tan”), had observed in a letter dated
                    5 February 2009 to Mr Tay that the “big gap at the roof
                    terrace” was a safety hazard. Additionally, the architect
                    Mr Tay’s evidence was that “strictly speaking” the
                    property was not fit for occupation as the defendants had omitted to install the
                    main door. However, he clarified that generally speaking the state the property
                    was in was due to the scheduled construction works:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">TOP issued BCA meant temporary occupation permit.
                            That means the building itself is in the minimum state that if you want
                            to have occupation, you can with no issue of safety and initially, that
                            means primarily, all the supply, everything must work in a sense –
                            there’s electrical supply, there’s water supply, all the
                            safety barriers must be up ... even with that TOP, it was stated that,
                            clearly, it’s not a full completion as such. <em>Why? Because at that point in time, we are aware, BCA is aware,
                                client is aware that subsequent work has to be carried out ... it is
                                not a full completion because there’s a whole lot of what we
                                term as ID works, interior fitting out works</em>. [emphasis
                            added]</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Outstanding works after the issuance of TOP</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     First and foremost, having examined the
                    photographic evidence adduced, I am persuaded that while the property looked
                    more or less complete during the TOP inspection in early January 2009, soon
                    thereafter, the deterioration of the state of the property as well as the
                    construction debris present was a direct result of the scheduled construction
                    works being carried out. The discrepancy between Mr Chua’s and
                    Mr Tan’s evidence excerpted below supported this finding. Under
                    cross-examination about the defects in the property, Mr Chua remarked
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in 2009 after the TOP was served, [I] went into the property and by
                        this time, <em>I’m able to see everything in a total
                            perspective, because there’s no construction work</em>, on
                        the floor of the living room and dining room. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However shortly thereafter on 3 February 2009, at the
                    Plaintiffs’ request BCA’s Mr Tan conducted an inspection of the
                    premises and he noted that “some works were still being carried
                    out”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     I am satisfied that there was an informal
                    understanding between the parties that interior decor and carpentry works for
                    the property would take place after the issuance of the TOP (dealt with in
                    detail below). Accordingly, it was disingenuous of the plaintiffs to use the
                    state of the property after the TOP had been issued, and interior decor and
                    carpentry works had started, to attack the validity of the Notice to Take Vacant
                    Possession on the grounds that the house was not painted and cleaned and that
                    there was failure to clear construction debris surplus material and
                    rubbish.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Mr Wong, the assistant architect,
                    persuasively explained that as the construction works were held back pending the
                    issuance of the TOP, if the main door with customised glass panelling requested
                    by the plaintiffs was installed at the TOP stage, it might have been damaged by
                    the construction works scheduled to take place following the issuance of the
                    TOP. The defendants’ omission to install the main door before and after
                    the issuance of the TOP was entirely within the contemplation of the parties.
                    The defendants’ intention was to avoid unnecessary costs and to protect
                    the customised door from exposure to construction works. As Mr Chua was not
                    planning on immediately occupying the property owing to the scheduled
                    construction works, the defendants did not install a temporary main door only to
                    have it discarded when Mr Chua’s customised door was installed. From
                    the evidence, it would appear that the cost saving from omitting a temporary
                    door was to be credited to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In a letter dated 11 March 2009, BCA wrote to
                    Mr Chua noting that the remaining:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... outstanding items listed by you [the Plaintiffs] are mainly fittings,
                        which do not fall within the scope of the Building Control Act and
                        Regulations and therefore are not regulated by the BCA. ... the statutory
                        requirements pertaining to the issuance of the TOP have been complied
                        with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiffs’ act of payment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     On a slightly different note, under the
                    Agreement the purchaser was required to make payment progressively in stages in
                    the order set out under cl 4. Firstly, the plaintiffs demanded that
                    pursuant to cl 9.3 a valid Notice to Take Vacant Possession could only be
                    issued, <em>inter alia</em>, by provision of the
                    architect’s certificate. Fourteen days after the defendants furnished the
                    said certificate on 30 January 2009, in compliance with cl 4.1.4, the
                    plaintiffs duly made the payment of 70% of the total purchase price, withholding
                    a sum of $141,922.19 for liquidated damages up to the date the architect’s
                    certificate was given to the plaintiffs and no further. The plaintiffs’
                    conduct invited the direct inference that the envisioned stage referenced in the
                    Agreement under cl 9.3 had been satisfactorily reached. This act indicated
                    that the plaintiffs accepted that the defendants’ Notice to Take Vacant
                    Possession was valid, at the latest by 16 January 2009 after the plaintiffs
                    received the architect’s certificate.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As observed earlier, the operation of cl 12.1
                    is contingent upon the prior satisfaction of cl 9.1. If the plaintiffs were of
                    the view that the defendants had failed to deliver Notice to Take Vacant
                    Possession, discussions between the parties in relation to the Notice to
                    Complete under cl 12.1 would not have arisen. When the defendants issued Notice
                    to Complete the sale and purchase of the property on 2 February 2009, whilst the
                    plaintiffs were reluctant to proceed further, rather than declaring the Notice
                    to Complete as invalid, the plaintiffs sought multiple extensions to complete
                    the transaction. This is evidenced by their e-mails dated 20 March 2009 and 18
                    April 2009. By their own conduct, it may be inferred that the plaintiffs
                    considered the defendants’ Notice to Take Vacant Possession to be
                    valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In light of BCA’s defence of the
                    validity of the TOP and the plaintiffs’ conduct outlined above, I am
                    reluctant to make a finding that the Notice given to take vacant possession of
                    the property was invalid. Admittedly, there was a gap in the roof terrace at the
                    time TOP was issued. However, it was soon remedied. The important point to bear
                    in mind is that while the property was strictly not in a state fit for immediate
                    occupation, the overarching reason for the property being in that state when it
                    was sought to be handed over was that it had been agreed between the parties
                    that construction works for the interior decor and carpentry would be commenced
                    immediately after the issuance of the TOP to accommodate Mr Chua’s
                    requirement for something more sophisticated than that to be provided under the
                    Agreement. (This is further mentioned in <a href="#p1_85">[85]</a> to <a href="#p1_88">[88]</a> <em>infra</em>.) Therefore any claim for liquidated damages
                    (if any) over and above that already conceded by the defendants ought properly
                    to have been under cl 12.4 for delay in giving Notice to Complete.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Liquidated damages recoverable for late completion of the sale and
                purchase</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The plaintiffs had a <em>prima
                        facie</em> contractual entitlement to liquidated damages for the delay
                    in completing the sale and purchase of the property. In their defence, the
                    defendants submitted that the delay occasioned was predominantly caused by
                    Mr Chua. Examination of Mr Chua’s contribution to the delay
                    during the period from 30 January 2009 until 22 November 2010 required
                    consideration of the amendments/alterations requested by him prior to and
                    following the issuance of the Notice to take Vacant Possession on
                    16 January 2009. Such consideration was for the purpose of determining
                    whether time was set “at large”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Was time set “at large”?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     An early expression of the principle
                    pertaining to time being set at large or the “prevention
                    principle” in construction contracts was seen in the Edwardian English
                    case of <em>Wells v Army &amp; Navy Co-operative
                        Society</em> (1903) Construction Law Year Book, Vol 4, 65 CA at
                    69–70, where Vaughan Williams LJ opined that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the contract one finds the time limited within which
                        [the developer] is to do his work. This means, not only that he is to
                        do it within that time but it means also that he is to have that time within
                        which to do it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In <em>Dodd v
                        Churton</em> [1897] 1 QB 562 at 566, Lord Esher MR famously described
                    the rationale behind the principle as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The principle is laid down in Comyns’ Digest, Condition L (6.),
                        that, <em>where one party to a contract is prevented from
                            performing it by the act of the other, he is not liable in law for that
                            default</em>; and, accordingly, a well recognised rule has been
                        established in cases of this kind, beginning with <em>Holme v
                            Guppy</em>, to the effect that, <em>if the building
                            owner has ordered extra work beyond that specified by the original
                            contract which has necessarily increased the time requisite for
                            finishing the work, he is thereby disentitled to claim the penalties for
                            non-completion provided by the contract</em>. The reason for that
                        rule is that otherwise a most unreasonable burden would be imposed upon the
                        contractor. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The equitable remedy afforded by the
                    prevention principle is derived from the well established legal maxim that no
                    man shall take advantage of his own wrong. Setting time at large ensures that
                    whoever “prevents a thing from being done shall not avail himself of the
                    non-performance he has occasioned”: H Broom, <em>A

                    p 235. More recently, in <em>Trollope &amp; Colls Ltd v North
                        West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board</em> [1973] 1 WLR 601, Lord
                    Denning MR sitting in the Court of Appeal held as follows (at 607):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    It is well settled that in building contracts
                            – and in other contracts too – when there is a stipulation
                            for work to be done in a limited time, if one party by his conduct
                            –
                            <em>it may be quite legitimate conduct, such as ordering
                                extra work – renders it impossible or impracticable for the
                                other party to do his work within the stipulated time, then the one
                                whose conduct caused the trouble can no longer insist upon strict
                                adherence to the time stated</em>. He cannot claim any
                            penalties, or liquidated damages for non-completion in that time.

                        Ltd</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 385 (“<em>Yap
                        Boon Keng Sonny</em>”) as (at [34]): “An act of prevention operates to prevent, impede
                    or otherwise make it more difficult for a contractor to complete the works by
                    the date stipulated in the contract.” Acts of prevention can include
                    failures or omissions on the part of the purchaser to fulfil certain express or
                    implied obligations such as, <em>inter alia</em>, the
                    giving of inadequate instructions, providing inadequate access to the site, late
                    delivery of the site, failure to secure approval of plans and failure to provide
                    the materials required. Within the context of this dispute, the purported
                        <em>acts of prevention</em> included
                    Mr Chua’s unilaterally ordering extra work to be carried out outside
                    the scope of the Agreement and the delay occasioned by the appointment of
                    independent subcontractors for the interior decor and carpentry works of the
                    property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     When an employer/purchaser is found to have
                    performed acts of prevention, in the absence of an extension of time clause in
                    the agreement, the contractual time for completion is no longer binding.
                    Accordingly, the right to claim liquidated damages under the contract for any
                    delay occasioned is lost as there is no longer a fixed completion date from
                    which damages may be calculated. Keith Pickavance, <em>Delay and
                        Disruption in Construction Contracts</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 4th
                    Ed, 2010) (“<em>Pickavance</em>”) at p 316,
                    observed that the prevention principle is applicable, setting time at large even
                    if the delays caused by the purchaser form <em>only part of the
                        total delay</em>. In fact, even if the developer would have been
                    unable to complete on time in the absence of the acts of prevention of the
                    purchaser, the liquidated damages clause will still cease to apply if the
                    purchaser was responsible for some of the delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Reiterating this principle, Salleh Abbas FJ in
                        <em>Sim Chio Huat v Wong Ted Fui</em> [1983] 1 MLJ 151
                        (“<em>Sim Chio Huat</em>”), clarified
                    that it was immaterial whether the hindrance or delay caused by the plaintiffs
                    was a <em>cause of part or the whole delay</em>. Liquidated
                    damages would cease to apply unless there was an extension of time clause
                    incorporated into the relevant contract. Thus, the enquiry into whether the
                    conduct of Mr Chua constituted an act of prevention capable of setting time
                    at large was <em>independent</em> of the question of the
                        <em>extent of delay</em> caused by the said act/acts or
                    the possibility that the delay was partly caused by the defendants. Thus,
                        <em>even if</em> Mr Chin was partly responsible
                    for the delay in relation to certain works, so long as the plaintiffs’
                    conduct was partly to blame for impeding/preventing the works of the defendants,
                    time would be set at large.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Nature of the Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The plaintiffs addressed the issue of time
                    being set at large in an almost cursory fashion. They asserted that the nature
                    of the Agreement was outside the parameters of the equitable remedy, rendering
                    it inapplicable. The plaintiffs argued that the nature of their relationship
                    with the defendants was one of purchaser and vendor. As they were not
                    contracting parties to a building contract, they were not in a position to
                    prevent the completion of work. However, <em>Keating</em>
                        (<a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> <em>supra</em>) defined a building contract as (at pp 1 and
                    2):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... any contract where <em>one person agrees for valuable
                            consideration to carry out ... building or engineering works for
                            another</em>. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... <em>The employer for whose benefit the work is carried
                            out</em> and the contractor who must carry out the work are the
                        principal parties to a construction contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The plaintiffs were without a doubt the
                    employers in this Agreement as all the re-construction works carried out at the
                    property were indisputably for their benefit, albeit in the context of a sale
                    and purchase. Contrary to the plaintiffs’ assertion, the Agreement was a
                        <em>quasi</em>-construction contract as it was both a
                    contract for the sale of land as well as a contract for the reconstruction of
                    the property built on the land. Inspecting the terms of the Agreement readily
                    revealed that at the heart of the sale and purchase of the property was the
                    construction of the said property. It was plain beyond doubt that the Agreement
                    was not a sale and purchase of the property as it was, but, rather, the property
                    was sold subject to construction works to be carried out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Consequently, the plaintiffs’ conduct
                    was capable of constituting acts of prevention. In the context of this dispute,
                    the purported <em>acts of prevention</em> included
                    variations such as Mr Chua unilaterally ordering extra work to be carried
                    out outside the scope of the Agreement and the delay occasioned by the
                    appointment of subcontractors for interior decor and carpentry
                works.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Acts of prevention: Variations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In the interest of simplifying the factual
                    matrix at hand, the changes or alterations made were classified either as (a)
                        <em>within</em> the Agreement and incorporated by way
                    of the Fourth and Fifth Schedules (BP02); or (b) <em>outside</em> the contractual bargain, having been initiated by the
                    plaintiffs both prior to and after the issuance of the TOP. In light of the
                    defendants’ acceptance of liability under cl 9.4 for the delay up to 15
                    January 2009, the enquiry centred on the plaintiffs’ conduct subsequent to
                    the issuance of the TOP and the architect’s certificate, <em>ie</em>, 16 January 2009 onwards.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The document titled “<em>Issues mutually agreed by Vendor and Purchaser</em>” contained
                    a list of “defects”, some of which, upon closer scrutiny, were
                    works ordered by Mr Chua <em>outside</em> the terms of
                    the Agreement. To the extent that other items in the list were indeed defects in
                    respect of which rectification works were expected of the defendants, they were
                    not regarded as works outside the scope of the Agreement. Mr Chua
                    repeatedly asserted that Mr Chin had agreed to the additional works even if
                    they were outside the scope of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In spite of Mr Chin’s agreement to
                    accommodate and carry out Mr Chua’s requests for additional works, so
                    long as the additional works were outside the scope of the original Agreement,
                    in the absence of a clause relating to extension of time or ordering of extra
                    works, any and all works ordered by Mr Chua outside the Agreement were
                    capable of constituting acts of prevention. Lord Esher MR’s remark in
                        <em>Dodd v Churton</em> (<a href="#p1_59">[59]</a> <em>supra</em>) bears repeating (at 566):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">.. if the building owner has ordered extra work beyond that specified by
                        the original contract which has necessarily increased the time requisite for
                        finishing the work, he is thereby disentitled to claim the penalties for
                        non-completion provided by the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Sim Chio Huat</em> (<a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> <em>supra</em>), the court held that (at 154):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Amongst the conclusions reached by the learned author [Hudson’s
                        Building and Engineering Contracts, 10th Ed, at p 624] after
                        considering these cases is that in cases <em>where an
                            agreement contains no clause for extension of time for completion, the
                            acts of prevention by the employer whether authorised by the contract or
                            whether in breach of it or whether the prevention is a cause of part or
                            of the whole of the delay invalidate the liquidated damages</em>
                        clause because by such acts in the words of Parke B in <em>Holme v Guppy (supra)</em>and Lord Denning MR in
                            <em>Trollope and Colls (supra)</em> ‘the time
                        becomes at large’. Consequently there is no date from which damages
                        could run and therefore no damages could be claimed. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In Duncan Wallace, <em>Hudson’s Building and
                        Engineering Contracts</em>, vol 2 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed,
                    1995), p 1157 clearly states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    that acts of prevention by the owner, whether
                            authorised by or breaches of the contract, will set time at large and
                            invalidate any liquidated damages clause, in the absence of an
                            applicable extension of time clause. <em>Variations
                                whether authorised under the original contract or subsequently
                                agreed, will be regarded as acts of prevention (or of waiver) for
                                this purpose</em>; [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Simply put, one of the main purposes of the
                    prevention principle is to protect a contractor who may be unable to adhere to
                    the time line stipulated in the contract by reason of additional works ordered
                    by his employer. The application of this equitable remedy in fact pre-supposes
                    that the contractor agreed to carry out the additional works and that, as a
                    result, the delay was caused at least in part by the additional works. The
                    rationale of the prevention principle would be undermined if additional works
                    ordered by the employer which hindered or delayed the works of the contractor
                    were incapable of constituting acts of prevention just because the contractor
                    agreed to carry out the additional works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Accordingly, any variations authorised or
                    unauthorised outside the scope of the Agreement were capable of constituting
                    acts of prevention in the absence of an extension of time clause or a clause
                    governing additional works. Furthermore, in the absence of an express term
                    incorporating all the additional works ordered by Mr Chua in the 5 March
                    2008 list into the original Agreement (<em>ie</em>, subject
                    to the timeline stipulated by cl 4 of the Agreement), I find that all such
                    works were outside the scope of the original Agreement and, accordingly, were
                    capable of constituting acts of prevention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Changes necessitated by the terms of the Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Any and all works <em>within</em> the contractual bargain, including works within the
                    Fourth and Fifth Schedules to the Agreement, were subject to the strict time
                    line set out in the Agreement. In the event of delay, the defendants were liable
                    for the relevant liquidated damages stipulated in the Agreement. As <em>Keating</em> (<a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> <em>supra</em>) observes at p 321, in the absence of
                    ambiguity in the construction contract, the contractor (defendants) would be
                    liable for any delay occasioned notwithstanding the
                    “impossibility” of performing the contract within the stipulated
                    time-frame:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The wording of the contract may be such that the contractor binds himself
                        absolutely to complete the contract work with extras within the stipulated
                        time, subject to payment of liquidated damages in default, even though
                        extras may be ordered and no extension of time is granted. <em>Such a contract, though it is very onerous and the contractor
                            may have committed himself to an impossibility, will be enforced
                            provided the extras were such as were contemplated by the
                            contract</em>. ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     On 22 December 2006, the defendants’
                    solicitors sent a letter to the plaintiffs attaching a letter from Ms Gwen
                    Tan of FA which highlighted the likely delays caused by the amended layout plan
                    awaiting BCA’s approval (BP02) and warned the plaintiffs of additional
                    professional fees chargeable for the requested changes encapsulated in the
                    Fourth and Fifth Schedules to the Agreement. Architect Ms Gwen Tan’s
                    warning and any difficulty faced by the defendants in adhering to the time line
                    stipulated by cll 9 and 12 did not excuse the defendants from compliance with
                    the terms of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     I accepted the defendants’ evidence that
                    the application for the TOP could have been made much earlier if not for the
                    need to update and submit BP02 to BCA and other relevant authorities in
                    accordance with the plaintiffs’ changes. While 95% of the work had been
                    carried out by 10 June 2008, the preparation of revised drawings required five
                    months (June to November 2008), delaying the application for the TOP to November
                    2008. Nevertheless, no matter how onerous, as the changes incorporated in BP02
                    had been contractually agreed as part of the Agreement, they were subject to the
                    time line provided under the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Changes ordered outside the terms of the Agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Contrary to the plaintiffs’ position
                    that all the changes requested were within the four corners of the contract, the
                    evidence showed that the plaintiffs made several requests for variations
                    directly to the architects (FA) and the main contractor (KHSC) even though they
                    were under the employ of the defendants. Mr Chua vehemently denied that he
                    had communicated directly with the representatives of FA and KHSC. In fact, it
                    appears that in the interest of ensuring that the plaintiffs were satisfied with
                    the property, Mr Chin had expressly authorised Mr Chua to approach the
                    architects with any query or change which he had in mind. I am satisfied that
                    Mr Chua did bypass the defendants, communicating not only with the
                    architect but also with the main contractor in relation to non-contractual
                    variation works. I accept the General Manager of KHSC, Mr Poh Kee’s
                    evidence that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5    In the course of carrying out the works, there were
                            numerous changes made to the design of the property. ... <em>I had informed him</em> [<em>Mr Chua</em>] <em>that any change would
                                be considered a variation work as it is different from the building

                                to clear with the architects first</em>. The owner had
                            informed me that he would speak to the architects and that the changes
                            were reflected in his contract with Mr Chin. The following

              <em>As a result of the numerous
                                changes to the works, I had informed Mr Chin on several

                                would not be able to complete the project within the time that was

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Furthermore, Mr Tay gave evidence that
                    multiple verbal instructions were given by Mr Chua during site meetings
                    which resulted in revisions and inevitable delay. The defendants’
                    assertion that Mr Chua had repeatedly interfered with the construction
                    works at the property was documented in the written correspondence from the
                    defendants’ solicitors to the plaintiffs dated 23 January 2009:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It appears that Mr Chua Tian Chu came earlier, met with the main
                        contractor and indicated to the contractor that he wanted some (if not all)
                        of the windows and frames to be changed. Kindly note that this direction (if
                        what the main contractor said is true) is totally out of line. Our clients
                        will reject his direction. It shows that your clients, <em>Mr Chua is again interfering and giving unilaterally</em>
                            [<em>sic</em>] <em>instructions to
                            the main contractor without our clients’ authority. Our clients
                            object to this. Should there be variations, the proper
                            negotiations/instructions should be directly</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>to our clients</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     Having established that Mr Chua was
                    accustomed to approaching FA and KHSC directly, the crucial question remained as
                    to whether the variation works ordered were within the boundaries of the
                    Agreement. Contrary to the plaintiffs’ submission that all the changes
                    made were contractually agreed, the amendments/alterations made at the
                    plaintiffs’ requests resulted in three revised building plans prepared by
                    FA on 1 February 2007, 23 October 2007 and 16 July 2008. I accept the
                    defendants’ submission that it was not in their interest to repeatedly
                    amend the building plans causing delay and attendant costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Under-cross examination, Mr Chua accepted
                    that he instructed Mr Poh Kee to install the water sprout at the swimming
                    pool, outside the scope of works detailed under the Fourth and Fifth Schedules
                    to the Agreement. In addition, under cross-examination while discussing the
                    defects list dated 5 March 2008 and notwithstanding his justifications,
                    Mr Chua conceded that changes were made outside of the Agreement in
                    relation to the new store-room at the back of the garage, the construction of
                    new boundary walls and the replacement of a wall between the dry kitchen and
                    dining room with a folding door:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     The layout of certain rooms completely changed
                    from the first building plan to the next. For example, several changes were made
                    to the layout of the water-closet, bidet, bath and shower area. Under cross
                    examination, Mr Chua accepted that certain changes made on his instructions
                    were outside the scope of the Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">And one other change that’s requested was the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In addition, many changes in positioning of
                    the toilet accessories were also reflected in the drawings made on 1 February
                    2007, 23 October 2007 and 16 July 2008. Mr Wong indicated that contrary to
                    the plaintiffs’ submissions, the enlargement of the area around the
                    maid’s water-closet on Mr Chua’s instructions was unnecessary
                    for accommodating the additional accessories listed in the Agreement. The
                    re-configuration of the whole area around the maid’s water-closet so as to
                    accommodate a towel rail and soap-holder was even less
                    “necessary”. Mr Wong indicated that Mr Chua proposed the
                    enlargement as he “wanted a bigger room” rather than because of
                    any structural necessity. Another major change made was the removal of the wall
                    between the dry kitchen and dining area upon Mr Chua’s instructions
                    that the “kitchen was too dark”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Similar to the changes highlighted thus far,
                    it appeared that Mr Chua requested the defendants to change the
                    “fixed glass louvre windows” to windows which could be opened; a
                    change like many others which were instructed outside the ambit of the
                    Agreement:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Mr Chua, subsequent to this, you informed
                            Mr Chin that it makes the place very hot and you asked for a change
                            to open louvre windows. Is that correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I think there must be a lapse of memory. I
                            complained the things that were very hot way back in March 2008,
                            that’s why we have asked for window that can be opened and stayed
                            in open position and instead of a fixed window that is going to be very
                            hot because of afternoon sun and so on and so forth. So that request was
                            made way back in March 2008 and agreed upon by both
                        parties.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The consequential changes arising from the
                    “re-design” or variation of the swimming pool in the property were
                    the subject of heated dispute between the parties. Briefly, the dimensions of
                    the pool were lengthened and the shape of the pool was changed to a small
                    L-shape that wrapped around the living area. These changes resulted in the
                    underground surface water channel, the walkway and many other parts of the
                    property having to undergo significant overhaul at the defendants’ expense
                    and time. Under the Fourth Schedule of the Agreement, as the re-design of the
                    pool was limited to modifications relating to its <em>dimensions</em>, it was clear that the scope of the changes
                    instructed by Mr Chua in terms of the design, shape and positioning of the
                    pool, were outside the scope of the Agreement. In <em>Multiplex
                        Constructions (UK) Ltd v Honeywell Control Systems Ltd (No 2)</em>
                    [2007] EWHC 447 at [56], it was held
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(i)    Actions by the employer which are perfectly
                            legitimate under a construction contract may still be characterised as
                            prevention, if those actions cause delay beyond the contractual
                            completion date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Having examined the slew of changes instructed
                    outside the terms of the Agreement, it is important to note that some of these
                    changes in turn resulted in consequential changes such as the hacking of wall
                    tiles and removal of fixtures. Furthermore, while certain changes were ordered
                    by Mr Chua for pragmatic reasons, it did not detract from the fact that the
                    changes caused delay and were capable of being characterised as acts of
                    prevention. Mr Chua’s interference and orders for variations worsened
                    any delay caused by the defendants. As the defendants merely needed to satisfy
                    the court that part of the delay was occasioned by the variations made by
                    Mr Chua, I was not required to quantify the precise period of delay caused
                    by each of the material changes discussed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Interior decor and carpentry work as an act of prevention</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The Fifth Schedule to the Agreement set out
                    the basic specifications for the architectural interiors which the defendants
                    were contractually obliged to provide. While the Agreement provided for basic
                    architectural interior decor and carpentry works, the plaintiffs wanted
                    “something more sophisticated”. Mr Lee testified that he
                    approached Mr Chua offering the services of FPL to <em>upgrade</em> the “basic” interior design work to be
                    provided under the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     On 26 May 2008, Mr Chua entered into a
                    contract with FPL, a subsidiary of FA, for the interior design of the property.
                    FPL’s representative, Mr Lee, recommended Mr Chin to enter into
                    a contract (SH011-08) with SI for all the carpentry works <em>within</em> the scope of the Agreement, such as the wardrobes, doors,
                    vanity and mirror cabinets in the property. He also recommended Mr Chua to
                    enter into a separate contract (SHD15-08) on 2 June 2008 with SI to
                    undertake all the carpentry works <em>outside</em> the
                    scope of the Agreement with Mr Chin.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Mr Lee explained that he had recommended
                    SI to both Mr Chin and Mr Chua with a view to saving costs and time.
                    If Mr Chin had engaged a different subcontractor to undertake the interior
                    decor and carpentry works whilst Mr Chua engaged SI to upgrade the works,
                    that which Mr Chin’s subcontractor built would have had to be removed
                    and replaced with SI’s upgrade resulting in wastage of time and money.
                    With the engagement of a common subcontractor, the plaintiffs only needed to pay
                    the incremental cost of the upgrade while the defendants bore the cost of the
                    basic interior decor and carpentry works which were to be provided under the
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     FPL’s contract with Mr Chua for the
                    development of an interior design concept for the property expressly included
                    the “delivery of carpentry and supervision of work”. Mr Lee
                    had recommended that Mr Chua should use one carpenter for all the works in
                    the property so as to ensure that the quality of work was uniform. It was
                    Mr Lee who introduced Mikey to Mr Chua as a carpentry contractor who
                    was trustworthy and capable of performing carpentry works which were compatible
                    with FPL’s interior design concept.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mr Chin’s role in his contract with SI</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     At the heart of their argument, the defendants
                    sought to establish that the delay occasioned from 30 January 2009 onwards
                    was beyond Mr Chin’s control. As Mr Chin did not have a
                    contractual relationship with FPL, he was unable to control the speed of
                    development and implementation of the interior design of the property.
                    SI’s work was contingent on FPL’s work. The progress of FPL’s
                    work was dependent on Mr Chua’s instructions. Accordingly, any delay
                    in communications between Mr Chua and FPL directly impacted upon SI’s
                    ability to carry out its works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     As regards SI, Mr Chin submitted that he
                    was not in a position to control its work as he was merely the
                    “paymaster”. Mikey clarified that Mr Chua was responsible for
                    all the “design approval” and Mr Chin’s contract was
                    “basically [entered into] to make sure he [paid] me [Mikey] for the work
                    done”. In fact, when the said contract between Mr Chin and SI was
                    signed in February 2009, Mr Chin made a note on the contract instructing SI
                    to liaise directly with Mr Chua for instructions relating to design and
                    materials. Furthermore, in a letter from Mikey to Mr Chua dated
                    3 March 2009, Mikey stated: “... we will liaise with [FPL] on all
                    design matters” while Mr Chin would be “solely responsible
                    for the payment for the works”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The limited role played by Mr Chin with
                    respect to SI’s work was highlighted by the testimony of Mr Lee,
                    Mr Wong and Mikey to the effect that SI sought directions from Mr Chua
                    or FPL for <em>all</em> their works. An e-mail from
                    Mr Chin to Mr Chua dated 12 June 2009 reiterated this
                    position:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... had finished all the works 2 weeks ago. But till today Mr Mikey
                        had not proceed [<em>sic</em>] to finish his work.
                            <em>Pls note that it had been very very unfair to me that

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Delay caused by Mr Chua’s contract with FPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     I am satisfied that Mr Chua’s
                    decision to enter into and manage the contracts with SI and FPL as a substitute
                    to the “basic” architectural fixtures envisioned under the
                    Agreement played a significant part in the delay occasioned after the issuance
                    of the TOP. Mr Wong’s evidence was that if the interior decoration
                    and carpentry had been limited to basic works as per the original Agreement, it
                    would have been completed much earlier. Mr Wong and Mr Chin also
                    testified that if not for the additional interior design and carpentry works
                    necessitated by Mr Chua’s arrangement with FPL and SI, the
                    “basic” architectural interior would have been completed before
                    the issuance of the TOP on 6 January 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     The plaintiffs’ decision to appoint FPL
                    and SI to modify the type of interior design and carpentry work for the property
                    prevented the defendants from carrying out the works in the Agreement within the
                    time period envisaged. The evidence showed that Mr Chua worked with FPL to
                    determine and approve the interior design. Notwithstanding the fact that
                    Mr Chin was in a contractual relationship with SI, I am satisfied that
                    Mr Chin was limited to the role of “paymaster”. In fact, in
                    January 2009, once the TOP was issued and works re-commenced,
                    Mr Chin’s inability to proceed with his works under the Agreement was
                    caused by the fact that SI was carrying out works. Mikey indicated, as late as
                    18 June 2009, that “once the works have been completed, I will hand
                    over the property to the developer, Mr Chin for his
                    follow-up.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mr Chua’s involvement in the work of SI and FPL</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Having established that under both contracts
                    with SI, Mr Chua was in the pivotal position of directing the works carried
                    out through FPL, the relevant question to address was whether his conduct caused
                    the delay occasioned by the defendants. Contrary to the plaintiffs’
                    submission that all design related decisions had been made by May 2008, the
                    evidence adduced by the defendants established that Mr Chua was still
                    making decisions affecting the defendants’ and SI’s ability to carry
                    out works on the property as late as May to June 2009. An e-mail dated
                    13 May 2009 from Mr Chin to Mikey stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Spoken to you yesterday, <em>you told me that Mr Chua
                            had not confirm</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>the contract on the toilet with you</em>. Pls confirm
                        that he have [<em>sic</em>] confirm it today and let me
                        know when you can start work. As Mr Chua had given me a [deadline] to
                        fulfil. <em>If you cannot finish

                            we can never proceed</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Furthermore, Mikey’s testimony indicated
                    that even after the carpentry works were completed, Mr Chua requested
                    additional changes such as the modification of the mirror cabinets on account of
                    insufficient storage being provided. An e-mail from Mr Chin to Mr Chua
                    dated 16 April 2009 read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Attached please find the design for the boundary wall. ...</p>

                        Or Berlin drawing????</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     In <em>Yap Boon Keng
                        Sonny</em> (<a href="#p1_62">[62]</a> <em>supra</em>), the act of prevention identified by Judith
                    Prakash J was the employers’ decision to appoint a subcontractor for
                    interior decoration works, rejecting the one provided by the contractor. The
                    learned judge held that the delay, resulting in late completion, was caused by
                    the plaintiff seeking another interior decoration contractor, setting time at
                    large. In the case at hand, the appointment of independent design and carpentry
                    contractors by Mr Chua impeded Mr Chin’s role as the developer
                    of the property. In sum, the delay occasioned by the interior design and
                    carpentry works after the issuance of the TOP was attributable to the
                    substitution of basic architectural fittings for “sophisticated”
                    ones, the time taken in the preparation and approval of FPL’s designs,
                    SI’s reliance on FPL’s design for carpentry works and FPL and
                    SI’s reliance on Mr Chua’s instructions. Consequently, the
                    defendants’ ability to complete the works under the Agreement was severely
                    compromised.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In light of the scope of variations ordered by
                    Mr Chua outside the four corners of the Agreement as well as the
                    appointment of FPL and SI for interior decor and carpentry works beyond that
                    provided for under the Agreement, Mr Chua’s conduct, at <em>minimum</em>, was in part responsible for the delay
                    occasioned. Accordingly, I find that time was set at large. Save for the sum of
                    $141,922.19 conceded by the defendants, the plaintiffs’ claim for
                    liquidated damages therefore had to fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">No pleadings on the issue of time being “at
                large”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Were the defendants precluded from relying on
                    the equitable remedy of time being set at large because they did not raise or
                    plead it? The courts have repeatedly stated that it is crucial for the parties
                    to plead material facts on which they seek to rely. As long as the material
                    facts have been pleaded, it is unnecessary to give a label such as, for example,
                    the name of the defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In <em>Orient Centre
                        Investments Ltd v Societe Generale</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 566
                    at [45], the Court of Appeal held that
                    a party who wished to rely on a clause in a contract which was capable of giving
                    rise to an estoppel only needed to plead it for its legal effect without
                    expressly pleading estoppel. Jeffrey Pinsler’s <em>Singapore Court Practice</em> (LexisNexis, 2009) (“<em>Pinsler</em>”), para 18/7/4 states (at p 366):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As it is only material facts which may be stated in the pleading, the
                        advocate must avoid setting down his legal arguments or theories of the law
                        ... The legal result of the facts is entirely a matter for the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In <em>M K (Project
                        Management) Ltd v Baker Marine Energy Pte Ltd</em> [1994] 3 SLR 823,
                    the court adopted Lord Denning MR’s proposition <em>In Re
                        Vandervell’s Trusts (No 2)</em> [1974] Ch 269 at 321: “It
                    is sufficient for the pleader to state the material facts. He need not state the
                    legal result”. While the defendants did not raise the defence that time
                    was set at large by reason of the acts of prevention of the plaintiffs, the
                    material facts relied upon to support such a conclusion were
                pleaded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    One must keep in mind that at the epicentre
                    of procedural rules relating to pleadings is the objective that pleadings should
                    give the other party fair notice of the case which it has to meet and to define
                    the issues at hand. Parties are intentionally precluded from “throwing a
                    spanner” into the works at the conclusion of proceedings. The overarching
                    goal guiding the rules relating to pleadings is the intention to guard against
                    either party being prejudiced. In the case at hand, it was in fact on <em>my</em> direction that the parties were instructed to
                    consider the issue of time being set at large. The plaintiffs were afforded the
                    opportunity to address this latent legal characterisation of the existing
                    material facts, as were the defendants. I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs
                    have been in any way unfairly prejudiced by the delayed re-characterisation of
                    the material facts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    In <em>RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v
                        Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (at
                        [51]–[52]), the Court of Appeal stated that if the
                    plea was alluded to in the evidence and the facts were already before the court,
                    no injustice would result from its consideration by the court. If one were to
                    distil the arguments presented in relation to liquidated damages, while the
                    plaintiffs argued that the defendants were responsible for the delay, the
                    defendants argued that the plaintiffs’ conduct caused the delay. No
                    injustice arose from allowing the defendants to rely on the defence of time
                    being set at large as the plea was clearly alluded to in the presentation of
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In any event, this court is vested with the
                    discretionary power to re-characterise the legal issues from the pleaded facts.
                    As Buckley LJ said in <em>Belmont Finance Corporation Ltd v
                        Williams Furniture Ltd</em> [1979] Ch 250 at 269: the “...
                    court must have jurisdiction to grant any relief that it thinks appropriate to
                    the facts as proved.” In <em>Lever Brothers Ltd v
                        Bell</em> [1931] 1 KB 557, at 582–583, cited with approval in
                        <em>Multi-Pak Singapore v Intraco</em> [1992] 2 SLR
                    793, Scrutton LJ declared:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... The practice of the Courts has been to consider and deal with the
                        legal result of pleaded facts, though the particular legal result alleged is
                        not stated in the pleadings, except in cases where to ascertain the validity
                        of the legal result claimed would require the investigation of new and
                        disputed facts which have not been investigated at trial. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Plaintiffs’ claim for damages in the alternative</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    In principle, when time is set at large, the
                    obligation to complete by the specified date is replaced by an implied
                    obligation to complete within a reasonable time. Notwithstanding the
                    unavailability of liquidated damages, general damages may be recoverable at
                    common law for any delay occasioned after the reasonable date for completion.
                    The assessment of reasonable delay is a question of fact for which the
                    plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing that the time actually taken by
                    developer (30 January 2009 onwards) was excessive under the circumstances. The
                    plaintiffs did not discharge their burden. In the absence of sufficient evidence
                    to establish a <em>reasonable date</em> for completion and
                    any unreasonable delay thereafter, I am unable to determine the question of the
                    defendants’ liability. Accordingly, allowing an assessment of damages to
                    be heard by the Registrar would be wholly inappropriate as it would be
                    tantamount to allowing a re-trial as the Registrar would be forced to make a
                    finding on the extent of unreasonable delay <em>prior
                        to</em> the calculation of damages, if any, available to the
                    plaintiffs. The determination of the defendants’ liability for delay, if
                    any, is a condition precedent to the damages analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The plaintiffs sought leave to amend their
                    statement of claim towards the end of the trial to include a plea for general
                    damages in the event that liquidated damages were unavailable. However, damages
                    are not to be awarded simply because a party alludes to them in a court of law.
                    In <em>Lee Chee Wei v Tan Hor Peow Victor</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 537 at 561,the Court of Appeal stated that the loss must be
                    shown to have actually occurred and to be legitimately recoverable in law before
                    any award can be made. The burden is on the party claiming
                damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Despite the plaintiffs’ election for a
                    trial on liability and quantum, they failed to address the primary question of
                    whether the delay occasioned was unreasonable and, <em>if
                        so</em>, whether any losses were suffered as a consequence. As the
                    determination of liability preceded the analysis on damages recoverable, on the
                    evidence before me, I could not proceed to address the question whether damages,
                    if any, should be awarded to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In the result, I find that the defendants
                    wrongfully rescinded the Agreement by mischaracterising the plaintiffs’
                    conduct as a repudiation of the Agreement. I therefore order, specific
                    performance of the Agreement. I allow the plaintiffs’ claim for
                    rectification costs in the agreed sum of $410,000. I find that time was set
                    at large by the plaintiffs’ conduct. As such, apart from the sum of
                    $141,922.19 already deducted (as conceded by the defendants), liquidated damages
                    are unavailable for the delay from 16 January 2009 onwards. In the absence
                    of proof of unreasonable delay and consequently of damages, I dismiss the
                    plaintiffs’ claim for damages in the alternative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    I will hear the parties on
