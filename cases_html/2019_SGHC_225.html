An additional 760 charges of cheating were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The District Judge sentenced the applicant to 12 years’ preventive detention (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh</span><span class="font-italic"> and another case</span> [2003] SGDC 146 (“<span class="font-italic">Sa</span><span class="font-italic">lwant Singh (District Court)</span>”).

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 MA 115 was heard by Yong Pung How CJ on 14 August 2003. At the hearing, the applicant also claimed for the first time that he had an alibi for all 765 charges and sought an order setting aside his conviction and setting the matter down for trial. Yong CJ rejected the applicant’s prayers on the basis that (a) the appeal was not the proper forum for such a request, the correct procedure being an application for revision rather than an appeal against sentence; and (b) a review of the evidence did not reveal any error so fundamental that it justified the exercise of the court’s revisionary powers on its own motion under ss 266 and 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC 1985”) (see <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (MA) </span>at [14]). He further found that the District Judge had not erred in rejecting the applications to retract the plea<span class="font-italic">, </span>and concluded that<span class="font-italic"> </span>the applicant’s request in MA 115 for a new trial was just another last-ditch attempt to escape a sentence of preventive detention (<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (MA)</span> at [15]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In respect of the sentence imposed by the District Judge, Yong CJ found that the sentence was manifestly inadequate to reflect the length and gravity of the applicant’s criminal record and the need for him to be incarcerated for a substantial duration for the protection of society (<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (MA)</span> at [21]). In the circumstances, the Prosecution’s appeal was allowed and the applicant’s sentence was enhanced from 12 years’ to 20 years’ preventive detention.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Subsequent applications filed by the applicant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Since the conclusion of MA 115 in 2003, the applicant has filed more than ten criminal applications. I do not propose to elaborate on each of these applications in these grounds save to highlight two of the applications which were of some relevance to the present matter. These are Criminal Motion No 20 of 2004 (“CM 20”) and Criminal Motion No 17 of 2008 (“CM 17”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In CM 20, the applicant sought to obtain the notes recorded at pre-trial conferences (“PTCs”) which occurred between the time he had been formally charged and the day he pleaded guilty to the charges. The applicant’s object in retrieving the notes was to substantiate his earlier claims that the Prosecution had agreed not to seek a deterrent or enhanced sentence before his conviction and thus that the Prosecution had reneged on the premise on which he had in fact pleaded guilty when it subsequently sought a sentence of preventive detention. CM 20 was dismissed at first instance by the High Court. On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the High Court. It held that there was no basis on which the court could properly order the release of the PTC notes to the applicant because what had taken place at the PTCs did not form part of the criminal proceedings in which the applicant had been convicted and sentenced (see <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh v Public Prosecutor</span> [2005] 1 SLR (R) 632 (“<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (PTC Notes)</span>”) at [10]). Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal investigated the substance of the applicant’s allegations and found, based on the contemporaneous exchange of letters between the Prosecution and the applicant, that the Prosecution had not agreed that it would not press for a deterrent sentence (<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (PTC Notes)</span> at [13]–[15]). The court also noted that on the day the Prosecution sought an order of preventive detention before the District Judge, there was no protest or any allegation of a breach of understanding by either the applicant or his counsel. Instead, all that was submitted at that juncture was that the imposition of preventive detention would be too harsh (<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (PTC Notes) </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[15]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In CM 17, the applicant sought an order for the review of his detention under ss 327(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and 327(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CPC 1985 and art 9(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint). In this application, the applicant contended that his conviction was wrongful because a number of the charges brought against him were for acts which he could not have committed since they were said to have occurred on a date when the applicant was not in Singapore. That the applicant was not in Singapore on those dates was, according to him, evident from date stamps in his passport as well as the fact that the SOF stated that he had left for India on 6 July 1999.

</div> I should mention at this juncture that this is the same submission which formed the basis of the applicant’s claims against the DPPs in the present application, and will be explained in greater detail in the following section of these grounds. CM 17 was heard and dismissed by Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was). Tay J found that there was no basis for the applicant to invoke s 327 of the CPC 1985 as his conviction and sentence were ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction and the appeal therefrom was heard and disposed of by the appellate court specified by law. The enhanced sentence was therefore not unlawful in any way (see <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] SGHC 164 (“<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (Review)</span>” at [13]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Following the dismissal of his criminal applications, the applicant filed the present application under the LPA in February 2019.

</div> He claimed that these showed that he was in fact away from Singapore for an even longer period, and therefore that more of the charges were affected. Some of the dates on the stamps were not entirely clear. It was also not clear just what these stamps were meant to signify. In particular, there were differences in the shapes of the stamps. Some were circular while others were oval and it was not clear if these reflected entry and exit stamps for instance. To try to resolve this, prior to the hearing for this application, I directed that the applicant arrange for the passport itself to be made available at the hearing. When he appeared before me, the applicant informed me that his family members had not been able to locate the passport. Thus, the passport was not eventually produced for my inspection. In respect of the present application, however, I proceeded on the basis that the scanned document produced by the applicant was a true copy of the relevant page in his passport. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 At the hearing before me, the applicant reiterated that all five date stamps reflected the dates on which he had arrived in India. Despite my misgivings, especially having regard to the different shapes of the stamps, I assumed, in the applicant’s favour, that he was correct. As for the dates on which he had returned to Singapore during this period, the applicant informed me that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  He could not recall the dates on which he arrived back in Singapore for the 15 June 1999 and 23 June 1999 trips to India. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) As for the 30 June 1999 trip, as far as he could remember, he returned to Singapore on either 2 July 1999 or 3 July 1999. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In respect of the 4 July 1999 trip, he recalled that he returned to Singapore on 5 July 1999. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 At no time did the applicant suggest there were any other travels he undertook during this period.

Singapore on the material dates but yet chose to bring the affected charges against him. This was, according to him, evident from the fact that they had chosen to proceed on five charges which were not committed either on any of the specific dates stamped in his passport, or dates after 6 July 1999 (that being the date of his exit from Singapore as stated in the SOF). The applicant claimed that this was no coincidence and showed that the DPPs had intended to conceal from the courts the fact that he was not in Singapore on the dates of the transactions that were the subject of the affected charges.

At the first stage of the inquiry, the Chief Justice must be satisfied that there is a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for an investigation into the complaint (meaning that the evidence, if accepted, would suffice to prove the elements of the alleged misconduct in question). If a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case is found, then consideration is given at the second stage of the inquiry to whether there are any relevant factors in favour of, as well as militating against, an investigation into the alleged misconduct (at [21]–[22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 One of the factors that may be relevant at the second stage of the inquiry is whether there has been any delay in the bringing of the complaint. On this note, where the s 82A(5) application is made more than six years from the date of the alleged misconduct or, in cases involving allegations of fraud, more than six years from the date of the applicant’s discovery of the fraud, s 82A(6A) expressly affords the Chief Justice the discretion to refuse leave notwithstanding that a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case for an investigation has been made out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Thus, on the facts of the present case, in order to exercise my discretion to convene a disciplinary tribunal to investigate the complaint against the DPPs concerned, I had to be satisfied that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  there was a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for an investigation into the applicant’s complaint; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) taking into account all relevant factors, an investigation should be commenced notwithstanding that the alleged misconduct pertained to events which transpired more than 15 years ago.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 1: Whether a prime facie case had been established </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Having considered the applicant’s submissions, I found that a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for an investigation had not been established for three principal reasons.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Delay in raising inconsistency in dates</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 First, the applicant raised the issue with respect to the dates of the charges late in the day and this delay called into question the veracity of his allegation that he had not committed the acts in question under the affected charges.

Instead, his principal complaint was that the DPPs had, in seeking a sentence of preventive detention before the District Judge, resiled from an earlier representation that they would not seek a deterrent or enhanced sentence and would leave sentencing to the court (see [11] above). He also alleged that the IO had threatened his wife.

</div> is not clear from the records. However, at the hearing before me, the applicant accepted that he had not raised the matter before the District Judge or in his petition of appeal or written submissions for MA 115. He explained that he had only discovered the inconsistency in the dates after his petition of appeal and written submissions for MA 115 had already been filed, and that the first time he raised the matter was during the oral hearing of MA 115. In this regard, I note that Yong CJ had in his grounds of decision for MA 115 referred to the fact that the applicant had before him “for the first time in these proceedings, glibly claimed to have an alibi for every one of the 765 charges against him” (see <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (MA) </span>at [13]). I assume, in favour of the applicant, that this was a reference to the submission concerning the dates of the affected charges even though, as can be seen from the position the applicant took before me, (see [25]–[27] above), this could not possibly have affected every one of the 765 charges.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In any case, what is evident is that the applicant failed to mention that he did not commit some of the offences at a time when he was already challenging his conviction, namely, in his applications before the District Judge to retract his plea and in his written submissions and petition of appeal for MA 115. The fact that his attempts to retract his plea at these times were premised not on the allegation that he could not have committed some of the offences but rather on alleged promises made by the Prosecution on sentencing, suggested that his submission in respect of the former was an afterthought, raised only after his primary argument on the promises made by the Prosecution had been rejected. This undermined the credibility of the applicant’s subsequent claims that he did not carry out some or all of the transactions that were the subject of the affected charges. As to the applicant’s claim that he was not aware of the grounds supporting his “evidence-in-support of an alibi” until shortly prior to the hearing for MA 115, both the applicant and his counsel had access to all 765 of the charges as well as the SOF from the time the matter arose for determination in the District Court. If the applicant truly had not committed some of the offences, I would have expected that the issue with the dates of the affected charges would have been discovered and raised earlier by him and/or his counsel. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In addition, even if I accepted that the applicant was not in Singapore for the periods referred to above at [26], this did not lead to the conclusion that the applicant had not carried out the transactions stated in the affected charges. It was perfectly plausible that the dates of those charges were off by a day or two and did not reflect the actual date on which the applicant keyed in the credit card details of his customers into the EDC terminal. Indeed, the SOF stated that “[t]he accused would key in the credit numbers of the customers who had used Infoseek’s IDD services into the EDC and UOB Card Centre would credit the amount due into Infoseek’s UOB bank account on <span class="font-italic">the next working day</span>” [emphasis added].

By reason of the effect this has on the veracity of the material allegation, it could not safely be assumed even on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>basis, more than 15 years later, that the affected charges had been fabricated by the DPPs and knowingly brought by them without basis, just on the basis of a seeming discrepancy. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The basis of the applicant’s conviction and sentence remained unaffected</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Further, even if I accepted the applicant’s case that he did not commit the offences in question under the affected charges, there remained ample basis for the applicant’s conviction and sentence. The applicant’s submission concerned 188 <span class="font-italic">TIC charges</span>. None of the five charges proceeded against the applicant seem to have been affected (see above at [27]). Thus, the applicant’s conviction was not affected in any way. The applicant’s case, at its highest, only reduced the number of charges that should have been taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, from 760 to 572. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In relation to sentencing, the applicant argued that the sentence imposed should have been appreciably more lenient since, on his case, he had shown that a lower number of charges should have been brought against him by the Prosecution than had in fact been the case. In this regard, the applicant was operating under a misimpression that he had been sentenced to 20 years’ preventive detention on the basis that he had been <span class="font-italic">convicted</span> of 765 charges. This stemmed from a misunderstanding on the nature and effect of TIC charges. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 It is useful at this juncture to reiterate the relevant legal principles concerning TIC charges which are well established but which, when I explained these to him at the hearing, seemed to take the applicant by surprise. The starting point is s 148 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Outstanding offences</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">148.</span>—(1) If the accused is found guilty of an offence in any criminal proceedings begun by or on behalf of the Public Prosecutor, the court in determining and passing sentence may, with the consent of the prosecution and the accused, take into consideration any other outstanding offences that the accused admits to have committed.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) The High Court may, under subsection (1), take into consideration any outstanding offences an accused admits to have committed when passing sentence, notwithstanding that no transmission proceedings under Division 5 of Part X have been held in respect of those outstanding offences.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(5) After being sentenced, the accused may not, unless his conviction for the original offence under subsection (1) is set aside, be charged or tried for any such offence that the court had taken into consideration under this section.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Section 148 makes it clear that where a defendant has been found guilty of the charges proceeded against him by the Prosecution, the court <span class="font-italic">may </span>take into consideration any outstanding offences which the defendant admits to having committed in determining the appropriate sentence to impose. It bears emphasis that where a court takes into consideration outstanding offences in the course of sentencing, the court does not <span class="font-italic">convict </span>the defendant of these outstanding offences, but merely relies on the defendant’s <span class="font-italic">admission</span> to these offences as <span class="font-italic">a relevant factor</span> in determining the appropriate length of sentence. The effect of taking into consideration outstanding offences is generally to enhance the sentence that would otherwise be meted out to the defendant (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 439 at [19]). That said, a separate sentence is not imposed for each of the TIC offences and the defendant avoids a potentially longer global sentence had he instead been <span class="font-italic">convicted</span> of each of the outstanding offences, with the sentences for each ordered to run consecutively. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v UI</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (“<span class="font-italic">UI</span>”), Chan Sek Keong CJ provided a useful explanation of the rationale for and the effect of charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing as follows (at [36]–[38]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">36 … It saves the Prosecution from the necessity of proving what can be a significant number of similar offences committed by the offender. The offender, conversely, is able to protect himself from being charged on a later occasion with the TIC offences. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">He can also be fairly sure that, despite the TIC offences being considered by the sentencing court, the increase in the severity of his sentence for the offences proceeded with will be less draconian than the sentence </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">which he would have received had the Prosecution proceeded with the TIC offences as well.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">37 More often than not, when TIC offences feature in a case, the sentence for the offences proceeded with will have to be increased. As Andrew Ashworth observed in his book, <span class="font-italic">Sentencing and Criminal Justice</span> (Cambridge University Press, 4th Ed, 2005) (“<span class="font-italic">Ashworth</span>”), <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">‘</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">[t]he offences … taken into consideration do not rank as convictions, but the court is likely to increase the sentence [for the offences proceeded with] in order to take account of them’ (at pp 241–242). The TIC offences may, however, also have little or no impact on the sentence ultimately imposed for the offences proceeded with.</span> As Sir Igor Judge P stated in the English Court of Appeal case of <span class="font-italic">R v Gary Dean Miles</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>[2006] EWCA Crim 256 at [11]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[T]he way in which the court deals with offences to be taken into consideration depends on context. In some cases the offences taken into consideration will end up by adding nothing or nothing very much to the sentence which the court would otherwise impose. On the other hand, offences taken into consideration may aggravate the sentence and lead to a substantial increase in it. For example, the offences may show a pattern of criminal activity which suggests careful planning or deliberate rather than casual involvement in a crime. They may show an offence or offences committed on bail, after an earlier arrest. They may show a return to crime immediately after the offender has been before the court and given a chance that, by committing the crime, he has immediately rejected. There are many situations where similar issues may arise.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">38 Section 178(1) of the [CPC 1985] does not mandate that, where TIC offences are present, the court must increase the sentence which would normally have been imposed for the offences proceeded with in the absence of TIC offences. But, if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would be increased ... This is commonsensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance admitted that he committed those offences. This would <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span> be the case where the TIC offences and the offences proceeded with are similar in nature …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That is <span class="font-italic">not</span> to say, however, that the court <span class="font-italic">must</span> increase the sentence imposed for the offences proceeded with where TIC offences are present. As stated by Yong CJ in <span class="font-italic">PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice </span>[1998] 3 SLR(R) 439 at [19]: ‘Ultimately, it is the court’s discretion whether to consider the [TIC] offence or not.’ However, if the sentencing court decides not to consider the TIC offences as aggravating the offences proceeded with where it is clear that the former offences should be so considered and does not justify its decision in this regard, the only conclusion which can be reached by an appellate court is that the sentencing court erred in its treatment of the TIC offences.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Having regard to the above principles, it is clear in the present case that even leaving aside the affected charges, which were all TIC charges, there was ample basis for the High Court to impose the sentence it did. First, leaving aside the affected charges from the equation, there remained a very significant number of TIC charges (specifically, 572) which the applicant had admitted to and which he seemed to have no basis to challenge. As was explained in the relevant paragraphs of <span class="font-italic">UI</span> that I have cited above, TIC charges tend generally to increase the sentence imposed on the defendant because the admission by the defendant that he had committed other offences besides those of which he had been convicted is generally seen as an aggravating factor. In this case, the significant number of unaffected TIC charges, which the applicant admitted to and has not challenged before me, was more than sufficient to justify any increase in the sentence imposed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Second, and in any event, the reasons given by Yong CJ for imposing a sentence of 20 years’ preventive detention were not premised on the number of TIC charges which the applicant had admitted to. Instead, in imposing a sentence of 20 years’ preventive detention, Yong CJ took into account the following factors: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The applicant’s antecedents which revealed a criminal propensity: The applicant had appeared in court on seven previous occasions, during which time he had been convicted of or admitted to a total of 92 offences ranging from violent offences such as attempted rape and kidnapping to property offences including theft and robbery with hurt (<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (MA)</span> at [18]; see also [8] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The fact that previous sentences had evidently had little deterrent effect: This included sentences of imprisonment and corrective training (<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (MA)</span> at [23]; see also [8] above). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The applicant’s lack of remorse: This was evidenced from the fact that the applicant had to be extradited back to Singapore, and from the prison psychologist’s preventive detention suitability report, which stated that the applicant displayed a tendency to intellectualise his offending and to downplay his personal responsibility for his crimes (<span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (MA)</span> at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 It is appropriate here, to reiterate the sentencing considerations applicable to preventive detention. It is well established that the foundation of the sentence of preventive detention is the need to protect the public. This is clear from the wording of s 304(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) itself (and what was, at the time the applicant was sentenced, s 12(2) of the CPC 1985) which states that the court shall sentence the accused to preventive detention if the court is satisfied that “it is expedient for the protection of the public”. That the principal consideration in preventive detention is the protection of the public was reiterated by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Rosli bin Yassin</span> [2013] 2 SLR 831, at [11]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The overarching principle is the need <span class="font-italic">to</span><span class="font-italic"> protect the public </span>(indeed, this principle is to be found in the express language of s 12(2) of the CPC itself ... This does not mean that the situation of the individual offender is irrelevant. However, the applicable principles in this particular regard are formulated with the <span class="font-italic">public</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>interest as the central point of reference constantly in view. Put simply, if the individual offender is such a habitual offender whose situation does not admit of the possibility of his or her reform, thus constituting a menace to the public (and this would include, but is not limited to, offences involving violence), a sentence of preventive detention would be imposed on him or her for a substantial period of time in order to protect the public. As Yong Pung How CJ put it in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">PP v Wong Wing Hung </span>[1999] 3 SLR(R) 304 … at [10], the ‘sentence [of preventive detention] is meant essentially for<span class="font-italic"> habitual </span>offenders<span class="font-italic">, </span>who must be over the age of 30 years, whom the court considers to be<span class="font-italic"> beyond redemption and too recalcitrant for reformation</span>’ [emphasis added]. The court will look at the <span class="font-italic">totality</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of the offender’s previous convictions …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In a similar vein, in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Raffi bin Jelan and </span><span class="font-italic">Another</span> [2004] SGHC 120, the High Court observed (at [24]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is clear from the statutory scheme in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) … that a sentence of preventive detention is an extreme measure that is prescribed for certain classes of habitual offenders and/or potential recidivists who are viewed as being beyond the reach of conventional sentencing and its underlying <span class="font-italic">raison d’etre.</span> Preventive detention has a wholly different penological objective. The rationale for preventive sentencing is preventive control that extends beyond the parameters of conventional sentencing which requires the sentence to fit the crime. The overwhelming consideration is whether the court is satisfied in the circumstances that it is ‘expedient for the protection of the public’ that an offender be incarcerated for a protracted period. If the court forms the view that such a repeat offender by virtue of his propensity to offend may yet again do so if unchecked, there would be a compelling case for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. Such an offender by reason of his past conduct and anticipated future conduct will be viewed as having forfeited his right to be accorded the considerations and attributes peculiar to conventional sentencing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 It has also been reiterated in our case law that since a sentence of preventive detention is underpinned by the need to protect the public, it differs from a sentence of imprisonment and different considerations may apply in determining the appropriate duration and implementation of the sentence. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Perumal s/o Suppiah</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 145, Yong CJ stated (at [38]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this regard, I must reiterate my earlier exhortation in <span class="font-italic">PP v Wong Wing Hung</span> … at [10] not to confuse the concept of preventive detention and imprisonment, which are distinct sentences and are underpinned by different objectives and rationales. The former is essentially aimed at the protection of the public while the latter reflects the traditional policies of prevention, deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution. They are different in duration, character and implementation. As such, it would be a mistake to view them as fungible sentences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In the present case, it is apparent from the factors taken into account by Yong CJ in MA 115 (see [51] above) that, consistent with the sentencing objective of preventive detention, the learned Chief Justice had sentenced the applicant to 20 years’ preventive detention because he was of the view that it was necessary for the applicant to be incarcerated for a substantial period of time <span class="font-italic">for the protection of the public</span>, in the light of the applicant’s criminal propensity (see <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (MA)</span> at [21]). In this regard, the sentence of 20 years’ preventive detention was <span class="font-italic">not </span>imposed because the precise number of TIC charges which the applicant admitted to was an aggravating factor justifying an enhancement in sentence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Thus, even if I were to accept all of the applicant’s submissions concerning the affected charges, they did not in any material way affect the foundation of his conviction and sentence. This in turn undermined the applicant’s suggestion that the DPPs had <span class="font-italic">deliberately</span> fabricated these charges against him in order to secure his conviction and/or a harsher sentence, and that he had been prejudiced from the alleged misconduct. This is because the applicant’s suggestion was that the DPPs were <span class="font-italic">knowingly</span> seeking to secure a punishment against the applicant that he did not deserve. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">No evidence that DPPs were aware of inconsistency in dates</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Finally, while the applicant alleged that the DPPs knowingly and deliberately brought charges against him for acts which they knew he could not have committed as he was not in Singapore at the material time, there was no evidence at all to sustain his allegation. The applicant claimed that the DPPs had “cherry-picked” the five charges proceeded against him, by intentionally choosing to proceed on charges that had not been committed either on any of the specific dates stamped in his passport, or dates after 6 July 1999 (that being the date of his exit from Singapore as stated in the SOF). This was allegedly to suppress the error in the affected charges from the court.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The applicant’s allegation was, however, entirely speculative and there was no evidence to sustain it, beyond his subjective speculation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 It will be evident from what has been set out above at [34]–[44] that the earliest occasion the point was taken in any form was at the hearing of MA 115. This was some months <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">after </span>the charges had been filed. There is no evidence at all to suggest that at the time the DPPs in question filed the charges, prepared the SOF and decided which charges to proceed with and which to take into consideration for sentencing, they had any awareness or consciousness of the various dates on which the applicant alleges he was away from Singapore (see [23]–[25]). By the applicant’s own account, the earliest he attempted to adduce this evidence was at the hearing of MA 115, long after the charges were filed and the plea of guilt had been taken. Hence, one of the key allegations he makes in support of his complaint against the DPPs, which is that they deliberately selected the proceeded charges knowing the dates he was allegedly away is wholly without basis and must be rejected. The only remaining evidence is the apparent inconsistency between the assertion in the SOF that the applicant left Singapore on 6 July 1999 and the seeming assertion that some of the offences that were taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing were committed on or after that date (see [6] and [22] above). Leaving aside all of the foregoing points, this seems to me to be a hopeless point because on the face of the SOF and the relevant charges, this fact was equally evident to the applicant and his counsel at the material time and was never taken up by them. This is consistent either with the point having no substance at all; or having been overlooked by the applicant and his counsel. Even if it were the latter, there is no reason at all for not taking the same view in respect of the DPPs at the time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The simple fact of the matter is that there were other reasons that could explain the Prosecution’s decision to proceed on the five charges in question. In addition, there was no reason at all for the DPPs to have brought charges against the applicant for transactions which they knew the applicant did not commit. No motive has ever been suggested for such an extraordinary course. Moreover, leaving the affected charges to one side, there were many other transactions on dates the applicant was in Singapore (and which the applicant admitted to) which could sustain the conviction and sentence imposed on the applicant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 For all of these reasons, I was satisfied that the applicant had failed in establishing a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for an investigation to be made into the alleged misconduct of the DPPs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Issue 2: The implications of the applicant’s delay in bringing the complaint </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Given my finding that the applicant had failed to establish a <span class="font-italic">prime facie</span> case, there was no need for me to proceed to the second stage of the inquiry under s 82A(6) of the LPA. Nevertheless, I was satisfied that the applicant’s case would have also failed at the second stage of the inquiry given the inordinate delay in his bringing the complaint.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The issue of delay in the bringing of a complaint was considered by the Court of Three Judges in <span class="font-italic">Law Society of Singapore v Chan Chun Hwee Allan</span> [2018] 4 SLR 859 (“<span class="font-italic">Allan Chan</span>”). The analysis in that case was made in the context of the relevant LPA provisions applicable to advocates and solicitors (namely, ss 85(4A) and 85(4C)), pursuant to which leave must be obtained from the court before a complaint may be referred to the chairman of the Inquiry Panel where the complaint is brought more than six years from the alleged misconduct). The court observed that the relevant factors to be considered in determining whether leave should be granted under s 85(4C) include “the length of, and reasons for, the delay in prosecuting the matter” (at [29]). The court also explained that, in determining whether leave should be retrospectively granted where the charges against the respondent-solicitor were procedurally defective due to the failure to obtain prior leave under s 85(4C), relevant factors include “whether the further passage of time has meant that the respondent-solicitor has lost the ability to defend himself effectively and the reasons why either the leave application or the complaint itself was not brought earlier” (at [31]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In my judgment, the factors outlined by the Court of Three Judges in <span class="font-italic">Allan Chan</span>, namely, the length of the delay, reasons for the delay, and prejudice to the potential respondents arising from the delay, are equally applicable in my consideration of whether I should exercise my discretion to refuse leave under s 82A(6A), in respect of complaints against Legal Service Officers. In approaching this issue, in my judgment, a countervailing factor which should also be considered is the strength of the complaint and whether further investigation is warranted notwithstanding any delay, in order to address any potential prejudice suffered by the complainant from the misconduct and also to safeguard the integrity of the public service. It bears repeating that the LPA confers disciplinary control and jurisdiction over advocates and solicitors as well as Legal Service Officers and non-practising lawyers in order to uphold discipline to facilitate and maintain proper administration of justice (<span class="font-italic">Allan Chan</span> at [31]). Thus, in certain cases, the need to uphold the proper administration of justice, and the integrity of the public service (in cases of alleged misconduct on the part of Legal Service Officers) may well outweigh any potential prejudice caused to the individual respondent arising from the delay. Ultimately, as was noted in <span class="font-italic">Allan Chan</span> (at [31]), the court’s determination of whether it should grant leave notwithstanding the delay involves an exercise of discretion that is fact-sensitive and attuned to the circumstances before the court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 On the facts of the present case, all of the relevant factors militated against the granting of leave. Firstly, the length of the delay in the present case was significant. The events which were the subject of the alleged misconduct occurred more than 15 years ago in 2003, when the applicant was charged, convicted and sentenced for the offences. The present application was filed by the applicant only in 2019, after he had failed on several occasions in his efforts to persuade various courts to set aside his conviction and sentence on the basis of (amongst others) similar allegations to those that he has made in the present application (see <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (MA)</span>; <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (Review)</span>; <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh v Public Prosecutor </span>[2005] 1 SLR(R) 36; <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh (PTC Notes)</span>; <span class="font-italic">Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] SGCA 34).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The applicant explained that he had not been aware of the possibility of raising a complaint under s 82A of the LPA until sometime in 2012. In addition, when he learnt of the complaints mechanism under s 82A, he had attempted to but was unsuccessful in filing the papers for the application. I was prepared to accept this explanation. However, as the length of the delay in the present case was significant, I found that substantial prejudice would be occasioned to the DPPs since the delay would likely affect their recollection of the case and access to relevant records on the matter. This was a factor that pointed towards a refusal of leave.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In addition, the strength of the complaint was weak for the reasons explained above. In particular, there was a complete lack of evidence to substantiate the applicant’s case that the DPPs <span class="font-italic">knowingly and deliberately</span> fabricated the affected charges against him. There was no reason at all for the DPPs to have done so and even less given the strength of the Prosecution’s case on the charges proceeded with which the applicant did not take issue with (see above at [57]–[61]). Given the inherent weakness of the complaint, there was no overriding interest in directing a further investigation. In short, there did not appear any real basis for suggesting that the integrity of the public service had been compromised. There was also no prejudice suffered by the applicant given that, even if his allegations were accepted, they did not in any way affect either the foundation of his conviction or the sentence (see above at [45], [50]–[56]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the foregoing reasons, I found that a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case for an investigation had not been established by the applicant and that, in any case, the severe delay in the bringing of the application militated against the granting of leave to commence an investigation. I therefore dismissed the application.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon  <br/>Chief Justice</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The applicant in person.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"> </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">1     In Originating Summons No 171 of 2019 (“OS 171”), the applicant applied for leave for an investigation to be commenced into his complaint of misconduct against three Legal Service Officers, pursuant to s 82A(5) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”). The three Legal Service Officers were Deputy Public Prosecutors (“DPPs”) involved in prosecuting the applicant more than 15 years ago. <br/>

<strong>Facts</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">2     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The applicant was a director of a company (“Infoseek”) which offered </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">international long distance telephone call services. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In 2003, he pleaded guilty to and was convicted of five charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed). An additional 760 charges of cheating, which the applicant admitted to, were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The offences involved overcharging customers. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The applicant would either duplicate calls of customers to inflate their total usage, or charge customers twice for the same incurred usage. The applicant would key in the credit card number of the customer into an Electronic Draft Capture (“EDC”) terminal provided by the United Overseas Bank (“UOB”) Card Centre and the bank would credit the amount into Infoseek’s UOB bank account on the next working day.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">3     The District Judge sentenced the applicant to 12 years’ preventive detention. The Prosecution filed Magistrate’s Appeal No 115 of 2003 (“MA 115”) on the basis that the sentence imposed by the District Judge was manifestly inadequate. The applicant cross-appealed, claiming that the sentence was excessive. In MA 115, Yong Pung How CJ allowed the Prosecution’s appeal and enhanced the applicant’s sentence to a term of 20 years’ preventive detention. The applicant is currently serving his sentence. <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">4     After the appeal was concluded, the applicant filed a number of criminal applications in an attempt to reopen his conviction and sentence. All of these applications had been dismissed by the courts. Following the dismissal of his criminal applications, the applicant filed OS 171 in February 2019.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In OS 171, the applicant claimed that the DPPs fabricated certain charges against him which had been taken into consideration by the court for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC charges”). He claimed that he could not have committed some of the TIC charges as he was not in Singapore at the material time. The applicant relied mainly on (a) the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) which stated that the applicant had left Singapore for India on 6 July 1999; and (b) a scanned copy of a page in his passport showing five date stamps, which he claimed reflected the dates on which he had <em>arrived</em> in India. The applicant contended that the DPPs were aware of his absence from Singapore on the material dates and yet chose to bring the relevant TIC charges against him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">6     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Although the applicant had not produced his passport for inspection, for the purposes of OS 171, the Chief Justice proceeded on the basis that the scanned document produced by the applicant was a true copy of the relevant page in his passport.  In addition, although some of the dates on the stamps were not entirely clear, and it was also not clear what the stamps were meant to signify (for instance, if the stamps reflected entry <em>and </em>exit stamps given their different shapes), the Chief Justice assumed in the applicant’s favour that the applicant was correct in asserting that the stamps reflected the dates on which he had arrived in India (at <strong>[23]–[24]</strong>). Taking the applicant’s case at its highest, </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">188 of the TIC charges (“the affected charges”) involved transactions which occurred on dates when the applicant was supposedly not in Singapore. None of the five charges proceeded against the applicant were affected (at <strong>[27]</strong>).<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Decision of the Chief Justice</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">7     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The Chief Justice dismissed OS 171. It was found that (a) a <em>prima facie</em> case for an investigation had not been established by the applicant; and (b) in any case, the severe delay in the bringing of the application militated against the granting of leave to commence an investigation.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">8     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The Chief Justice found that a <em>prima facie</em> case for an investigation had not been established for three principal reasons. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(a) Delay in raising inconsistency in dates</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">9     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">First, the applicant raised the issue with respect to the dates of the charges late in the day and this delay called into question the veracity of his allegation that he had not committed the acts in question under the affected charges. Before the District Judge, the applicant did not claim that he had not committed the acts under some of the charges. The applicant’s principal complaint then was that the DPPs had, in seeking a sentence of preventive detention, resiled from an earlier representation that they would not seek a deterrent or enhanced sentence and would leave sentencing to the court (at <strong>[35]</strong>). This was rejected by the District Judge. The applicant accepted that he had not raised the matter concerning the dates of the affected charges before the District Judge or in his petition of appeal or written submissions for MA 115, and that the first time he raised the matter was during the oral hearing of MA 115 (at <strong>[41]</strong>). The delay undermined the credibility of the applicant’s subsequent claims that he did not carry out some or all of the transactions that were the subject of the affected charges. If the applicant truly had not committed some of the offences, the issue with the dates of the affected charges would have been discovered and raised earlier by him and/or his counsel (at <strong>[42]</strong>). </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">10     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In addition, even if it was accepted that the applicant was not in Singapore on the dates of the affected charges, this did not lead to the conclusion that the applicant had not carried out the transactions stated in the affected charges. It was perfectly plausible that the dates of those charges were off by a day or two and did not reflect the actual date on which the applicant keyed in the credit card details of his customers into the EDC terminal (at <strong>[43]</strong>). If the issue had been raised by the applicant timeously, the point could and would have been resolved quickly with recourse to the records. It could not safely be assumed even on a <em>prima facie</em> basis, more than 15 years later, that the affected charges had been fabricated by the DPPs (at <strong>[44]</strong>). <br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(b) The basis of the applicant's conviction and sentence remained unaffected</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">11     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Second, even if the applicant’s case that he did not commit the offences in question under the affected charges were accepted, there remained ample basis for the applicant’s conviction and sentence. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">12     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The applicant’s conviction was not affected in any way</span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">(at <strong>[45]</strong>). This is because the applicant’s submission concerned 188 <em>TIC charges</em>. None of the five charges proceeded against the applicant seemed to have been affected. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Where a court takes into consideration outstanding offences in the course of sentencing, the court does not <em>convict </em>the defendant of these outstanding offences, but merely relies on the defendant’s <em>admission</em> to these offences as <em>a relevant factor</em> in determining the appropriate length of sentence (at <strong>[48]</strong>).</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">13     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The basis of the applicant’s sentence also remained unaffected. Leaving aside the affected charges from the equation, there remained a very significant number of TIC charges (specifically, 572) which the applicant had admitted to and which he seemed to have no basis to challenge. </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The significant number of unaffected TIC charges was more than sufficient to justify any increase in the sentence imposed (at <strong>[50]</strong>). I</span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">n any event, the reasons given by Yong CJ for imposing a sentence of 20 years’ preventive detention were not premised on the number of TIC charges which the applicant had admitted to. Yong CJ had sentenced the applicant to 20 years’ preventive detention because he was of the view that it was necessary for the applicant to be incarcerated for a substantial period of time for the protection of the public, in the light of the applicant’s criminal propensity (at <strong>[55]</strong>). <br/>
<br/>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(c) No evidence that DPPs were aware of inconsistency in dates</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">14     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Third, while the applicant alleged that the DPPs knowingly and deliberately brought charges against him for acts which they knew he could not have committed as he was not in Singapore at the material time, there was no evidence at all to sustain his allegation (at <strong>[57]</strong>). </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">There was no evidence to suggest that at the time the DPPs filed the charges, prepared the SOF and decided which charges to proceed with and which to take into consideration for sentencing, they had any awareness of the various dates on which the applicant alleged he was away from Singapore (at <strong>[59]</strong>). In addition, t</span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">here was no reason at all for the DPPs to have brought charges against the applicant for transactions which they knew the applicant did not commit. No motive was suggested for such an extraordinary course. Moreover, leaving the affected charges to one side, there were many other transactions on dates the applicant was in Singapore (and which the applicant admitted to) which could sustain the conviction and sentence imposed on the applicant (at <strong>[60]</strong>).<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>The implications of the applicant's delay in bringing the complaint</strong></em></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">15     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">W</span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">here an application for leave to commence an investigation into alleged misconduct on the part of Legal Service Officers is made more than six years from the date of the alleged misconduct, s 82A(6A) of the LPA expressly affords the Chief Justice the discretion to refuse leave notwithstanding that a <em>prima facie </em>case for an investigation has been made out (at <strong>[31]</strong>). In this case, </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">a <em>prima facie</em> case for an investigation had <em>not</em> been established. In any event, the severe delay in the bringing of the application militated against the granting of leave to commence an investigation. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">16     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">The relevant factors which would be considered by the Chief Justice in determining if leave should be refused under </span><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">s 82A(6A) include the length of the delay, reasons for the delay, and prejudice to the potential respondents arising from the delay. A countervailing factor which would also be considered is the strength of the complaint and whether further investigation is warranted notwithstanding any delay, in order to address any potential prejudice suffered by the complainant from the misconduct and also to safeguard the integrity of the public service (at <strong>[64]</strong>).</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">17     <span style="font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">On the facts of the present case, all of the relevant factors militated against the granting of leave. The length of the delay (more than 15 years) was significant and substantial prejudice would be occasioned on the DPPs since the delay would likely affect their recollection of the case and access to relevant records on the matter (at <strong>[66]</strong>). In addition, the strength of the complaint was weak. There was a complete lack of evidence to substantiate the applicant’s case that the DPPs knowingly and deliberately fabricated the affected charges against him. Thus, there was no overriding interest in directing a further investigation as there was no real basis for suggesting that the integrity of the public service had been compromised. There was also no prejudice suffered by the applicant given that, even if his allegations were accepted, they did not in any way affect either the foundation of his conviction or the sentence (at <strong>[67]</strong>).</span></span></p>
