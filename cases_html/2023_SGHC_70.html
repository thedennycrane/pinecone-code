On 10 April 2017, while recovering from surgery on her broken right leg in Jurong Community Hospital (“<span class="font-weight-bold">JCH</span>”), she fell and fractured her other leg. She brought an action for damages against the respondent, National University Health Services Group Pte Ltd (the <span class="font-weight-bold">“respondent”</span>), which owns and manages JCH. Following a three-day trial in DC/DC 890/2020, the learned District Judge (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">DJ</span>”) dismissed her claim. This is her appeal against that decision. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 I allow the appeal for the reasons below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 On 12 March 2017, Mdm Pappa was admitted to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (“<span class="font-weight-bold">NTFGH</span>”). She had fallen at home and suffered a fracture of her right thigh bone. She underwent a right hip fixation with dynamic hip screw surgery the next day. Mdm Pappa’s recovery at NTFGH was uneventful. She was assessed as a patient at risk of falling and underwent daily physiotherapy and occupation therapy sessions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Mdm Pappa was assessed to require rehabilitative care. On 20 March 2017, she was transferred to JCH, where she was placed in an eight-bed ward. On or around 28 March 2017, she developed an infection and was transferred to a single-bed isolation ward (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Room</span>”). She was also assessed as a patient at risk of falling throughout the duration of her stay at JCH. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 In the Room, there was a single bed (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Bed</span>”), an emergency call bell (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Bell</span>”), a geriatric chair, a chair for visitors (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Visitor’s Chair</span>”) and a table on rollers of an adjustable height (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Table</span>”). There was also a toilet within the Room (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Toilet</span>”). Two doors separated the Room from the corridor of the ward – a first door which opened into a smaller room (for the purposes of preparing to enter, and cleaning up after exiting, the Room) and then a second door to enter the Room. When Mdm Pappa was in the Room, she was not visible to the nursing staff outside the Room. Neither was there any close-circuit television (“<span class="font-weight-bold">CCTV</span>”) in the Room. Her only means of communicating with the nursing staff was via the Bell. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mdm Pappa’s fall </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On 10 April 2017, just before 8am, Patient Care Assistant Ms Myat Swe Zin Myint (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Ms </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Myat</span>”) entered the Room to assist Mdm Pappa with her morning hygiene routine. Mdm Pappa’s breakfast was also brought in and placed on the Table.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 After Ms Myat left the Room, at about 8.35am, Staff Nurse Ms Hou Wenfeng (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Ms</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Hou</span>”) entered the Room on her medication rounds. When she entered the Room, Mdm Pappa was seated in the Visitor’s Chair with the Table (and her breakfast) in front of her. Ms Hou gave Mdm Pappa her medication and left. No one entered the Room thereafter until after Mdm Pappa fell.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 A few minutes after Ms Hou left, Mdm Pappa attempted to get out of the Visitor’s Chair on her own but fell (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Fall</span>”). Mdm Pappa crawled to the Bed and managed to press the Bell. JCH’s records show that the Bell was activated at 8.53am. What happened after Mdm Pappa was attended to is not disputed: she was carried back on to the Bed, her vital signs were checked and a doctor reviewed her condition. Mdm Pappa’s children, Ms V Tamilselvi d/o Veeramuthu (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Ms</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Tamilselvi</span>”) and Mr V Thiruchelvam (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Mr</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Thiruchelvam</span>”), were contacted and went to JCH. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Mdm Pappa was found to have suffered a sub-trochanteric fracture of the left femur and underwent surgery on 11 April 2017. On 18 April 2017, she was transferred to St Luke’s Hospital for rehabilitation, and thereafter, arrangements were made for her to attend reviews at the Specialist Outpatient and Orthopaedic Clinics at NTFGH and physiotherapy sessions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The parties’ respective accounts of what happened in the Room (a) when Ms Myat and Ms Hou were there; and (b) between the time Ms Hou left the Room and the time Mdm Pappa suffered the Fall, diverge in material aspects. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Mdm Pappa’s claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Mdm Pappa’s case is that after Ms Myat had assisted her with her morning routine, Ms Myat brought her to the Visitor’s Chair to have her breakfast, which was placed on the Table in front of her. The Visitor’s Chair was approximately one metre away from the Bed. At about 8.35am, Ms Hou entered the Room to give Mdm Pappa her medication, saw Mdm Pappa seated in the Visitor’s Chair and left the Room without checking whether the Bell was within Mdm Pappa’s reach. Mdm Pappa started to experience immense and unbearable pain in her back. The Bell was out of her reach. She tried to shout for help, but no one came to her aid. As she did not know when the nursing staff would next enter the Room, she decided to move to the Bed on her own. In doing so, she lost her balance and fell. She cried out in pain but no one came to her aid. She managed to crawl to the Bell and pressed it. She was attended to by the nursing staff after about 10 to 15 minutes. At about 10.40am, she gave an account of the Fall to a doctor reviewing her case, with Mr Thiruchelvam acting as her interpreter as she could not speak English. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Mdm Pappa pleaded a myriad of breaches on the part of the respondent. She claimed that: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The respondent and/or its employees, servants and/or agents had been negligent and breached their duty of care owed to her, by failing to render reasonable medical and/or nursing care. This failure was a consequence of their: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) failing to take any or any reasonable care to ensure that there was proper and effective supervision and/or monitoring of her;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) failing to take any or any reasonable steps to monitor her at regular intervals to ensure that she was comfortable and not in pain;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) failing to “have known or ought to have known” that she would not have been able to sit in the Visitor’s Chair for a prolonged period of time, which was approximately 50 minutes, without feeling any pain;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iv) failing to take any or any timely action to assist her out of the Visitor’s Chair and onto the Bed;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(v) negligently allowing her to be able to transfer herself from the Visitor’s Chair to the Bed without any assistance from the respondent and/or its agents, employees and/or servants;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vi) failing to observe that she suffered the Fall;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(vii) failing to ensure that the Bell was within her reach;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(viii) failing to take any or any timely action once she pressed the Bell for help after she had suffered the Fall;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ix) failing to take any or any timely action to assist her off the floor after she suffered the Fall;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(x) failing to manage, control, take appropriate measures or in any way do whatever was reasonably necessary to ensure her safety and to ensure that she did not suffer the Fall during her period of hospitalisation at the respondent’s hospital;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(xi) failing to have a safe system in place to ensure that she did not suffer the Fall;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(xii) failing to have in place and/or to comply with appropriate protocols, standard operating procedures and/or guidelines to ensure the safety of patients and prevent them from suffering falls, especially in the case of elderly patients who are cared for in single-bed isolation rooms, such as the Room, and are noted to be high fall-risk patients, such as herself;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(xiii) failing to take adequate steps to ensure that she did not suffer any injuries during her hospitalisation at the respondent’s hospital;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(xiv) failing to provide appropriate medical and/or nursing care, treatment and/or advice to her at the respondent’s hospital;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(xv) failing to provide a safe environment for her; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(xvi) in these circumstances, negligently exposing her to a risk of a fall, which they knew or ought to have known might occur, and any injuries that would arise as a result of a fall.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res </span><span class="font-italic">ipsa loqitar</span> applied.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The respondent had breached the contract it had with her, by: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) failing to render reasonable and good medical and/or nursing treatment, care and advice to her; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) causing and/or failing to take appropriate measures to prevent the Fall. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The respondent’s defence </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The respondent’s case is that at about 7.40am, Ms Myat helped Mdm Pappa with her toileting and hygiene needs in the Toilet. Ms Myat then, at Mdm Pappa’s request, assisted her to sit upright on the Bed, with her legs over the side, to have breakfast. Ms Myat placed the Table with the breakfast in front of Mdm Pappa. After checking that the Bell was within Mdm Pappa’s reach, Ms Myat left the Room. Later, at about 8.35am, Ms Hou entered the Room to give Mdm Pappa her medication. She saw Mdm Pappa seated in the Visitor’s Chair, with the Table in front of her. It is the respondent’s case that Mdm Pappa must have made her own way from the Bed to the Visitor’s Chair. Ms Hou ensured that Mdm Pappa consumed her medication. She decided to leave Mdm Pappa seated in the Visitor’s Chair as she appeared comfortable and did not complain of any pain. She checked that the Bell was within Mdm Pappa’s reach and left the Room. Mdm Pappa then tried to move to the Bed on her own, which she knew she should not have done. She could have asked for assistance by using the Bell but failed to do so. The nurses and staff also responded to Mdm Pappa within a reasonable time – Mdm Pappa was attended to at around 9am after the Bell was activated at 8.53am. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The respondent therefore maintains that it was neither negligent nor in breach of its contract with Mdm Pappa. It argued that it had put in place adequate fall protection measures to minimise Mdm Pappa’s risk of falling at JCH. However, these required the cooperation and compliance of Mdm Pappa. In this instance, Mdm Pappa neither tried to call for assistance using the Bell to move from the Visitor’s Chair to the Bed, nor informed Ms Hou about her alleged back pain which precipitated her attempt to self-ambulate. Accordingly, the Fall was not caused or contributed to by any breach on the respondent’s part. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The respondent further argues that Mdm Pappa was contributorily negligent for:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) moving from the Bed to the Visitor’s Chair on her own without calling for assistance;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) failing to inform Ms Hou, or any of the respondent’s staff, that she was in pain or discomfort while sitting in the Visitor’s Chair and/or that she wanted to be assisted from the Visitor’s Chair back to the Bed;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) failing to use the Bell to call for nursing assistance before attempting to move from the Visitor’s Chair to the Bed on her own, even though the Bell was visible and within her reach at the material time; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) failing to adhere to the nurses’ instructions not to ambulate on her own without calling for nursing assistance.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The DJ’s main findings of fact, as set out in his Grounds of Decision (“<span class="font-weight-bold">GD</span>”) issued on 28 November 2022, are as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Mdm Pappa failed to show on a balance of probabilities that the Visitor’s Chair was one metre away from the Bed at the time of the Fall.

Accordingly, I consider the issues in the appeal through these broad questions: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Could Mdm Pappa self-ambulate?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Was the Bell within Mdm Pappa’s reach while she was seated in the Visitor’s Chair? </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Why was Mdm Pappa permitted to remain seated in the Visitor’s Chair?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Why did Mdm Pappa try to move back to the Bed on her own?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The DJ based his findings on both the objective evidence as well as the credibility of the witnesses. In my view, the credibility of the factual witnesses is suspect at differing points and in different ways, which I explain more fully below. Accordingly, I will approach each issue by first analysing the objective evidence, before considering the witness testimony. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Could Mdm Pappa self-ambulate?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 This issue is comprehensively covered by the objective evidence, against which the oral evidence of the witnesses can be tested. It also sets the context for the dispute – Mdm Pappa’s claim is premised on her being <span class="font-italic">forced</span> to attempt self-ambulation because she was in unbearable pain and was unable to reach the Bell. In contrast, the respondent claims that the Fall was a consequence of Mdm Pappa voluntarily deciding to move without assistance from the Visitor’s Chair to the Bed when she knew that she ought not do so.

In this regard, the evidence would likely have been available – she had been undergoing physiotherapy at JCH and had had attending doctors – but the respondent chose not to lead any. The respondent’s only evidence was via Ms Myat, but very little weight should be given to this, for reasons I explain later at [44]–[46], [64], [105] and [106].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Likewise, the DJ’s reliance on Ms Tamilselvi’s evidence of Mdm Pappa’s expected discharge date was misplaced.

</div> It was not contended by her counsel that this was accurate and such scenarios were not put to the respondent’s witnesses.

The respondent submits, on appeal, that Mdm Pappa was able to self-ambulate because the nursing records for the days leading up to the Fall show that she had been “Able to turn self”, that she had “Self regulated” and required “Minimal assist”.

For the reasons above, and given her very limited interaction with Mdm Pappa, her opinion is unsubstantiated and speculative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In this regard, Ms Myat’s evidence should also be treated with caution. It is undisputed that Ms Hou found Mdm Pappa seated in the Visitor’s Chair after Ms Myat had left the Room. Ms Myat’s own evidence was that it was wrong and risky for Mdm Pappa to be seated in the Visitor’s Chair. This was consistent with Ms Kaur’s evidence that the Visitor’s Chair was not for patients, and the respondent’s own internal regulations that patients should be properly supported when seated. I elaborate on this below (see [68]). It was therefore in Ms Myat’s interests to testify that she had not seated Mdm Pappa in the Visitor’s Chair, and that Mdm Pappa was capable of self-ambulating. In this regard, I also note that Ms Myat volunteered that Mdm Pappa had been able to self-ambulate from the Bed to the Visitor Chair despite the fact that (a) she did not give any evidence as to the position of the Visitor Chair when she was in the Room; and (b) she would not have known, on her own evidence, how far Mdm Pappa had been seated from the Bed.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In the circumstances, the evidence leads to the conclusion, on the balance of probabilities, that Mdm Pappa could not self-ambulate from the Bed to the Visitor’s Chair. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The next question is whether she <span class="font-italic">would </span>have tried to move on her own.

As stated above, the undisputed evidence was that Mdm Pappa always followed instructions given to her throughout her stay at JCH, whether they were from the respondent’s staff or her family members. She was reminded time and again to call the nurses using the Bell if she needed any assistance. The objective evidence was that she used the Bell 309 times over 21 days leading up to the Fall.

As stated above, the respondent’s solicitors avoided answering Mdm Pappa’s solicitors’ questions on this. Indeed, none of the respondent’s witnesses were asked if the photographs provided an accurate representation of the Room. The respondent also did not put to both Ms Tamilselvi and Mr Thiruchelvam that the photographs were an accurate representation of the Room, as it declined to cross-examine them. It is therefore unclear whether the dimensions of the Room and the rooms in the photographs are the same, and if not, how they differ. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Second, and more fundamentally, the photographs are not relevant to the position of the Visitor’s Chair <span class="font-italic">at the material time</span>.

</div> Even taking the DJ’s approach of reasoning from the relative positions of the sink, curtains surrounding the Bed and the Toilet door to deduce the distance between the Visitor’s Chair and the Bed, the position of the Visitor’s Chair next to the Bed as depicted in the photographs is also not logical as it would block access to the bedside drawers.

The location of the Visitor’s Chair at the time of the Fall should therefore not be determined by the relative positions of the curtains, sink and the door of the Toilet, and certainly not by looking at photographs of a different room.

</div> It is unsafe to draw this conclusion. First, Ms Myat and Ms Hou were not independent witnesses – they each had a personal incentive to testify as they did. If they had not left the Bell within reach, that would have constituted a breach of their duties. Second, and significantly, Ms Myat did not, and could not, give any evidence as to whether the Bell was within Mdm Pappa’s reach when she was seated in the Visitor’s Chair since, on the respondent’s case, Mdm Pappa had self-ambulated to the Visitor’s Chair after Ms Myat left the Room. Further, while the DJ characterised Mdm Pappa’s evidence that the Bell had not been within her reach as a bare assertion, the same could be said of Ms Hou’s evidence as well. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I therefore test the evidence of both parties against the objective evidence on what transpired between Mdm Pappa and Ms Hou when the latter was in the Room. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Why was Mdm Pappa permitted to remain seated in the Visitor’s Chair?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In my view, this is the most important issue as it deals with what happened just before the Fall.

Her answer is worth reproducing: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q Ms Hou, would you have administered this plaster if not for a complaint from the patient that she was experiencing pain on her back?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A I can recall the time I never really noticed the patient complained of pain or on her back, but she just request the plaster, I just give.

</div> Second, even her own answer, taken on its face, appeared to refer to patients who already have plasters applied on them and are asking for more. Third, how would Ms Hou know <span class="font-italic">where</span> to apply the Plasters, in this case, Mdm Pappa’s right knee and middle back, unless Mdm Pappa specifically informed her of the areas where she was suffering pain? As stated above, the undisputed evidence was that Ketoprofen plasters are applied where the patient is experiencing pain. Fourth, according to the respondent’s records, this appeared to be the first time Ketoprofen 30mg plasters were applied to Mdm Pappa’s back, specifically; the respondent’s records make clear that Ketoprofen 30mg plasters had previously been administered but do not specify locations for those instances.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In fact, a closer look at Ms Hou’s evidence reflects an attempt to distance herself from the implications of her application of the Plasters on Mdm Pappa.

</div> This response is questionable – as counsel for Mdm Pappa submitted, there was no reason for Ms Hou to have placed the Plasters on Mdm Pappa’s back if she had not been suffering back pain. Ms Kaur’s evidence (at [75] above) supports this submission. Ms Hou’s attempt to explain away the application of the Plasters is suggestive of evasion. My finding that Mdm Pappa had experienced and informed the respondent of some pain is not, in my view, affected by Mdm Pappa’s evidence that she had not told any nurses or doctors about her back pain.

Mr Thiruchelvam’s evidence was that Mdm Pappa had informed the doctor that after she was left seated in the Visitor’s Chair, she began to suffer unbearable back pain, tried to get up from the Visitor’s Chair to go to the Bed to rest, but fell; Mdm Pappa had also told the doctor that the Bell was not within her reach and she was therefore unable to call for assistance.

Mdm Pappa was an elderly, uneducated woman who had been through a traumatic and difficult period. By the time she gave evidence, she was 79 years old and it had been about four years since the Fall. Further, as a result of the Fall, her life had been affected considerably for the worse – she was no longer able to be independent and enjoy her usual activities. In the time between the Fall and her evidence, she lost her husband, who she had been caring for on account of his dementia. Her testimony also evidenced confusion and a failing memory, which make her contemporaneous account – which the DJ disregarded – all the more important. What came out clearly from her testimony was that she held the respondent responsible not only for her fall, but also the failure to respond promptly to her activation of the Bell, thereby leaving her on the floor in agony, in her mind, for a long time – I deal with this issue in the section below. Her impression was that the respondent’s staff were irritated by her constant use of the Bell and she also believed that the respondent would fabricate documents against her – her answers during cross-examination betrayed her dislike and suspicions of the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 A clear example of the DJ’s mischaracterisation of her evidence is his finding that her claim to be suffering from back pain was an afterthought and was concocted. This is unwarranted and fails to take into account relevant evidence, including objective evidence that she had suffered from back pain before the Fall (at [75] above). The DJ also failed to consider that Mdm Pappa had narrated a version of events largely consistent with the material aspects of her case less than two hours after the Fall, while she had been in great pain (at [91] above). It is therefore not the case that Mdm Pappa came to court, after obtaining legal advice, with a version of events which would increase her prospects of obtaining judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 In addition, where Mdm Pappa gave evidence that was incorrect or did not make sense, they appear to be on account of confusion and not dishonesty:

</div> This suggests confusion on her part. In any event, as stated above, the fact that she had gone to the Toilet with assistance does not undermine her case that she could not, and would not, ambulate independently. In fact, as the DJ himself observed, Mdm Pappa’s allegation that the respondent fabricated the records of her toilet use had no bearing on the Fall.

Indeed, the extracts only show confusion on Mdm Pappa’s part. Second, it has always been Mdm Pappa’s case, and it is undisputed by the respondent, that she had dutifully followed instructions to press the bell when she had needed assistance. Her denial in the extracts does not change that position or improve her case. Third, there is in fact no record of how long the respondent’s nurses had taken to respond to Mdm Pappa’s call after the Fall,

</div> Ms Hou did not refer to this document in her evidence. It is also not relevant since, first, Ms Hou was not the first nurse who had attended to Mdm Pappa and EN Jane was not called and no evidence was led from her as to when she had discovered that Mdm Pappa had fallen. Second, Ms Hou’s statement that Mdm Pappa had fallen at 9am is inaccurate since Mdm Pappa must have suffered the Fall before 8.53am, when she had pressed the Bell for assistance. Finally, the Progress Note does not say that Mdm Pappa had been attended to at 9am. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114  The respondent’s records do not show how long the respondent took to respond to Mdm Pappa’s activation of the Bell at 8:53am. The respondent’s system is designed such that it will record the time a bell is activated, and when a staff member attends to the patient and terminates the alarm. There is, however, one significant limitation: Ms Kaur testified that the system will not record the time taken to respond if it exceeds 5 minutes and 30 seconds from the time of activation – where the records state “Cancelled By: Escalation timeout”, the respondent can only say that the call bell was responded to <span class="font-italic">after</span> 5 minutes and 30 seconds.

The purpose of the Bell is for Mdm Pappa to seek assistance when she needed it, including for emergencies. Considering that she was an elderly, fall-risk patient in an isolation room with no visibility from the outside and with no other patients around to assist her, it is incredible for the respondent to maintain that the onus was on Mdm Pappa to press the Bell multiple times in quick succession to get timely assistance. It completely ignores the very real possibility that her situation may be such that she could only press the Bell once. It was also not in evidence that Mdm Pappa had been told to press the Bell multiple times in an emergency. Indeed, the respondent’s argument only suggests that Mdm Pappa could and would have been attended to sooner, had she pressed the bell repeatedly.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether the respondent had breached its duty of care to Mdm Pappa </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 For the reasons above, I find that the respondent did, by (a) leaving Mdm Pappa in the Visitor’s Chair and failing to move her to the Bed despite knowing that she was suffering pain in her back; and (b) failing to ensure the Bell was within her reach, breach its duty of care owed to Mdm Pappa. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable standard of care </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 It is not disputed that the respondent owed a duty to take reasonable steps to minimise Mdm Pappa’s risk of falls during her admission at JCH.

</div> The only issue in contention is the standard of care. In my view, considering that Mdm Pappa was an elderly fall-risk patient who suffered giddiness, was unable to self-ambulate and occupied an isolation room with no visibility from outside the Room (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from the ward), the standard of care required that (a) Mdm Pappa should not have been allowed to occupy the Visitor’s Chair, particularly in circumstances where she was suffering pain; and (b) the Bell should have been placed within her reach. I elaborate on each limb below.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 First, the standard of care owed by the respondent to Mdm Pappa required that the respondent should have ensured that Mdm Pappa had been seated, if not on the Bed, then on the geriatric chair. Given that Mdm Pappa was recovering from surgery, elderly and seated for the first time on the Visitor’s Chair which was not suitable for her use, there was a reasonably foreseeable risk that she would suffer discomfort or pain or not be adequately supported. In these circumstances, the respondent should not, in the first place, have allowed her to be seated in the Visitor’s Chair, which provides no safety features and is hence riskier. Furthermore, given that she had been in an isolation ward and had not been constantly monitored, it was also foreseeable that when she in fact started suffering discomfort or pain, she could not directly and immediately seek assistance from the respondent. While this would, to a significant extent, be mitigated by having the Bell within reach, this was not the case here. Accordingly, the respondent should have taken precautions: when Mdm Pappa had made known to Ms Hou that she was suffering some pain, Ms Hou should have moved Mdm Pappa to either the Bed or the geriatric chair. This is also prescribed by the Manual (at [68] above) and the respondent’s witnesses testified to the same effect (Ms Kaur at [71]; Ms Myat at [72] above). In fact, Ms Hou herself gave evidence that, if a patient experienced back pain, she would have transferred the patient back to their bed because it would be more comfortable “as well as much more safer for the patient”.

</div> Clearly, regardless of whether Mdm Pappa expressly asked to be moved back to the Bed, the respondent ought to have moved her to the Bed, particularly as soon as it was aware that she suffered pain. Second, for the same reasons above, the respondent had to, in order to meet its standard of care, have ensured that the Bell was at all times within Mdm Pappa’s reach. Mdm Pappa could only have asked for help by pressing the Bell, since she could neither shout nor gesture in order to get attention. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that a key plank of the respondent’s case is that Mdm Pappa had been a cooperative patient who had no difficulty pressing the Bell: indeed, this was a reason cited by the respondent’s witnesses to explain why it was not necessary that a nurse, family member or caregiver remain with Mdm Pappa at all times and why she did not need to be moved from the Visitor’s Chair to the Bed.

</div> Indeed, the respondent itself appears to acknowledge that placing the Bell within Mdm Pappa’s reach was crucial to their meeting the standard of care required of them.

The evidence suggests that, but for the respondent allowing Mdm Pappa to remain seated in the Visitor’s Chair and failing to ensure that the Bell was within her reach, Mdm Pappa would not have suffered the Fall. However, the issue of whether Mdm Pappa is to some, if any, degree responsible, by choosing to attempt self-ambulation, goes to the issue of contributory negligence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125  I therefore overturn the DJ’s verdict dismissing Mdm Pappa’s claim.
