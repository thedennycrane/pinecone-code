        V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of decision of
                the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal relates to a decision by a High
                    Court judge (“the Judge”) who found the main contractor of a
                    construction project at Biopolis Drive/Biomedical Grove solely liable in
                    negligence for the collapse of a crane into a concealed manhole at the worksite.
                    At the hearing, we decided to allow the appeal in part and re-apportion the
                    liability between the main contractor and the subcontractor. We now give the
                    grounds for our decision, which includes discussion of important issues
                    pertaining to the legal responsibility for worksite safety, the relationship
                    between the statutory framework and common law duties and the applicable
                    standard of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant, Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd
                    (“JPW”), was appointed by Crescendas Bionix Pte Ltd
                    (“Crescendas”) the main management contractor to build a
                    seven-storey multi-user business park development at a worksite located off
                    Biopolis Drive/Biopolis Grove (“the worksite”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first respondent, Moh Seng Cranes Pte. Ltd.
                    (“Moh Seng”), is in the business of letting out lifting cranes for
                    hire. It was the owner of the damaged lifting crane WB 2032L
                    (“crane”) and employer of one Lian Lam Hoe (“Lian”)
                    who was operating the crane when the accident occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The second respondent, Hup Hin Transport Co Pte
                    Ltd (“Hup Hin”), leases heavy equipment, including lifting cranes.
                    It had a rental agreement dated 3 March 2010 with JPW for the supply of
                    cranes to the worksite on a per call basis (“crane supply
                    contract”) and a hiring contract dated 7 August 2008 with Moh Seng
                    to hire Moh Seng’s mobile cranes whenever required (“hiring
                    contract”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The third respondent, MA Builders Pte Ltd
                    (“MA”), had various subcontracts (<em>viz</em>, the Temporary Works Subcontract dated 13 August 2008,
                    the RC Subcontract dated 30 June 2009, the External Works Subcontract dated
                    5 January 2010 and the Wet Trades Subcontract dated 13 January 2010)
                    (collectively, “subcontracts”) with the Appellant to carry out
                    structural, architectural and external works on the worksite. The flow chart
                    below helps to illustrate the various relationships:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 10 June 2010, MA made a request to JPW
                    for a mobile crane to lift some steel rebars. JPW in turn then requested a
                    50-tonne mobile crane from Hup Hin to be delivered to the worksite the next day.
                    MA asserted that they had actually made a request for an 80-tonne mobile crane,
                    not a 50-tonne mobile crane, and received no satisfactory reason from JPW why a
                    50-tonne crane was ordered instead. JPW disputed this. Nevertheless, as Hup Hin
                    did not have any 50-tonne cranes immediately available for hire, Hup Hin hired
                    one from Moh Seng, on the basis that it would be delivered to the worksite the
                    next morning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 11 June 2010, Lian drove the crane to
                    the worksite. Upon arrival, he was directed by Kolanjiapan Sunder, the lifting
                    supervisor (“Lifting Supervisor”) employed by MA, to park the
                    crane at a designated location identified as “CL2” on the sitemap
                    used in the proceedings below. CL2 was the location where the manhole was at.
                    Lian raised concerns with the Lifting Supervisor that the designated location
                    might be unable to take the weight of the crane. The Lifting Supervisor
                    responded by assuring him that the ground comprised of hard flooring that could
                    support the crane’s weight. Lian, nevertheless, continued to harbour
                    concerns about the ground conditions and conveyed this to JPW’s Safety
                    Officer, Kuah Teck Heng (“JPW’s Safety Officer”).
                    JPW’s Safety Officer, after conferring with the Lifting Supervisor,
                    reassured Lian that the ground indeed comprised of hard flooring.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Relying on these assurances,
                    Lian proceeded to deploy the crane in accordance with the instructions given by
                    the Lifting Supervisor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       During the course of lifting at CL2, part of the
                    crane collapsed into a concealed manhole in the following manner: while the
                    crane’s left back outrigger was resting near the manhole, the boom of the
                    crane swung from the left front of the crane towards the left back outrigger.
                    The left back outrigger broke through the manhole cover and collapsed into the
                    manhole, causing the crane to topple over. The parties all denied having
                    knowledge of the manhole’s existence at the material time, and the manhole
                    itself was not visible as it had been covered up with layers of brown soil when
                    the accident occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Judge confined his analysis to the following
                    three issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether Moh Seng had a claim against
                        Hup Hin in contract/bailment;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether Moh Seng had a claim against JPW and/or MA for
                        negligence; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether JPW was contractually entitled to be indemnified by Hup Hin and/or
                        MA under their respective contracts with JPW.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On the first issue, the Judge observed in
                        <em>Moh Seng Cranes Pte Ltd v Hup Hin Transport Co Pte Ltd
                        and others</em>[2013] 2 SLR 1 (“GD”) that there was
                    nothing in the crane supply contract between JPW and Hup Hin which obliged Hup
                    Hin to secure cranes for JPW or to provide an unremunerated lifting supervisor
                    for the worksite. He found that the legal basis of the relationship between JPW,
                    Hup Hin and Moh Seng was an oral contract between the three parties (“the
                    oral contract”) for Moh Seng to provide a crane with an operator to JPW
                    on 11 June 2010, with no further role or involvement of Hup Hin save that
                    Hup Hin would pay Moh Seng at the rates provided in the hiring contract. Hup Hin
                    would in turn be paid by JPW at the rates provided in the crane supply contract.
                    This oral contract was implemented by Moh Seng sending its crane, and JPW
                    receiving it at the worksite.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     As JPW was not a party to the hiring contract,
                    the general “<b>Terms And Conditions</b>”
                    [emphasis in original] attached to the hiring contract were not incorporated as
                    terms of the oral contract. The Judge also rejected Moh Seng’s claims that
                    there was an implied term in the hiring contract that Hup Hin would assume
                    responsibility for the crane, and that there was a contract of bailment for
                    valuable consideration. As regards the latter claim, the Judge found that the
                    facts in the present case did not point towards the existence of a bailor-bailee
                    relationship. Hup Hin had never received possession of the crane, which was
                    delivered directly by Moh Seng to JPW at the worksite. Moh Seng’s
                    contention that Hup Hin had received constructive possession or control of the
                    crane and then “sub-hired” it to JPW was untenable in light of the
                    factual matrix.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On the second issue, the Judge found that it
                    was “undisputed that the proximate cause of the damage to the crane was
                    the manhole which was concealed at the time of the lifting operations on
                    11 June 2010” (GD at [24]). He then held that the test in <em>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology
                        Agency</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<em>Spandeck</em>”) was satisfied in relation to JPW’s
                    liability. Factual foreseeability was established as it was clearly foreseeable
                    that JPW’s failure to take precautions with respect to a known unconcealed
                    manhole could result in damage. Legal proximity was satisfied by the fact that
                    JPW had ordered the crane for lifting works. There were also no policy reasons
                    weighing against the imposition of such a duty of care on JPW. In fact, imposing
                    such a duty would be consistent with the policy reasons underlying the Workplace
                    Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the
                    WSHA”). Despite having knowledge about the manhole by 12 August
                    2008, JPW did nothing about it. MA could not have knowledge about the manhole,
                    as they would never have constructed a washing bay close to the manhole if it
                    was aware that the manhole was nearby. The Judge found that JPW did not take
                    reasonable care to properly mark and cordon off the manhole and direct the
                    subcontractors to take the appropriate action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Judge also held that there was no
                    contributory negligence attributable to Moh Seng and MA. Lian had acted
                    reasonably and had fully discharged his responsibility as a crane operator. As
                    to whether MA had contributed to the damage due to its nearby excavation works
                    as the excavated soil would have run off to cover the manhole, the Judge found
                    that the manhole remained concealed even before the excavated soil run-off. MA,
                    therefore, did not contribute to the accident as the excavation work had been
                    carried out without knowledge of the manhole’s existence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On the third issue, the Judge dismissed
                    JPW’s contractual claims against both Hup Hin and MA. He found that the
                    crane supply contract which contained the indemnity clauses was a bilateral
                    contract between JPW and Hup Hin, and was not incorporated into the oral
                    contract between the three parties. He also found that JPW’s claim against
                    MA for breach of the subcontracts in failing to comply with all workplace safety
                    requirements failed as he had already rejected JPW’s Safety
                    Officer’s evidence that he had instructed the crane to be removed from the
                    washing bay area. The Judge construed “wilful default” as used in
                    the indemnity clause (cl 12.3.4) in the subcontract to refer to JPW’s
                    failure to take reasonable care in the circumstances, which he had earlier
                    established. Hence, JPW had no basis to claim an indemnity from
                MA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Appellant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     JPW’s main focus in this appeal was on
                    the Judge’s finding that JPW was solely liable to Moh Seng for negligence,
                    without any contribution from MA and Hup Hin. On this issue, JPW disputed a few
                    of the Judge’s <em>factual</em> findings and asserted
                    the following: (a) the Lifting Supervisor was not an agent or
                    representative of JPW, but MA; (b) MA was aware of the existence of the
                    manhole which had been concealed by the soil excavated by MA; and
                    (c) JPW’s Safety Officer had asked for the crane to be removed from
                    the danger area.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Legally, JPW asserted that no duty of care
                    arose as there was no legal proximity: there was no close and direct
                    relationship between JPW and Moh Seng, and the fact that JPW was the licensed
                    occupier did not suffice to establish proximity. Further, as a matter of policy,
                    a duty of care should not be superimposed on a contractual framework, such as
                    the two written contracts (hiring contract and crane supply contract). As to the
                    standard of care, JPW emphasised that they were only the <em>occupiers</em> of the worksite (as holder of the factory license) and
                    should have their duties limited to appointing a qualified lifting supervisor,
                    implementing a permit-to-work system and ensuring that MA carried out its work
                    properly and safely. There was no breach of any duty of care as JPW had already
                    taken all reasonably practicable safety measures. On the issue of causation, the
                    Judge also failed to state how JPW’s conduct contributed to the damage as
                    MA was aware of the manhole too and JPW’s Safety Officer had instructed
                    the crane to be moved away from the CL2 location.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Further, even if JPW were to be found
                    negligent, the respondents should at least be found to be contributorily
                    negligent. Moh Seng was negligent as Lian did not follow JPW’s Safety
                    Officer’s instructions, and Moh Seng had failed to obtain the requisite
                    permit to work for the lifting operation and to carry out risk assessments. MA
                    was negligent/contributorily negligent as they had concealed the manhole, knew
                    about the manhole and was in direct control and possession of the area of the
                    accident. Hup Hin was negligent in failing to provide a site representative and
                    not taking any steps to address the risks involved with Lian going to the
                    worksite for the first time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Contractually, JPW argued that the Judge erred
                    in finding a tripartite oral contract between the three parties as this was not
                    even pleaded, and in any event, the parties had clearly arranged their
                    relationships with two separate written contracts. JPW submitted that the Judge
                    erred in dismissing its claims against Hup Hin and MA for contractual indemnity
                    under the crane supply contract and the subcontracts respectively. The Judge
                    also erred in dismissing JPW’s claim against Hup Hin and MA for the breach
                    of those two contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Respondents’ case</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Moh Seng’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Moh Seng argued that JPW clearly owed a duty
                    of care as it (a) had overall control and possession of the worksite;
                    (b) knew about the presence of the manhole; (c) designated the crane
                    access at the worksite; (d) reviewed MA’s risk assessments; and
                    (e) had its own Safety Officer who expected to be obeyed by everyone else.
                    This was further affirmed by the statutory regime put in place by the WSHA.
                    There was no contributory negligence on Moh Seng’s part due to
                    Lian’s acts of prudence at the material time. In fact, Lian had gone
                    beyond his duty by informing the Lifting Supervisor and JPW’s Safety
                    Officer of his concerns regarding the ground conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Hup Hin’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Hup Hin argued that it was undisputed industry
                    practice that (a) the owner of the crane supplied a crane operator;
                    (b) the hire of a crane did not come with a lifting or site supervisor,
                    rigger and signalman unless requested for; (c) the crane owner was
                    responsible for the insurance of the crane; and (d) the crane owner would
                    be responsible for losses and damages to a crane if an accident was caused by
                    its own operator. Moreover, on a broader causation issue, it was clear that Hup
                    Hin was never involved with any of that morning’s events and the evidence
                    showed that the accident was caused by the systemic failure in JPW’s work
                    system in failing to detect the presence of a manhole which they should have
                    been aware of.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">MA’s arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     MA argued that JPW took a serious risk in
                    failing to cordon off or place warning signs to alert the subcontractors to the
                    presence of the manhole, despite having effective control of the worksite and
                    principal responsibility for the worksite under the WSHA. MA, in turn, was not
                    liable in negligence because the lifting operations in question were not part of
                    MA’s duties. The Lifting Supervisor was not under MA’s supervision
                    and direction at that time (as he had been seconded to JPW pursuant to a
                    secondment agreement, or was <em>pro hac vice</em> the
                    servant and/or agent of JPW’s). Moreover, MA had no knowledge and could
                    not be expected to have any knowledge of the manhole; in fact, MA would not even
                    be able to meet the threshold factual foreseeability test in <em>Spandeck</em> as they were not even aware of the concealed manhole.
                    Even if factual foreseeability was made out, there was no proximity between Moh
                    Seng and MA to support the imposition of a duty of care: there was no
                    contractual relationship, and neither had Moh Seng relied on MA for the lifting
                    operation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Three broad issues were put before us:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether JPW, MA, Hup Hin and/or Moh
                        Seng were negligent;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether MA and/or Hup Hin were in breach of their contracts with JPW;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether JPW
                        should be indemnified by MA and/or Hup Hin.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Common law negligence</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Factual disputes</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Two factual disputes remained alive, namely,
                    (a) whether the Lifting Supervisor was representing JPW or MA at the time
                    of the accident; and (b) whether JPW’s Safety Officer had given
                    certain instructions to Lian on the morning of the accident. We will address
                    them both before considering the legal issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Lifting Supervisor: JPW or MA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     JPW and MA took contrary stances as to who
                    employed the Lifting Supervisor. The Judge stated that it was <em>undisputed</em> that “JPW’s Worksite representatives
                    included ... Lifting Supervisor Kolanjiapan Sunder (“Lifting
                    Supervisor”)” (GD at [18]). However, with respect, it was odd that
                    the Judge should have come to that conclusion given that this issue <em>was</em> in fact disputed at the trial below and continued to
                    be so on appeal. In essence, JPW contended that “it is not disputed that
                    the Lifting Supervisor is [MA’s] employee”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> while MA
                    maintained that the Lifting Supervisor was “<em>pro hac
                        vice</em> of [JPW]” and on
                        “secondment”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> to JPW.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The confusion may be traced to an interim
                    agreement made during a project meeting on 27 August 2009, during which
                    MA’s Project Manager Roger Kung and JPW’s Senior Project Manager Teo
                    Boon Thong discussed, <em>inter alia</em>, an arrangement
                    for MA to provide lifting supervisors for some crawler crane lifting operations.
                    At that point, JPW did not have its own qualified lifting supervisors as the
                    employees designated by JPW to be lifting supervisors were due to go on course.
                    On 28 August 2009 at 2.22pm, Roger Kung sent Teo Boon Thong an email
                    briefly mentioning the salient points of the meeting:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    As discussed but MA to provide own riggers.
                                <em>In the mean time, we request MA assistance to

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     MA relied on these two emails as evidence of a
                    purported secondment arrangement between JPW and MA. However, JPW subsequently
                    appointed its own lifting supervisors Thiein Htut Win and Than Htike Aung who
                    qualified for their roles on 27 October 2009 and 23 September 2009
                    respectively, which, according to JPW, signalled the end of the Lifting
                    Supervisor’s secondment to them. Accordingly, at the time of the accident
                    the Lifting Supervisor was no longer acting for JPW, but was acting as
                    MA’s site supervisor in addition to being their lifting
                supervisor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Several facts persuaded us that JPW’s
                    version of events was to be preferred, <em>ie</em>, the
                    Lifting Supervisor was employed by MA at the time of the accident. First, on the
                    day of the accident he was wearing a white helmet with a
                    “MA Builders” logo on it, a headgear worn by MA’s site
                    supervisors, in contrast with the brown helmets worn by lifting supervisors
                    – a practice confirmed by MA’s Roger Kung<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. Secondly, the Lifting Supervisor
                    signed off with “S/S” (representing “site
                    supervisor”) on the second permit to work, under “<em>Application by Supervisor-in-charge</em>”, indicating
                    that he was making the application as a site supervisor. This was a position
                    that he had held under MA. Thirdly, the Lifting Supervisor identified himself as
                    an employee of MA to the Ministry of Manpower’s Koh Chin Chin, who
                    interviewed the Lifting Supervisor after the accident<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In contrast, MA’s submission that the
                    Lifting Supervisor was seconded to JPW for all lifting operations, including the
                    one during the accident or that he was <em>pro hac
                        vice</em> the servant and/or agent of JPW was not borne out by the
                    evidence. The “LETTER OF APPOINTMENT” that MA pointed to as
                    evidence of the secondment appeared to be nothing more than a confirmation by
                    the Lifting Supervisor, <em>as MA’s lifting
                        supervisor</em>, to abide by statutory safety regulations. As for the
                    document submitted as MA’s summary of variation for the additional lifting
                    crew supplied evidencing the alleged secondment, there is an item for
                    “Additional Lifting Crew (24/12/2009-19/7/2010)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>
                    amounting to an addition of $113,628.00. While this was further particularised
                    as “Lifting Supervisor (1 no)”, “Riggerman (2 nos)”,
                    and “Signalman (2 nos)”, this did not point towards a secondment
                    arrangement as this document appeared to be in exactly the same format as the
                    original tender questionnaires submitted by MA to JPW, <em>ie</em>, it was a document varying the original tender documents to
                    factor in additional lifting crew which MA had engaged in carrying out works.
                    Notwithstanding the fact that it was unclear whether “Lifting Supervisor
                    (1 no)” did actually refer to Kolanjiapan Sunder on 11 July 2010,
                    the variation document was also silent on whether the additional lifting crew
                    were for the purposes of carrying out works within MA’s own scope of work
                    or some other seconded work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We were therefore satisfied that the Lifting
                    Supervisor was not the representative of JPW at the material time, but rather
                    MA’s representative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   JPW’s Safety Officer’s alleged
                instructions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     JPW and the respondents also disputed whether
                    JPW’s Safety Officer had given instructions for the crane to be removed
                    from the danger area. In his decision, the Judge rejected JPW’s Safety
                    Officer’s evidence that he had done so as “it [was] puzzling that
                    [JPW’s Safety Officer] would immediately walk away from the scene without
                    ensuring that his instructions were promptly implemented”, and further,
                    “[JPW’s] Safety Officer was accompanied by an assistant who
                    similarly immediately walked away and was not instructed to remain to ensure
                    removal of the crane” (GD at [32]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     We had reservations on the correctness of the
                    Judge’s inference that JPW’s Safety Officer ought to have stayed
                    behind to see his instructions carried out if he did indeed give those
                    instructions (which JPW argued was based on “puzzling”
                        logic<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>). However, as we were satisfied that
                    JPW’s Safety Officer did not give those instructions we need say no more
                    about that particular finding.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     JPW’s Safety Officer affirmed in his
                    affidavit that during his discussion with the Lifting Supervisor, the Lifting
                    Supervisor had told him that the land had already been backfilled. JPW’s
                    Safety Officer then replied that he did not know about any filling up, and that
                    to him “it was still a washing bay and that the Crane cannot park
                        [there]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Therefore, he “instructed [the
                    Lifting Supervisor] to shift the Crane and not to park [there] any
                        further”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Subsequently, when
                    cross-examined, JPW’s Safety Officer modified his evidence and claimed
                    that he not only gave the instruction for the crane to be moved away to
                        <em>the Lifting Supervisor</em>, but also to <em>Lian</em> himself.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This point
                    was not in JPW’s pleaded case and it was the first occasion that
                    JPW’s Safety Officer had brought this up. Contrary to JPW’s Safety
                    Officer’s (and JPW’s own Safety Coordinator) evidence, the other two
                    individuals at the scene, Lian and the Lifting Supervisor, both disagreed that
                    JPW’s Safety Officer had given the instructions for the crane to be moved.
                    In fact, it was only JPW’s Safety Officer who asserted that the crane had
                    previously been parked at a different location, identified as
                    “CL1” on the sitemap and relatively far away from the manhole,
                    whereas both Lian and the Lifting Supervisor testified that the crane had only
                    been parked at CL2, which was where the manhole was located at. In addition,
                    JPW’s Safety Officer was unable to explain why the permit-to-work for the
                    lifting operation (which would have authorised CL2 as the place for the crane to
                        work<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>) was missing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     On the whole we found JPW’s Safety
                    Officer’s evidence on this point to be unsatisfactory and found that he
                    did <em>not</em> give the instructions for the crane to be
                    moved away.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relevance of the WSHA</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Duty of care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The parties’ operational activities were
                    all embraced by the regulatory framework installed by the WSHA and its relevant
                    regulations (collectively, the “WSH Regime”). This had a
                    significant bearing on our analysis of the parties’ conduct, their legal
                    responsibilities and the imputation of negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     First, it is trite that there is no common law
                    tort of careless performance of a statutory duty and the mere presence of a
                    statutory duty does not automatically give rise to a concomitant common law duty
                    of care (<em>Animal Concerns Research &amp; Education Society v
                        Tan Boon Kwee</em> [2011] 2 SLR 146 (“<em>Animal Concerns</em>”) at [21]–[23]; <em>Tan Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte Ltd and others</em> [2012]
                    2 SLR 549 (“<em>Tan Juay Pah</em>”) at
                    [53]). Rather, the presence of statutory rules would fall within the rubric of
                    the existing analysis for negligence. The classic framework for establishing a
                    duty of care was clearly stated in <em>Spandeck Engineering (S)
                        Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 100 (“<em>Spandeck</em>”).
                    There is first a threshold requirement of factual foreseeability before a
                    two-stage test is applied (<em>Spandeck</em> at [115]). The
                    first stage requires sufficient legal proximity, which is determined by the
                    closeness of the parties’ relationship, supported by the defendant’s
                    voluntary assumption of responsibility and the claimant’s actual reliance.
                    It is a multi-faceted concept which is a measure of the parties’
                    relationship in terms of nearness or closeness, and can also reflect an
                    assumption of responsibility by one party to another. If established, there
                    would be a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care. The second
                    stage involves policy considerations to decide if the <em>prima
                        facie</em> duty should be negated, such as the presence of a
                    contractual matrix within which parties have defined their rights and
                    liabilities, or the relative bargaining positions of the parties (<em>Spandeck</em> at [83]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The effect of the WSH Regime on the issue of
                    whether there exists a duty of care in negligence was discussed at length in
                        <em>Tan Juay Pah</em>, a case which also involved the
                    collapse of a tower crane which resulted in the deaths of three workers.
                    However, a significant difference was that the alleged negligence in <em>Tan Juay Pah</em> was that of the <em>authorised examiner</em>, whose duty was prescribed under the WSH
                    Regime, and not the <em>crane operator, contractor, subcontractor
                        and crane supplier</em>, as was the case here. The main contractor in
                        <em>Tan Juay Pah</em> had sued the subcontractor, which
                    in turn brought in the authorised examiner as a third party, claiming an
                    indemnity against the subcontractor in the event that the latter was found
                    liable to the main contractor. At the trial, the main contractor succeeded in
                    its claim against the subcontractor, which in turn succeeded in its claim of
                    indemnity against the authorised examiner. The authorised examiner appealed
                    against the High Court’s decision. On appeal to this Court, it was
                    established that the subcontractor needed to show that the authorised examiner
                    was liable to the main contractor directly for the same damage that the
                    subcontractor had caused by the crane collapse. Hence, the crucial question was
                    whether the authorised examiner owed a duty of care at common law to the main
                    contractor even though the authorised examiner was not engaged by the main
                    contractor but by the subcontractor renting out the tower crane.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>Tan Juay Pah</em>,
                    this Court made general observations about the WSH Regime and the imposition of
                    a common law duty of care under it. First, a party seeking to establish a
                    private right of action for a breach of a statutory duty has to show that
                    Parliament intended for the members protected by that statutory duty to have
                    such a right of action. Secondly, the mere existence of a statutory remedy or
                    sanction for a breach of the duty is not decisive on matter of whether there is
                    a private right of action. Thirdly, each statute has to be considered
                    contextually; formulas are not helpful. Fourthly, the underlying statutory
                    scheme and parliamentary intention go to the second limb of <em>Spandeck</em>, not the first. Crucially, this Court in <em>Tan Juay Pah</em> identified the main underlying objective of
                    the WSH Regime as follows (at [68], [73] and [89]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">68    …
                            <b>[T]he objective of the WSH Bill (which was later
                                enacted as the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 (Act 7 of 2006))
                                was to protect workers and members of the public present at a
                                workplace from injury by deterring risk-taking behaviour (through
                                the imposition of liability for such behaviour) on the part of
                                persons who create and have control over safety risks at
                                workplaces.</b> To achieve this objective, a “more
                            direct liability regime” (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates
                            vol 80 at col 2209) was put in place under Pt IV of the
                            WSH Bill to hold various groups of persons accountable for
                            workers’ safety and health according to their different
                            capacities. We observe that while an AE does not fall under any of the
                            categories of persons enumerated in Pt IV of the WSH Bill,
                                <b>a main contractor and a subcontractor may fall
                                under one or more of those categories</b> (<em>eg</em>, as an employer under cl 12 of the WSH Bill, or
                            as a manufacturer and supplier of machinery under cl 16). The
                            structure of the WSH Bill suggests that <b>the liability
                                of an AE under the WSH Regime is </b><b><em>secondary </em></b><b>to that of the persons
                                specifically mentioned in Pt IV of the WSH Bill
                                (</b><b><em>inter alia</em></b><b>, contractors and subcontractors</b>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73    … It is clear, in our view, that while the
                            office of the AE is an integral part of the WSH Regime’s overall
                            statutory purpose of ensuring workplace safety (see [56]–[61]
                            above), <b>the statutory objective is not to protect

                            Indeed, Dr Ng’s statements in Parliament during the second
                            reading of the WSH Bill (see above at [66]) suggest that the objective
                            of the WSH Regime is to guard against safety lapses at workplaces by
                            contractors and those to whom they have delegated operational control of
                            their work. …</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Moreover, the prevailing intention behind the
                    WSHA was precisely to create a system of accountability by defining the
                    responsibilities of various persons at workplaces, as explained by the then
                    Minister of Manpower Dr Ng Eng Hen during the second reading of the
                    Workplace Safety and Health Bill 2005 (Bill 36 of 2005) (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official
                        Report</em> (17 January 2006) vol 80) at cols
                    2208–2210:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Third, this Bill will better <em>define persons who are
                            accountable, their responsibilities and institute penalties</em>
                        which reflect the true economic and social cost of risks and accidents.
                        Penalties should be sufficient to deter risk-taking behaviour and ensure
                        that companies are <em>proactive in preventing
                            incidents</em>. Appropriately, companies and persons that show
                            <em>poor safety management</em> should be penalised
                        even if no accident has occurred.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Bill will put into place a new and more effective framework to reduce
                        accidents at the workplace - to bring about a quantum improvement in OSH
                        standards and to achieve our intermediate goal of halving the present
                        occupational fatality rate by 2015.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     From the foregoing it is clear that
                    contractors and subcontractors (as JPW and MA were, respectively) are precisely
                    the entities which the WSHA seeks to increase direct liability on for workplace
                    safety. They have “primary responsibility” in all areas of safety,
                    given their “operational control” of workplaces. In fact, the main
                    purpose of the WSHA is to strengthen the accountability of and impose
                    responsibilities on parties such as the main contractor and subcontractors so as
                    to ensure a safer working environment at construction sites. These statutory
                    responsibilities also complement the very aims of the common law tort of
                    negligence, which is concerned with ensuring that negligent conduct, within
                    legal limits, would attract corresponding liability. The law of tort serves two
                    functions here: it is an engine of compensation as well as a financial
                    deterrent. The law governing the establishment of a duty of care in turn helps
                    to limit claims in negligence to only parties with sufficient proximity and
                    foreseeability, so that the net of liability is not cast too widely. Plainly,
                    contractors and subcontractors are parties whose negligence on construction
                    sites has the most potential to result in fatal, or at least costly,
                    consequences, given their well-placed abilities to foresee and be aware of the
                    various possible mishaps that others without operational responsibilities and
                    control may not be able to identify. In fact, it would be very hard to think of
                    situations where sufficient proximity to give rise to a common law duty of care
                    will not be found to exist due to the control contractors and subcontractors
                    have over the worksite and the on-going activities on it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The WSHA is clearly focussed on strengthening
                    the safety management of worksites as its primary aim. By placing heavy
                    responsibilities on contractors and subcontractors, the scheme of the WSHA
                    intends that the burden of making worksites as free from hazards as possible and
                    installing necessary systems and safeguards would fall on these
                parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Standard of care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The standard of care required in relation to a
                    duty of care is usually the general objective standard of a reasonable person
                    using ordinary care and skill (<em>Blyth v The Company of
                        Proprietors of the Birmingham Waterworks</em> (1856) 11 Exch
                    781). However, factors such as industry standards and normal practice can be
                    taken into account at this stage. Cases such as <em>The
                        “Emma Maersk”</em> [2006] SGHC 180 (at [51]) and
                        <em>Tesa Tape Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Wing Seng Logistics Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 116 at ([17]) are instances where the
                    courts accepted what was shown to be normal practice to be the standard of care.
                    As such, we affirm the Judge’s observation that the industry standard
                    guidance provided by the Singapore Standard SS 536 2008 Code of Practice
                    (“the Code”) for the safe use of mobile cranes would be applicable
                    here (GD at [26]). We note that the Code was listed as a useful reference under
                    the Workplace Safety and Health Council’s Technical Advisory for the Safe
                    Operation of Lifting Equipment. Significantly, the Code was accepted as the
                    “reasonable standard of care to be observed by crane operators” by
                    all counsel during the trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> In addition to the
                    Code, the stipulations under the WSHA would also be relevant in pitching the
                    standard of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether JPW was negligent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     On the existence of a duty of care towards Moh
                    Seng, JPW submitted that the Judge’s summary conclusion that legal
                    proximity was satisfied simply because JPW had ordered the crane for lifting
                    works was overly simplistic, and failed to take into account the fact that there
                    was no direct contractual relationship between JPW and Moh Seng. Rather, JPW
                    asserted there had been very little communication between JPW and Moh Seng (if
                    at all). It was the Lifting Supervisor, who was an employee of MA, who had
                    assumed all responsibility. Moreover, the lifting operations were part of
                    MA’s scope of work under the subcontracts, and the individuals in charge
                    of the part of the worksite where the accident took place were MA’s
                    personnel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We acknowledge that the brevity of the
                    Judge’s reasoning did not satisfactorily explain the basis of legal
                    proximity. However, his finding that such proximity did exist between JPW and
                    Moh Seng was nonetheless correct. As explained above, as main contractor, JPW
                    would already <em>prima facie</em> have owed a duty of care
                    to Moh Seng simply by virtue of being identified heavily as a responsibility
                    bearer by the WSHA. Moreover, JPW’s narrow and overly-technical
                    demarcation of its relationships down to formal contractual lines failed to take
                    into account the reality that it: (a) did exercise effective control and
                    possession over the worksite as main contractor; and (b) must be taken to
                    have had knowledge about the location of the manhole.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     JPW was given effective management and control
                    of the worksite under its main management contract with Crescendas. This was
                    common ground. As noted in <em>Tan Juay Pah</em> at [53],
                    “[u]nder the first limb of the <em>Spandeck</em>
                    test, one of the many factors taken into consideration is the existence of a
                    statutory duty”. It was undisputed that JPW was an
                    “occupier” as defined under the WSHA (<em>ie</em>, “the person who has charge, management or control of
                    those premises either on his own account or as an agent of another person,
                    whether or not he is also the owner of those premises”), and had to
                    fulfil the relevant duties and responsibilities under it. The Judge found that
                    (GD at [18]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…[It was] beyond debate and confirmed by the subpoenaed Ministry of
                        Manpower officer Koh Chin Chin that JPW had principal responsibility for the
                        Worksite under the Workplace and Safety Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009
                        Rev Ed), and that JPW had appointed the requisite officers to discharge
                        such responsibility…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This finding was also supported by the evidence given by Koh Chin Chin
                    at trial.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>
                    The relevant duties of an occupier under s 11 of the WSHA are as

                        is an employee of the occupier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As an “occupier” under the WSHA,
                    JPW could not expect to abrogate from its duty to ensure safety at the worksite
                    simply by looking at the strict contractual arrangements between the parties.
                    While acknowledging that it was the <em>licensed
                        occupier</em> of the worksite, JPW attempted to draw “a
                    distinction between a general duty of care owed by an occupier <em>vis-a-vis</em> the land (occupier’s liability) and
                        <em>vis-a-vis</em> the operations being carried out
                        (negligence)”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. Yet, this distinction has already
                    ceased to exist with this Court’s decision in <em>See Toh
                        Siew Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement (Pte) Ltd and others</em> [2013]
                    3 SLR 284 (“<em>See Toh Siew Kee</em>”)
                    where it was emphatically established that the “law in Singapore on
                    occupiers’ liability can and should be subsumed under the tort of
                    negligence” (at [76]). In <em>See Toh Siew Kee</em>
                    this Court held that the first limb of <em>Spandeck</em>
                    would be satisfied in the vast majority of occupiers having control of the
                    property which they occupy and/or the activities carried out there (at [80]).
                    There was no reason why this should not be the case in JPW’s situation as
                    the licensed occupier and main contractor of the worksite. Yet, it also bears
                    noting that this Court’s statement that <em>“the
                        vast majority of occupiers having control of the property which they occupy
                        and/or the activities carried out there de jure owe a prima facie duty of
                        care to lawful entrants</em>” [emphasis in original] (which
                    there is no doubt Moh Seng was) was qualified by the observation that
                    “this turns on the degree of control which an occupier has over the
                    property concerned and/or the activities carried out there” (at [80]). In
                    this respect, JPW and MA disputed whose scope of work the lifting operation
                    which resulted in the accident came under (discussed in further detail below at
                    [55]–[56]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     By their own admission, JPW also knew (at
                    least since 12 August 2008 when photographs of the manhole were taken by
                    JPW) about the existence of the manhole. In fact, it was JPW’s submission
                    that the manhole had normally been visible and so “obvious to any person
                    or passerby” that there would not have been “the need of any
                    barricade, warning sign or warning”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Hence, according to JPW, if
                    not for the brown soil that must have been mounted by MA due to their excavation
                    works nearby, the manhole would have been visible. Yet JPW failed to acknowledge
                    that the sheer <em>knowledge</em> that such a manhole
                    existed, apart from whatever JPW alleged MA to have done to it, gave rise to
                    sufficient proximity between Moh Seng and itself. The foreseeability of the
                    damage that may be caused by one’s negligence is essential in establishing
                    the proximity needed for a duty of care to arise. Therefore, JPW’s
                    knowledge of the existence of the manhole would certainly have made it
                    reasonably foreseeable that serious damage could be caused in a busy worksite
                    with heavy equipment and machinery, making their omission to deal with the
                    manhole even more inexcusable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the second limb of <em>Spandeck</em>, JPW’s argument that a duty of care should not be
                    superimposed where there had been an established contractual framework
                    consisting of the hiring contract between Hup Hin and Moh Seng, the subcontracts
                    between MA and JPW, and the crane supply contract between Hup Hin and JPW simply
                    could not stand. From a legal policy point of view such an approach is plainly
                    unpalatable. In the same parliamentary speech quoted above at [40], Dr Ng
                    Eng Hen critically referred to such situations and explained how the proposed
                    regime sought to address this through a direct imposition of duties, albeit in
                    the context of principals engaging contractors for specialised tasks (at
                    col 2209):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Traditionally, a principal who engages a contractor would be engaging the
                        specialist services of the contractor, and would not be directing the
                        contractor on how to do the work. However, today the situation is different.
                        Principals often engage “contractors” and third-party labour
                        not for their specialist expertise, but <em>precisely so that
                            they can avoid entering into a direct employment relationship, for
                            organisational or other reasons.</em> In such situations, the
                        principal, in terms of supervision, takes on the role of an employer.
                            <b><em>The Bill thus places on him responsibility for the
                            worker’s safety and health as if he were the
                            employer.</em></b> If this were not the case, then the <em>duties under the Act could be simply circumvented by a careful
                            crafting of the legal relationship.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The case at hand could also be easily
                    distinguished from <em>Man B&amp;W Diesel S E Asia Pte
                        Ltd and another v PT Bumi International Tankers and another
                        appeal</em> [2004] 2 SLR(R) 300 (“<em>Man
                        B&amp;W</em>”), a case which JPW cited as an instance where the
                    court declined to impose a duty of care against parties’ express
                    contractual arrangements. In <em>Man B&amp;W</em> this
                    Court observed that a subcontractor which had supplied defective engine parts
                    did not owe a duty of care to the shipowner for the faulty parts due to the
                    shipowner’s contract with the main contractor, as the shipowner had chosen
                    to seek redress from the main contract by directly contracting with the main
                    contractor. However, in the current case, the presence of the WSH regime alters
                    the weight that must be put on the parties’ contractual arrangement,
                    especially with regards to safety measures, which the WSH regime is concerned
                    with. Moreover, the realities of the situation around the time of the accident
                    was not one like that in <em>Man B&amp;W</em> where the
                    shipowner was well aware of the subcontractor’s involvement, but
                    ultimately made the choice to make the main contractor “solely
                    responsible for any defect that could arise” (at [36]) in the contract.
                    Accordingly, the policy argument which rightfully applied in that case could not
                    be similarly invoked here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Having established that JPW did owe Moh Seng a
                    duty of care, the standard of care would be that as established in the Code for
                    the safe use of mobile cranes. Manholes were specifically identified as one of
                    the possible “underground hazards”, a term frequently referred to
                    in the Code, as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On large construction sites where mobile cranes are expected to be in
                        common use over long periods, <em>a site survey should be
                            undertaken to identify soil types and underground hazards</em>.
                        Further ground improvement may then be required and can take many forms.
                        When all surveys are completed, any hazards identified and soil improvements
                        completed, <em>a site layout plan can be produced to show the
                            location of danger areas</em>, access routes, and safe working
                        areas for the types of mobile cranes to be used.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     As the main contractor, JPW clearly had the
                    responsibility to ensure that hazards such as manholes were identified properly
                    through site surveys, and then to undertake ground improvements to ensure that
                    these underground hazards did not continue to remain hazardous. The sheer
                    importance of this duty, to ensure that potential dangers were located and dealt
                    with properly, simply cannot be overstated, especially in work environments such
                    as construction sites. The mere presence of heavy machinery, dangerous equipment
                    and high volumes of activity at construction sites would ordinarily already
                    carry high levels of inherent risks and propensity for accidents. Therefore,
                    measures to reduce these risks cannot be taken lightly, and the responsibility
                    to do so cannot be abrogated. Yet, JPW had unjustifiably failed in this duty to
                    identify and rectify the underground hazard in the form of the manhole in this
                    case. JPW was therefore liable to Moh Seng for the damage caused to the crane as
                    a result of its negligence in this aspect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether MA was negligent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Although the Judge found that MA was not
                    contributorily negligent in causing some soil run-off to cover the manhole due
                    to its nearby excavation works, this was but one peripheral issue in relation to
                    MA’s liability. Given our discussion above on the underlying rationale of
                    the WSH Regime, plainly there is a <em>prima facie</em>
                    duty of care on contractors and subcontractors at construction sites to parties
                    who are present at the construction site. Accordingly, MA, as subcontractor,
                    could not escape this duty in the absence of strong countervailing reasons.
                    Moreover, in our view there were a few other unaddressed factors which pointed
                    towards a duty of care owed by MA toward Moh Seng: (a) the lifting
                    operation that caused the accident was within MA’s scope of work;
                    (b) MA knew about the manhole as well; and (c) MA was contractually
                    responsible and deemed fully informed of the conditions at the worksite. In
                    addition, given our finding above that the Lifting Supervisor had been under the
                    employ of MA at the material time, his actions also needed to be assessed
                    against the standards set out in the Code.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     First, the lifting operation, the cause of the
                    accident, was part of MA’s scope of work, as the crane had undisputedly
                    been requested for by Roger Kung, MA’s Project Manager. MA had required
                    the services of JPW to lift some steel reinforcement bars up to the building
                    under construction, and the crane had been hired for this very
                        purpose.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Roger Kung further confirmed that the
                    personnel involved in the lifting operation on the morning of the accident
                    included the Lifting Supervisor, riggers and signalmen - all of whom were
                    employees of MA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In addition, this appeared to be
                    the impression of the persons working at the worksite who were interviewed by
                    Koh Chin Chin as well:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The fact that the crane was deployed for works
                    under the scope of MA’s oversight was a significant indicator of
                    MA’s assumption of responsibility, since the overall directive of what had
                    to be done and how it would be done – quite apart from the overarching
                    direction of JPW over the entire project – would emanate from
                MA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Second, apart from the Lifting
                    Supervisor’s knowledge of the existence of the manhole (see
                    [64]–[65] below), MA itself also appeared to have known about the
                    existence of the manhole. The Judge made the following finding (GD at
                    [28]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is quite clear the washing bay for laden and unladen lorries would not
                        have been constructed by MA at this location if it were known to MA that the
                        manhole was nearby. It was in evidence that MA had previously built and
                        subsequently removed a guardhouse over the former washing bay, which
                        confirms that the existence of the manhole was then and subsequently unknown
                        to MA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">However, in our view this finding was, with respect, mistaken. This
                    was a supposition drawn purely on the Judge’s intuitive sense of what a
                    contractor’s logic would be, as there was no evidence led on the
                    non-viability of building washing bays or guardhouses over <em>covered</em> manholes (it was undisputed that the manhole was not
                    exposed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The evidence of JPW’s Project Manager,
                    Thomas Teo, was that the manhole was in fact covered with a thick concrete cover
                    able to withstand the weight of normal traffic,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and was readily visible. As
                    subcontractors who had been working in that region of the worksite for a few
                    months, it is unlikely that MA’s workers would not have known that there
                    was a manhole there.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Thomas
                    Teo also testified that MA had even carried out works in the manhole itself for
                    (a) investigation and (b) sealing the underground discharge opening to
                    some pipes connecting the manhole to a PUB drain.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_23" id="Ftn_23_1"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Further, Koh Chin Chin testified

                    for the presence of unsafe features on the worksite. We also observe that this
                    is unremarkable given the nature of the work that is going to be done on a
                    construction site by a sub-contractor. Such work is often actually or
                    potentially dangerous and in the ordinary course, one would expect that those
                    about to embark on such work make the effort to assess and investigate the site,
                    the surroundings and any relevant features. It would ill have lain in the mouth
                    of an entity in the position of MA to then say that it had no responsibility to
                    anyone else injured by reason of its failure to take such basic steps as it was
                    only required to do so as a matter of a contractual obligation owed to its main
                    contractor. In fairness to MA’s counsel it must be said that this was not
                    a contention it put forward.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As the Lifting Supervisor knew that a manhole
                    was there, it was all the more astounding that he failed to take the necessary
                    precautions. Notwithstanding his failure to ascertain if the ground was safe for
                    lifting <em>after</em> Lian voiced out his concerns about
                    the safety of that spot being “soft”, the Lifting Supervisor
                    should also have made efforts to ascertain <em>where the manhole

                    Seng. This duty was then breached by MA’s unjustifiable failure to deal
                    with the manhole in a way that would enhance and ensure the safety of the
                    worksite. As subcontractor, it could not expect to abrogate from these duties by
                    simply pointing to JPW as the main contractor, as the operation in question at
                    the material time was within MA’s scope of work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Moh Seng was negligent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Whether Moh Seng was negligent or not rested
                    largely on Lian’s conduct and, in particular, whether he wilfully ignored
                    the alleged instructions of JPW’s Safety Officer to move the crane away.
                    As explained above (at [32]–[5]), JPW’s Safety Officer’s
                    evidence that he gave such an instruction was not credible and hence Lian could
                    not be said to have ignored it. Also, JPW’s arguments about Moh
                    Seng’s negligence in not providing a site representative and failure to
                    carry out risk assessments also failed on causation, as it was simply not shown
                    that but for Hup Hin’s breach, the crane would not have fallen into the
                    manhole. Accordingly, Moh Seng was not negligent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Hup Hin was negligent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     JPW acknowledged that “in terms of
                    negligence”, Hup Hin was, among all the parties, “relatively less
                        culpable”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> However, JPW still maintained that as
                    JPW’s subcontractor for hire of the crane pursuant to the crane supply
                    contract, Hup Hin could not absolve itself from all responsibility. By failing
                    to carry out risk assessments or provide a site representative despite being
                    more familiar with the worksite than Lian (who was there for the first time),
                    Hup Hin’s negligence could not be ignored.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     However, it was clear to us that for the same
                    reason given above in the allegations of Moh Seng’s negligence, this claim
                    was misconceived because of the lack of a nexus between Moh Seng’s alleged
                    failings and the collapse of the crane.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Breach of contract</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether there was a tripartite oral contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The tripartite oral contract, the Judge
                    reasoned, was the most probable legal basis of their relationship based on the
                    factual and business matrix of the case, and he described it as follows (GD at
                    [9]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">JPW, Hup Hin and [Moh Seng] all agreed that [Moh Seng] would supply the
                        crane with the crane operator directly to JPW, with no further role or
                        involvement of Hup Hin save that Hup Hin would pay [Moh Seng] at the rates
                        provided in the Moh Seng Quotation (the hiring contract) and Hup Hin would
                        in turn be paid by JPW at the rates provided in the JPW Crane Supply
                        Contract (the crane supply contract). The Moh Seng Quotation prices to Hup
                        Hin are lower than Hup Hin’s contract prices to JPW under the JPW
                        Crane Supply Contract. In such case, Hup Hin would earn a mark-up for this
                        arrangement, whilst JPW by paying Hup Hin would not be obliged to separately
                        contract with [Moh Seng] as an approved crane supplier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Judge observed that the “business and convenience logic of
                    this arrangement” (GD at [9]) was evident and the “invoicing
                    arrangements did not change the business substance of the agreement” as
                    the parties were all “aware that [Moh Seng’s] crane was intended
                    for use by JPW at JPW’s Worksite and not by Hup Hin” (GD at
                    [10]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     This finding was significant as the Judge
                    later rejected all of JPW’s contract-related claims in relation to Hup Hin
                    on the basis that the terms of the written contracts were not incorporated into
                    the tripartite oral contract. JPW submitted that this was erroneous as the
                    parties’ pleaded case made it clear that the hiring of the crane was done
                    pursuant to two separate written contracts: the crane supply contract (JPW and
                    Hup Hin) and the hiring contract (Hup Hin and Moh Seng). Accordingly, JPW hired
                    a crane from Hup Hin pursuant to the crane supply contract which in turn hired
                    the crane from Moh Seng pursuant to the hiring contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The Judge’s finding of an oral
                    tripartite contract was indeed problematic. This was not so much due to the
                    deficiency in pleading such an arrangement, but primarily because such an
                    interpretation would effectively have gone against the clear intentions of the
                    parties as expressed in the two written contracts. Fundamentally, the Judge
                    failed to realise that there was never a meeting of minds by the parties in
                    reaching what appeared to have been an <em>ad hoc</em>
                    arrangement made by Hup Hin to overcome its lack of an available crane for use
                    by JPW. It was improbable that the parties could have actually intended to cease
                    to give legal effect to their immediate written contracts simply because the
                    crane was used/supplied by someone else other than Hup Hin. It was unlikely to
                    have been within the parties’ contemplation that an entirely new
                    contractual arrangement would have arisen just to accommodate the situation,
                    thereby cancelling out all the then existing contractual agreements. In fact,
                    this was not even the first time that Moh Seng had deployed its cranes to
                    JPW’s worksites at Hup Hin’s request.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> Hup Hin’s
                    Managing Director, Woon Wee Peng, testified that crane owners often hired cranes
                    from each other whenever they were unable to meet a request for a specific
                    equipment order.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     The corollary of not being bound by the terms
                    of the two written contracts would be a resultant vacuum apropos the remedies
                    available to JPW in the event that something went wrong (as precisely was the
                    case here) as the oral contract would not have incorporated any of the
                    provisions addressing situations addressed in the written contracts. Surely such
                    an arrangement could not have been said to make “business and convenience
                    logic” (GD at [9]), especially in the construction industry where
                    risk-allocation provisions and accident-related safeguards are of the utmost
                    importance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     Moreover, there was nothing in either contract
                    which expressly precluded the arrangement that took place in this case,
                        <em>ie</em>, Hup Hin supplying a crane not owned by
                    itself to JPW and hiring out a crane supplied by Moh Seng to another party.
                    Contrary to the Judge’s finding that the “invoicing arrangements
                    did not change the business substance of the [tripartite oral] agreement”
                    (GD at [10]), we find that the fact that Hup Hin invoiced JPW, and Moh Seng
                    invoiced Hup Hin, was telling in explaining how the parties sought to govern
                    their relationships. The parties had clearly acknowledged that Hup Hin was to be
                    the intermediary in the arrangement, and that JPW and Moh Seng were not to be in
                    any direct contractual relationship. In fact, this was not the first time that
                    the parties had chosen to work in such an arrangement, as seen from invoices
                    based on the <em>same</em> arrangement (with the same three
                    parties) on previous occasions. Therefore, it was clear to us that the parties
                    did not agree to form a tripartite oral agreement, but instead functioned on the
                    basis of the two separate written contracts. We accept that in certain
                    circumstances, a given contractual framework may preclude the imposition of a
                    duty of care due to the lack of an assumption of responsibility. For instance,
                    in the English case of <em>Simaan General Contracting Co v
                        Pilkington Glass Ltd (No 2)</em> [1988] QB 758, the Court of Appeal
                    found that no duty of care was owed by the defendant glass supplier (hired by
                    the subcontractors) to the main contractor claimant (who hired the
                    subcontractors) as there was no assumption of direct responsibility. However,
                    Bingham LJ did note that had the loss been damage to property instead of
                    economic loss alone, a duty of care would have arisen notwithstanding the
                    contractual matrix (at 781). Hence the contractual arrangement between the
                    parties did not render the imposition of a duty of care inconsistent in this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether Hup Hin breached the crane supply contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     JPW also argued that Hup Hin breached the
                    crane supply contract in failing to: (a) take out adequate insurance to
                    cover its liabilities under the crane supply contract (cl 10 of the
                    Conditions); (b) provide a site representative responsible for
                    co-ordination (cl 4.d of the Conditions); (c) take reasonable steps to
                    observe, comply with and carry out the workplace safety and health requirements
                    applicable to the use of the crane (cl 12 of the Conditions);
                    (d) perform risks assessments necessary under the WSHA for the use of the
                    crane (cl 12 of the Conditions); (e) provide a Trade Safety Supervisor and
                    Lifting Supervisor (cl 12 of the Conditions); and (f) take reasonable steps
                    to ensure that the safety regulations prescribed from time to time by the
                    relevant Government authorities and/or JPW were complied with (cl 14 of the
                    Supplementary Conditions).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     While the Judge found that JPW’s claim
                    against Hup Hin for the breach of the crane supply contract “must
                    fail” because of his previous finding that the crane supply contract
                    “was not operative on 11 June 2010, the events of which were instead
                    governed by an oral agreement between all three parties” (GD at [42]),
                    given our views that this was <em>not</em> the case (at
                    [70]–[73] above), this claim for breach of contract must be
                    re-examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     However, the answer must still be the same in
                    that JPW could not have been entitled to damages from Hup Hin. As a matter of
                    principle, damages can only be awarded if a claimant can prove that the
                    defendant’s breach of the contract <em>caused</em>
                    the loss sustained by the claimant. As this Court stated in <em>Salcon Ltd v United Cement Pte Ltd</em> [2004] 4 SLR(R) 353 at
                    [24], “[t]hat causation must be established before the question of
                    quantification of damages arises is obvious”. This element of causation,
                    however, was simply not made out in relation to Hup Hin’s alleged breach
                    of contract as JPW has not discharged its burden of proving that such a breach
                    was the “effective cause” (<em>Monarch Steamship
                        Co., Limited v Karlshamns Oljefabriker (A/B)</em> [1949] AC 196 at
                    212) of the loss. Here, as Hup Hin rightly submitted, the accident was caused by
                    the failure in JPW’s work system and would likely have happened <em>even if Hup Hin had not committed the alleged breaches</em>.
                    As such, it was unnecessary to inquire if Hup Hin did breach those Conditions or
                    not.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Whether MA breached the subcontracts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     JPW argued that MA breached the subcontracts
                    by failing to observe, comply with and carry out all workplace safety and health
                    requirements in that: (a) the Lifting Supervisor failed to ensure that the
                    ground conditions were safe for the lifting operations; (b) the Lifting
                    Supervisor failed to take measures to rectify Lian’s concerns about the
                    muddy ground; (c) the Lifting Supervisor commenced lifting operations
                    without a valid permit-to-work; and (d) the Lifting Supervisor failed to
                    comply with the Safety Officer’s express instructions to remove the crane
                    from the washing bay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     With regard to point (d), as the Safety
                    Officer never gave such an instruction (explained above at [32]–[34]), it
                    can be dismissed. However, with regard to the first three points, given that the
                    Lifting Supervisor was MA’s representative (and was not seconded to JPW)
                    when the accident occurred, in our view MA did <em>breach</em> those requirements due to the Lifting Supervisor’s
                    lapses. Clause 7.13.2 of the Conditions in the RC Subcontract reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Prior to commencing work on Site the Subcontractor shall make itself aware

                        and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $20,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     Hence, MA did breach the
                subcontracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Apportionment of liability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     In deciding that both JPW and MA were liable
                    in negligence to Moh Seng, and that MA did breach the subcontracts that it had
                    entered into with JPW, we felt that an apportionment of 60% to JPW and 40% to MA
                    would be just in all the circumstances. As the main contractor, as well as
                    occupier under the WSHA, JPW had to bear the bulk of the responsibility for
                    failing to identify an underground hazard like the manhole, and taking measures
                    to ensure that it ceased to be an unknown danger. However, we were also
                    cognisant of the fact that MA was largely in charge of the works that were in
                    the area, and specifically, the operation of lifting steel rebars that
                    Lian’s crane was engaged in. Also, the Lifting Supervisor was under
                    MA’s employment and had specific duties under the WSH Regime which he
                    failed to fulfil.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In view of the foregoing, we made the
                    following orders on liability: the appeal in relation to Moh Seng and Hup Hin
                    was dismissed, whilst the appeal in relation to MA was allowed in part such that
                    liability was apportioned 60% to JPW and 40% to MA. We also made the following
                    orders in relation to costs:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_a"></a>(a)     the costs of Moh Seng for the trial
                        below were to be borne by JPW and MA in the proportion of 80% and 20%
                        respectively;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_b"></a>(b)     the costs of Moh Seng in this appeal were to be borne wholly by
                    JPW;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_c"></a>(c)     Hup Hin was
                        entitled to indemnity costs borne by JPW for both the trial below and this
                        appeal; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_86-p2_d"></a>(d)     no
                        orders were made between JPW and MA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Hup Hin was undoubtedly prejudiced by being
                    made to appear in such a long action and, in our opinion, without good reason.
                    As such, we ordered indemnity costs to be awarded to them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Subsequent to the hearing, JPW wrote in on
                    5 August 2013 requesting further arguments on the costs orders, citing an
                    offer to contribute pursuant to O22A r 11 that was allegedly made by JPW to
                    MA and Hup Hin well before the trial began. According to the letter, another
                    offer to contribute was made by MA after the trial commenced, and Moh Seng was
                    purportedly aware of these offers but did not respond to them. JPW hence
                    submitted that the Judge’s costs orders in relation to Moh Seng’s
                    costs should be set aside and reserved to the assessment Registrar; in
                    particular, MA should be made to bear at least some of Moh Seng’s costs in
                    that respect. This letter was followed by a flurry of letters from the parties
                    each taking various positions (Moh Seng on 16 and 23 August 2013, MA on
                    23 August 2013, and JPW once again on 3 October 2013).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     However, having considered what was put before
                    us, we were not willing to entertain any further arguments or change our orders
                    made during the hearing. Hence our orders on costs made during the hearing still
                    stand.</p>
