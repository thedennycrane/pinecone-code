In the first clip, the parties were arguing, with the appellant seated with her back against a door, while the respondent advanced towards her and raised his leg for a second before lowering it; he then snatched her phone with his hand. In the second clip, which was filmed after the first clip, the parties continued arguing as the appellant stood up and followed the respondent to the bedroom. The clip ended when the respondent screamed at the appellant to shut up.

</div> Second, the appellant argues that, in the course of her cross-examination of the respondent (which took only about a minute), she was repeatedly cut off and disallowed from completing her sentences and was controlled in the manner in which she could ask her questions. This shows that the Magistrate had little interest in understanding her case.

The appellant further suggests that the Magistrate rejected a question she raised during closing submissions as he wanted to conclude the matter hastily.

</div> Taken together, the Magistrate’s conduct amounts to judicial interference.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 At the oral submissions, the appellant submitted that r 100(1) of the FJR confines the Magistrate to making findings of fact based only on what was raised in oral evidence. This is because family violence hearings require a mindfulness to the facts, and credence should be placed on oral evidence. The breach of r 100(1) of the FJR was furthered by the Magistrate’s interventions in the appellant’s conduct of her case. In these circumstances, a re-trial should be ordered. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of the respondent’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The respondent raises three main grounds.

</div> As such, the Magistrate was entitled to consider the evidence therein. Second, the respondent disputes the appellant’s interpretation of r 100(1) of the FJR. On the appellant’s account, any evidence in an AIEC that is not raised in oral examination is considered unproven.

</div>
</div> This is incorrect. Rule 100(1) of the FJR only requires any finding of fact that is to be proven at a family violence trial to be done by way of an examination of the witness in court. In other words, only the facts going towards showing that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed, as well as that the PPO is necessary for the protection of the family member need to be raised in oral evidence.

The implication of this is that the court may not consider evidence contained in an AEIC unless it was raised in oral testimony. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 A review of r 100 of the FJR shows that the appellant’s interpretation is incorrect. Affidavit evidence may be considered by the court, even if it is not raised in oral testimony. To begin, r 100(2) of the FJR states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)   Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), and unless otherwise provided by any written law or by these Rules, at a family violence trial —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) evidence‑in‑chief of a witness must be given by way of affidavit; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) unless the Court otherwise orders —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) the witness must attend trial for cross‑examination; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) in default of the witness’ attendance, the witness’ affidavit shall not be received in evidence except with the leave of the Court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Rules 100(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 100(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) make clear that the evidence-in-chief of a witness is to be received in evidence by way of affidavit, barring their absence at trial for cross-examination. Rule 100(3) further stipulates that the documents used in conjunction with an affidavit must be exhibited (with a copy to be annexed), suggesting that documents attached to the affidavits may also be considered by the court. Of significance is also r 100(7) of the FJR, which provides an exception to rr 100(2), 100(3), 100(4) and 100(6) (“the Provisions”). Pursuant to r 100(7)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), a court may order a witness to give evidence orally at a family violence trial. This stands in contradistinction against the Provisions, which generally pertain to the use of affidavits of evidence-in-chief in a family violence trial. This further confirms that the evidence of a witness is ordinarily to be given by way of an affidavit. It is thus evident, on a holistic review of r 100 of the FJR, that r 100(1) does not restrict the court to only considering oral evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Beyond r 100 of the FJR, a review of the general schema of legislation governing family violence hearings points to the same conclusion. Rule 101(4) of the FJR, which governs the family violence trial process, allows a court to deal with applications seeking a PPO or DEO without any oral testimony or examination of witnesses on fulfillment of two conditions. One of the two conditions is that there is no dispute on the facts stated in the affidavits filed by the parties: r 101(4)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the FJR. In such a situation, the court may then rely on the affidavits of parties in determining the relevant facts. This demonstrably undermines the appellant’s interpretation of r 100(1) of the FJR. The Family Justice Practice Directions (“FJPD”) is also instructive. At paragraph 24(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>), which concerns family violence proceedings, parties may apply to strike out the whole or parts of affidavits to be used in proceedings. That such applications are provided for only underscores the significance of affidavits in family violence proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 A review of the relevant legislation therefore shows that the appellant’s interpretation of r 100(1) of the FJR is untenable. It also bears noting that on the appellant’s interpretation of r 100(1) of the FJR, the AEICs that are tendered in family violence hearings are rendered otiose. If they may not be relied on to prove facts (as they are used to do so in other civil proceedings), it is unclear what purpose they serve. When pressed on this point, the appellant suggested, in oral submissions, that the purpose of AEICs in family violence hearings differ from that in other civil proceedings; AEICS in the former delineate the evidence that may be given orally but do not go towards establishing facts while AEICs in the latter may be relied on to prove facts. This distinguishment, however, is without basis or merit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In sum, r 100(1) of the FJR does not restrict a court to only considering oral testimony in making findings of fact. Instead, the court may consider all admissible evidence, including affidavit evidence and oral testimony.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Magistrate is in breach of r 100(1) of the FJR</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 It follows from the foregoing that the Magistrate is not in breach of r 100(1) of the FJR by making findings of facts based on the evidence contained in the respondent’s AEIC. The AEIC of the respondent was admitted into evidence, the appellant provided her account of the events during her examination-in-chief (as she had not filed an AEIC), and both the respondent and appellant tested each other’s evidence through cross-examination. The respondent further confirms that all the findings of fact made by the Magistrate are grounded in either affidavit evidence or the oral testimony of parties. Pertinently, the appellant does not go so far to suggest that the Magistrate has made findings of fact beyond what was contained in affidavit evidence or oral testimony but simply that the Magistrate should not have relied on the respondent’s AEIC as part of his consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 As for the allegation that the Magistrate furthered the breaches of r 100(1) of the FJR through his interventions, this falls away given that it is premised on the appellant’s interpretation of the said rule, which I have rejected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 However, assuming, <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span>, that the appellant’s interpretation of r 100(1) of the FJR is correct, there remains no basis for the appellant’s complaint against the Magistrate. The general tenor of the appellant’s submission is that the Magistrate should have done more to clarify or put forth some pertinent points of the appellant’s case to the respondent, notwithstanding that the appellant had chosen to conclude her cross-examination after one question.

</div>
</div> Oral evidence concerning the appellant’s case, as put forth by the Magistrate on behalf of the appellant, may then be relied on to make findings of fact. Beyond a bare reliance of r 100(1) of the FJR, no further reasons have been offered as to why this should be expected of the Magistrate. As conceded by the appellant, neither the notion of therapeutic justice nor the judge-led approach in resolving family disputes lend themselves to justifying the demands she imposes on the Magistrate. Examining paragraph 6(9) of the FJPD, which outlines the key principles of the judge-led approach in resolving family disputes, it is apparent that the judge-led approach is not conceived in such expansive terms such that the court is to advance the cases of litigants-in-person on their behalf. And as further conceded by the appellant, on a traditional umpire view of judicial management, there is no reason why the Magistrate should advocate on behalf of the appellant. Ultimately, given the appellant’s choice not to ask further questions or advance her case (and not by any consequence of the Magistrate’s interventions, as explained below at [24]), no fault may be attributed to the Magistrate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Finally, there is no basis for the appellant’s suggestion that the Magistrate was “primed” by the respondent’s submissions. The appellant relies on paragraph seven of the GD as proof that the Magistrate adopted the respondent’s submissions as evidence.

</div> Plainly, the appellant’s characterisation of the statement is unsustainable. It is not within even the penumbra of the meaning of the words used. The Magistrate was merely explaining to the appellant that if she did not have any further questions in cross-examination, parties may move on to their closing submissions. On no account of the Magistrate’s statement could it be suggested that he conveyed an impression to the appellant that her case was made out. It further beggars belief on what basis the appellant suggests that the Magistrate sought to hastily complete the appellant’s cross-examination of the respondent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Apart from the above incidents, the appellant separately submits that the Magistrate rejected a question she raised during closing submissions as he wanted to conclude the matter hastily.

</div> Again, a review of the transcript shows this to be untrue. The Magistrate answered the questions raised by the appellant, and checked with her repeatedly if she had any further submissions before turning to the respondent.

Control needs to be exercised by the presiding judge to ensure not just proper use of court time and resources, but also to be fair to the other side: the court cannot give such aid or indulgence that it tilts the scale in favour of one or the other. In the interests of the administration of justice, <span class="font-italic">pro se</span> litigants may need to be moved along, or on other occasions, cut off: an appellate court will not be so ready to find interference or conclude that there was any shortcoming in the conduct and management of a case by a judge attempting to control matters that threaten to spin out of control.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In all, no reasons were raised by the appellant such that the appeal against the decision of the Magistrate should be granted.
