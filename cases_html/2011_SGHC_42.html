        Woo Bih Li J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff Chong Sze Pak (“the
                    Plaintiff”) and the defendant Chong Ser Yoong (“the
                    Defendant”) are brothers. The Plaintiff is 18 years older than the
                    Defendant. The Plaintiff claims the net sale proceeds of about $300,000 from the
                    sale by the Defendant of a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”)
                    flat at Block 108C McNair Road #25-216 Singapore 324108 (“the McNair Road
                    property”) which was registered in the name of the
                Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In or about 1996 or 1997, the Plaintiff’s
                    property at 44B Starlight Road, Singapore was acquired by the relevant authority
                    and the Plaintiff received about $400,000 as compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In or about 1997, the Defendant sold his HDB
                    flat at Block 77 Commonwealth Drive #04-537, Singapore (“the
                    Defendant’s Commonwealth Drive property”) for $137,000 and received
                    about $100,000 from the sale.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       By an agreement dated 6 June 1997, the
                    Defendant agreed to buy an HDB flat at Block 8 Tronoh Road #02-15, Singapore
                    (“the Tronoh Road property”) for $286,000 from third parties. The
                    sale and purchase was completed on 9 October 1997. The circumstances
                    leading to the purchase and the beneficial ownership of the Tronoh Road property
                    were disputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Subsequently, in August 1999, the Tronoh Road
                    property was acquired by the relevant authority as part of a Selective En Bloc
                    Redevelopment Scheme. The Defendant was offered and he accepted a replacement
                    flat, <em>ie</em>, the McNair Road property as part of the
                    overall compensation for the acquisition. The McNair Road property was
                    transferred to the Defendant in or about 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 25 November 2009, the Plaintiff lodged a
                    caveat in respect of the McNair Road property. It is not clear whether this was
                    before or after the Defendant had entered into an agreement to sell it to a
                    third party. In any event, upon learning about the caveat, the Defendant agreed
                    that his solicitors would hold the net sale proceeds of the McNair Road property
                    pending the outcome of this action in exchange for the removal of the caveat so
                    that the sale and purchase of the McNair Road property could be completed. The
                    completion was in 2010.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Plaintiff claimed that when the Defendant
                    acquired the Tronoh Road property in 1997, the parties agreed that if the
                    Plaintiff paid for all the outgoings of that property, including the instalment
                    payments to repay an HDB loan and conservancy charges, the Defendant would hold
                    that property in trust for the Plaintiff. This was evidenced by a Deed of Trust
                    dated 23 June 1997 (“the Trust Deed”) executed by the
                    Defendant and also a Power of Attorney (“the PA”) dated
                    14 July 1997 executed by the Defendant in favour of the Plaintiff. In
                    reliance on the agreement, the Plaintiff paid various outgoings for that
                    property which I shall elaborate on later. The Plaintiff also claimed that when
                    the Defendant acquired the McNair Road property, the Defendant again orally
                    assured the Plaintiff that if he continued to pay the outgoings for the McNair
                    Road property, the Defendant would hold that property in trust for the Plaintiff
                    and that when that property was sold, the net sale proceeds would be paid to the
                    Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The Plaintiff’s pleaded claim to the net
                    sale proceeds was based on an express trust or a resulting or a constructive
                    trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Defendant alleged that both the Tronoh Road
                    property and the McNair Road property belonged to him. He also asserted that if
                    there was a trust of these two properties in favour of the Plaintiff, it was
                    void under the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 1997 Rev Ed)
                    (“HDA”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     There are two main issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_a"></a>(a)     firstly, whether the Defendant held
                        the Tronoh Road property and the McNair Road property in trust for the
                        Plaintiff; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_b"></a>(b)     secondly, even if he did, whether the Plaintiff was entitled to the net
                        sale proceeds of the McNair Road property in view of s 51(4) and (5) of
                        the HDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The witnesses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Plaintiff and the Defendant were the two
                    material witnesses. A housing agent, Lim Chin Seng, was a witness for the
                    Defendant but his evidence was immaterial. The solicitor, Mr Ng Cher Yeow
                    (“Mr Ng”) who had apparently prepared the Trust Deed and the PA
                    and witnessed the Defendant’s execution of both the documents, had passed
                    away.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the Defendant held the Tronoh Road property and the McNair
                Road property in trust for the Plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The different versions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     According to the Plaintiff, it was the
                    Defendant who approached him in June 1997 and told him that he wanted to
                    purchase the Tronoh Road property. The Defendant requested the Plaintiff’s
                    financial assistance. The Plaintiff and the Defendant agreed that if the
                    Plaintiff paid for the outgoings of the Tronoh Road property, the Defendant
                    would hold the Tronoh Road property on behalf of the Plaintiff. By
                    “outgoings”, the Plaintiff meant, for example, the monthly
                    payments to repay a loan taken from the HDB to purchase the Tronoh Road property
                    and the conservancy charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Plaintiff alleged that to assure him that
                    he was the beneficial owner of the Tronoh Road property, the Defendant engaged a
                    solicitor Mr Ng to prepare the Trust Deed which the Defendant executed on
                    23 June 1997. To further assure the Plaintiff, the Defendant also
                    instructed Mr Ng to prepare the PA from the Defendant to the Plaintiff which
                    allowed the Plaintiff to purchase and manage the Tronoh Road property in the
                    name of the Defendant. The PA was executed by the Defendant on 14 July
                    1997.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Plaintiff alleged that he paid the
                    following:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the initial downpayment of $5,000 for the
                            purchase;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">housing agent’s commission of
                            $2,945.80;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">annual fire insurance premium;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">monthly payments to repay the HDB
                        loan;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the power supply which was applied for in the
                            Plaintiff’s name;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the monthly conservancy charges.</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(g)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$11,200 on completion of the
                        purchase;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(h)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$5,138.90 as HDB’s conveyancing fee ($630)
                            and a stamp or registration fee ($4,490) and also another $110 as a
                            caveat fee for the Defendant’s purchase.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Plaintiff alleged that subsequently, at
                    the Defendant’s request, he also paid the outgoings like the monthly
                    payments on the HDB loan and the monthly conservancy charges on the McNair Road
                    property after it was registered in the name of the Defendant. He denied that he
                    used the rent from each of these two properties to pay for outgoings like the
                    monthly payments on the HDB loan and the monthly conservancy charges. He said
                    that he handed the rent to the Defendant through a man whom he referred to as
                    “uncle” but he did not know the actual name of this man who was
                    the Defendant’s representative.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     I should also mention that under the Trust
                    Deed, the Defendant was to transfer the Tronoh Road property to the
                    Plaintiff’s son Chong Chin Hock when he attained the age of 35. This was
                    in two years’ time (from the date of execution of the Trust Deed),
                        <em>ie</em>, 1999. I will set out the terms of the
                    Trust Deed later. The Plaintiff alleged that over the years, the Defendant
                    avoided his obligation many times to transfer the Tronoh Road property to his
                    son but, nevertheless, the Plaintiff expected to recoup what he had spent in
                    respect of the two properties when the Defendant eventually decided to sell the
                    McNair Road property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Defendant’s version was that it was
                    the Plaintiff who approached him in 1997 to buy the Tronoh Road property to
                    house foreign workers employed by the Plaintiff’s business which was a
                    garment factory at Kallang Bahru in Singapore. As the Defendant had sold his
                    Commonwealth Drive property, “he needed to buy another flat” (see
                    Defence at para 5). He was given a grant of $40,000 pursuant to a housing scheme
                    because the Tronoh Road property was within a certain distance from his
                    mother’s residence. With this money and the $100,000 from the sale of the
                    Defendant’s Commonwealth Drive property, he did not need financial
                    assistance from the Plaintiff to buy the Tronoh Road property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     He said that the $40,000 grant was paid into
                    his account with the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) and used to
                    pay the vendor of the Tronoh Road property. Another $3,000 was used from his CPF
                    account to pay the vendor. That was why when the McNair Road property was sold,
                    about $57,000 from the sale proceeds thereof was refunded to his CPF account.
                    This was for the principal used and interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Defendant did not deny his signature on
                    the Trust Deed. He said that Mr Ng was not engaged by him but by the Plaintiff.
                    He was asked to sign the document and he did so in the presence of Mr Ng without
                    understanding the nature of the document as he did not understand many of the
                    words therein. He said he was educated in Chinese and that his English was not
                    good. No one explained the document to him in Chinese. The first time that he
                    came to learn about the Trust Deed was after the Plaintiff had lodged a caveat
                    in respect of the McNair Road property in November 2009 to prevent him from
                    completing a sale thereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Defendant said that in 1997 he was busy in
                    China trying to do business there. He was in Singapore in that year for half the
                    time. From 1998 to 2003, he was in China for 70% to 80% of the time. That was
                    why he gave the PA to the Plaintiff. He accepted that he had signed the PA and
                    understood the nature of that document. In 2003, he visited his son in the
                    United States of America and stayed there for five years, returning to Singapore
                    in about October 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In 2004, the Defendant acquired the McNair
                    Road property in exchange for the Tronoh Road property as mentioned above. The
                    Defendant also received $30,000 cash of which he said he used $10,000 for
                    renovations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Defendant alleged that some of the
                    payments made by the Plaintiff like those stated in [14(a), (b), (g) and (h)]
                    above were actually funded from cash which he had handed over to the Plaintiff
                    to make payments on his behalf. As for outgoings like the monthly payments to
                    repay the HDB loan and the monthly conservancy charges, he said that the
                    Plaintiff had managed the Tronoh Road property and then the McNair Road property
                    on his behalf and used the rent from these properties to pay the outgoings
                    although he did not know how much rent had been collected by the Plaintiff. He
                    claimed that he had asked the Plaintiff for information about the rent over the
                    years but did not receive clear information about the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The Defendant also alleged that even though
                    the Plaintiff’s son Chong Chin Hock reached the age of 35 in 1999, the
                    Plaintiff took no step to get the Tronoh Road property or the McNair Road
                    property transferred to the son.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     On the other hand, the Defendant himself had
                    not taken any step to recover from the Plaintiff the balance of any rent
                    received from the letting out of the two properties, after deduction for the
                    monthly payments for the HDB loan and the conservancy charges. He said he had
                    been advised to await the outcome of the present action.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Trust Deed</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The terms of the PA are not material. The
                    terms of the Trust Deed were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This Trust Deed is made the 23<sup>rd</sup> day of June
                        One Thousand Nine Hundred and Ninety-seven (1997).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I, CHONG SER YOONG, NRIC NO. [xxx], (“the Trustee”)
                        hereby acknowledge and declare that:-</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am holding my share of the Housing and Development Board
                        (“HDB”) flat at Block 8 Tronoh Road #02-15 Singapore 330008 ON
                        TRUST for my brother, CHONG SZE PAK NRIC NO: [xxx] and his son CHONG
                        CHIN HOCK, NRIC NO. [xxx]) as my said brother provided and is providing
                        the full purchase price including stamp and legal fees for the purchase of
                        the Housing and Development Board flat at Blk 8 Tronoh Road #02-15 Singapore
                        330008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon the said CHONG CHIN HOCK, attaining the age of thirty-five (35)
                        years, I undertake to transfer the said HDB flat to him, with all stamp,
                        legal and HDB administrative fees to be paid by CHONG CHIN HOCK or my
                        brother CHONG SZE PAK.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be seen, the terms stipulated that the Defendant was holding
                    the Tronoh Road property in trust for both the Plaintiff and his son Chong Chin
                    Hock and not just for the Plaintiff alone. They also recorded the
                    Defendant’s undertaking to transfer the property to Chong Chin Hock when
                    he attained the age of 35.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The court’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Plaintiff said that at the time when the
                    Tronoh Road property was purchased in the name of the Defendant, he was not
                    eligible to purchase an HDB flat. Neither was his son until he reached the age
                    of 35 as his son was single then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     I should mention that in the Plaintiff’s
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), the Plaintiff mentioned
                    (in para 5 thereof) that the Defendant had assured him that the Trust Deed and
                    the PA had been submitted to and approved by HDB. Yet, this was not pleaded in
                    the Statement of Claim or in the Reply. His cause of action against the
                    Defendant was not for misrepresentation. Indeed, the Defendant was not
                    cross-examined on this point although I should also mention that the Plaintiff
                    was also not cross-examined on this point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is common ground that the HDB did not
                    approve the Trust Deed. It is obvious to me that the Defendant did not represent
                    to the Plaintiff that the HDB had approved the same and there was no question of
                    the Plaintiff having believed and acted upon the same. If the Defendant could
                    hold the Tronoh Road property in trust for the Plaintiff and his son, there was
                    no reason why that property could not instead be registered in the name of the
                    Plaintiff. There would have been no need to use the Defendant’s name. It
                    was because the Plaintiff knew that the HDB would not have allowed him to
                    purchase the Tronoh Road property, whether for himself or for his son, that he
                    had to use the name of the Defendant who was then eligible to purchase that
                    property. It was he who approached the Defendant to help him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Plaintiff’s version that the
                    Defendant signed the Trust Deed because the Defendant had obtained financial
                    assistance from him was nonsensical. If the financial assistance was a loan,
                    then the Defendant’s obligation would be simply to repay the loan.
                    However, the Trust Deed was not a security document to repay a loan. It was only
                    compatible with the conclusion that the Defendant’s name was being used by
                    the Plaintiff to buy the Tronoh Road property which would eventually be for the
                    benefit of the Plaintiff’s son. This was not a case of the Defendant being
                    so grateful to the Plaintiff for his financial assistance that he was prepared
                    to give up a property, which he intended to buy for himself, to the
                    Plaintiff’s son. After all, the Defendant had two children of his own
                    then.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It was also clear to me that it was the
                    Plaintiff who required the Defendant to sign the Trust Deed. In all probability,
                    Mr Ng was the Plaintiff’s solicitor and had prepared the Trust Deed on the
                    Plaintiff’s instruction. It was not disputed that the Plaintiff made at
                    least one payment of $500 to Mr Ng although it was not clear whether this was to
                    pay for the preparation of the Trust Deed or both the Trust Deed and the
                    PA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Therefore, I reject the Plaintiff’s
                    version as to why the Tronoh Road property was purchased. I also reject the
                    Defendant’s version, <em>ie</em>, that the Tronoh
                    Road property was bought for the Defendant’s benefit and that he did not
                    understand the nature of the Trust Deed he had executed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     It will be recalled that in para 5 of his
                    Defence, the Defendant had pleaded that he “needed” to buy another
                    flat at the material time as he had sold his Commonwealth Drive property. Yet,
                    when I asked him why he sold his Commonwealth Drive property, his instinctive
                    response was that he wanted to use the sale proceeds for his business. It was
                    after giving that evidence that he then said that the Plaintiff had informed him
                    about the Tronoh Road property and he thought it was a good purchase as he would
                    get a $40,000 grant because it was near his mother’s residence. However,
                    there was no suggestion in his evidence that he was actively looking for an
                    alternative property after selling his Commonwealth Drive property. Indeed his
                    evidence was that after the sale of his Commonwealth Drive property, he was
                    staying at a shophouse at Block 46-2 #01-376 Commonwealth Drive, Singapore
                    whenever he was in Singapore. He referred to the shophouse as his father’s
                    although the Plaintiff’s evidence was that the registered tenants thereof
                    were two of their siblings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As for the Trust Deed, it was a one-page
                    document couched in simple English. While the Defendant alluded to his poor
                    English, he was able to give his oral evidence in English without the aid of an
                    interpreter. Also, he said that he understood his AEIC, which was more
                    complicated than the Trust Deed, after his counsel Mr Joseph explained his AEIC
                    to him in English. Apparently, there was no need for his AEIC to be interpreted
                    to him in Chinese. Yet, he had complained that no one had interpreted the Trust
                    Deed to him in Chinese before he executed it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     I add that the Defendant did not suggest that
                    his English had improved markedly after his five years’ stay in the USA
                    between 2003 to 2007. Indeed, he said that even after he learned about the Trust
                    Deed in 2009 (after the Plaintiff had lodged his caveat based on the Trust
                    Deed), he still did not understand that document until Mr Joseph and a male
                    Indian friend (who was in court) had explained it to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     I conclude that the Defendant understood the
                    nature and the terms of the Trust Deed when he executed it. He did so because
                    the Tronoh Road property was not bought for him but eventually for the benefit
                    of the Plaintiff’s son using his name because the Plaintiff’s son
                    and the Plaintiff were not eligible to acquire it then. The Plaintiff and the
                    Defendant were acting in breach of the relevant legislation or rules and that is
                    why each came up with a version which I find to be untrue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     There was documentary evidence that some money
                    from the Defendant’s CPF account was used to partially pay for the Tronoh
                    Road property. There was a letter dated 9 April 2010 from the HDB stating
                    that about $57,000 was refunded to his CPF account from the sale proceeds of the
                    McNair Road property. However, there was no other documentary evidence to
                    establish just how much had been used from his CPF account to acquire the Tronoh
                    Road property. It appears that the $40,000 grant (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above) was indeed paid into the Defendant’s CPF
                    account in 1997 and then used to partially pay the vendor of the Tronoh Road
                    property as the Defendant had alleged. Indeed, this was conceded by the
                    Plaintiff in the closing written submission for the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, it was unclear whether another $3,000
                    was used from the Defendant’s CPF account to partially pay for the Tronoh
                    Road property.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On the other hand, there was documentary
                    evidence that payment of a $5,000 deposit and the housing agent’s
                    commission and the conveyancing fee, and a stamp or registration fee and caveat
                    paid in 1997 in respect of the Tronoh Road property (see [14(b) and (h)] above)
                    were paid from an account of the Plaintiff’s business known as Leng Guan
                    Shirt Co. Indeed, the Defendant did not dispute this as such. His allegation was
                    that he had given the Plaintiff cash to make such payments for him but there was
                    no documentary evidence to substantiate this aspect of the Defendant’s
                    allegation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     There was also no dispute that the monthly
                    payments to repay the HDB loan and the conservancy charges were paid by the
                    Plaintiff. However, the Defendant said that the Plaintiff used the rent to pay
                    the same. Although the Plaintiff denied using the rent to do so, his initial
                    reason for this denial seemed to be that there was no need to use the rent and
                    also, the rent was not substantial. Yet, after he was cross-examined, he alleged
                    that he had paid the rent to the Defendant over the years through a man referred
                    to as “uncle” who was the Defendant’s representative (see
                        <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above). If this was true, the
                    Plaintiff would have said this at the earliest opportunity to rebut the
                    Defendant’s allegation that he had used the rent to make the monthly
                    repayments to HDB and the conservancy charges. It is clear to me that the
                    Plaintiff had kept the rent consistent with the original arrangement that the
                    Defendant was not to have any beneficial interest in the Tronoh Road property
                    (and, subsequently, the McNair Road property).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Based on the available evidence, I also
                    conclude that except for payments made from the Defendant’s CPF account,
                    he did not make any other payments in respect of the purchase of the Tronoh Road
                    property whether directly or indirectly through the Plaintiff. The other
                    payments were made by the Plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Not much evidence was given about the alleged
                    oral assurance given by the Defendant to the Plaintiff when the McNair Road
                    property was acquired by the Defendant. I find that the initial oral agreement
                    in 1997 as alleged by the Plaintiff did not exist and also that there was no
                    subsequent oral assurance by the Defendant in 2004 when he acquired the McNair
                    Road property. The parties had simply carried on with the previous arrangement
                    in 1997 stated in <a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the circumstances, I find that the
                    Defendant held the Tronoh Road property, and subsequently the McNair Road
                    property, on an express trust for the Plaintiff and his son Chong Chin Hock. The
                    intended ultimate beneficiary was the son.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The HDA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Section 51(4) and (5) of the HDA
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) No trust in respect of any such flat, house or other building [that
                        has been sold by the HDB under Part IV of HDA] shall be created by the owner
                        thereof without the prior written approval of the Board.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5) Every trust which purports to be created in respect of any such flat,
                        house or other building without the prior written approval of the Board
                        shall be void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Although the Tronoh Road property was not
                    purchased by the Defendant directly from the HDB, it was not disputed that it is
                    a flat that has been sold by the HDB in that HDB was the original
                vendor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Before I continue, I will first deal with a
                    preliminary point raised for the Plaintiff in respect of this issue.
                    Plaintiff’s counsel Mr Gurdaib Singh submitted that the Defendant was not
                    entitled to rely on the relevant provisions of the HDA as illegality was not
                    pleaded by the Defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     
          <em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler, SC) (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 18/8/8
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>18/8/8. Illegality</b>. Although facts giving
                        rise to illegality are required to be pleaded (see r 8(1); <em>Clarke v Callow</em> (1876) 46 LJQB 53; <em>Lee Pee Eng v Ho Sin Leow</em> [1958] SCR 18, at 19; cf
                            <em>Mustafa bin Osman v Lee Chua</em> [1996] 2 MLJ
                        141), it would seem that in certain circumstances the court may be prepared
                        to make a finding of illegality in the absence of such a plea. Where the
                        contract appears illegal on its face, as in the case where it clearly
                        contravenes statute or public policy (see <em>Philips v
                            Copping</em> [1935] 1 KB 15, at 21), or the evidence adduced by
                        either party indicates illegality, the court may make such a finding in the
                        absence of a plea. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If the contract does not appear to be illegal on its face, evidence of
                        circumstances showing that it has an illegal object will not be admitted
                        unless those circumstances are pleaded (<em>North Western
                            Salt v Electrolytic Alkali</em> [1914] AC 461). For a succinct
                        account of the court’s approach to illegality, see the judgment of
                        Devlin J in <em>Edler v Auerbach</em> [1950] 1 KB 359,
                        at 371 (accepted as correct by Willmer LJ in <em>Snell v
                            Unity Finance</em> [1964] 2 QB 203 and endorsed by the Federal
                        Court in Singapore in <em>Seven Seas Supply v
                            Rajoo</em> [1966] 1 MLJ 71 at 74). ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It is true that the Defence did not plead the
                    provisions of the HDA or state specifically that any trust in favour of the
                    Plaintiff was void or illegal as it was in contravention of the
                HDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The point was raised later in para 15 of the
                    Defendant’s AEIC which referred to s 51(4) and (5) HDA. That para
                    also referred to s 51(6) HDA but that provision was introduced only in 2005
                    as I shall elaborate on later.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Although the Defendant’s AEIC was
                    executed on 27 December 2010, no attempt was made to amend his Defence to
                    plead the point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Opening Statement for the Defendant was
                    filed on 18 January 2011. It stated the following issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a.    Whether the Defendant knew he signed the Trust
                            Deed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b.    Who engaged the lawyer to prepare the Trust
                            Deed/Power of Attorney. The lawyer has since passed away.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c.    Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to claim in
                            equity as Trust Deed is not valid.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The third issue was not a reference to the
                    provisions of the HDA but rather a reference to the allegation in para 2a of the
                    Opening Statement that the Defendant was not aware of the nature of the Trust
                    Deed he had signed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     It appears that the Defendant’s counsel
                    had lost his way somewhat. First, he should have pleaded in the Defence that any
                    trust in favour of the Plaintiff was void in view of the HDA. Having failed to
                    do so, this point was then raised in the Defendant’s AEIC but still no
                    attempt was made to amend the Defence. Then the Opening Statement for the
                    Defendant omitted to make the point.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     Nevertheless, the Plaintiff was aware of the
                    point. Indeed, the Opening Statement for the Plaintiff set out the issues as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The Defendant claims that he had no knowledge of
                            the Trust Deed executed on 23<sup>rd</sup> June 1997.
                            The Defendant is English educated and would have known what he was
                            signing for.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    The Defendant had engaged his own lawyers to
                            prepare the said Trust Deed and the Power of Attorney both of which were
                            executed closer in time to one another (difference of three (3)
                            weeks).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    The HDB Act does not recognize Trust Deed relating
                            to HDB flat. The Plaintiff is making his claims based on
                        equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The reference in [52(c)] above to the HDB Act
                    was really a reference to the HDA. As can be seen, the Plaintiff acknowledged
                    the statutory prohibition against a trust. He sought to avoid the prohibition by
                    suggesting that while he could not claim either property through the Trust Deed,
                    he could claim the sale proceeds of the McNair Road property in
                equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Furthermore, when the Plaintiff was
                    cross-examined as to whether he or his son was eligible to acquire the Tronoh
                    Road property in 1997, Mr Singh did not object to this line of
                    questioning.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In the circumstances, I am of the view that
                    the Defendant is not precluded from relying on the relevant provisions of the
                    HDA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     It is common ground that neither the Plaintiff
                    nor his son Chong Chin Hock was eligible to acquire the Tronoh Road property at
                    the material time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In the circumstances, the express trust in
                    favour of the Plaintiff and his son is null and void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     The Plaintiff’s attempt to claim the
                    sale proceeds (of the McNair Road property) under a resulting trust, must also
                    fail, see <em>Cheong Yoke Kuen and others v Cheong Kwok
                        Kiong</em> [1999] 1 SLR(R) 1126 (“<em>Cheong</em>”) at [13]
                    –
                    [19]. As for his claim under a
                    constructive trust, this is not a case of a constructive trust as explained in
                        <em>Cheong</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     In 2005, the HDA was amended to put the matter
                    beyond doubt by the introduction of s 51(6) which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6) No person shall become entitled to any such flat, house or other
                        building under any resulting trust or constructive trust, whensoever
                        created.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Prior to the amendment, Mr Mah Bow Tan, the Minister for National
                    Development said of the relevant bill on 15 August 2005 (see Singapore
                    Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (15 August 2005) vol 80 at col
                    1252):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 6 of the Bill amends s 51 to <em>make it
                            clear</em> that, in addition to prohibiting the voluntary creation
                        of trusts over an HDB flat, the Act also prohibits any person from becoming
                        entitled to a HDB flat under a resulting trust or constructive trust. This
                        will help to prevent a situation where a person who is ineligible to own an
                        HDB flat may become entitled to own one, for example, by paying the purchase
                        price of the flat on behalf of the owner.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I should mention that para 28 of the closing
                    submission for the Plaintiff referred to a case (<em>Ho Seek
                        Yueng Novel v J &amp; V Development Pte Ltd</em> [2006]
                    2 SLR(R) 742) which was in respect of a loan. It appears that Mr Singh
                    also lost his way somewhat or was acting in desperation. In the present action,
                    the Plaintiff’s pleaded claim is not based on a loan.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The Plaintiff’s claim is dismissed. The
                    Defence claimed an order for the sale proceeds held by the Defendant’s
                    solicitors, Messrs James Joseph &amp; Associates to be released to the Defendant
                    solely. This claim should have been formally pleaded as a counterclaim by the
                    Defendant. Nevertheless, as that order is the natural consequence of the failure
                    of the Plaintiff’s claim, I will order the net sale proceeds held by the
                    Defendant’s solicitors to be released to the Defendant
                solely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In the circumstances, each party is to bear
                    his own costs of the action.</p>
