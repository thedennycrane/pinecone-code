They lived together for several years with their own young children and the children from Ms Mytsyk’s former marriage, prior to Ms Mytsyk commencing divorce proceedings in August 2019. Shortly after filing for divorce, Ms Mytsyk also started a civil suit against Mr Anushka and Med Travel. This is HC/S 1247/2019 (“S 1247”), in which Mr Anushka is the first defendant and Med Travel is the second defendant. Ms Mytsyk’s co-plaintiffs in S 1247 are her father, one Hryhorii Liaskovskyi (“Mr Liaskovskyi”), and a company called Health &amp; Help Pte Ltd, (“Health &amp; Help”) in which she is currently the sole shareholder and director on record. In S 1247, Ms Mytsyk – together with her co-plaintiffs – seek <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>declarations that Mr Liaskovskyi is the true legal and beneficial owner of both Med Travel and Health &amp; Help. Most of the facts stated below are gleaned from the pleadings in S 1247 which are exhibited in Mr Anushka’s first affidavit in these proceedings.

According to Mr Anushka, Ms Mytsyk has failed to identify in her affidavit the capacity in which she is bringing the application. In any event, according to him, she cannot show that she has standing to bring the application as a shareholder of the company under s 216(1)(a) of the Companies Act, nor can she show that she is a “proper person” to bring the application, within the meaning of s 216(1)(c). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 First of all, I do not think it is accurate to say that Ms Mytsyk has failed to identify in her affidavit the capacity in which she is bringing the present application.

Based on various assertions made in her first affidavit, it would also seem clear that Ms Mytsyk has no intention to rely on s 216A(1)(a) by bringing the application in the capacity of a shareholder. This is because in her first affidavit, she claims that it was Mr Liaskovskyi who “provided the share capital for [Med Travel]” when it was incorporated;

</div> According to Ms Mytsyk, Mr Anushka had – despite repeated reminders – transferred only 50% of the shares to Mr Liaskovskyi, while “[retaining] the remaining 50% of the shares even though he was not supposed to”; and sometime later, he even “forged” Mr Liaskovskyi’s signature so as to “fraudulently” transfer this 50% shareholding from  Mr Liaskovskyi to Ms Mytsyk. Given these assertions, I understand it to be Ms Mytsyk’s position that Mr Liaskovskyi is the rightful owner of <span class="font-italic">100% </span>of the shares in Med Travel – and not Ms Mytsyk or Mr Anushka; further, that insofar as half of these shares have been transferred to her name, this was a “fraudulent” transfer”. Indeed, in her statement of claim in S 1247 which I alluded to earlier (and which is exhibited in Mr Anushka’s first affidavit), Ms Mytsyk seeks <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>a declaration that Mr Liaskovskyi is the <span class="font-italic">true legal and beneficial owner </span>of Med Travel. It is in this context that I conclude Ms Mytsyk has no intention to bring the present application in the capacity of a shareholder.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Pursuant to s 216A(1)(c) of the Companies Act, the court has the discretion to allow any person it regards as a “proper person” to apply for leave to bring a statutory derivative action. As I noted earlier, Ms Mytsyk has in her first affidavit made it clear that she takes the position she is not in reality the owner of the shares registered in her name, since she claims they were “fraudulently transferred” to her when they actually belong to Mr Liaskovskyi.

</div> I also note that she does not say anywhere in her affidavits that she is bringing OS 987 in the capacity of a nominee for Mr Liaskovskyi and on his behalf. As to whether a director of the company who is not concurrently a shareholder is a “proper person” to apply for leave under s 216A(1)(c), counsel for Ms Mytsyk did not make any submissions nor cite any authorities on this issue. Counsel appears to have taken it for granted that such a director must be a “proper person” for the purposes of s 216A(1)(c). I do not think the issue is so clear-cut.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In <span class="font-italic">Urs Meisterhans v GIP Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 1 SLR 552 (“<span class="font-italic">Urs Meisterhans</span>”), the plaintiff was a shareholder and former director of the defendant company on whose behalf he had applied for leave under s 216A to commence proceedings against two existing directors. The High Court dismissed the application on the basis that the intended proceedings were not shown to be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>in the interests of the company and that the plaintiff was not acting in good faith in making the application. In arriving at this conclusion, the court referred in passing to the issue of the category of persons whom the court would deem to be “a proper party” under s 216A(1)(c) and stated that such category of persons “would include a director of the company” (at [23]). This remark was, however, <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>, since the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Urs Meisterhans</span> was no longer a director of the company by the time he applied for leave under s 216A. As for the case of <span class="font-italic">Agus Irawan v Toh Teck Chye </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 471 (“<span class="font-italic">Agus Irawan</span>”), which the court in <span class="font-italic">Urs Meisterhans</span> referred to (at [23]), the plaintiff who applied for leave to commence a derivative action in the name of the defendant company in that case was a shareholder and former director of the defendant company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 When s 216A was introduced by way of amendment to the Companies Act, the <span class="font-italic">Report of the Select Committee on the Companies (Amendment) Bill (Bill no. 33/92)</span> (Parl 2 of 1993, 26 April 1993) (“the Select Committee Report”) stated (at [49]):  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The Committee holds the view that the proposed section 216A(1)(c) provides the Court with the discretion to extend the application of the section to any person who it thinks is a proper person to make the application under the section. In view of this wide power, the Committee thinks it not necessary to extend the application of the section to directors and debenture holders expressly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 An examination of the Select Committee Report indicates that the above statement arose from responses to a representation to the Select Committee which queried whether the term “complainant” in the proposed new s 216A(1) might “specifically include” a debenture holder and a director. In the views expressed by members of the Select Committee in response to the representation, some reservations were expressed as to whether debenture holders and directors who were not shareholders should be expressly included as complainants under the proposed new s 216A(1). <span class="font-italic">Inter alia</span>, it appears to have been suggested that the purpose of the proposed new s 216A(1) was really to protect minority shareholders, or at least persons with “interest” or “financial interest” in the company. In light of these concerns, the Select Committee’s eventual statement (see above at [16]) suggests that it concluded the most appropriate legislative solution was to provide the court with a “wide” discretion to extend the application of the new s 216A to any person whom it found to be a “proper person” to seek leave under the section – instead of providing for a blanket inclusion of all debenture holders and directors as “complainants” for the purposes of s 216A. In other words, depending on the circumstances of the case, the court may in its discretion permit the director of a company who is not concurrently a shareholder of the company to bring an application for leave under s 216A(1)(c).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In <span class="font-italic">Ganesh Paulraj v A&amp;T Offshore Pte Ltd and another </span>[2019] SGHC 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Ganesh Paulraj</span>”), the High Court was faced with an application for leave under s 216A(1)(c) by the beneficial owner of a company which owned 40% of the shares in the respondent company. In considering the scope of s 216A(1)(c), the court in <span class="font-italic">Ganesh Paulraj </span>held (at [12]) that the question was really whether the applicant had “<span class="font-italic">a clear interest and sufficient connection to the company</span>” to bring the leave application. On the facts before it, the court answered this question in the applicant’s favour.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 The High Court’s formulation in <span class="font-italic">Ganesh Paulraj </span>of the guiding principle behind s 216A(1)(c) (in italics above) appears to reflect the concern expressed by the Select Committee that applicants who were not shareholders but who wished to invoke s 216A should be able to show some “financial interest” – or at the very least, an “interest” – in how the company is being managed. Applying the formulation adopted by the court in <span class="font-italic">Ganesh Paulraj</span> and on the basis of the undisputed facts in the present case, I am prepared to accept that Ms Mytsyk has “a clear interest and sufficient connection to the company” to bring the present application. Ms Mytsyk is one of two directors in a company where various breaches of directors’ duties (mostly involving the misappropriation of company funds and the diversion of income due to the company) are being alleged against the other director – Mr Anushka; and the latter has vehemently denied these allegations. There is obviously no prospect of Mr Anushka agreeing to the company pursuing the allegations. Given the two parties’ opposing positions on the true status of the shareholders of Med Travel, there is also obviously no prospect of either of the registered shareholders making a s 216A application in their capacity as shareholders. In these circumstances, I am prepared to accept that in her capacity as director of Med Travel (and solely as such), Ms Mytsyk is a “proper person” to bring the application under s 216A(1)(c).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The issue of notice</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Under s 216A(3)(a), Ms Mytsyk is required to have given the directors of Med Travel 14 days’ notice of her intention to apply for leave to commence a statutory derivative action on behalf of the company. There is no dispute that her lawyers wrote to Mr Anushka on 4 August 2021 to give him notice

In <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments</span>, the High Court summarised the applicable principles as follows:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">42 There are two main facets to the “good faith” requirement: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [29]–[30]; <span class="font-italic">Maher v Honeysett and Maher Electrical Contractors </span>[2005] NSWSC 859 at [28]. The first relates to the merits of the proposed derivative action. The applicant must honestly or reasonably believe that a good cause of action exists for the company to prosecute. It follows as a corollary that an applicant may be found to lack good faith if it is shown that no reasonable person in his position, and knowing what he knows, could believe that the company had a good cause of action to prosecute…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">44 Secondly, an applicant may be found to be lacking in good faith if it can be demonstrated that he is bringing the derivative action for a collateral purpose: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [30]. The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that he or she is “genuinely aggrieved”, and that any collateral purpose is sufficiently consistent with the purpose of “doing justice to a company” so that he or she is not abusing the statutory remedy and, by extension, also the company, as a vehicle for the applicant’s own aims and interests: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [31], citing <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock and another v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span>”) at [19].</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">45 As regards this second facet of the good faith requirement, it will not suffice to show dislike, ill-feeling or personal animosity between the parties as hostility between warring factions within a company is commonplace. However, if it can be shown that the applicant is “so motivated by vendetta, perceived or real, that his judgment will be clouded by purely personal considerations”, then this would constitute a lack of good faith: <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock </span>at [20]. A history of grievances against the majority shareholders or the board would make it easier to characterise the derivative action as having been brought for no other purpose other than the satisfaction of the applicant’s private vendetta: <span class="font-italic">Swansson v R A Pratt Properties Pty Ltd </span>(2002) 42 ACSR 313 at [41], cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [13]. An applicant’s good faith will also be in doubt if he appears set on damaging the company out of sheer spite or for the benefit of a competitor: <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock </span>at [20]; <span class="font-italic">Wong Kai Wah v Wong Kai Yuan and another </span>[2014] SGHC 147 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Kai Wah</span>”) at [70].</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">46 In addition, any lack of good faith must relate to the commencement of the derivative action and not all past conduct of the applicant in general: <span class="font-italic">Fong Wai Lyn Carolyn v Airtrust (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 3 SLR 980 (“<span class="font-italic">Fong Wai Lyn Carolyn</span>”) at [75] and [79]; <span class="font-italic">IGM Resources Corp v 979708 Alberta Ltd </span>[2004] AJ No 1462 at [36]…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">47 In considering the requirement of good faith, a distinction between “motive” and “purpose” should be drawn. The element of good faith is “dependent less on the motives” behind the application and “more on the purpose of the proposed derivative action, which must have an obvious nexus with the company’s benefit or interests”: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [16]. In other words, it is not the questionable motivations of the applicant <span class="font-italic">per se </span>that amounts to bad faith; instead bad faith may be established where questionable motivations constitute a personal purpose which will be pursued at the expense of or in lieu of the company’s interests. In this sense, the requirements under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 216A(3)<span class="font-italic">(c) </span>of the CA are quite clearly inter-linked: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [13] and [16], citing <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock </span>at [20].</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">48 The good faith enquiry may also extend beyond the two main facets earlier identified, honest and reasonable belief in the merits, and purpose for bringing the application. It can also encompass considerations of the applicant’s conduct in the proceedings: Margaret Chew, <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) at para 6.043. For instance, the failure to be fully candid before the court would indicate a lack of good faith…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 As to how an applicant can discharge the burden of establishing his good faith, the following observations by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Petroships Investment </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd v Wealthplus Pte Ltd and others</span> [2015] SGHC 145

However, that case also establishes in the same paragraph that there is a legitimate – though, of course, never inevitable – inferential pathway from a finding that the objective test in s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) is satisfied to a finding that the subjective test in s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) is also satisfied…</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">72 <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> therefore accepts that the inquiry into an applicant’s good faith can overlap with the inquiry into whether the derivative action appears to be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company.

In <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span>, the High Court summarised these principles as follows:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify">152 The question at this stage of the inquiry is whether it appears to be <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>in the interests of Wealthplus for Petroships to bring the derivative action. The threshold test on this stage is directed towards the merits of the derivative action. The applicant must satisfy the court that the derivative action is legitimate and arguable: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [53] to [55]. The threshold test deliberately sets a low standard, precisely because it is only a <span class="font-italic">threshold </span>test. It operates to weed out “only the most obviously unmeritorious claims” (<span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [55]). But the statutory test under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) serves a broader purpose than just protecting the company from being compelled to pursue an obviously unmeritorious claim. The statutory test requires the court to consider the overall interests of the company in the round. This is one of the shortcomings of Petroships’ submissions: it assumes that passing the threshold test is sufficient to satisfy the entirety of the test under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>). That is not the correct approach.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">153 In addition to the threshold test on the merits, the test under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) comprises a consideration of whether the derivative action is in the practical and commercial interests of the company and of the alternative remedies available to the applicant: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [56]. This is a multifactorial inquiry. In order to satisfy the court that the derivative action is in the practical and commercial interests of the company, Palmer J held in <span class="font-italic">Swansson </span>that the applicant ought to put evidence on at least the following factors before the court:</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">57 First, there should be evidence as to the character of the company: different considerations may well apply depending on whether the company is a small, private company whose few shareholders are the members of a family or whether it is a large public listed company. If the company is a closely held family company, it may be relevant to take into account the effect of the proposed litigation on the purpose for which the company was established and on the family members who are the shareholders. If the company is a public listed company, such considerations will be irrelevant. Again, the company may be a joint venture company in which the venturers are deadlocked so that the proposed derivative action is seen as being for the purpose of vindicating one side’s position rather than the other’s in a way which will not achieve a useful result: see e.g. <span class="font-italic">Talisman Technologies Inc v Queensland Electronic Switching Pty Ltd </span>[2001] QSC 324.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">58 Second, there should be evidence of the business, if any, of the company so that the effects of the proposed litigation on its proper conduct may be appreciated.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">59 Third, there should be evidence enabling the Court to form a conclusion whether the substance of the redress which the applicant seeks to achieve is available by a means which does not require the company to be brought into litigation against its will. So, for example, if the applicant can achieve the desired result in proceedings in his or her own name it is not in the best interests of the company to be involved in litigation at all. This was the case in <span class="font-italic">Talisman Technologies </span>in which it appeared from the evidence that the most desirable outcome for the applicant was to obtain an order for specific performance of a contract, which it could do in a suit in which the company did not need to be a party.</div><div class="txt-body text-justify"></div><div class="txt-body text-justify">60 Fourth, there should be evidence as to the ability of the defendant to meet at least a substantial part of any judgment in favour of the company in the proposed derivative action so that the Court may ascertain whether the action would be of any practical benefit to the company.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">On whether Ms Mytsyk has satisfied the good faith requirement under s 216A(3)(b)</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">On Mr Anushka’s contention as to collateral purpose</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Bearing the above principles in mind, I examine first the issue of whether Ms Mytsyk has established that she is acting in good faith.

</div> Mr Anushka clearly disputes that she is. The chief argument he makes is that she has a collateral purpose in bringing OS 987, and that by pursuing such collateral purpose, she is abusing s 216A – and by extension, the company – as a vehicle for her own aims and interests (see the judgment of the CA in <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [31]). In a nutshell, Mr Anushka’s case is that she has brought this OS for the collateral purpose of advancing her own cause in S 1247 and “sabotaging” Med Travel’s defence in S 1247.

It is his case that most of the matters put forward by Ms Mytsyk in OS 987 as the intended subject of the derivative action she seeks leave to commence are already the subject of ongoing litigation in S 1247, in which both he and Med Travel have already filed defences setting out their positions. There is therefore no good reason for Ms Mytsyk to file at this juncture a separate application for leave to bring a derivative action in Med Travel’s name against him in respect of these same matters: the only reason why she has done so is because she has so far failed in her earlier attempts to undermine Med Travel’s defence in S 1247.

In addition, Mr Anushka is alleged to have committed various breaches of directors’ duties owed to Health &amp; Help, which include his allegedly causing the misappropriation of Health &amp; Help’s “Med Expert” software system by “[placing] the software as an asset belonging to Med Travel in its books”, causing Health &amp; Helpp to extend an interest-free loan of $1.38 million to Med Travel for the purchase of the Property in Med Travel’s name  when such loan held “no commercial benefit” for Health &amp; Help and was not in its best interests, and causing Health &amp; Help to enter into “questionable transactions and payments” including the payment of service fees to Med Travel.

Obviously, however, he disputes Ms Mytsyk’s characterization of his actions as a misappropriation of company funds committed in breach of his fiduciary duties as Med Travel’s director.  He further contends that the issue of his withdrawal of these funds is already a matter in contention in S 1247. As seen from the above outline, Mr Anushka’s defence to the claims brought against him in S 1247 centers on his assertion that Med Travel and Health &amp; Help constitute a Family Business jointly owned by him and Ms Mytsyk – and that part of the mutual agreement between them was that “they would try and keep as much retained earnings in the Family Business” so as to use these monies “for future investment and expansion”. Mr Anushka has further pleaded in his defence in S 1247 that when their relationship started unraveling in April / May 2019, he had informed Ms Mytsyk that he “wished to stop the existing financial arrangement” whereby “all his savings were maintained within the Family Business as company profits”; that he intended to “withdraw around $400,000 out of the Family Business to be kept as his personal savings”; and that “going forward [Ms Mytsyk] should contribute her fair share to the family expenses along with [him]”.

</div> According to Mr Anushka, it was shortly after this that Ms Mytsyk started taking various “wrongful steps” to breach the Mutual Understanding. As outlined above, in S 1247 Mr Anushka has counter-claimed against (<span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>) Ms Mytsyk for her alleged breach of their Mutual Understanding and seeks an order for her to pay him the value of 50% of the shares in the two companies. It is in this context that he has in his pleadings acknowledged his own withdrawal of the total amount of $476,368.05 from Med Travel’s account between 5 August 2019 and 8 October 2019; and he has further pleaded that the Buyout Value (which he says is the amount Ms Mytsyk should pay him for his share of the Family Business) should be “reduced” by this amount – but only after setting off various payments which he claims to have made on Med Travel’s behalf or which he asserts he is entitled to.

Given the case advanced by Mr Anushka in his counter-claim (which Ms Mytsyk and her co-plaintiffs dispute), it is likely that the trial court in S 1247 will have to make factual findings which impact on the issue of whether Mr Anushka’s withdrawal of the $476,368.05 may be characterised as a “misappropriation” of company funds.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">On the alleged forgery of “financial documents”</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I consider next the allegation that Mr Anushka has forged “financial documents”. In her first affidavit, Ms Mytsyk stated that he had “forged [her] signature on [Med Travel]’s Financial Statements for FY 2017 and FY 2018 without [her] permission nor knowledge”. Looking at the complaints put forward in her affidavit, however, it seems clear that the alleged forgery of her signature on the FY 2017 and FY 2018 financial statements was never her actual concern. Practically speaking, if the contents of these financial statements were entirely accurate and true, there would seem to be no real reason for Med Travel to pursue legal action against Mr Anushka for “forging” Ms Mytsyk’s signature on the statements. Indeed, an examination of Ms Mytsyk’s affidavit evidence reveals that vis-à-vis the FY 2017 and FY 2018 financial statements, her real concern was with the service fees billed by Med Travel to Health &amp; Help in those years. In gist, she claims that she never authorised the billing of such service fees: according to her, Mr Anushka “manufactured” the service fees billed in FY 2017 and FY 2018; and he also did the same thing in respect of services fees billed by Med Travel to Health &amp; Help in FY 2014, FY 2015 and FY 2016.

Cash and other assets in the two companies’ names were treated as being part of the assets of this Family Business and handled accordingly, so as to build up a “nest egg” for the benefit of the couple and their family.

</div> It was with a view to investing these cash reserves that Mr Anushka and Ms Mytsyk jointly decided to purchase the Property in Med Travel’s name, with Med Travel taking on the mortgage in its name while Health &amp; Help extended it a loan of $1.38 million for the down-payment.  Indeed, according to Mr Anushka, it was Ms Mytsyk who had suggested purchasing the Property, and he had agreed to her suggestion after assessing that “the property could be rented out” and that there was the “additional possibility to use the investment to generate additional returns from a bunkering business owned by [him]”. The “bunkering business” in question was the company Murex, which – in his pleadings in S 1247 – Mr Anushka described as a new business he had set up in 2018. According to Mr Anushka, he derived a monthly income from Murex, which he had transferred to Med Travel to enable Med Travel to meet the monthly mortgage payments for the Property. This was something Ms Mytsyk was aware of: in fact, this “additional revenue stream” for Med Travel was “(o)ne of the key reasons” why he and Ms Mytsyk had agreed to purchase the Property, as the additional revenue would have ensured that the mortgage payments were not a burden for the Family Business.

According to Ms Mytsyk, this monthly US$7,500 payment by Murex had initially gone into Med Travel’s account, but after she served the divorce papers on Mr Anushka, he kept the monies for himself and had his own company A B Capital Pte Ltd invoice Murex for the US$7,500 instead.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I shall say more about Murex in the next few paragraphs.  In respect of the present allegation that Mr Anushka unilaterally caused Med Travel to take on a mortgage it could not afford, I am of the view that this is a matter which is already in contention in S 1247. Although in S 1247 the purchase of the Property was brought up by Ms Mytsyk in the context of a claim relating to Health &amp; Help’s loan to Med Travel, the court hearing the trial of S 1247 will have to make findings on whether it was Mr Anushka who unilaterally insisted on Med Travel purchasing the Property in its name as Ms Mytsyk and her co-plaintiffs claim (thereby saddling the latter with a mortgage it could not afford) – or whether the purchase of the Property by Med Travel was jointly agreed by Mr Anushka and Ms Mytsyk as part of their plans for investing the cash reserves of the “”Family Business”. As for the allegation about Mr Anushka getting Med Travel further indebted by drawing on its overdraft to meet mortgage payments, this is in my view ancillary to the issue of whether the mortgage was a liability which in the first place Ms Mytsyk and Mr Anushka had jointly agreed to have Med Travel assume.    </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">On the allegation that Mr Anushka unlawfully diverted to himself income due to Med Travel </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I next consider the allegation that Mr Anushka unlawfully diverted to himself income due to Med Travel.  As noted above, it is alleged firstly that he diverted “income” and “returns” due to Med Travel from Murex, to his own company A B Capital Pte Ltd instead. It is also alleged that he diverted to himself rental income due to Med Travel from the tenant of the Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As to the allegation concerning Murex, I have summarised above the parties’ differing positions on Murex. Ms Mytsyk claims that Mr Anushka is a mere nominee shareholder and director in Murex, and that she was the one who had negotiated for Murex to pay Med Travel a monthly US$7,500 fee. Mr Anushka claims that Murex is his company and that the monthly US$ 7,500 was his “personal income” which – prior to August 2019 – he had voluntarily transferred to Med Travel’s account “as income to Med Travel” and “part of family income”.

</div> In other words, in S 1247 Mr Anushka appears to have posited that there was a practice of some of the Family Business’ monies being kept in the personal bank accounts of one of its directors. I highlight this because it provides some context for the position he takes regarding rental payments he has received into his personal bank account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Mr Anushka has acknowledged that whilst 8 months of rental income were credited directly into Med Travel’s account, the balance 6 months of rental income have been paid into his personal account. According to Mr Anushka, it was necessary to do so because Ms Mytsyk was being “deliberately” obstructive in refusing to use the rental income to pay for expenses related to the Property (such as property tax and MCST fees). Mr Anushka’s position is that from an early stage, he has already notified Ms Mytsyk that he would be getting the rental income paid into his personal account, and that he would pay off expenses related to the Property from that income before transferring any balance to Med Travel’s account.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> 1st Defendant’s Defence &amp; Counter-claim in S 1247 at paras 12 and 14 of the Appendix.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Mr Anushka does not, of course, agree that he has breached any fiduciary duties to Med Travel. As I noted earlier, he takes the position in S 1247 that Med Travel is part of the Family Business owned jointly by him and Ms Mytsyk pursuant to a Mutual Understanding; that it was pursuant to this Mutual Understanding that he kept all his savings “within the Family Business”; and that it was Ms Mytsyk who breached the Mutual Understanding, following which he took steps to withdraw a total of $476,368.05 from Med Travel’s account. It will be remembered that in the counter-claim he has filed in S 1247, Mr Anushka is claiming that Ms Mytsyk should pay him 50% of the value of the shares in Med Travel and Health &amp; Help, and that the amounts he has withdrawn from Med Travel should be accounted for by corresponding deductions from the Buyout Value, while the monies he has paid on its behalf should be added back to the Buyout Value.  Ms Mytsyk does not agree. Whether there was in fact a Mutual Understanding between Mr Anushka and Ms Mytsyk as to their joint ownership of Med Travel and Health &amp; Help; whether such Mutual Understanding was breached by Ms Mytsyk; whether Mr Anushka was entitled to withdraw monies from Med Travel’s account for personal expenses; and whether he is correct to insist that the amounts so withdrawn should now be accounted for by being factored into the computation of the Buyout Value – these are matters which in my view the trial court in S 1247 is likely to have to consider in the trial of Mr Anushka’s counter-claim in S 1247.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">On the allegation that Mr Anushka has negligently caused Med Travel to incur numerous penalties as a result of late submission of GST payments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The last allegation concerns the late submission of GST payments by Med Travel, which Ms Mytsyk claims was due to negligence on Mr Anushka’s part. This last allegation does not feature in S 1247. Mr Anushka does not deny that there were some late submissions of GST payments, but says that they occurred when he was busy running “the entire backend of the Family Business” in the period between 2012 and 2019.

Indeed, in respect of the issue of the service charges billed by Med Travel to Health &amp; Help (namely, whether the service charges are “manufactured”) as well as that of Ms Mytsyk’s access to the Med Expert programme, these are specifically the subject of claims advanced by Ms Mytsyk and her co-plaintiffs in S 1247. It is against this backdrop that I consider Mr Anushka’s submission that Ms Mytsyk’s collateral purpose in the proposed derivative action is to advance her own cause in that suit and correspondingly, to “sabotage” Med Travel’s defence in S 1247 – what he has called “her intractable conflict of interest”.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 First, given that many of the factual issues which arise from the allegations raised in OS 987 will likely be the subject of findings by the trial court in S 1247, the question which naturally comes to mind is why Ms Mytsyk insists that the derivative action must be launched against Mr Anushka at this juncture.  Even if there is not strictly a duplicity of proceedings, there will likely be a fairly substantial amount of overlap between S 1247 and the intended derivative action, in terms of the factual issues to be determined. S 1247, having been commenced by Ms Mytsyk and her co-plaintiffs in early December 2019, should presumably be proceeding for trial in the near future. Ms Mytsyk’s insistence on launching the proposed derivative action now is all the more disconcerting when one considers that she is asking that Med Travel indemnify her for the legal fees and disbursements she incurs in bringing the derivative action (<span class="font-italic">per </span>prayer 2 of OS 987). In other words, in addition to paying for its own defence in S 1247, Med Travel is now being asked to pay for Ms Mytsyk to bring a derivative action against Mr Anushka, involving issues which overlap with those raised in S 1247.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In his email of 16 August 2021 to Ms Mytsyk’s lawyers,

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Ms Mytsyk’s 1st affidavit at p 410.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Mr Anushka had suggested that if she believed Med Travel had a good claim against him (which he denied), she should nevertheless wait for her existing action in S 1247 to “proceed to finality” and let the proposed derivative action “be stayed until the conclusion” of that suit. Ms Mytsyk rejected this suggestion. According to Mr Anushka, in insisting on bringing a derivative action despite ongoing litigation in her own existing suit over many of the same matters, Ms Mytsyk is driven by her personal interests in S 1247. Having sued him for various breaches in S 1247 and having been stymied in her numerous attempts in that suit to get her hands on assets such as the Med Expert programme, Ms Mytsyk is now (according to Mr Anushka) trying to achieve the same ends via a separate set of proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 This brings me to the other, related point. As far as I can understand from Mr Anushka’s arguments, it is his case that Ms Mytsyk’s pursuit of her own interests cannot in any way be consistent with “doing justice” to Med Travel, because the case she wishes to advance in the statutory derivative action will effectively “sabotage” Med Travel’s defence in S 1247.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Having examined the evidence before me, it does appear to me that if Ms Mytsyk is permitted to bring the proposed derivative action, the effect of some of the allegations she seeks to pursue in such action will be to undermine or subvert at least some aspects of Med Travel’s defence in S 1247. For example, in respect of her allegation of forged financial documents, I have noted earlier that an examination of her affidavit evidence reveals that Ms Mytsyk’s real complaint is about the service fees charged by Med Travel to Health &amp; Help, which she claims were “manufactured” by Mr Anushka for the purpose of falsely inflating Med Travel’s earnings. If Ms Mytsyk were to pursue this claim on behalf of Med Travel in a derivative action, it would necessarily mean Med Travel taking the position that the service fees were in fact “manufactured” – and thus “unjustifiable”. This is precisely the same complaint about the service fees that Ms Mytsyk and her co-plaintiffs have advanced in S 1247, wherein they have asserted that Med Travel’s receipt of the “unjustifiable” service fees is wrongful and that the company holds the monies paid as “constructive trustee” for Health &amp; Help. On the face of it, therefore, the claim Ms Mytsyk proposes to pursue on behalf of Med Travel in the derivative action would involve in effect its capitulation to the plaintiffs’ claim in S 1247 about its having charged service fees without any basis.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 As another example, Ms Mytsyk claims that Mr Anushka’s actions in denying her access to the Med Expert programme have prevented Med Travel from continuing to do business and that she must be granted access to the programme in order to stem the resulting losses. In her affidavits, Ms Mytsyk has not explained clearly how her own lack of access to the Med Expert programme has caused Med Travel’s business to be impeded. Indeed, if what she says is true (<span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">e</span>, that the Med Expert programme contains all the personal records of Health &amp; Help’s clients), then it would appear to be Health &amp; Help whose business is impeded and whose interests are at risk – rather than Med Travel’s. Even more fundamentally, if Ms Mytsyk pursues in the intended derivative action this claim regarding her lack of access to Med Expert, the outcome she seeks will be for “full access” to and “control” of the programme to be given to her. This is the very outcome which she seeks vis-à-vis the Med Expert programme in S 1247, and which Med Expert – judging from the defence it has filed – obviously does not agree to.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 There are two other things I should also point out.  First, in the course of the ongoing litigation in S 1247, the lawyers for Ms Mytsyk and her co-plaintiffs have attempted to get Med Travel’s lawyers to amend its defence, apparently so as to remove specific averments as to the true state of affairs vis-à-vis such disputed issues as access to the Med Expert programme, the purchase of the Property and the basis of service fees charged to Health &amp; Help.  On 11 February 2021, M/s Asia Ascent Law Corporation (the lawyers then acting for Ms Mytsyk and her co-plaintiffs) wrote to M/s Tembusu Law LLC (Med Travel’s then lawyers),

</div> purportedly to raise concerns about the scope of Mr Anushka’s authority to instruct solicitors on behalf of Med Travel.  In this letter, M/s Asia Ascent Law Corporation also purported to seek “confirmation” that M/s Tembusu Law LLC “shall” effect a number of specified amendments to Med Travel’s defence. These specified amendments included the proposed deletion of large swathes of those paragraphs in Med Travel’s defence which addressed the issues of the Med Expert programme, the purchase of the Property and the service fees. In these paragraphs, Med Expert had pleaded <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>that the Med Expert programme was correctly documented as an asset in its accounts and that it was not obliged to surrender the software to the S 1247 plaintiffs; that it had purchased the Property as “an investment” in line with the Mutual Understanding and with Ms Mytsyk’s knowledge and approval; and that Ms Mytsyk knew and had not objected to the arrangements for the charging of the service fees. <span class="font-italic">Per</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>M/s Asia Ascent Law Corporation’s letter, all such averments were to be deleted and replaced instead with the bare statement that the corresponding passages in the statement of claim were “not admitted”. If the specified amendments had been made, the substantive basis pleaded for sizeable chunks of Med Travel’s defence in S 1247 would have been deleted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 As it turns out, Med Travel did not make the amendments requested.  I bring this up because in my view, this letter shows that Ms Mytsyk has already attempted in S 1247 to prevent Med Travel from presenting a narrative on disputed issues which corroborated or coincided with Mr Anushka’s narrative. These are the same disputed issues that she now seeks to make the subject of a derivative action against Mr Anushka; and as I have noted, if she is permitted to bring such derivative action, it will mean Med Travel adopting a narrative on the disputed issues which contradicts – indeed, undermines – its pleaded position in S 1247.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Second, and specifically in respect of the Med Expert software programme, it will be remembered that Ms Mytsyk and her co-plaintiffs have pleaded in S 1247 that Med Travel holds this programme as constructive trustee for Health &amp; Help (of which Ms Mytsyk is the sole shareholder and director). They have further pleaded that Mr Anushka should be ordered to take steps to surrender to Health &amp; Help full access and control over this programme. In the course of the proceedings in S 1247, Ms Mytsyk and her co-plaintiffs applied in November 2020 for specific discovery against Mr Anushka of various items, including files and data maintained in the Med Expert software; and when they failed to get specific discovery of these files and data, they brought an appeal which also failed.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify"> Mr Anushka’s 1st affidavit at paras 38–42.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Now, if Ms Mytsyk is permitted to proceed with the proposed derivative action, one of the things she has made clear she will ask for is to be granted access to and control of the Med Expert programme.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I point out these two things because they appear to me to support Mr Anushka’s contention that what Ms Mytsyk seeks to do in the proposed derivative action will end up “sabotaging” Med Travel’s defence in S 1247, even as it advances her cause in that suit. Furthermore (and somewhat ironically), as I pointed out earlier, if Ms Mytsyk has her way, Med Travel will have to indemnify her for the legal fees and disbursements she incurs in bringing the derivative action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In light of the above, I find that Mr Anushka has been able to point to enough evidence capable of suggesting that Ms Mytsyk is not acting in good faith. In other words, he has discharged the respondent’s <span class="font-italic">tactical </span>burden of proof on the issue of good faith. As the High Court highlighted in <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>(at [79]), where a respondent meets its tactical burden, the applicant can no longer simply point to the merits of the derivative action and invite the court to draw an inference of good faith from that fact alone: an applicant who does no more than that will fail to discharge its legal burden of proof on the issue of good faith.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Unfortunately for Ms Mytsyk, her affidavit evidence shows no signs of any attempt to demonstrate her good faith. In her first affidavit in OS 987, no mention at all was made of S 1247, even though it must have been obvious that most of the allegations of breaches she wanted to pursue in Med Travel’s name were already matters in contention in S 1247. Even after Mr Anushka filed an affidavit asserting that issues such as the use of Med Expert and the purchase of the Property were already before the court in S 1247 and accusing her of trying to sabotage Med Travel’s defence in that suit, Ms Mytsyk continued to shy away from addressing the question of good faith.  In her second affidavit, she merely stated that S 1247 was “commenced to rectify [Mr Anushka’s] wrongdoings and to allow [her] father to regain control of the 2 companies which are beneficially owned by him”. She made no mention of the other aspects of the plaintiffs’ claim in S 1247. In particular, she has been silent about their claim against Med Travel for wrongful conversion or receipt of assets such as monies paid by Health &amp; Help for service fees and the Med Expert programme. Even in the third affidavit which she obtained leave to file, she has spent most of her time repeating the allegations made against Mr Anushka in her first affidavit, setting out further allegations and describing the abuse she says he visited on her and her children. Her bottom-line is that Mr Anushka is guilty of much misconduct and that the case she wishes to bring against him on Med Travel’s behalf is a strong one. As the High Court cautioned in <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span>, however, an applicant under s 216A cannot discharge its burden of proof on the issue of good faith simply by pointing to the merits of the proposed derivative action.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Indeed, it would appear Ms Mytsyk’s reluctance to deal with the issue of overlap between S 1247 and the proposed derivative action bespeaks a lack of candour on her part in the present proceedings. The failure to be fully candid before the court has been held in various cases to indicate a lack of good faith: see for example <span class="font-italic">Wong Kai Wah v Wong Kai Yuan &amp; anor </span>[2014] SGHC 147 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Kai Wah</span>”) at [66]; <span class="font-italic">Agus Irawan </span>at [9]; <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span> at [117] to [128]; and <span class="font-italic">Jian Li Investments </span>at [99(b)]. As the High Court observed of the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Agus Irawan</span>” (at [9]), good faith would have required the plaintiff to “set out the story in full from the beginning but he did not do so”; and the court found that he had not acted in good faith. In <span class="font-italic">Agus Irawan</span>, the plaintiff had applied for leave to bring a derivative action in the name of the third defendant company against the first and second defendants. It was alleged that the third defendant company was entitled to rebates given by the Australian Wheat Board but that it never received these rebates because the Australian Wheat Board paid the rebates to other parties on the instructions of the first defendant and a manager of the third defendant. Evidence was adduced by the defendants to show that in fact, the rebate had been paid through a company called Gismo Investments in which the plaintiff and his father were shareholders and directors. The plaintiff said he had been ignorant of this arrangement as the bank accounts of Gismo Investments had been operated by the first defendant alone, but the High Court found that this simply raised further questions as to why and how that was allowed to be so (at [9]). The court was not satisfied that the plaintiff had come before it in good faith, and his leave application was accordingly dismissed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In the present case, Ms Mytsyk is one of the main protagonists in S 1247: she can hardly have been ignorant of the claims which she and her co-plaintiffs have advanced in that suit, or of the defences and counter-claim filed therein.  Good faith would have required her to set out the story in full from the beginning, but she did not do so. I surmise that she did not do so because she did not want to invite scrutiny of the claims she has brought against Mr Anushka and Med Travel in S 1247, versus the claims she now proposes to launch against Mr Anushka in a derivative action on behalf of Med Travel.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In arriving at the above conclusions, I do not find the allegation about Mr Anushka’s late submission of GST payments adds anything to the mix. Ms Mytsyk has given only four examples of such late submissions; and while she claims in her affidavit that she is “quite sure” there are other examples, she provides no basis at all for this claim. On her own computation, the total penalties incurred by Med Travel in respect of these late submissions came to $742.25. It would appear to me this allegation was something of an afterthought, thrown in to add to the allegations reprised from S 1247.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the issue of good faith</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 For the reasons set out above, I find that Ms Mytsyk has failed to satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that she is acting in good faith.  She has failed to discharge her legal burden of proof under s 216A(3)(b). In my view, in bringing this application, she is abusing the statutory remedy in s 216A – and by extension, also Med Travel – as a vehicle for her own aims and interests.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 This finding suffices <span class="font-italic">per se</span> to dispose of Ms Mytsyk’s application in OS 987. As the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>said of the unsuccessful applicant in that case (at [150]), “(n)o matter how strong the merits of its case might be, those merits cannot make up for a lack of good faith”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 It is not necessary, in the circumstances, for me to address the issue of whether Ms Mytsyk can pass the next stage of the inquiry in s 216A(3)(c). In the interests of completeness, however, I will say something about the application of s 216A(3)(c) on the present facts.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">On whether the intended derivative action appears prima facie to be in the interests of Med Travel pursuant to s 216A(3)(c)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 Pursuant to s 216A(3)(c), the applicant only needs to show that the intended derivative action is legitimate and arguable. As the High Court noted in <span class="font-italic">Petroships</span>, the threshold test at this stage of the inquiry deliberately sets a low standard, precisely because it is only a threshold test that serves to weed out “only the most obviously unmeritorious claims” (<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span> (at [152], <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee v Low Hian Chor </span>[2013] 2 SLR 340 at 53] to [55]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 As the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>also noted, however, passing the threshold test is insufficient to satisfy the entirety of the test under s 216A(3)(c), because the statutory test under that provision requires the court to consider the overall interests of the company in the round. The court in <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>(at [153]) endorsed Palmer J’s judgment in <span class="font-italic">Swansson v R A Pratt Properties Pte Ltd &amp; anor </span>[2002] 42 ACSR 313 (“<span class="font-italic">Swansson</span>”), holding that the inquiry under s 216A(3)(c) should be a multi-factorial process which examines a number of factors to determine if the derivative action is in the practical and commercial interests of the company. I have summarised these <span class="font-italic">Swansson </span>factors earlier (see above at [24]).<span style="color: rgba(255,0,0,1)"> </span>Even if I am wrong on the issue of good faith and even if I assume that Ms Mytsyk can satisfy the threshold test, I nevertheless find she cannot show on a balance of probabilities that it is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>in Med Travel’s interests for her to pursue the claims of alleged breaches by Mr Anushka via a derivative action. I have highlighted earlier that many of the allegations which she proposes to pursue in the derivative action overlap with issues already in contention in S 1247, and that some of the claims she proposes to pursue in the derivative action effectively undermine various aspects of the defence pleaded by Med Travel in that suit – while simultaneously requiring Med Travel to indemnify her legal costs in the derivative action. There is nothing in her affidavits and / or her counsel’s written submissions which explains away this disturbing conundrum.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion and final observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 For the reasons I have set out above, I dismiss OS 987.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 There is one final point I wish to make. Much ink has been spilt by each party in detailing the poor behaviour of the other during their marriage, and much vitriol spewed not only in the affidavits filed but also in the submissions made and even in the letters sent to the court. I consider that the greater share of the responsibility for this unhealthy exchange must lie with Ms Mytsyk, who – in every affidavit she has filed in these proceedings – has brought up the “very abusive” relationship and “physical and verbal abuse” she claims to have suffered during her marriage to Mr Anushka. In fact, I have found virtually all the allegations about marital abuse to be irrelevant to the issues in contention in OS 987; and it is regrettable that Ms Mytsyk chose to focus her time and energy on ventilating these matters when such time and energy should have been more fruitfully spent coming to grips with the legal and evidential issues in the OS.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I will hear parties on costs.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Mavis Chionh Sze Chyi<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lim Tean (Carson Law Chambers) (instructed), </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Wong Li-Yen Dew (Dew Chambers) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The first defendant absent and unrepresented;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">The second defendant in person. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
