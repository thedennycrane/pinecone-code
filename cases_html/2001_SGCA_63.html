<strong>Judgment:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">1.     This

was an appeal by S3 Building Services Pte Ltd (the appellant) against the decision of Woo Bih

Li JC, in which he allowed the appeal from the decision of the registrar refusing the application by

Sky Technology Pte Ltd, the respondent (the respondent) for an extension of time to file the

affidavits of evidence-in-chief of witnesses and exchange them with the appellant, and striking out

the defence and dismissing the counterclaim with costs. We dismissed the appeal and now give our

reasons.

<i><b>
<p align="justify">Background facts</p></b></i></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">2.     The

relevant facts giving rise to the appeal were briefly these. On 25 November 2000, the appellant

instituted this action against the respondent, seeking an order for the rescission of an agreement

whereby the respondents agreed to assign certain patent rights to the appellant on the terms and

conditions therein stated. The basis of the claim, among others, was that the respondent had

intentionally suppressed material information relating to the patent rights. Soon after the

commencement of the action, the appellant took out an application for summary judgment. At the

hearing thereof before an assistant registrar on 15 January 2001, the respondent was granted

unconditional leave to defend. On 31 January 2001, the respondent served its defence and

counterclaim. The appellant appealed against the decision of the assistant registrar and the appeal

was heard on 13 February 2001 before Lai Siu Chiu J. She dismissed the appeal. Not contented with

the decision, the appellant, on 27 February 2001, applied for hearing of further arguments. That

application appeared to be belated, as the time for such application had expired. Nonetheless, the

application was acceded to by Lai J, and 5 March 2001 was fixed for the hearing of further

arguments.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">3.     In

the meantime, on 28 February 2001, the parties appeared before the registrar for directions, and at

that hearing the registrar made, inter alia, the following directions:

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The affidavits of evidence-in-chief of witnesses to be called were to be

  exchanged between the parties by 30 March 2001 and objections thereto were to be taken by 6 April

  2001.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) Leave was granted to the respondent to adduce the oral evidence at the

  trial of a representative from Allen &amp; Gledhill, and a representative from Chu Chan Gan &amp;

  Ooi.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The trial be fixed for five days from 27 April 2001 to 4 May 2001 and the

  action be set down by 9 April 2001.</p>
</blockquote></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">4.     On 5

March 2001, the parties appeared before Lai J for the hearing of further arguments. At the

conclusion, the judge altered her previous decision and ordered that the respondent be given only

conditional leave to defend the appellants claim instead. The condition imposed was that the

respondent was to provide security in the sum of S$600,000 for the appellants claim by 26 March

2001.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">5.     On

16 March 2001, the respondent filed an appeal against Lai Js decision and applied for the hearing

of the appeal to be expedited. The application was allowed, and in consequence the appeal was heard

on 22 March 2001. The appeal was unsuccessful, but the court granted to the respondent an extension

of two weeks from the original deadline of 26 March 2001 to provide the security in the sum of

S$600,000.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">6.    

Thereafter, the respondent and its solicitors attempted to prepare the affidavits of

evidence-in-chief of the witnesses for the trial to meet the deadline of 30 March 2001, but did not

succeed in so doing. On Friday, 30 March 2001, the appellants solicitors sent a fax to the

respondents solicitors requesting for a time to be fixed for the exchange of the affidavits. The

respondents solicitors sought an extension of time from the solicitors for the appellant on the

ground that Ms Winnie Tham of Allen &amp; Gledhill, one of the witness they intended to call, was

overseas. The solicitors for the appellants refused. There followed an exchange of correspondence

and no agreement was reached between the parties. The appellant took out an application to strike

out the defence and counterclaim. The respondent, on its part, applied for an extension of time to

14 April 2001 to file and exchange the affidavits of evidence-in-chief.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">7.     On 4

April 2001, both the applications were heard before the registrar. The registrar refused the

respondents application for an extension of time and allowed the appellants application, and

consequently ordered that the defence be struck out and counterclaim dismissed with costs, and that

judgment for the appellant be entered. On the same day, the respondent filed an appeal to a judge in

chambers, and the appeal was heard before Woo Bih Li JC on 10 April 2001. He allowed the appeal.

From that decision, the appellant appealed to this Court.</font>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4"><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman"><i><b>The appeal</b></i></font></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman">8.     We

considered first the reasons given by the respondent in the application for an extension of time

before the registrar. In the affidavit filed in support of the application, Mr Lim Yeow Bing, the

intellectual property and contracts director of the respondent, said in  4 the following:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">
<p align="justify">4. The directions provided a short time frame for the preparation of the

  affidavits. Meanwhile, the Defendants efforts to prepare the affidavits expeditiously have been

  affected by the following circumstances:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) The Plaintiff obtained leave, subsequent to the giving of the directions,

    to make further arguments before Justice Lai Siu Chiu in respect of her earlier dismissal of

    their appeal for summary judgment. The further arguments were heard on 5 March 2001 and, at the

    end of a lengthy hearing, the learned Judge gave conditional leave to defend.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) The Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the learned Judges

    order, and the appeal was heard on an expedited basis on 22 March 2001. The appeal was

    unsuccessful. Much of the Defendants attention and effort were taken up by the hearing of the

    further arguments and the appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The Defendant had also previously indicated that they may call a lawyer

    from M/s Allen &amp; Gledhill to testify. In this regard, Ms Winnie Tham of M/s Allen &amp;

    Gledhill, who acted for the Defendant in the subject patent application, has been out of the

    country since 23<sup>rd</sup> March 2001 and is understood that she will only return to

    Singapore after 4 April 2001.</p>
</blockquote></font>
</blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">9.     The

judge below held that the true reason for the delay was not given in the application for the

extension of time and thus the conduct of the appellant was unsatisfactory, and further, that the

delay was unjustified. The judge said at  61:

<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">
<p align="justify">61. The truth of the matter was that Rodyk &amp; Davidson and Sky Technology

  had used the absence of Winnie Tham to seek an EOT [extension of time] when the real reason was

  something else. To this extent, their conduct was unsatisfactory.</p>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Later, the judge said at  64-66:</p>
<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">
<p></p></font><font size="3">64.</font>    <font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">The true reason for the delay was that Rodyk &amp; Davidsons time and attention had

  been taken up and distracted by the hearings before Lai J and the Court of Appeal in respect of

  the application for summary judgment and conditional leave. They had misjudged the time required

  to prepare the AEICs.

  <p></p></font><font size="3">65.</font>   <font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">Although I had some sympathy for the situation they found themselves to be in, the true

  reason was still not satisfactory. After all, S3s AEICs were ready by 30 March 2001.

  <p></p></font><font size="3">66.</font>   <font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">Hence, the delay was unjustified.

  </font>
</blockquote>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">10.     We

had some difficulty in accepting the findings the judge made in this part of his judgment. First,

with respect, we did not agree with his finding that the respondents had used the absence of Ms

Winnie Tham to seek an extension of time when the true reason was something else. Mr Lim, in his

affidavit, gave what the judge later said were the true reasons for the delay and these included the

absence of Ms Winnie Tham as one of the reasons. It is true that in seeking an agreement from the

appellants solicitors for the extension of time, Mr Lok Vi Meng, the solicitor for the appellant,

gave only one reason for the delay: that is, that Ms Winnie Tham was out of the country. That was

rather unfortunate, but not fatal. What was more important, surely, must be what the respondent

relied on as the true reasons for the delay at the hearing before the registrar. These were given by

Mr Lim in his affidavit filed in support of the application, the relevant part of which we have

quoted above. We certainly did not find anything wanting in respect of what was said there. Nor did

we find the conduct of the respondent unsatisfactory.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">11.    

Secondly, with respect, we did not find that the delay was unjustified. The summons for directions

before the registrar was heard only on 28 February 2001 and, among other things, a direction was

given for the exchange of the affidavits of evidence-in-chief to take place on 30 March 2001.

Mr Lim said in his affidavit that the time frame given for the preparation of the affidavits was a

short one. We found nothing wrong with this statement. In the circumstances of this case, we think

that the time frame was a short one. Now, what happened immediately after the directions were given

was that multiple proceedings took place. It appeared that on 27 February 2001, which was the day

before the date the directions were given, the appellant applied to Lai J for a hearing of further

arguments on the application for summary judgment. Mr Lok said that he was unaware of this

application at the hearing of the summons for directions before the registrar. That was not

disputed. Probably at that point in time, neither of the parties knew that the application had been

granted, or for that matter, expected that it would be granted, having regard to the fact that the

time for such an application had expired. It was unclear when the parties were notified that Lai J

agreed to hear further arguments. However, the hearing of further arguments was fixed for 5 March

2001. Naturally both parties would have to prepare further arguments for submission before the

judge. Then on 5 March 2001, Lai J altered her decision previously given and gave the

respondent leave to defend the appellants claim on condition that the respondent furnished

security in the sum of S$600,000. Against that decision, the respondent decided to appeal, and it

immediately filed an appeal. An urgent application was made by the respondent for the hearing of the

appeal to be expedited and an order was made expediting the hearing. The appeal was heard on 22

March 2001, but unfortunately the respondent was unsuccessful in the appeal. Plainly, all these

events supervened during the relevant period, i.e. date when the order for directions was made,

namely 28 February 2001, and the deadline for the exchange of affidavits on 30 March 2001. It was

manifestly clear to us that all these events, which were unforeseen at the time the directions were

given, occasioned a delay in the preparation by the respondent of the affidavits of

evidence-in-chief. As the judge below said, and we agreed, the time and attention of the solicitors

for the respondent had been taken up and distracted by the hearing before Lai J and the Court of

Appeal in respect of the application for summary judgment.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">12.     In

our judgment, having regard to the supervening events and the short time frame allowed, the delay

could not, with respect, be characterised as unjustified. We were of the view that an adequate

explanation was given for the extension of time, and the registrar should have granted the extension

of time sought or alternatively an extension of seven or even ten days, and should not have

exercised the draconian power of striking out the defence and dismissing the counterclaim with

judgment to the appellant. Particularly, in this case, such extension would not necessitate an

adjournment or postponement of the trial, and the impact of an extension of time on the case overall

would not have been significant.

<i><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Prejudice</p></b></i></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">13.    

Having regard to what we have said, it is unnecessary to deal with the issue of prejudice. However,

since this was an issue raised and argued by both parties, we should say a word on it. The leading

authority is the case of <i>The Tokai Maru</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=46670&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1998] 3 SLR 105</a>. That was a case involving also a

delay in filing and exchanging affidavits of evidence-in-chief, and the delay involved covered a

period of some nine months, and the court held that the explanation given for the delay was

unsatisfactory and the delay was unjustified. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal found that there was

no prejudice caused to the respondents and the application to extend the time was granted. In coming

to this conclusion, the Court followed the decision of the Court of Appeal in England delivered by

Sir Thomas Bingham MR (as he then was) in <i>Costellow v Somerset County Council</i> [1993] 1 All ER

952, [1993] 1 WLR 256. Among other things, it was stated there that <i>the courts practice has

been to treat the existence of such prejudice as a crucial, and often a decisive, matter.</i>

Even if prejudice is caused, which can be cured by an appropriate order of costs, the court would be

disinclined to refuse the application for an extension of time.

</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">14.     It

is unnecessary for us to refer to the judgment in <i>Costellow </i>which was quoted in extenso in <i>The

Tokai Maru</i> and also in this Courts decision in <i>Leong Mei Chuan v Chan Teck Hook David</i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=60977&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[2001] 2 SLR 17</a>. Suffice here to remind ourselves of the following passage of the judgment of Sir

Thomas Bingham MR which we find appropriate ([1993] 1 All ER 952 at 960, [1993] 1 WLR 256 at 264):

<blockquote>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="3">
<p align="justify">[I]n the ordinary way, and in the absence of special circumstances, a court

  will not exercise its inherent jurisdiction to dismiss a plaintiffs action for want of

  prosecution unless the delay complained of after the issue of proceedings has caused at least a

  real risk of prejudice to the defendant. A similar approach should govern applications made under

  Ords 19, 24, 25, 28 and 34. The approach to applications under Ord 3, r 5 should not in most cases

  be very different. Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances, it can rarely be

  appropriate, <i>on an overall assessment of what justice requires</i>, to deny the plaintiff an

  extension (where the denial will stifle his action) because of a procedural default which, even if

  unjustifiable, has caused the defendant no prejudice for which he cannot be compensated by an

  award of costs. In short, an application under O 3 r 5 should ordinarily be granted where the

  overall justice of the case requires that the action be allowed to proceed.</p></font>
</blockquote></font>
<font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[Emphasis is ours]</p>
</font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">15.     The

judge below found that there was no undue prejudice to the appellant if an extension of time

was granted to the respondent to exchange affidavits of evidence-in-chief by 11 April 2001, i.e. one

day after the hearing before him. We, for our part, found that there was no evidence that the

appellant had suffered <i>any</i> prejudice entitling it to deny an extension of time to the

respondent.

Conclusion</p></b></i></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font><font face="CG Times (W1),Times New Roman" xmlns="">16.     For

the reasons given, we found that the appeal had absolutely no merit and had no hesitation in

dismissing it.</font>
