A subsidiary’s loss in fact cannot be transformed into its parent’s loss in law, even if consolidated accounts are prepared for the group as a whole. A group of companies may function as a single economic unit. But each company in the group nevertheless remains a legal person separate from the other companies in the group just as much as it remains a legal person separate from a company that is not a member of the group (at [71]).

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Reconciling the expert opinions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 It appears to me that the first material point of difference between Mr Liu and Dr Zhang’s opinions on the scope of Article 148(a) is more apparent than real. I accept that Dr Zhang is correct when he says that the deliberately unconstrained language of Article 148(a) cannot as a matter of law be constrained either by non-statutory texts such as <span class="font-italic">Interpretation of PRC Company Law</span> or by <span class="font-italic">Damage to Corporate Interests</span>. But I do not read Mr Liu’s opinion as suggesting that it should be. Mr Liu is simply using these non-statutory texts to predict how a PRC court is likely to interpret and apply Article 148(a) rather than to suggest that these texts prescribe how a PRC court must interpret and apply Article 148(a).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As for the second material point of difference, I do not consider it necessary to reconcile the experts’ differing opinions. Even if I were to take the second plaintiff’s case at its highest and adopt Dr Zhang’s disjunctive test (see [88(b)] above) instead of Mr Liu’s conjunctive test (see [82(b)] above), it is my view that the second plaintiff has failed to establish <span class="font-italic">both</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>elements of Dr Zhang’s disjunctive test.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I have arrived at that conclusion for the following reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) The loan agreements were for the second plaintiff’s benefit</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 The second plaintiff characterises the loan agreements as a “sham”. But the second plaintiff does not use the word “sham” in the legal sense. A document is a sham contract in the legal sense if it appears on its face to be a contract creating legal rights and obligations but was executed only to give the appearance of doing so and with no actual intention whatsoever of creating any legal rights or obligations. A sham contract in this sense is not a contract at all and is unenforceable as a contract given the absence of any intention to create legal relations. (see <span class="font-italic">Toh</span><span class="font-italic"> Eng Tiah v Jiang Angelina and another appeal</span> [2021] 1 SLR 1176 at [73]–[76]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 What the second plaintiff means by characterising the loan agreements as a “sham” is merely that the agreements are not what they purport to be on their face. They purport to be agreements by the second plaintiff to lend money to Mr Li to enable him to identify and acquire land on the second plaintiff’s behalf for a sheet board plant. But, the second plaintiff says, the agreements are in truth merely a pretence for the defendant and Mr Li to conceal their illegitimate arrangement to siphon money out of the Group and into Mr Li’s hands, contrary to the interests of the second plaintiff.

The loan agreements would, of course, be a sham in the legal sense if both parties intended that Mr Li should never repay the RMB 14m to the second plaintiff. But, in the sense which the second plaintiff uses the word, the loan agreements would equally be a sham if both parties entered into them fully intending that Mr Li should be contractually obliged to repay the RMB 14m to the second plaintiff but for a purpose unconnected to identifying or acquiring land for a sheet board plant. The critical factor making it a sham, according to the second plaintiff, is that the stated purpose for the loans is not the true purpose for the loans.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The defendant’s case is that the loan agreements are not a sham and were indeed entered into for the second plaintiff’s benefit. The purpose stated for the loans in the loan agreements was its actual purpose: for Mr Li to assist the second plaintiff in identifying and acquiring land on the second plaintiff’s behalf for a sheet board plant. The purpose of the first loan agreement in January 2019 (see [31] above) was, once land had been identified, to enable Mr Li to pay a vendor a deposit, thereby securing the right to negotiate to acquire the land.

</div> Those words are not, of course, conclusive as to the true purpose of entering into the loan agreements. But, taken together with the defendant’s oral evidence, they do set the starting point in the inquiry. It is the second plaintiff’s burden to prove that the loan agreements are not what they purport to be on their face. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Second, the circumstances in which the defendant caused the second plaintiff to enter into the loan agreements lead me to accept that the stated purpose in both loan agreements was indeed the true purpose for entering into them.

Mr Siong’s evidence is that he sought these quotations for the Group’s existing box plant business and not for a sheet board plant. But Mr Siong gave different explanations as to where the new corrugator was to be installed. In his affidavit of evidence in chief, he claimed that he sought the quotations to upgrade the corrugators at the Group’s existing box plant in Singapore.

The email correspondence in December 2017 and the minutes of two meetings, one in December 2017 and another in February 2018, show that the parties were considering and discussing only a new <span class="font-italic">sheet</span><span class="font-italic"> board</span> plant <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">the PRC</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 As regards the financing that Mr Siong explored in the first half of 2018, there is in evidence an email that he sent to the Group’s finance executives in February 2018. In this email, he told them that the Group was “going to make big investments in China on new plants” in order to position the Group for an initial public offering of its shares. As a result, the Group would need to raise bank financing. He therefore instructed them in this email to explore the terms of such financing with four or five banks. The question is what type of plant Mr Siong was referring to in this email. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Mr Siong’s evidence is that his reference in this email to “big investments in China on new plants” was merely a reference to the Group’s general strategy for expansion which was then focused only on “acquiring or building more of the same box plants that the Hector group was already operating and managing in the PRC”

I accept instead the defendant’s evidence that he instructed Mr Siong to explore bank financing in the first half of 2018 for a new sheet board plant in the PRC. There is no contemporaneous evidence that the first plaintiff was, at that time, considering upgrading an existing box plant in Singapore or setting up a new box plant anywhere, whether in Singapore or in the PRC. Further, no such case pleaded. Quite the opposite: all of the contemporaneous evidence shows that the only new plant that was being discussed in 2018 and even in 2019 was a new sheet board plant that the defendant had proposed setting up in the PRC. The evidence also shows that Mr Siong and Mr Ching accepted, or at the very least acquiesced in, the defendant’s proposal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Having regard to the totality of the evidence, I accept on the balance of probabilities that entering into the loan agreements was one more of the several steps which the second plaintiff took in 2018 and 2019 to set up a new sheet board plant in the PRC.

</div> To support this argument, the second plaintiff makes two points. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 First, it points to the fact that the arrangement with Mr Li was structured as a <span class="font-italic">loan</span>, which is quite a different transaction from a principal putting a consultant in funds in anticipation of an acquisition. To address this point, the defendant called an expert witness on business practices in the PRC: Mr Huili Du Harry (“Mr Du”). Mr Du’s evidence was that it is common practice for foreign companies who intend to acquire land in the PRC to engage consultants to assist them in identifying and acquiring the land.

The loan agreements do not provide a mechanism for the second plaintiff to accelerate recovery of the RMB 14m in the event that Mr Li fails to identify land for the second plaintiff to acquire or if he does so but the transaction to acquire the land falls before it can complete. In either of those events, the loan agreements do not allow the second plaintiff to do anything to recover the RMB 14m from Mr Li. It would simply have to wait for the two-year tenor of each loan to expire.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 Indeed, the fact that the defendant chose to structure the second plaintiff’s transfer of the RMB 14m to Mr Li as a loan could very well be said to be circumstantial evidence in support of the defendant’s case, bearing in mind that I am here considering a duty of fidelity and not a duty of diligence. For example, the fact that it was a loan as opposed to an outright transfer at least ensured that the second plaintiff had some legally enforceable right to recover the RMB 14m from Mr Li. Even if this right was exercisable only after the two-year tenor of each loan had expired, it was better than nothing. And it may not be correct to view Mr Li’s obligation to pay interest at only 3% per annum as a discount to the market rate. As the defendant testified, he saw the obligation to pay interest as an incentive to Mr Li to identify and acquire the land faster.

</div> I reject the plaintiffs’ submission on this point for three reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 First, and most importantly, there is no admissible evidence that Ms Luo received any part of the RMB 14m, either from the second plaintiff or from Mr Li. There is only hearsay evidence suggesting that Mr Li transferred RMB 1m to Ms Luo. In the absence of any admissible evidence of such a transfer, Ms Luo’s relationship to the defendant is irrelevant to whether Mr Li is an “interested party” as against the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Second, even if I assume in the second plaintiff’s favour that Ms Luo did receive some part of the RMB 14m loan from Mr Li, the plaintiffs have failed to discharge their burden of proving a sufficiently close relationship between the defendant and Ms Luo to render either Mr Li or Ms Luo an “interested party” as against the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The second plaintiff’s basis for asserting an intimate personal relationship between the defendant and Ms Luo is extremely thin.

It is not the position that an adverse inference must be drawn against every party who fails to call a witness who can give material evidence. No adverse inference may be drawn if there is a wholly satisfactory explanation for the absence of the witness (at [20(d)]). Even if the explanation is not wholly satisfactory but is at least reasonable and credible, the adverse inference to be drawn may be reduced or annulled (at [20(e)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Even when the court draws an adverse inference under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act, the adverse inference drawn must be evidence that would have been admissible if the absent witness had in fact been present and had given that evidence; and the adverse inference drawn must also have some basis in the admissible evidence that is before the court. When drawing an adverse inference, the court must apply its mind to the <span class="font-italic">manner </span>in which the evidence that is not produced is said to be unfavourable (at [23]). Further, if the evidence that is not produced is the oral evidence of a witness who is outside the jurisdiction of the court for reasons that are not attributable to the relevant party, the presumption is either not raised or if raised, is rebutted (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>vol 10 and 10(2) (LexisNexis) at para 120.349).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 I decline to draw an adverse inference against the defendant that the evidence of Ms Luo and Mr Li would have been unfavourable to his case if they had been called as witnesses.

A subpoena cannot be served on any person outside Singapore (see O 38 r 18(2) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed)).

As the director failed to do so, the director was held to have breached Article 148(c).

Moreover, the defendant did not present any feasibility study, financial projections or capital requirements for setting up a sheet board plant. Therefore, Mr Siong and Mr Ching could not and would not have approved it.

Setting up a sheet board plant and approving the steps necessary to do so was a “process”, not an event.

</div> The plaintiffs themselves also assert that the defendant “drove a wedge” between Mr Siong and Mr Ching on the one hand, and Mr Tay on the other hand, and thereby convinced the former two men that Mr Tay would vote with the defendant to allow the defendant to do as he pleased with the first plaintiff and the Group and, if necessary, to remove Mr Siong and Mr Ching as directors of the first plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 I accept this evidence of the defendant’s relationship with Mr Siong and Mr Ching and of his autocratic and domineering management style. But seen from the defendant’s perspective, this means that Mr Siong and Mr Ching consented or, at the very least acquiesced, to the defendant’s exercise of ultimate management control over the first plaintiff and the Group. Thus, Mr Siong and Mr Ching had resigned themselves to doing the defendant’s bidding from the time the defendant first tabled a sheet board plant for discussion until the defendant caused the second plaintiff to enter into the loan agreements and to advance the RMB 14m to Mr Li.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 As I have foreshadowed, the critical event in the analysis of the plaintiffs’ case on Article 148(c) is the February 2018 Meeting.

Section 4 of the Act defines the word “director” as including “any person occupying the position of director of a corporation by whatever name called and includes <span class="font-italic">a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors or the majority of the directors of a corporation are accustomed to act</span> ….” [emphasis added].

</div>
</div> The presentation of evidence in litigation is undoubtedly a most serious matter. Deliberately altering evidence for the purpose of presenting it in anticipated litigation is an even more serious matter. Actually tendering the altered evidence in litigation without explaining how it was produced is an infinitely more serious matter. But I do not accept the plaintiffs’ characterisation of what the defendant or Mr Kenneth Chan did as tampering with evidence. Neither the defendant nor Mr Kenneth Chan made any attempt to suppress the first version of the April 2018 Minutes in this litigation. Nor did they misrepresent the second version of the April 2018 Minutes as a document created contemporaneously with the April 2018 Meeting, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> by surreptitiously attaching it – whether in discovery, in an affidavit of evidence in chief or for inclusion in the agreed bundle – to a contemporaneous email.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 It is, of course, a matter of serious regret that Mr Kenneth Chan did not voluntarily disclose that he produced the second version of the April 2018 Minutes only in August 2019 by amending the first version and for the specific purpose of presenting the second version as evidence in anticipated litigation. He did so only under cross-examination. But I accept the defendant’s submission that the amendments are immaterial to the essential meaning of the April 2018 Minutes in so far as they are relevant to my disposal of this action. The amendments do not detract from the evidential value of the first version of the April 2018 Minutes for that purpose. In particular, although the second version records that the directors approved expanding into “containerboard” production, it is common ground that the only business discussed at the April 2018 Meeting was sheet board production. I therefore accept that the first version of these minutes stands as a contemporaneous record in writing that the first plaintiff’s directors unanimously approved a sheet board plant at the April 2018 Meeting. The nature and consequences of Mr Kenneth Chan’s conduct outside this context is an entirely separate matter on which I express no view. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 Having regard to the totality of the evidence, therefore, I am satisfied that, at the April 2018 Meeting, the first plaintiff’s directors approved a sheet board plant and agreed to take steps to advance it. The steps which I have found at [98] were taken to set up a sheet board plant from December 2017 to May 2018 are consistent with the discussions recorded both in the February 2018 Minutes (see [162] above) and in the April 2018 Minutes. They include:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the defendant and Mr Ching arranging visits to sheet board plants in China;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Mr Siong obtaining quotations for corrugator machines for a sheet board plant between December 2017 and May 2018;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Mr Siong’s correspondence with DBS Bank in March 2018 seeking financing;

Once the first plaintiff’s directors had agreed and approved the general direction, the details would be worked out and approved along the way. Viewing the evidence in totality, I therefore accept that the first plaintiff’s directors did approve setting up a sheet board plant, and did so at the April 2018 Meeting.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Approval of the loan agreements</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 I now turn to consider whether the first plaintiff’s directors approved the second plaintiff’s entering into the loan agreements. It is not the defendant’s case that the second plaintiff’s directors approved entering into the loan agreements expressly, whether orally or in writing, <span class="font-italic">eg</span> by way of a director’s resolution. But having regard to the totality of the evidence <span class="font-italic">and </span>the management practices within the Group and the first plaintiff, I accept the defendant’s submission that the directors nevertheless approved the second plaintiff’s entering into the loan agreements because they were aware of them and acquiesced in the second plaintiff entering into them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 In his defence, the defendant makes two pleas which are relevant to this branch of the analysis.

</div> Considering this inconsistency between his pleadings and his evidence together with the lack of contemporaneous evidence supporting any such oral agreement, I find that the directors of the first defendant did not agree expressly and orally to engage Mr Li as the Group’s consultant or to transfer money to Mr Li.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 Even though there was no <span class="font-italic">express </span>oral agreement to engage Mr Li as a consultant or to transfer money to Mr Li, I accept that there was nevertheless approval in the form of Mr Siong’s and Mr Ching’s knowledge and silence. I reiterate that the management practices within the Group and the first plaintiff must be borne in mind when considering what “approval” means. I have found at [159] above that in the unique circumstances of the Group, Mr Siong’s and Mr Ching’s knowledge and silence of the defendant’s conduct did amount to approval. It is the plaintiffs’ own case that Mr Ching and Mr Siong resigned themselves to doing the defendant’s bidding to avoid confrontation.

</div> Shareholders of a company are entitled to expect that directors will perform their duties with reasonable mental fortitude. The minority shareholders who hold 7% of the first plaintiff’s shares are entitled to no less. A director who has resigned himself to doing another person’s bidding and who acquiesces in that other person’s conduct in order to avoid confrontation or removal as a director must intend his knowledge and silence or acquiescence to be taken as approval. So too, that other person is entitled to take the director’s knowledge and silence or acquiescence as approval. That is precisely what I find happened here as between the defendant on the one hand and Mr Siong and Mr Ching on the other.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 I therefore find that the directors of the first plaintiff did approve the second plaintiff moving forward to identify and acquire land for a sheet board plant. By doing so, they also approved the actions that had to be taken to advance that purpose. This includes causing the second plaintiff to enter into the loan agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 Apart from the evidence I have set out at [162]–[176] above, I find that Mr Siong and Mr Ching knew of and approved the specific step of identifying and acquiring land for a sheet board plant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 Mr Siong’s approval can be seen from the following. On 30 May 2018, the defendant sent an email to Mr Siong and Mr Ching informing them that (a) he had been looking for land in Huizhou without success, (b) an opportunity had come up to buy land in Huizhou, (c) he had suggested to the Group’s lawyers that the Group set up an escrow account to be managed by the lawyers for the land purchase, and (d) Mr Ching needed to get RMB 130m in cash ready within the next month for the land purchase.

</div> The plaintiffs submit that this draft letter does not assist the defendant because it does not refer to any loan agreements. The plaintiffs further submit that the letter is consistent with Mr Ching’s evidence and that if Mr Siong had known about the loan agreements before he drafted this letter, he would not have guessed that RMB 15m “was given out as under table money”.

To my mind, the plaintiffs’ argument that Mr Siong and Mr Ching did not know that the defendant had caused the second plaintiff to enter into the loan agreements is contrary to the inherent probabilities. Mr Siong and Mr Ching may not have known the <span class="font-italic">terms</span> of the loan agreements, such as the total amount lent being RMB 14m. But on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that they knew of the <span class="font-italic">fact </span>of the loan agreements, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the defendant had caused the second plaintiff to pay money as a loan to a third party to facilitate the third party in identifying and acquiring land for the second plaintiff for a sheet board plant.

</div> It may be that the first plaintiff’s directors were required formally and expressly to approve the Group’s expansion strategy. But Mr Siong and Mr Ching did the defendant’s bidding as to <span class="font-italic">how</span> this broad strategy was to be implemented. And these two directors: (a) knew what these plans were; (b) were conditioned and had resigned themselves not to raise doubts or contradict the defendant; and (c) did not in fact raise any doubts or contradict the defendant. In these circumstances, it was entirely reasonable for the defendant to consider that Mr Siong and Mr Ching approved of the steps he was taking. I find that there was the necessary and sufficient approval by the first plaintiff’s directors of the defendant causing the second plaintiff to enter into the loan agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 The plaintiffs have therefore failed to prove their case that the first plaintiff’s directors did not approve the defendant taking steps to set up a sheet board plant, including by causing the second plaintiff to enter into the loan agreements.

</div> To my mind, neither of the plaintiffs in this case have a cause of action against the defendant which can yield any relief for this alleged breach of duty. As I have said at [66]–[68] above, AMBDG’s losses are not the first plaintiff’s losses and cannot be transformed in law into the first plaintiff’s losses.

</div> The loan agreements do not oblige Mr Li to apply the RMB 14m solely for the purpose of “[l]and purchase at industrial park”. They do not give the second plaintiff any contractual or practical mechanism to police the purpose to which Mr Li applies the RMB 14m once he has received it. They make no provision for security or for a third-party guarantee for the second plaintiff to recourse to if Mr Li uses the RMB 14m for a different purpose or fails to repay it after two years. As I observed at [126] above, they do not allow the second plaintiff to accelerate Mr Li’s repayment obligation. They also do not oblige Mr Li to attempt to secure a refund of the deposit if negotiations with a potential seller fail. As the second plaintiff points out, its only right to recover the RMB 14m is by waiting for the two-year tenor of the loan agreements to expire.

At the very least, legal advice would have made the defendant aware of the shortcomings in the terms of the loan agreement. Instead, the defendant’s evidence is that he approached the loan agreements as an entirely commercial matter, not as a legal matter requiring legal advice to ensure that the second plaintiff’s legal interests were reasonably adequately protected.

</div> I have also found that the RMB 14m advanced to Mr Li was applied towards setting up a sheet board plant. This is broadly consistent with the January 2019 Email.

</div> Second, the defendant has an interest in at least 20% of the shares in the first plaintiff through Caldicott. It is not part of the plaintiffs’ case that the defendant derived any personal gain from causing the second plaintiff to advance RMB 14m to Mr Li. Therefore, any loss that he intended to cause to the first plaintiff would rebound as to at least 20% upon himself. For these two additional reasons, I find that the plaintiffs’ case that the defendant acted with any intention, predominant or otherwise, of causing loss to either of the plaintiffs to be contrary to the inherent probabilities.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 The plaintiff submits that the defendant incorporated China HX and HK Xinlong in May 2019 in furtherance of his conspiracy with Mr Li.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 The first point I make is that I have found the defendant liable to the second plaintiff for a wrong and not for a breach of contract or for a breach of the duty of fidelity. The defendant’s breach of his duty of diligence renders him liable to put the second plaintiff in the position it would have been in if that breach of duty had never occurred. The defendant is not liable to put the second plaintiff in the position it would have been in if the defendant had, in breach of his duty of diligence, nevertheless caused the second plaintiff to enter into the loan agreements with Mr Li <span class="font-italic">and</span> if Mr Li had performed his obligation under the loan agreements to pay interest to the second plaintiff at 3% per annum. In my view, therefore, the defendant’s only liability to the second plaintiff is to compensate it for the actual loss it has suffered, and not to compensate it for any benefit under the loan agreements that it expected to receive from Mr Li but has failed to receive. The defendant’s breach of his duty of diligence to the second plaintiff does not render him a guarantor to the second plaintiff of Mr Li’s obligations under the loan agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 This result is clear from considering the second plaintiff’s case against the defendant more closely. The second plaintiff’s case is that the defendant breached his duty of diligence to the second plaintiff by causing the second plaintiff to enter into the loan agreements instead of a escrow, custody or other similar agreement. That raises two alternative counterfactuals to consider in assessing damages: (a) the defendant <span class="font-italic">not</span> causing the second plaintiff to enter into any agreement with Mr Li at all; or (b) the defendant causing the second plaintiff to enter into an escrow, custody or other similar agreement with Mr Li. On the first alternative, the second plaintiff would still have the RMB 14m but would have no right to receive interest from Mr Li. The second plaintiff’s loss would be simply the RMB 14m. On the second alternative, the result would be the same. If the defendant had caused the second plaintiff to enter into a escrow, custody or other agreement with Mr Li, the second plaintiff would not have put the RMB 14m at Mr Li’s unqualified disposal but would have retained control over it. If the RMB 14m was not at Mr Li’s unqualified disposal, there would have been no commercial basis whatsoever for the second plaintiff to receive any interest on the RMB 14m from Mr Li. On the alternative counterfactual too, the second plaintiff would have the RMB 14m but would have no right to receive interest from Mr Li.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 That suffices in itself to render the RMB 1.26m irrecoverable from the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 Further, in the context of an action for breach of a duty of diligence (as opposed to an action for breach of contract or in debt) and given the counterfactuals in this case, I accept that the loss of interest at 3% per annum which the defendant claims it suffered is special damage. Special damage is a type of loss which the law will not presume is the natural or probable consequence of a defendant’s wrongful act (<span class="font-italic">Crest Capital Asia Pte Ltd and others v OUE Lippo Healthcare Ltd (formerly known as International </span><span class="font-italic">Healthway Corp Ltd) and another and other appeals </span>[2021] 1 SLR 1337 at [211], citing <span class="font-italic">The</span><span class="font-italic"> “Shravan” </span>[1999] 2 SLR(R) 713 at [77]). The defendant’s wrongful act in this case is causing the second plaintiff to enter into the loan agreement with Mr Li. Mr Li’s breach of his contractual obligation to pay interest under the loan agreements is not a natural or a probable consequence of the defendant’s breach of his duty of diligence. The second plaintiff’s claim for interest is therefore special damage and ought to have been pleaded in order to avoid taking the defendant by surprise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 For both these reasons, I dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim to recover the interest of RMB 1.26m.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The investigation expenses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 I reject the second plaintiff’s claim for the RMB 5.77m in investigation expenses.

Neither can the plaintiffs rely on Mr Lock’s affidavit of evidence in chief as a backdoor pleading (<span class="font-italic">Tuitiongenius</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Toh Yew Keat and another </span>[2021] 1 SLR 231 at [67]). This is not a mere technicality. The second plaintiff’s failure to plead that it suffered loss in the form of an obligation to reimburse AMBDG for these expenses deprived the defendant of the opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiffs’ witnesses on the existence and scope of this alleged obligation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">265 Second, even on the plaintiffs’ own case, the effect of the resolutions is not to create an immediate obligation, binding on the second plaintiff, to reimburse AMBDG in the sum of RMB 5.77m. The only effect of the resolutions is to create a conditional obligation: one which will bind the second plaintiff if and only if the second plaintiff succeeds in recovering RMB 5.77m from the defendant. Given the conditionality of this obligation, it is apparent that even today, the judgment date, the second plaintiff is <span class="font-underline">not</span> obliged to reimburse AMBDG in the sum of RMB 5.77m. On the clear wording of the resolution, the second plaintiff will become obliged to do so only if it recovers that sum from the defendant in this action. But it can recover that sum from the defendant in this action only if it is legally obliged to reimburse AMBDG in that sum. There is no way to break the circularity. The resolutions therefore do not have the effect of transforming expenses incurred by AMBDG into a loss suffered by the second plaintiff in the form of an obligation to reimburse AMDG for those expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">266 Third, the two resolutions were passed in June 2021. The second plaintiff commenced this action in March 2020.

</div> Even taking the second plaintiff’s case at its highest and assuming that the resolutions created an immediate and binding legal obligation on the second plaintiff to reimburse AMBDG in the sum of RMB 5.77m in June 2021, it could not have been subject to any such obligation when the second plaintiff commenced this action in March 2020. AMBDG was the only proper plaintiff to seek to recover the RMB 5.77m in March 2020. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">267 Fourth, it is unclear what proportion of the investigation expenses were expenses that AMBDG incurred on behalf of the second plaintiff. The breakdown of the investigation expenses shows that the RMB 5.77m includes, among other expenses, professional and operational expenses “of AMBDG’s subsidiaries”.
