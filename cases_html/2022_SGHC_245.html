After considering the conflicting legal opinions put forth by the parties, I held that the <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu </span>interpretation was incorrect. Instead, where a beneficiary like Shafeeq passes away without offspring, his or her share ought to accrue to other beneficiaries who own shares under the same lineage (or portion) (“the branch interpretation”). In other words, Shafeeq’s share under the Settlement ought to remain within his mother Aisha’s portion, in the sense that it ought to accrue to his siblings, who were the surviving beneficiaries under Aisha’s lineage, rather than split amongst <span class="font-italic">all </span>beneficiaries under the Settlement (see <span class="font-italic">British Malayan Trustees v Lutfi Salim bin Talib and others </span>[2019] SGHC 270<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [51]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 My decision in OS 163 was not appealed against. As such, owing to the incorrect application of the <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu </span>interpretation in respect of Hana’s, Noor’s, Salleh’s, and Shafeeq’s shares, most beneficiaries have been overpaid, while some beneficiaries (<span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Shafeeq’s siblings) have been underpaid over the years. After some accounting, the extent of overpayment (and concomitant underpayment) to the beneficiaries between November 2001 and November 2019 amounted to $2,959,842.

For example, beneficiaries who are agreeable to some recoupment may differ as to the time in which such recoupment should be cut-off. For this reason, it is not possible to interpret the lack of response by the remaining non-Respondent beneficiaries as intimating consent to whatever position that the Group 1 Respondents will be taking. This is particularly so as the position to be taken by the Group 1 Respondents has not been finalised and may be changed upon deeper research of the relevant authorities as regards the issue of equitable recoupment. Given this, sub-divisions may also form within the Group 1 Respondents at a later stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Furthermore, since Hana’s, Noor’s, Salleh’s, and Shafeeq’s shares were all incorrectly distributed pursuant to the <span class="font-italic">pari</span><span class="font-italic"> passu </span>interpretation, it is reasonable to infer that at least <span class="font-italic">some </span>of the remaining 77 non-Respondent beneficiaries will be underpaid, rather than overpaid, beneficiaries. Accordingly, it is likelier that such underpaid beneficiaries would have positions that align closer to those of the 6th and 7th Respondents (“the Group 2 Respondents”), which includes Lutfi Salim bin Talib, Shafeeq’s brother. In addition, sub-groups may also arise amongst the underpaid beneficiaries, for instance as to the appropriate start date for the repayment (if any). It may be envisaged in this regard that beneficiaries sharing Hana’s lineage would advocate for a start date of 2001<span class="font-italic">, </span>when she was deemed to have passed without offspring, while Shafeeq’s siblings would be content to have a start date of 2014, when Shafeeq passed, since an earlier date would have no practical impact on them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 Secondly, it is significant to note that all beneficiaries have been alerted to these proceedings even before it was initiated. Prior to taking out this OS, the Trustee gave all the beneficiaries notice of its intention to do so by way of a Trustee’s Circular.

Against this, the Group 1 Respondents submit that the majority of beneficiaries are located in Singapore and Yemen, and due to the ongoing conflict and civil war in Yemen, the Trustee has experienced difficulty in communicating with the beneficiaries located there. This may have hindered the ability of certain beneficiaries to contact the Trustee to indicate their intention to participate in these proceedings.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In my view, this is entirely speculative. As the Group 2 Respondents submit, the present OS emanates from OS 163, which was initiated more than three years ago. Since then, there have been numerous correspondence between the Trustee and the beneficiaries by way of Trustee’s Circulars. No evidence has been tendered by the Group 1 Respondents supporting the assertion that because of the war, these beneficiaries have not been able to participate in the present proceedings. If these beneficiaries were unable to stay in contact with Trustee due to the Yemeni war, this begs the question as to how they have been able to receive payments from the Trustee under the Settlement during the same period. It is reasonable to surmise that such payments would not have been insignificant and that notwithstanding the war, at least some of the beneficiaries based in Yemen would have reached out to the Trustee if they stopped receiving such payments. Furthermore, as the Group 1 Respondents accept, the majority of beneficiaries are located in Yemen <span class="font-italic">and </span><span class="font-italic">Singapore</span>. If so, why have the beneficiaries who are not based in Yemen not indicated their intention to participate in these proceedings, notwithstanding repeated notices from the Trustee? The simpler and more obvious answer must be that they have no intention to participate in the present OS, whether for time and costs considerations or otherwise.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 To this, the Group 1 Respondents submit that the non-Respondent beneficiaries “may not be comfortable with [the Trustee] representing their interests in OS 288”.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Again, this is entirely speculative, and goes against the grain of the Trustee Circulars sent by the Trustee, which explained that the Trustee was not seeking to represent the interests of the beneficiaries. Rather, by the circulars, interested beneficiaries were invited to indicate their interest so that they may be added as Respondents to OS 288 and to provide their viewpoints for the Court’s consideration. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Thirdly, and related to the above, it appears improper for the Group 1 Respondents to purport to represent all remaining beneficiaries in the present OS. O 80 r 3 of ROC 2014 provides the mechanism for interested beneficiaries to be added to the OS, and this was the basis by which the Group 1 and 2 Respondents were joined to these proceedings. It also does not appear necessary, nor is it “expedient … for the purpose of saving expense” (O 15 r 13(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of ROC 2014) for the remaining beneficiaries to be added as respondents to OS 288. The present OS has been taken out pursuant to O 80 r 2 of ROC 2014, for a determination of an issue pertaining to the administration of the Settlement. This is significant, because whereas O 15 r 4(2) of ROC 2014 provides that “[w]here the plaintiff in any action claims any relief to which any other person is entitled jointly with him, all persons so entitled must … be parties to the action and any of them who does not consent to being joined as a plaintiff must … be made a defendant”, O 80 r 3(2) provides an exception to this general rule:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) <span class="font-italic">Notwithstanding anything in Order 15, Rule 4(2),</span> and without prejudice to the powers of the Court under that Order, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">all the persons having a beneficial interest in or claim against the estate or having a beneficial interest under the trust</span>, as the case may be, to which such an action as is mentioned in paragraph (1) relates <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">need not be parties to the action</span>; but the plaintiff may make such of those persons, whether all or any one or more of them, parties as, having regard to the nature of the relief or remedy claimed in the action, he thinks fit. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In other words, for the purposes of the present OS, there is no necessity for the remaining beneficiaries to be added as parties to the action. The mechanism is also clearly in place for any interested beneficiary to be added as a respondent and to provide his or her viewpoint. Despite this and notwithstanding multiple notices by the Trustee for interested beneficiaries to indicate their interest, only the seven Respondents have indicated their interest to being added as parties to this action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 For the above reasons, I do not think it expedient for the purpose of saving expense to allow the Group 1 Respondents to represent the interests of all remaining beneficiaries, in particular given that these beneficiaries may diverge into any of the sub-groups discussed at [10]–[12] above and adopt contrasting positions later on. This may complicate the matter further, and it is improper, by this summons, to dissect and concretise the positions of <span class="font-italic">all </span>beneficiaries to the positions to be taken by the Group 1 and Group 2 Respondents only. Accordingly, I allow the summons only in part, in that I will make an order allowing the Group 1 Respondents to act as representatives of the 15 beneficiaries who have provided their express written consent to have their interests represented by the Group 1 Respondents. I note in this regard that neither the Trustee nor the Group 2 Respondents have raised any concerns on the legitimacy of the consent provided by these 15 beneficiaries.
