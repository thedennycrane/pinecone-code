However, the complainant only heard either her brother or sister say very loudly “Papa molester!”, followed by laughter. Although the door was locked, it could be easily unlocked with a coin. The complainant attempted to push against the door to close it but could not. The accused then entered the toilet, closed the door and locked it. The complainant kept making noises and asked him to leave but was told by the accused to keep quiet. He then turned the complainant around to face the toilet bowl and raped her for about six minutes. Thereafter he told the complainant to wash up and not to tell anyone about what happened. Subsequently, the complainant washed up, got dressed and left the house with the accused and her siblings to go to her mother’s workplace.

However, the WhatsApp messages exchanged between the accused and his wife a few days after the statement was recorded from the accused (see [33] above) seemed to suggest that there must have been some suggestion made to the accused then that his semen had been detected on the complainant’s clothing.

The accused could have simply stopped at telling his wife that the police officers had threatened to lock him up if he did not confess – which was in fact a part of his explanation to his wife – and say nothing further in relation to the semen evidence.

This undermined the credibility of the testimonies provided by ASP Xu and ASP Raj, including their evidence that no threat, inducement or promise whatsoever had been rendered to the accused by either of them. Accordingly, I found that the prosecution had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the contested statement was given voluntarily and declined to admit the statement at the conclusion of the ancillary hearing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 At the end of the prosecution’s cross-examination of the accused, the prosecution made an application under s 279(7) of the CPC for a reconsideration of the admissibility of the contested statement.

In relation to the first charge for example, the complainant recalled that she had called out to her sister for assistance when the accused tried to enter the toilet but that all she heard was either her brother or sister say the words “Papa molester!” and that there was laughter thereafter.

The complainant had also provided a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy, which was that she had earlier given the date of 11 January 2015 as 11 January is the date of her friend’s birthday and she had been thinking about that and was confused when she first made the report.

The testimonies of the boyfriend and B in relation to how they came to know about the complainant’s sexual abuse and how the offences were eventually reported were consistent with material aspects of the complainant’s account. This included the boyfriend’s testimony that the complainant had first asked him if he would still like her if she was no longer a virgin and her subsequent confiding in him about the sexual abuse.

</div> which I agree with:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I accepted that victims of sexual offences may not behave in a stereotypical way. Many victims report their sexual abuse early to a family member, friend, the police, or other person in authority. However, there is no general rule requiring victims of sexual offences to report the offences immediately or in a timely fashion. Instead, the explanation for any such delay in reporting is to be considered and assessed by the court on a case-by-case basis (see <span class="font-italic">DT v Public Prosecutor</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 583 at [62]; <span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Seng v Public Prosecutor</span> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 444 at [79]). While I accept that an omission to report the offence in a timely fashion, in the absence of other evidence, may in certain circumstances make it difficult to establish a case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, I emphasise that the effect of any delay in reporting always falls to be assessed on the specific facts of each individual case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… While the average adult may be expected to react in a particular way – for example, to resist, report or complain about an assault as soon as possible – a child or juvenile cannot be expected to always react similarly. The thinking process, assumptions and viewpoint of a child or juvenile victim may lead to a course of action that may on its face appear unreasonable or improbable to an adult. However, the court must always be mindful of the reasons behind what may seem like unexpected conduct on the part of a child or juvenile victim, and should not measure a child or juvenile by adult standards.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Therefore, I was satisfied that the complainant’s testimony was unusually convincing and sufficient on its own to prove the charges against the accused.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Goh Han Heng</span>”), Yong Pung How CJ held that such burden on the prosecution arises only where the accused was able to show that the complainant had a motive to falsely implicate him. Yong CJ stated at [33] of the decision:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]here the accused can show that the complainant has a motive to falsely implicate him, then the burden must fall on the Prosecution to disprove that motive. This does not mean that the accused merely needs to allege that the complainant has a motive to falsely implicate him. Instead, the accused must adduce sufficient evidence of this motive so as to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. Only then would the burden of proof shift to the Prosecution to prove that there was no such motive. To hold otherwise would mean that the Prosecution would have the burden of proving a lack of motive to falsely implicate the accused in literally every case, thereby practically instilling a lack of such a motive as a constituent element of every offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In <span class="font-italic">AOF, </span>the Court of Appeal clarified that the above statements from <span class="font-italic">Goh Han Heng</span> should not be interpreted as “suggesting that the Prosecution bears the legal burden to disprove the allegation of collusion <span class="font-italic">only after</span> the accused has discharged his evidential burden by proving a motive for collusion to a standard that is sufficient to create a <span class="font-italic">reasonable doubt</span> in the Prosecution’s case” [emphasis in the original]. Instead, the accused has an evidential burden to show that the complainant had a “plausible motive” to fabricate the allegations against the accused (<span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [216]). The burden then shifts to the prosecution to disprove this beyond a reasonable doubt (<span class="font-italic">AOF</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [217]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The defence’s case was that the complainant had fabricated the allegations against the accused in order to gain freedom from her parents who were strict with her.

First, the complainant was reluctant to disclose the offences and to make a police report because, amongst others, she was worried that it would cause her relationship with her family to “turn sour” (see [53] above). The matter started with her being concerned that the fact that she was not a virgin would affect her relationship with her boyfriend. This led to her eventual disclosure to her boyfriend of the rapes by the accused. And it was only after much pressuring from him and B that she decided to tell her school counsellor about the sexual abuse, which in turn led to the police report being lodged.

</div>
</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>”), the Court of Appeal established a sentencing framework for offences of rape. The Court of Appeal summarised the sentencing framework as follows at [73] of <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span>:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) At the first step, the court should have regard to the <span class="font-italic">offence-specific </span>factors in deciding which band the offence in question falls<span class="font-italic"> </span>under. Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of<span class="font-italic"> </span>sentences which may <span class="font-italic">usually </span>be imposed for an offence with those<span class="font-italic"> </span>features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely<span class="font-italic"> </span>where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an<span class="font-italic"> </span>“indicative starting point”. In exceptional cases, the court may decide<span class="font-italic"> </span>on an indicative starting point which falls outside the prescribed range, although cogent reasons should be given for such a decision.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The sentencing bands prescribe ranges of sentences which would be appropriate for contested cases and are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(i) Band 1 comprises cases at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness which attract sentences of ten to 13 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. Such cases feature no offence-specific aggravating factors or are cases where these factors are only present to a very limited extent and therefore have a limited impact on sentence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(ii) Band 2 comprises cases of rape of a higher level of seriousness which attract sentences of 13–17 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. Such cases would usually contain two or more offence-specific aggravating factors …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(iii) Band 3 comprises cases which, by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors, present themselves as extremely serious cases of rape. They should attract sentences of between 17–20 years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are <span class="font-italic">personal to the offender</span> to calibrate the sentence. These are factors which relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, <span class="font-italic">cannot </span>be the same factors which have already been taken into account in determining the categorisation of the offence. ...</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) The court should clearly articulate the factors it has taken into consideration as well as the weight which it is placing on them. This applies <span class="font-italic">both </span>at the second step of the analysis, when the court is calibrating the sentence from the indicative starting point <span class="font-italic">and </span>at the end of the sentencing process, when the court adjusts the sentence on account of the totality principle. In this regard, we would add one further caveat. In a case where the offender faces two or more charges, and the court is required to order one or more sentences to run consecutively, the court can, if it thinks it necessary, further calibrate the individual sentence to ensure that the global sentence is appropriate and not excessive. When it does so, the court should explain itself so that the individual sentence imposed will not be misunderstood.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Parties’ submissions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The prosecution submitted that a global sentence of at least 28 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane was an appropriate sentence in this case.

The accused, as the biological father of the complainant, was someone in whom the complainant ought to have been able to repose her trust. The accused however betrayed the relationship and committed the heinous act of rape against the complainant, who was at the time, still at the tender age of 14 years old. The accused raped his own daughter in the sanctity of her home, including in her bedroom, and had effectively driven her out of her home.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I also rejected the defence’s submission that there was a lack of premeditation in the offences, and that this was an offence-specific mitigating factor.

The offender’s culpability cannot be simply brushed aside lightly or dusted off purely because of economic considerations. Lamentably, there are no easy or right answers in cases of this nature.

</div> (“<span class="font-italic">Raveen</span>”) at [39]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In addition, in <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ held that as a general rule, a multiple offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, through individual sentences that run consecutively (at [41]). The following reasons were provided for the general rule (<span class="font-italic">Raveen</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [42]–[46]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, a multiple offender bears greater culpability and will have caused greater harm than an offender who has committed only a single offence.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would not adequately serve, and in fact may undermine the sentencing considerations that underlie the individual sentences comprising the aggregate term. In terms of the sentencing consideration of deterrence, the imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would afford an offender who has already committed an offence less or no real incentive to refrain from committing a further offence. In addition, from the retributivist perspective, imposing concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would mean that the second or later legally protected interest that was infringed would have no apparent vindication in law. Likewise, the duration of punishment would not adequately reflect the greater need for public protection against a multiple offender who cannot claim to have acted in an isolated instance of misjudgement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, allowing a multiple offender to be punished less seriously or even not at all for a second or further offending is contrary to any notion of justice. Public confidence in the administration of criminal justice requires the court to avoid the suggestion that a multiple offender may benefit from some sort of bulk discount in sentencing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In this case, the offences under both charges were unrelated in that they were carried out on separate occasions, more than one and a half months apart from each other, rather than as a single continuous transaction.

</div> Having regard to the principles articulated in <span class="font-italic">Raveen</span> including the reasons for the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences, which were equally relevant and applicable in this case, I was satisfied that the sentences imposed on the accused for each charge should run consecutively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Taking into account all the circumstances of this case, I was satisfied that a sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for each charge of rape, to run consecutively, would be an appropriate sentence in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 While the operative offence-specific aggravating factors in this case would have placed it at the higher end of Band 2 of the <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng </span>sentencing framework, taking into account the totality principle, I was satisfied that a consecutive sentence at the lower end of Band 2 would be appropriate. I therefore sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 26 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane, which was an appropriate sentence to give effect to the sentencing principles of retribution, as well as general and specific deterrence applicable in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Having considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties, I found that both charges of rape had been proven against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly in the light of the DNA evidence and the unusually convincing testimony of the complainant in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The heinous offences committed by the accused in this case rendered the sentencing principles of retribution and deterrence paramount. There was a need to send out a clear message to the accused and would-be sex offenders that the abuse of a relationship with a vulnerable victim to satisfy sexual impulse will be met with severe penal consequences. Taking into account all the circumstances of the case, I was of the view that a global sentence of 26 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane was appropriate and sentenced the accused accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Lee Seiu Kin<br/>Judge </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Winston Man and Chee Ee Ling (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution;<br/>A Revi Shanker s/o K Annamalai and Mathew Kurian (ARShanker Law Chambers, Regent Law LLC) for the accused.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
