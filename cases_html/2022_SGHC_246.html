I found that the present case was one such instance where the exercise of that power was appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 HC/OS 1115/2021 (“OS 1115”) is the plaintiff’s application to set aside a final award dated 5 August 2021 (the “Award”), issued by a sole arbitrator (the “Arbitrator” or the “Tribunal”) in Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) Arbitration No 279 of 2019 (consolidated with SIAC Arbitration No 280 of 2019) (the “Arbitration”). The plaintiff rests its challenge on s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (the “IAA”), and Arts 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) and 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Model Law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 Having carefully considered the parties’ arguments and the evidence before me, I was persuaded that the Arbitrator had breached the rules of natural justice, such that there were grounds for setting aside the Award under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA. However, instead of setting aside the Award in its entirety, and at the defendant’s request, I exercised my powers under Art 34(4) of the Model Law to suspend the setting aside proceedings and remit the Award to the Tribunal. I informed the parties of my orders by way of brief oral grounds which I delivered on 27 May 2022. Aggrieved by my decision, the plaintiff has since filed an appeal. These are my full grounds of decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Singapore and is in the business of the import and export of various commodities.

Instead, these issues only came to the fore in the parties’ further submissions following the hearing on 4 February 2022. In the circumstances, while neither party submitted extensively on this point, I found it apposite to first consider if the plaintiff was precluded from relying on these grounds of challenge by reason of the fact that they had not been sufficiently canvassed in the supporting affidavit filed with OS 1115.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Order 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) provides that an application to set aside an arbitral award under s 24 of the IAA or Art 34(2) of the Model Law must be made by originating summons. Further, <span class="font-italic">per </span>O 69A r 2(4A) of the ROC, the affidavit in support must, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, “state the grounds in support of the application” and “be served with the originating summons”. In my view, it was clear from a plain reading of these provisions that an affidavit filed in support of a setting aside application must reasonably contain <span class="font-italic">all </span>the grounds relied upon for the application. To the extent necessary to expound on this point, I refer to my observations in <span class="font-italic">BTN and another v BTP and another and other matters </span>[2021] SGHC 271 at [62]–[63], which I reproduce below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62 In my judgment, the affidavit(s) in support served with the originating summons must reasonably contain all the facts, evidence and grounds relied upon in support of an application under O 69A r 2(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the ROC to set aside an award. This coheres with the procedure set out in O 69A r 2(4C) of the ROC in which the defendant must, if he wishes to oppose the application, file an affidavit stating the grounds on which he <span class="font-italic">opposes</span> the application 14 days after being served with the originating summons. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">When the defendant is served with the originating summons (and any affidavit or affidavits in support which are required to be served with the originating summons), the originating summons and the affidavit(s) in support are meant, compendiously, to inform the defendant of the specific grounds on which the arbitral award is being challenged.</span> The facts and circumstances and the grounds relied upon to challenge the award should therefore be detailed with sufficient particularity in the affidavit or affidavits that are served on the defendant with the originating summons. Having been served with that compendious ‘package’ comprising the application, and the supporting grounds and evidence for the application, the defendant will then know the case being mounted and will put forth its defence or opposition to the application by way of an affidavit or affidavits in reply filed in accordance with O 69A r 2(4C) of the ROC.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 While it may be common practice for a plaintiff to file further reply affidavits after the defendant has filed its affidavit in opposition to the application, this does not mean that the plaintiff should be permitted to advance <span class="font-italic">new grounds</span> in <span class="font-italic">subsequent</span> affidavits by introducing new facts and circumstances that could and should have been raised at first instance. That does not sit well with the procedure contemplated in O 69A r 2 of the ROC, and does violence to the clear language in O 69A r 2(4A)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) requiring any supporting affidavit <span class="font-italic">to be served with the originating summons</span>. Similarly, even in cases where there is a related appeal pending, a plaintiff ought not to be permitted to hedge its bets by drafting the initial affidavit in support in vague terms and then introducing new grounds in subsequent reply affidavits. Not only would that amount to springing a surprise on the defendant, but such conduct would also contribute to greater inefficiency by prolonging the proceedings, and possibly also encourage abuse of process. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">In such a scenario, a plaintiff/applicant should be forewarned that the court may well preclude it from raising such new grounds belatedly</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 A plaintiff in a setting aside application therefore cannot hope to steal a march on his opponent by omitting or obfuscating the grounds of challenge in an affidavit filed in support of the application, only to raise those grounds later in his submissions. Nonetheless, there will be cases falling on the borderline. It appeared to me that <span class="font-italic">CNQ v CNR</span> [2021] SGHC 287 (“<span class="font-italic">CNQ</span>”) was such a case. In <span class="font-italic">CNQ</span>, the parties had entered into a contract for the sale and purchase of optical fiber preforms. In the arbitration proceedings, the buyer was found to have breached the contract by its non-acceptance of the goods, and had been ordered to pay damages to the seller under s 50(3) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 383, 1999 Rev Ed) (the “SOGA (SG)”). The buyer sought to set aside the award, on the basis that it had been unable to present its case and that the tribunal had acted in breach of the rules of natural justice. At the oral hearing of the setting aside application, the buyer alleged for the first time that the reason why it had been unable to present its case was that the tribunal had unilaterally decided to award damages under s 50(3) of the SOGA (SG). The seller’s position throughout the arbitration had been that s 50(2), and not s 50(3) of the SOGA (SG), was the applicable provision (the “SOGA (SG) Issue”) (at [2]). In connection with the SOGA (SG) Issue, the buyer also contended that the tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction by awarding damages under s 50(3) of the SOGA (SG), contrary to Art 34(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(iii) of the Model Law (“the excess of jurisdiction ground”). This was not a ground of challenge that had been raised in the buyer’s originating summons, affidavits or written submissions (at [4]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Andre Maniam J noted that there was therefore “some element of surprise to the Seller”, caused by the introduction of the SOGA (SG) Issue and the excess of jurisdiction ground at the oral hearing (at [103]). Nonetheless, the learned Judge observed that these grounds of challenge were “based on evidence already before the court” (at [101]). While the distinction between ss 50(2) and 50(3) of the SOGA (SG) had not featured prominently until the oral hearing, the buyer <span class="font-italic">had</span> complained that the tribunal had not considered its contentions in relation to certain issues pertinent to s 50(3) of the SOGA (SG) (such as “market price”, “available market”, and “hypothetical market price”): at [102]. Moreover, the buyer’s allegation that the tribunal had denied it a right to be heard on the SOGA (SG) Issue rested on the same factual matrix as the excess of jurisdiction ground (at [101]). Following the oral hearing of the setting aside application, the seller was also granted leave to make further arguments in correspondence, and the buyer was allowed to reply (at [103]). In the circumstances, Maniam J decided to deal with the merits of the SOGA (SG) Issue and the excess of jurisdiction ground, although the Judge forewarned that other cases “may well merit stricter treatment in this regard” (at [104]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 With this in mind, I turned to consider the facts of the present case. The plaintiff filed one affidavit with its originating summons, namely that of Mr Agrawal (“Mr Agrawal’s affidavit”). Mr Agrawal’s affidavit did not expressly frame the Ambiguity Issue or the SOGA Issue as breaches of natural justice, warranting the setting aside of the Award. Nonetheless, Mr Agrawal<span class="font-italic"> did </span>complain that the Tribunal had found the Price Adjustment Mechanism to be ambiguous despite the defendant having not taken this position:

The Tribunal made a number of incorrect findings in respect of the terms of the Addenda.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) Second, the Tribunal concluded that the specific terms agreed between the Parties in respect of the provisional price, apportionment of costs and expenses for onward sales, were contradictory to the reference to ‘FOBST’.

Similar to the facts of <span class="font-italic">CNQ</span>, it was evident in the present case that the SOGA Issue and the Ambiguity Issue had not featured prominently in the plaintiff’s case, up until the filing of the parties’ further submissions following the hearing on 4 February 2022. Nonetheless, the <span class="font-italic">substance</span> of the plaintiff’s grievances had, to some extent, been canvassed in Mr Agrawal’s affidavit. This could be seen from para 63(2) of Mr Agrawal’s affidavit, where he complained that the defendant had not contended in the Arbitration that (a) the Addenda suffered from any ambiguity; or (b) that “any legal consequences” followed from the ambiguity in the Addenda. In my view, this encapsulated the essence of the plaintiff’s grounds of challenge in relation to the Ambiguity Issue and the SOGA Issue, which were that (a) the Tribunal had found the Addenda to be ambiguous, despite neither party taking this position; and (b) the Tribunal had found that the “legal consequence” of the ambiguity in the Addenda was that the plaintiff was obliged to pay the defendant a reasonable price under s 8(2) of the SOGA, without giving the parties an opportunity to be heard on the same.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Moreover, even if there had been “some element of surprise” occasioned to the defendant in the present application, I found that the defendant had been given sufficient opportunity to respond to the Ambiguity Issue and the SOGA Issue in the two rounds of further submissions filed pursuant to my directions. In this regard, I also noted that there was no allegation by the defendant that it had been deprived of the opportunity to file the requisite affidavit evidence, or to otherwise resist the setting aside application, by reason of the plaintiff’s belated arguments on the Ambiguity Issue and the SOGA Issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I therefore found that it was not appropriate in the present case to exclude the Ambiguity Issue and the SOGA Issue from my consideration, as possible grounds for setting aside the Award. Even if these grounds of challenge had not been at the forefront of the plaintiff’s submissions, they had been canvassed in substance in Mr Agrawal’s affidavit. In any event, limited prejudice, if at all, had been occasioned to the defendant. Nonetheless, and as I have mentioned above, I stress that the present case fell on the borderline. It would be ill-advised for a similarly placed applicant to be, whether inadvertently or worse, deliberately, anything short of transparent and unequivocal in setting out its grounds of challenge in the affidavit(s) filed in support of a setting aside application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Did the Ambiguity Issue or the SOGA Issue provide a basis for setting aside the Award?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Having answered Issue 1 in the negative, I turned to consider whether the Ambiguity Issue or the SOGA Issue provided a possible basis for setting aside the Award. In my judgment, the mere fact that the Arbitrator referred to <br/>s 8(1) of the SOGA and concluded that the Price Adjustment Mechanism was ambiguous did not, in itself, amount to a breach of the rules of natural justice that prejudiced the rights of the parties. However, as I stated at the beginning of these grounds of decision, the breach of natural justice in this case lay in the Arbitrator’s failure to allow the parties a reasonable opportunity to be heard, in adopting a chain of reasoning based on s 8<span class="font-italic">(2)</span> of the SOGA. Let me elaborate on why I came to this conclusion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 I begin by setting out the relevant paragraphs of the Award:

The [SOGA] provides at section 8 as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">‘(1) the price in a contract of sale may be fixed by the contract, or may be left to be fixed in a manner agreed by the contract, or may be determined by the course of dealing between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) where the price is not determined as mentioned in subsection (1) above the buyer must pay a reasonable price.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) what is a reasonable price is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case.’</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">154.

The wording of Point 2 of the Addenda does not say who is responsible for putting together the raw data from onward sales and, for precisely what items could be included in the calculations. It also does not specify that this will be the final price, but ‘the basis of final price/value’. That implied further calculations to which no one but the [plaintiff] was privy. Furthermore, the items listed as expenses in the Addenda are costs for which the [plaintiff] is responsible under the FOBST Incoterm used in the Contract and repeated in the Addenda.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">156. The [defendant] has claimed damages based on the original prices of USD33.50 and USD34.50 agreed in Clause 4 of the Contracts. That cannot be right, as the price was to be adjusted for variations in quality, and the [defendant] did deliver ore below the contractual level of 57%.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">157. In the context of these proceedings the [plaintiff] has produced a lengthy and complex analysis for the calculation of the appropriate final sales price based on the proceeds of sale, without consulting the [defendant].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">158. Mr. Agrawal’s calculations were endorsed by his expert witness, Mr. Emmott, who himself appeared to have used a different set of calculations. Unfortunately, Mr. Emmott himself agreed at the hearing, that as a metallurgist, he has no experience in the real-life purchase and sale of the products he analyses. His endorsement could only rely on information from Mr. Agrawal and from a consultant who did not sign the witness statement and who did not appear at the hearing. As such, it is not helpful.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">159. The [plaintiff’s] ‘accounting’ results in a figure lower than the [plaintiff’s] partial payment of 30 May 2017, so that the [defendant] is not entitled to any further payment but in fact owes the [plaintiff] money.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">160. For the reasons already set out above, the calculations provided by the [plaintiff] in the course of this arbitration are too little, too late. The [plaintiff] failed to provide the [defendant] with either information or the opportunity to consult and agree the final prices. In light of the ambiguity of the provision in Point 2 of the Addenda, this was particularly important.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">161. The appropriate calculation of damages, payable to the [defendant] as a result of the [plaintiff’s] breach of the Contracts, of the Addenda, and of its fiduciary duty to the [defendant], is to be calculated on the basis of the prices of the cargoes actually furnished, as of the effective date of the Contracts, that is, 2 February 2021. By reason of its ambiguity, and in light of the [plaintiff’s] breach of the Addenda, the original contractual price, as adjusted for quality in accordance with the Contracts, must be the basis of calculating damages.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">162.

I was not completely persuaded by this submission. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BZW</span>, a breach of the fair hearing rule occurs if the tribunal adopts a chain of reasoning that (a) the parties did not have reasonable notice it would adopt; or (b) does not have sufficient nexus to the parties’ arguments. A party has reasonable notice of a particular chain of reasoning if (a) it arose from the parties’ pleadings; (b) it arose by reasonable implication from their pleadings; (c) it is unpleaded but arose in some other way in the arbitration and was reasonably brought to the party’s actual notice; or (d) it flows reasonably from the arguments actually advanced by either party or is related to those arguments: <span class="font-italic">BZW </span>at [60(b)], citing <span class="font-italic">JVL Agro Industries Ltd v Agritrade International Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 4 SLR 768 (“<span class="font-italic">JVL Agro Industries</span>”) at [150], [152], [154] and [156].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In addition, in order for there to be grounds for setting aside an arbitral award under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA, the applicant must establish that the breach of the fair hearing rule was connected to the making of the award, and that the breach caused it prejudice.

In any event, the appropriate final price of the Iron Ore Fines had also been expressly listed in the parties’ Agreed List of Issues, which was submitted to the Arbitrator prior to the hearing. Specifically, the Agreed List of Issues stated as follows:

In particular, whether the [defendant] is entitled to payment from the [plaintiff] of the balance, final price of the cargoes and if so, in what amount?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The parties were also clearly aware that English law and the SOGA were the applicable laws in the Arbitration, the parties themselves having referred to provisions within the SOGA in their submissions in the Arbitration (albeit to provisions other than s 8; see [25] above). Moreover, I agreed with the defendant’s submission that the parties’ pleaded cases had effectively corresponded with the first two limbs of s 8(1) of the SOGA – the defendant had taken the position that the price of the Iron Ore Fines had been “fixed by the [Contracts]”, whereas the plaintiff’s case was that the final price had been “left to be fixed in a manner agreed by the [Contracts, as amended by the Addenda]” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the Price Adjustment Mechanism). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Accordingly, I found that by simply making reference to the first two limbs of s 8(1) of the SOGA, the Arbitrator could not be said to have adopted a chain of reasoning that the parties did not have reasonable notice of, or which had an insufficient nexus to the parties’ arguments. Given that the parties’ cases had corresponded to the first two limbs of s 8(1) of the SOGA, the Arbitrator’s reference to these provisions could be said to arise directly out of the parties’ pleadings, or at the very least, by reasonable implication from their pleadings. There was therefore no breach of the rules of natural justice in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Alternatively, even if the parties did not have reasonable notice of the Arbitrator’s reliance on the first two limbs of s 8(1) of the SOGA, no prejudice had been occasioned to the parties for similar reasons. The parties had, in substance, presented their cases on the first two limbs of s 8(1) of the SOGA, even if they may not have expressly<span class="font-italic"> </span>referred to the provision. It therefore could not be said that the Arbitrator had been denied the benefit of arguments or evidence that had a real chance of making a difference to her deliberations. Accordingly, I found that the Arbitrator’s reference to the first two limbs of s 8(1) of the SOGA did not warrant setting aside the Award under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Similarly, in my view, the fact that the Arbitrator rejected both parties’ cases under s 8(1) of the SOGA did not in itself present a ground for setting aside the Award under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA. In this regard, I disagreed with the plaintiff’s argument that the parties had been deprived of a reasonable opportunity to be heard, solely because the Arbitrator had concluded that the Price Adjustment Mechanism set out in the Addenda was “vague and ambiguous”. To begin with, it might be argued that it was at least implicit in the defendant’s pleaded position that the Price Adjustment Mechanism had become unworkable by the time of the Arbitration, such that it could not be relied upon to calculate the final price of the Iron Ore Fines. As noted above at [17], the defendant pleaded in its Statement of Claim that as the plaintiff had failed to intimate it of the prices at which the Iron Ore Fines were actually sold, the plaintiff should be “presumed” to have utilised the Iron Ore Fines for its own gains, such that the defendant was entitled to the original price under the Contracts. Similarly, the defendant contended as follows in its written opening submissions in the Arbitration:

Indeed, during oral closing submissions at the hearing of the Arbitration, it was argued by the defendant that the Addenda had “almost become impossible to understand” for this very reason:

In so far as the nub of the plaintiff’s complaint pertained to the Arbitrator’s departure<span class="font-italic"> </span>from the methods proposed by the parties for determining the final price of the Iron Ore Fines, I disagreed that the Arbitrator was obliged to choose <span class="font-italic">either </span>the plaintiff’s calculations, <span class="font-italic">or </span>the method proposed by the defendant, and nothing else. As observed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Soh Beng Tee &amp; Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 at [65(e)], an arbitrator is “perfectly entitled to embrace a middle path (even without apprising the parties of his provisional thinking or analysis) so long as it is based on evidence that is before him”. This principle is illustrated by the decision in <span class="font-italic">TMM Division Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 4 SLR 972 (“<span class="font-italic">TMM Division</span>”). In that case, one of the issues before the arbitrator was whether a particular contractual clause was a condition precedent or an innominate term. The arbitrator found that the contractual clause was neither a condition precedent nor an innominate term, but instead a collateral warranty. Chan Seng Onn J (as he then was) found that this did not breach the fair hearing rule. This was because the arbitrator’s conclusion was a “reasonable follow-through” from his finding that the clause was not a condition (at [70]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In the present case, the Arbitrator was thus not limited to the binary positions taken by the parties. In my view, she was entitled to reject both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s calculations. It was also open to her to conclude, on the evidence before her, that the Addenda was ultimately ambiguous even if neither party had made this specific argument. In my judgment, to hold otherwise would be to unduly straitjacket the latitude given to the Arbitrator.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Having rejected both parties’ cases under the first two limbs of s 8(1) of the SOGA, and having found that the Price Adjustment Mechanism was in fact “vague and ambiguous”, the next step in the Arbitrator’s reasoning was to consider the <span class="font-italic">third</span> limb of s 8(1) of the SOGA (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the price in a contract of sale may also be “determined by the course of dealing between the parties”). It appears that the Arbitrator concluded that this limb of s 8(1) of the SOGA was also inapplicable to the present case, given her observation that “[t]his was the first time the [p]arties had done business together”.

</div> While the plaintiff did not specifically take issue with this aspect of the Arbitrator’s reasoning in its submissions before me, I found for completeness that the Arbitrator’s reliance on this limb of s 8(1) of the SOGA did not cause any relevant prejudice to the parties that would warrant a setting aside of the Award. During the hearing of the Arbitration, both parties expressly took the position that the Contracts had been the <span class="font-italic">first</span> time that the parties had done business with each other; in other words, there had been no prior dealings between the parties.

In any event, as I have noted above, no submission was made to the contrary by either party before me.

</div> While the Arbitrator’s reliance on s 8(1) of the SOGA could nonetheless be said to align with and arise out of the parties’ pleadings, or at least to have caused no relevant prejudice to the parties (as I have explained above at [43]–[54]), the concept of a “reasonable price” under s 8(2) of the SOGA was neither raised nor submitted on by the parties. Although both parties had proposed various alternative methods for calculating the final price of the Iron Ore Fines during the Arbitration, there was no evidence that the parties had contended that these calculations were “reasonable” prices for the Iron Ore Fines, <span class="font-italic">independent </span>of what the parties had agreed to under the Contracts and/or the Addenda. On the contrary, the parties’ positions throughout the Arbitration were that the final price of the Iron Ore Fines had been <span class="font-italic">fixed</span> in some way by the Contracts and/or the Addenda. I elaborate further below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I begin with the defendant’s case. As is clear from the summary at [47]–[48] above, the defendant’s pleaded case in the Arbitration was that the parties should “revert” to the original price for the Iron Ore Fines <span class="font-italic">agreed upon by the parties</span> under the Contracts. For completeness, I noted that notwithstanding the defendant’s pleaded position, the defendant’s counsel in the Arbitration put forth a set of alternative calculations during his opening address, which was based on the prevailing price of iron ore fines on 2 February 2017 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the date of the Contracts) according to the Mysteel price index.

Crucially for present purposes, there was no submission by the defendant that either of those sums should be awarded because they would constitute a <span class="font-italic">reasonable </span>price for the Iron Ore Fines, in the absence of any price being fixed for the Iron Ore Fines under the Contracts. I therefore found that it could not be said that the concept of a “reasonable price” formed part of the defendant’s case or flowed from any arguments actually advanced by it. In any event, as I have noted at [28] above, it was the defendant’s submission before me that its case in the Arbitration had corresponded to s 8(1) of the SOGA; there was no suggestion by the defendant that its case in the Arbitration had in fact corresponded to both s 8(1) <span class="font-italic">and </span>8(2) of the SOGA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Turning to the case advanced by the plaintiff in the Arbitration, the plaintiff’s position was that the final price of the Iron Ore Fines should be calculated based on the Price Adjustment Mechanism, because that had been what the parties had agreed to under the Addenda. In my judgment, this was clear from the plaintiff’s pleadings and submissions in the Arbitration. For instance, in its Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, the plaintiff alleged that based on the “specific contractual agreements among the parties”, the plaintiff had in fact overpaid the defendant for the Iron Ore Fines and was therefore entitled to make a counterclaim for the overpayment.

</div>), I did not read this to mean that the plaintiff was proposing a “reasonable price” within the meaning of s 8(2) of the SOGA. As I have explained above, it was clear from the plaintiff’s pleadings and submissions that the crux of its case was that the final price of the Iron Ore Fines should be determined by the parties’ <span class="font-italic">agreement</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Price Adjustment Mechanism set out in the Addenda.

This, however, was not done. As noted at [21(g)] above, the Arbitrator concluded in the Award that a “reasonable price” would be the original price of the Iron Ore Fines, with downward revisions pursuant to the Adjustment Clause to take into account the cargo defects. It appears that the basis for her conclusion may have been limited to the following exchange with the plaintiff’s counsel during oral closing submissions:

While the defendant had referred the Arbitrator to the Adjustment Clause in the Contracts, this was entirely consistent with its pleaded position that the final price of the Iron Ore Fines should be determined by the price agreed upon by the parties under the Contracts (albeit with the added caveat that the price should be revised to take into account the cargo defects). At the risk of repetition, there was nothing in the defendant’s submissions or the Arbitrator’s responses to indicate that the Arbitrator would ultimately decide the case based on what constituted a “reasonable price” for the Iron Ore Fines. It was also plain from the transcript of the hearing of the Arbitration that the Arbitrator did not invite the parties to address her on what would constitute a “reasonable price” for the Iron Ore Fines. I therefore found that the Arbitrator did not give notice to the parties that she would rely on a chain of reasoning based on s 8(2) of the SOGA in the Award. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The defendant contended in its further submissions that there was no breach of the rules of natural justice, as the Arbitrator’s reference to s 8(2) of the SOGA arose naturally out of her conclusion that the price of the Iron Ore Fines had not been fixed within the meaning of s 8(1) of the SOGA (see [28] above). The defendant argued that the Arbitrator’s reliance on s 8(2) of the SOGA could be characterised as a “reasonable follow-through” from the issue before her (applying <span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span>at [70]).

</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, the defendant might well have been correct to observe that the Arbitrator’s recourse to s 8(2) of the SOGA was <span class="font-italic">premised</span> on her conclusion that s 8(1) did not apply to the present facts, given that s 8(2) of the SOGA expressly states that “[w]here the price is not determined <span class="font-italic">as mentioned in sub-section (1) above</span> the buyer must pay a reasonable price” [emphasis added]. Yet, in my judgment, the fact that there was a logical link between the Arbitrator’s reliance on s 8(2) of the SOGA, and her rejection of the parties’ cases under s 8(1) of the SOGA, did not necessarily mean that the parties had <span class="font-italic">reasonable notice </span>that the Arbitrator would adopt a chain of reasoning based on s 8(2) of the SOGA. As I have explained above, the fact remained that the concept of a “reasonable price” was not part of either party’s case, and the Arbitrator did not provide any intimation that she would be relying on the same in the event she was not persuaded that s 8(1) of the SOGA did apply. It therefore could not be said that the parties had reasonable notice that the Arbitrator would ultimately adopt a chain of reasoning based on s 8(2) of the SOGA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Moreover, while the decision in <span class="font-italic">TMM Division</span> may have provided some assistance to the defendant in relation to the Ambiguity Issue (see [50] above), I found that it could be distinguished from the present case in so far as the Arbitrator’s reasoning in relation to s 8(2) of the SOGA was concerned. In this regard, I was cognizant that the extent to which a tribunal must afford a party an opportunity to be heard depends on the nature of the issue involved: <span class="font-italic">Phoenixfin Pte Ltd and others v Convexity Ltd</span> [2022] 2 SLR 23 (“<span class="font-italic">Phoenixfin</span>”) at [52]. In <span class="font-italic">TMM </span><span class="font-italic">Division</span>, the issue before the tribunal was essentially one of contractual interpretation – as noted at [50] above, the parties had taken the position that the clause in question was either a condition or an innominate term. Accordingly, it was open to the tribunal, on the evidence before it, to take the middle path of concluding that the clause was <span class="font-italic">neither </span>a condition nor an innominate term, but instead a collateral warranty. A similar case in this regard is <span class="font-italic">CJA v CIZ</span> [2022] SGCA 41 (“<span class="font-italic">CJA</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">CJA</span>, the Court of Appeal observed that the issue before the tribunal had been a legal question of contractual interpretation. The parties had submitted on this issue before the tribunal and had sufficient opportunity to canvass evidence on, amongst other things, the contextual dimension and commercial purpose of the contract. Accordingly, even though the tribunal ultimately adopted an interpretation of the contract that neither party had expressly pleaded, there was no breach of the fair hearing rule (at [77]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 By contrast, the issue of what constitutes a “reasonable price” is not a purely legal question, but instead “a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case”, <span class="font-italic">per </span>s 8(3) of the SOGA. As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">Phoenixfin </span>at [52], where the issue before the tribunal is a factual one or a mixed fact and law question, then “apart from submitting on the law, a party needs to be able to question the evidence produced in support of the issue as well as have the chance to itself introduce relevant rebuttal evidence”. Moreover, the cases of <span class="font-italic">TMM Division </span>and <span class="font-italic">CJA </span>concerned instances where the arbitral tribunal had arrived at a different conclusion from the parties, based on the evidence that was <span class="font-italic">already</span> before it. On the contrary, it was reasonable in the present case that the parties would have sought to adduce evidence that <span class="font-italic">differed </span>from the evidence already before the Arbitrator, had they been asked to present their cases on s 8(2) of the SOGA. As is clear from the wording of the provisions, the inquiries under ss 8(1) and 8(2) of the SOGA are conceptually distinct – s 8(1) focuses on whether any price has been fixed by the contract of sale or a course of dealing between the parties, whereas s 8(2) focuses on what a “reasonable price” for the goods would be, in the <span class="font-italic">absence </span>of any price being fixed as such. Given that the parties had advanced cases in the Arbitration that corresponded only with s 8(1) of the SOGA, they may well have desired to introduce new evidence or submissions on the question of what would constitute a “reasonable price” for the Iron Ore Fines under s 8(2) of the SOGA. For the reasons I have detailed above, it was evident that the parties had not been given an opportunity to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I therefore disagreed with the defendant that the Arbitrator’s reliance on s 8(2) of the SOGA could be characterised as a “reasonable follow-through” from the arguments advanced by the parties, such that it was open to her to adopt such a chain of reasoning without apprising the parties of her intention to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In the circumstances, I was persuaded that the fair hearing rule was breached in this instance when the Arbitrator adopted a chain of reasoning in relation to s 8(2) of the SOGA, without inviting further evidence and/or submissions on the same. This was, in my judgment, a breach of the rules of natural justice that was causally connected to the making of the Award, since the Arbitrator’s reliance on s 8(2) of the SOGA determined the final price of the Iron Ore Fines payable by the plaintiff. Moreover, it was plain to me that the Arbitrator’s failure to afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to be heard denied her the benefit of arguments or <span class="font-italic">evidence</span> that could reasonably have made a difference to her decision (<span class="font-italic">JVL Agro Industries </span>at [194]). There was therefore prejudice ensuing from this failure of process. As I have stated above, it was not inconceivable that had the parties been made aware that the Arbitrator was considering the application of s 8(2) of the SOGA and a chain of reasoning based on that provision, the parties would have sought to present their respective cases on this question of fact, whether in terms of evidence, submissions, or both. Indeed, the plaintiff complains in its further submissions that the parties were not able to “tender any factual evidence or submissions on fact or law” as a result of the Arbitrator’s failure to afford the parties an opportunity to be heard.

</div> In my view, such further evidence and/or submissions could have reasonably made a difference to the Arbitrator’s decision on the final price of the Iron Ore Fines. At the very least, no reason was suggested to me as to why this would not be the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In these circumstances, I was satisfied that there existed grounds for setting aside the Award under s 24(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the IAA. However, rather than setting aside the entire Award, and given the defendant’s alternative position raised in its further submissions requesting the court to remit the Award to the Tribunal if appropriate to do so, I turned to consider whether remission would be appropriate in this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 3: Was it appropriate to remit the Award to the Tribunal?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The court’s power to remit an arbitral award to the tribunal is found in Art 34(4) of the Model Law, which provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(4) The court, when asked to set aside an award, may, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">where appropriate and so requested by a party</span>, suspend the setting aside proceedings for a period of time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the arbitral tribunal’s opinion will eliminate the grounds for setting aside.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I found that it was appropriate in the present case to remit the Award for the Arbitrator to consider whether to receive further evidence and/or submissions (as the Arbitrator deems appropriate) on the issue of what would constitute a “reasonable price” for the Iron Ore Fines under s 8(2) read with s 8(3) of the SOGA. I detail my reasons below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 First, I disagreed with the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant’s failure to request for remission of the Award at the time of the hearing before me on 4 February 2022 necessarily meant that it was not possible or appropriate to remit the Award (see [26] above). To begin with, Art 34(4) of the Model Law imposes no such time limit on when a request for remission must be made. On a plain reading of the provision, Art 34(4) provides that a court, when asked to set aside an award, may remit the award to the tribunal “where appropriate and so requested by a party”. Given that the defendant had made a request in its further submissions for the court to consider remitting the Award, I did not see why the power under Art 34(4) of the Model Law should be unavailable in the present case. To construe Art 34(4) as requiring any request for remission to be raised by a certain point in the setting aside proceedings would, in my view, place a strain on the plain meaning of the provision, and I rejected such an interpretation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In any case, it was clear to me that at the hearing on 4 February 2022, the focus of the parties’ submissions had not been on the issue of remission, or s 8 of the SOGA. As I have noted at [23] above, the SOGA Issue was raised, literally in one sentence, by Mr Kek in his oral submissions in reply at the end of that hearing. Moreover, it was only in the parties’ further submissions, which had been occasioned by Mr Kek’s fleeting remark, that the question of remission came to the fore. In the circumstances, I found there to be no merit to the argument that remission of the Award should be refused simply because the defendant had not requested for it earlier.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Next, I disagreed with the plaintiff’s contention that the Arbitrator’s breaches of natural justice were inextricably intertwined with the Award, or that the Arbitrator would not be able to approach the remitted issues in a balanced and open-minded manner, such that remission of the Award would be inappropriate. In this regard, both parties referred me to the case of <span class="font-italic">BZW </span>in their further submissions. <span class="font-italic">BZW</span> concerned an appeal against the decision of Vinodh Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">BZV v BZW and another</span> [2022] 3 SLR 447 (“<span class="font-italic">BZW (HC)</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">BZW (HC)</span>, Coomaraswamy J found that the arbitral tribunal had acted in breach of the rules of natural justice, but declined to remit the award for two reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the tribunal’s breaches of natural justice were “fundamental and woven deeply into the analytical exercise” that the tribunal had undertaken. The tribunal had fundamentally misapprehended the parties’ arguments. Eliminating any grounds for setting aside would require the tribunal to undertake its entire analytical task <span class="font-italic">de novo</span>, which would go beyond the purpose of remission (at [222]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The tribunal had acknowledged in the addendum to the award that it had committed a manifest factual error but sought to deny the effect of the error on its reasoning. This did not inspire confidence that remission would afford the applicant a genuine opportunity to persuade the tribunal to arrive at a different result (at [224]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The decision of Coomaraswamy J was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BZW</span>. In doing so, the Court of Appeal made the following observations regarding Art 34(4) of the Model Law:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The drafters of Art 34(4) intended that in determining whether to remit an award, the court should consider whether (i) the tribunal’s error is remediable; and (ii) whether, by its error, the tribunal’s mandate no longer continues (at [65]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The principle of limited curial intervention militates against the exercise of the Art 34(4) power rather than in favour of it (at [66(b)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In deciding whether to remit an award, the court should consider whether the breach is in respect of a single isolated or standalone point (at [66(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The court should also take into account whether the arbitrators are unfit to continue the hearing. If the court is of such a view, the correct approach is the setting aside of the award and the appointment of a fresh tribunal (at [66(d)]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Finally, it has been observed in the UK that the court should consider whether (i) there is a real risk, judged objectively, that even a competent and respectable arbitral tribunal may sub‑consciously be tempted to achieve the same result as before; and (ii) that a reasonable person would no longer have confidence in the tribunal’s ability to come to a fair and balanced conclusion on the issues remitted (at [67]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 On the facts of <span class="font-italic">BZW</span>, the Court of Appeal observed that the breach of natural justice did not involve a standalone issue, but instead concerned the tribunal’s complete failure to appreciate the correct questions it had to pose to itself (at [68]). A reasonable person would no longer have confidence in the tribunal’s ability to come to a fair and balanced conclusion on the issues remitted, given the tribunal’s denial of the effect of its factual error (see [71(b)] above) (at [69]). There were also no time and cost savings that would arise from remitting the award, given that a substantial amount of time had elapsed since the hearing of the evidence and submissions (at [70]). Remission was therefore inappropriate in that case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 I agreed with the defendant that the present case could be distinguished from <span class="font-italic">BZW</span> on several counts<span class="font-italic">.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 First, I considered that the Arbitrator’s breach of natural justice involved a sufficiently discrete and standalone factual issue – namely, what would constitute a “reasonable price” within the meaning of s 8(2) of the SOGA. The plaintiff claimed that the Arbitrator’s reliance on s 8(2) of the SOGA was not an isolated issue, as it was tied to her findings on the Glencore Issue and the Ambiguity Issue.

</div>
</div> In my view, this was incorrect. In the Award, the Arbitrator made clear that she ultimately regarded the precise role of Glencore to be <span class="font-italic">irrelevant</span>, given her finding that the plaintiff had breached its fiduciary duties to the defendant (see [21(h)] above).

</div> The Arbitrator’s findings on the Glencore Issue therefore cannot be said to have had any material bearing on her consideration of s 8(2) of the SOGA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In so far as the Arbitrator’s reference to s 8(2) of the SOGA arose out of her conclusion that the Price Adjustment Mechanism was ambiguous (and that no price had been fixed under s 8(1) of the SOGA), I have explained above that I did not find that the Arbitrator acted in breach of natural justice when she reached her conclusion on the Ambiguity Issue or made reference to s 8(1) of the SOGA. I therefore did not see a need for the Arbitrator to re-open her findings of fact in relation to those issues, for the purposes of considering what would be a “reasonable price” under s 8(2) of the SOGA. In my judgment and as I have explained at [64] above, it was also clear from the wording of s 8 of the SOGA that the inquiries under ss 8(1) and 8(2) are entirely separate exercises. Accordingly, this was not a case where, to quote <span class="font-italic">BZW (HC)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [222], the Arbitrator’s breaches were “fundamental and woven deeply into the analytical exercise” that she undertook.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Neither did I agree with the plaintiff that the available evidence demonstrated that the Arbitrator had entirely failed to apply her mind to the issues before her, or that in a similar vein, a reasonable person would no longer have confidence in her ability to come to a fair and balanced conclusion on the remitted issues.

</div> In my view, the Arbitrator’s failure to afford the parties an opportunity to present their cases on s 8(2) of the SOGA was essentially a procedural misstep which occasioned a process failure. This was unlike <span class="font-italic">BZW</span>, where the tribunal had failed entirely to appreciate the correct questions it had to pose to itself – <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, it had completely misunderstood what the case and the issues were about. Unlike <span class="font-italic">Sai Wan Shipping Ltd v Landmark Line Co, Ltd</span> [2022] SGHC 8 (“<span class="font-italic">Sai Wan Shipping</span>”), this was also not a case where the failure to accord one side a reasonable opportunity to be heard was “the product of a haste quite out of keeping with the time accorded to the [other party] for its submissions”, such that a “lack of confidence in the arbitrator to decide the matter fairly if remitted [was] not without reasonable basis” (<span class="font-italic">Sai Wan Shipping </span>at [78]). In the present case, there was no suggestion that the Arbitrator had failed to accord the parties an opportunity to be heard on s 8(2) of the SOGA out of a desire for haste, or that the Arbitrator had acted partially by only affording one side such an opportunity. In the circumstances, the <span class="font-italic">totality</span> of the Arbitrator’s conduct did not, in my mind, raise questions as to her ability to decide any remitted issues fairly, objectively and even-handedly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I was also unpersuaded by the plaintiff’s attempts to distinguish the present case from <span class="font-italic">CKG v CKH</span> [2021] 5 SLR 84 (“<span class="font-italic">CKG</span>”) on the basis that the arbitral tribunal in <span class="font-italic">CKG </span>consisted of three “distinguished members”, whereas the Tribunal in the present case consisted of a sole arbitrator.

</div>
</div> While the learned Judge in <span class="font-italic">CKG </span>may have remarked that the “distinction of the Tribunal” formed part of the reason for his decision to remit the arbitral award (at [70]), I did not read the learned Judge’s comments to mean that the qualifications or eminence of the tribunal members should be an important or the determinative factor in deciding whether to remit an award back to the tribunal. In my view, the distinction of a tribunal is, at best, <span class="font-italic">a </span>consideration in determining whether to remit an award. Be that as it may, I was not given any reason to doubt the Arbitrator’s qualifications in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Finally, I disagreed with the plaintiff that there would be no time and cost savings from the remission of the Award. The Award was dated 5 August 2021, and I made the order to remit the Award on 27 May 2022. By way of comparison, the final award in <span class="font-italic">BZW </span>was dated 25 October 2018, and the decision of the Court of Appeal was issued on 12 January 2022. On the present facts, it could not be said that a substantial amount of time had passed since the making of the Award, such that the Arbitrator would necessarily have to spend considerable time, effort and costs reviewing the evidence afresh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 For completeness, there was no allegation that the Arbitrator had acted in excess of her jurisdiction in considering a chain of reasoning based on s 8(2) of the SOGA. In any event, it was plain that s 8 of the SOGA was generally within the scope of the disputes referred to the Arbitrator, given that the final price of the Iron Ore Fines was indubitably an issue in dispute (see [43] above). Accordingly, while it has been observed by the Court of Appeal that remission would be inappropriate if, in doing so, the tribunal would be asked to deal with an issue outside the scope of its jurisdiction (see <span class="font-italic">CAJ and another v CAI and another appeal </span>[2022] 1 SLR 505 at [70]), that concern did not, in my view, arise in the present case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For the reasons set out above, I exercised my power under Art 34(4) of the Model Law, at the defendant’s request, to suspend the setting aside proceedings and remit the Award to the Arbitrator, for the Arbitrator to consider whether to receive further evidence and/or submissions (as the Arbitrator deems appropriate) on the issue of what would constitute a “reasonable price” for the Iron Ore Fines within the meaning of s 8(2) read with s 8(3) of the SOGA. I further ordered that the defendant’s solicitors were to (a) notify the Tribunal of my orders within seven days of the date of my orders; and (b) furnish the Tribunal with a certified copy of the Notes of Arguments containing my oral grounds of decision and the orders made therein, within ten days of the date of my orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Following from my decision to remit the Award, it was not necessary or appropriate for me to address or reach any decision on the rest of the plaintiff’s arguments for why the Award should be set aside (see [22] above), at least not at this juncture of the matter. I thus reserved my decision on the other grounds raised, pending the Arbitrator’s decision in relation to my remission order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The costs of the application thus far were reserved and are to be dealt with when the matter comes back before me.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">S Mohan<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kek Meng Soon Kelvin and Gan Yun Han Rebecca (Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Mohammad Haireez Bin Mohameed Jufferie, Ow Jiang Meng Benjamin and C Sivah (Incisive Law LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
