<strong>JUDGMENT:</strong>
</font>

<p xmlns=""><font color="#804040" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>Oral Judgment</strong></font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><i><u><b>Charge</b></u></i></p>
<p align="justify">1. The Accused was charged and tried on the following amended charge:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">You, LEE WEE CHENG</p>
<p align="justify">are charged that you on the 7<sup>th</sup> day of June 2000, between 12

  a.m. and 4.55 a.m. at Blk 668-C, Jurong West ST 64 #15-144, Singapore, did commit culpable

  homicide not amounting to murder, by causing the death of one Lee Luan Ku (male/68 years),

  to wit, by punching his head and kicking his body, which act was done with the intention

  of causing such bodily injury as was likely to cause death and you have thereby committed

  an offence punishable under section 304(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">1. The Accused killed his own father by kicking and punching him

violently for reprimanding him for sniffing glue in the toilet of his house. The Accused

had earlier consumed a fair amount of alcohol. The prosecution in its facts conceded that

there was some evidence that the Accused was to some extent intoxicated with alcohol and

as a result of glue sniffing.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The Deceased’s death resulted from bleeding internally due to

multiple chest and abdominal injuries as certified by the Pathologist.</p>
<p align="justify">3. It has been drawn to my attention that the Accused has a previous

conviction for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon in 1981 for which

he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. Although the offence took place long ago it

does appear that the Accused continues to have a residual propensity for violence.</p>
<p align="justify">4. The fact that the Accused was to some extent intoxicated by alcohol

and as a result of glue sniffing in committing the offence has already been taken into

consideration by the prosecution in reducing the charge from murder to culpable homicide

not amounting to murder.</p>
<p align="justify">5. However in relation to sentencing the Accused on the charge I am of

the opinion that drink constitutes an aggravation, as an assault by an aggressor under

such influence tends to frighten an average person much more.</p>
<p align="justify">6. I accept that the case has some mitigational aspects such as the

Accused having called the police some hours later when he saw his father lying unconscious

on the floor as well as the remorse he has expressed.</p>
<p align="justify">7. Although the Accused will no doubt live in shame and sorrow for the

rest of his life for this patricide I have to view both the circumstances of the offence

and the relationship of the Accused as a son to the Deceased - and at that an adult -

seriously.</p>
<p align="justify">8. In the circumstances I sentence the Accused to 9 years imprisonment.

The sentence is backdated to 7<sup>th</sup> June 2000.</p>
