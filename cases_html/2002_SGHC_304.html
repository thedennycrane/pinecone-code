        The plaintiffs, Bakery Mart Pte Ltd

("BM"), were bread, cake and confectionery manufacturers. BM’s managing

director was Ng Yew Hong ("Ng"). Ng owned and managed BM with his sister

Ng Sock Cheng ("Cheng"). The 1<sup>st</sup> defendants, Avante Investment

Pte Ltd ("Avante"), were a subsidiary of Sincere Watch Ltd, a public-listed

company. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants, Culina Pte Ltd ("Culina"), were

(previously) a subsidiary of Hai Sun Hup, another public-listed company. Culina were in

the business of importing and distributing fine foods, wines and bakery products.</font>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2.        In

July 1999, Ng, on behalf of himself and Sincere Watch Ltd, successfully negotiated the

purchase the entire share capital of Culina. As a result of that purchase BM and Avante

each became 50% shareholder of Culina. At the time of the takeover of Culina, it was,

according to Ng, agreed that BM and Avante each would nominate two persons to represent

their respective interests on the Board of Culina. It was also agreed that Ng, who

had hands-on experience in the food and bakery business, would be managing director of

Culina and take charge of its operations. Accordingly, when the sale and purchase was

completed Avante nominated Tay Liam Wee ("Tay") and Soh Gim Teik

("SGT") and BM nominated Ng and Cheng to the Board of Culina. Ng was

appointed managing director. Some time later BM replaced Cheng with Soh Yeow Hwa

("Soh") on the Board of Culina.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.        

Towards the end of 2001, one Ng Wei Min ("NWM") was appointed as business

adviser to Culina at the request of Avante. Ng and NWM could not get along and

misunderstandings began to surface between the parties. On 17 July 2002, Ng received from

the company secretary of Culina a Notice of Directors’ Meeting to be held on 19 July

2002. There were only two items on the Agenda:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) To discuss on the Writ of

    Summons issued by Francois Gigandet ("Gigandet"); and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) Any other business.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Gigandet had been the managing

director of Culina when Hai Sun Hup controlled Culina and had remained with Culina as

executive director after the takeover of Culina. According to Ng, Gigandet was very

familiar with all aspects of the business of Culina and represented a substantial part of

its goodwill at the time of the takeover. Before dealing with the events that took place

at the meeting scheduled for 19 July 2002, some background on Gigandet would be

relevant.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.        Ng,

at the time he negotiated the purchase of Culina, realised that Gigandet may not remain

long with Culina after the takeover. To induce Gigandet to stay, Ng gave his personal

guarantee that in the event Gigandet’s services were terminated by Culina, Ng would

pay Gigandet an amount equal to 13 months of salary. On the strength of that guarantee,

Gigandet (in September 1999) accepted appointment with Culina for a period of 2 years with

an option to renew for a further 2 years. In September 2001, Gigandet’s appointment

was renewed for 2 years.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.        In

January 2002, the Board of Culina (including Ng) decided that it was no longer in the

interests of Culina to retain Gigandet’s services. His services were, accordingly,

terminated. On 2 March 2002, Gigandet sued Ng under the personal guarantee and on

25 June 2002 Gigandet sued Culina for some alleged error in the profits payable to

him under a profit-sharing scheme.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.        When

Ng attended the Board meeting on 19 July 2002 pursuant to the Notice referred to above, he

was under the impression that the meeting was convened to discuss the suit Gigandet had

instituted against Culina. That was, however, not so. Instead, at the meeting, Ng was

confronted with the accusation that by giving his personal guarantee to Gigandet, he had

put himself in a position of conflict of interest and he was told by SGT that, because of

that conflict, he would be removed as a director of Culina.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.        

Following the meeting NWM announced to the staff of Culina that Ng had been removed as

managing director and that NWM was taking over as Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Suppliers

and customers of Culina were also informed of this change. Ng was told to remove all his

personal effects and vacate his office at Culina by 26 July 2002.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.        On

22 July 2002, M/s Gabriel Peter &amp; Pnrs ("GP&amp;P), acting for BM and Ng, wrote

to Avante, SGT and Tay pointing out that:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) BM and Avante had agreed that

    each would appoint two directors on the Board of Culina and that in the light of that

    agreement Ng, as one of the appointees of BM, could not be removed except by consent of

    BM.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) No notice was given in the

    Agenda that the meeting of the Board of Culina was being convened to remove Ng as a

    director and that the Board did not have the powers to effect such removal.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) The personal guarantee to

    Gigandet had been given by Ng for the benefit of Culina and so the allegation of conflict

    had no basis. In any event, the fact that Ng had supported the move to terminate

    Gigandet’s services showed that he was not acting in his own interest.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">GP&amp;P asked that each of the

addressees confirm in writing that the meeting held on 19 July 2002 was null and void.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.        On

23 July 2002, GP&amp;P again wrote to Avante informing Avante that BM was appointing

Leslie Yong Boon Chuan ("Yong") to be a director of Culina in place of Soh and

asked Avante to arrange for this replacement to take effect immediately.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.        On

25 July 2002, M/s Wong Tan &amp; Molly Lim ("WT&amp;ML") responded on behalf of

Avante, SGT and Tay to the two letters from GP&amp;P. They took the position that the

removal of Ng at the meeting of the Board of Culina held on 19 July 2002 was valid as it

was carried out in accordance with s 82(g) of the Articles of Association of Culina under

which the office of a director becomes vacant if the director was requested, in writing,

by all his co-directors to resign. WT&amp;ML pointed out that all the other directors of

Culina – including Soh whom WT&amp;ML described as "the nominee of BM on the

Board" – had voted for the removal of Ng. WT&amp;ML took the position that the

Notice of Meeting was an adequate notice, that the Board had the powers to remove Ng and

that by giving his personal guarantee to Gigandet, Ng had placed himself in a position

where his duties to Culina as a director was in direct conflict with his personal

obligations under the guarantee.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.        On

GP&amp;P’s letter of 23 July 2002, WT&amp;ML took the position that under the

Articles of Association of Culina, the power to appoint/remove a director was a matter

solely within the province of the Board of Culina and that the directions to replace Soh

with Yong would not be carried out.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.        On

30 July 2002, BM instituted these proceedings against Avante and Culina. Amongst the

reliefs that BM sought was an injunction restraining Avante and Culina from excluding or

attempting to exclude BM from exercising, together with Avante its rights of control and

management over Culina. Simultaneously with the writ, BM took out this Summons-in-Chambers

seeking an interim injunction to that effect.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.        The

application for the interim injunction was heard by me on an inter parte basis. Mr Peter

Gabriel, who appeared for BM, emphasised from the start that what his clients sought was

the maintenance of the status quo pending the final resolution of the dispute between the

parties. BM’s position was that irrespective of what the Articles of Association of

Culina stated, BM and Avante had, at the time they took over Culina, agreed that – to

represent their respective rights – each party would be entitled to appoint two

directors on the Board of Culina. The party making the appointment, Mr Gabriel submitted,

would have the right to remove and replace that appointee and it would be objecting on the

other party to ensure that this right is given effect to.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.        

Avante’s position with regard to this alleged agreement was not very clear. Soh, in

his affidavit, denied the existence of any agreement between the parties at the time of

the takeover other than an agreement that each party would acquire 50% of the issued share

capital of Culina. However, he conceded that it was agreed that Ng was to be fully in

charge of the operations of Culina. And WT&amp;ML, as noted earlier, accepted that Soh was

the nominee of BM on the Board of Culina. Mr Philip Ling, who appeared for Avante and

Culina, accepted, in the course of submissions, that BM can appoint and remove its

representatives on the said Board.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.        I

make the above comments not in the context of determining whether or not such a

shareholders’ agreement between BM and Avante existed – that is a matter to be

determined at trial – but to assess whether or not there were serious issues to be

tried. If there was such an agreement between BM and Avante as shareholders of Culina,

then it could be argued that it was incumbent on each party to exercise its respective

rights under the Articles of Association of Culina in such a way as to give effect to that

agreement (as was done, for instance, when BM replaced Cheng with Soh).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.        I

formed the view that the existence or otherwise of such an agreement was a serious issue

to be tried. There were also other serious issues to be tried, namely: (a) whether Article

82(g) of the Articles of Association of Culina can be said to have been sufficiently

complied with if there was no request, in writing, for the resignation of Ng from all the

co-directors; (b) whether Ng was in a position of conflict of interest warranting his

immediate dismissal; (c) whether adequate notice ought to have been given; and (d) whether

the Board of Culina had the power to remove Ng.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.        BM

was a 50% shareholder of Culina and it was not (seriously) in dispute that BM and Avante

were each entitled to nominate two members on the Board of Culina. With the removal of Ng,

only one of the two persons nominated by BM – namely Soh – remained on the

Board. Mr Ling argued that the continued presence of Soh on the Board of Culina negated

BM’s claim that BM had been excluded from control over Culina. Mr Ling also submitted

that, through Soh, BM continued to have access to the books of Culina and therefore it

could not be said that if the injunction was not granted BM would suffer irreparable loss

not compensatable by damages.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.        I

found Mr Ling’s submission that BM still retained control over Culina through Soh

difficult to accept. The fact was that Soh and BM had fallen out and BM no longer wished

to have Soh representing its interests in Culina. Indeed, BM had sought to have Soh

replaced but Avante and Culina had refused to accommodate that request. The reality of the

situation therefore was that BM, a 50% shareholder of Culina, no longer had any say in the

Board of Culina. This was an untenable position for BM.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.        I

felt that the balance of convenience was clearly on the side of the status quo being

maintained at least to the extent that BM should continue to have two persons representing

BM’s interests on the Board of Culina. Accordingly, I ordered that, until further

order, Avante and Culina by themselves, their directors, officers, servants and/or agents,

be restrained from the following acts or any of them:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) excluding or attempting to

    exclude BM, through its nominees to the Board of Culina, namely, Ng and Yong, from

    carrying out, with Avante’s two nominees to the said Board, the control and

    management of Culina’s business;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) excluding BM or its nominees,

    servants and/or agents from any part of the premises of Culina at 24 Senoko Way,

    Singapore; and</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) excluding BM or its nominees,

    servants and/or agents, from having full access to all the business books of account,

    letters or other documents of Culina.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

of this application be costs in the cause.</font></p>
