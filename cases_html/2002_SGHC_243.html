to Ming Min and Jenny in equal shares. That is how Ming Min and Jenny came to be

shareholders of Hua Ann as well. In addition, Jenny was awarded some shares in Hua Ann by

1948. According to Tong Djoe’s evidence, Mdm Tan was a Singapore citizen before she

married him and after she married him, she became an Indonesian citizen (NE 16, 17). In

1958, Tong Djoe incorporated his first company in Singapore, Chin Yeong Pte Ltd. In 1960,

he set up his flagship Tunas Pte Ltd (‘Tunas’) to act as the sole agent in

Singapore for the Indonesian oil company Pertamina. Tunas was also the chartering agent

for vessels for the operation of Pertamina. In 1970, he commissioned the development of

Tunas Building in Anson, Singapore. The building was completed in 1973 with 31 floors. It

<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26 THIRD AVENUE (‘26

TA’)</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.        

According to Tong Djoe’s AEIC (para 9 and 10), his family together with Mdm

Tan’s mother, Mdm Ang Joo Poh, were living at 26 TA in the 1960s. He had rented it

from one John Sum. In 1964, John Sum, the owner of 26 TA, approached him to purchase 26

TA. Mdm Tan and Tong Djoe liked 26 TA and so Tong Djoe agreed to buy 26 TA for $250,000.

The purchase price was paid in instalments of $10,000 per month. However, he neglected to

get 26 TA transferred until 1976 when it was transferred to Keng Tit. Tong Djoe added that

in 1966, while Mdm Tan took an evening walk around 26 TA, she noticed an empty plot of

land at 18 NC within walking distance of 26 TA. She told him about it and how the view was

spectacular as it was sited on a slope. He then went to see this plot of land with her and

eventually he paid about $14,508 for it. The plot of land was, however, then registered in

Mdm Tan’s name.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.        Keng

Meng’s AEIC (para 24) also asserted that the Tong family had lived in 26 TA since the

early 1960s, first as tenants and subsequently as owners. Keng Meng’s evidence was

that he knew that sometime around 1964, Tong Djoe had agreed to purchase 26 TA ‘from

the then owner John Sum’ and this property was paid for in instalments. When it was

paid up, the property was transferred (presumably by John Sum) to Keng Tit.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.        

However, according to a search (DBD 1023), John Sum was not the owner of 26 TA in the

1960s. At that time, the owner was one Rachel Sum. On 18 November 1971, she conveyed 26 TA

to John Sum. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.        I

also note that during cross-examination, Tong Djoe’s evidence was that he was staying

both at 61 Grange Road and 26 TA between 1968 to 1978, 61 Grange Road having been bought

by Tunas (NE 25 to 27).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.        

During cross-examination of Keng Meng, Keng Meng said that he and his parents were staying

at 19 and 26 Third Avenue between 1964 to 1969 and from 1969 to 1978, they were staying at

61 Grange Road (NE 72 and 73). Keng Meng’s wife Ming Min also said in

cross-examination that when she married Keng Meng in 1973, the Tong family was staying at

61 Grange Road and no where else (NE 132 to 133).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.        

Furthermore, during cross-examination, Tong Djoe said that he had bought 26 TA for $40,000

(NE 28). When it was pointed out to him that para 10 of his own AEIC referred to a

purchase consideration of $250,000, he insisted that 26 TA was bought at $40,000 and he

paid this sum in instalments of $10,000 per month. He said the $250,000 was ‘a

technical point between John Sum and my son’. He then said that his son and Mdm Tan

had attended to the matter. All he knew was he paid $40,000. He did not know the details

(NE 28 and 29).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.        I

am of the view that even if Tong Djoe and the Tong family were residing at 26 TA in the

1960s before moving to 61 Grange Road, this property was not bought from John Sum in 1964

or thereabouts. If the purchase had been in or about 1964, Tong Djoe and Mdm Tan would not

have waited 12 years until 1976 to get the property transferred to Keng Tit’s name. I

am also of the view that the purchase of 26 TA was at the price of $250,000 and not

$40,000 and that the purchase was handled by Mdm Tan. Whether Tong Djoe paid the purchase

price or part of it is another matter.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">PURCHASE OF 18 NC</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.        

Coming back to 18 NC, I accept that it was Mdm Tan who first became interested in it. It

was purchased in 1966/1967 and registered in Mdm Tan’s name. At that time, it was

vacant land.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">16.        As

I have said, Tong Djoe’s position was that he paid the purchase price of about

$14,508. This was disputed by the liquidator because Keng Hiang and Jenny said that Mdm

Tan provided the funds for the purchase. Their position was that Mdm Tan came from a

wealthy family. Furthermore, she was running a tailoring business selling garments to

retail shops. The business was known as Li Ping from which she made profits. From these

profits, she bought 18 NC. Tong Djoe’s witnesses Keng Meng and Kheng Ann did not

accept that Mdm Tan came from a wealthy family. For example, para 10 of Kheng Ann’s

AEIC states that Mdm Tan came from a rather poor family. Her mother, Mdm Ang, used to run

a small provision shop in Singapore and Tong Djoe used to purchase goods from her. That

was how Tong Djoe came to know Mdm Tan. Yet this evidence was contradicted by Tong Djoe

himself. He said that when he got to know Mdm Tan, her mother owned a rubber plantation in

Malaysia and was not running a provision shop (NE 8). As for Li Ping, Tong Djoe’s

position was that Mdm Tan did not make profits from that business.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.        Not

surprisingly, there was no documentary evidence as to who paid the purchase price for 18

NC, given the very long lapse of time. In addition, witnesses like Keng Hiang, Keng Meng

and Kheng Ann were young at the material time and then had left Singapore for studies

overseas. In the case of Jenny, she was not yet married to Keng Hiang. Her evidence was

based on what Mdm Tan allegedly told her. Jenny had asserted that she was Mdm Tan’s

confidante, but, during cross-examination, she had to concede she was nothing of the sort.

It was also not really disputed that Keng Hiang had married Jenny in a hurry and without

Mdm Tan’s approval. Although Jenny sought to portray her relationship with Mdm Tan as

a close one, I am of the view that it was otherwise. I make this finding based on various

oral evidence and on a letter dated 7 March 1983 which she had written to Keng Tit and

Kheng Ann (Exhibit P3). In that letter, she had complained as to how Mdm Tan did not trust

her. To be fair, Mdm Tan was not the trusting sort but the point is that Jenny’s

relationship with Mdm Tan was not close.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.        

Paragraph 31 of Keng Meng’s AEIC stated:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘31. I know that it is not

    possible that my mother came up with her own monies to purchase and develop 18 Namly

    Crescent. First of all, she was a housewife with little means of her own. Secondly, my

    mother was always rather insecure about my father. He was (and still is to this day) a

    very well-known and respected businessman. He was generous with money and many people

    sought his friendship, including many women. My mother was extremely concerned that my

    father would give his fortunes away so much so that she would try to take as much as money

    from him as possible in order to avoid having him give these monies to outsiders.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">While the first two sentences of

his para 31 are disputed, the rest are not.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.        In

addition, it was not disputed that Tong Djoe gave Mdm Tan large sums of cash from time to

time as household expenses whenever she thought fit to ask for money.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.        On

balance, I find that Tong Djoe probably provided all or most of the monies to pay for 18

NC.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION

OF A HOUSE AT 18 NC, THE INCORPORATION OF HUA ANN AND THE TRANSFER OF 18 NC AND 26 TA TO

HUA ANN</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.        In

1973, the development of a house at 18 NC started. For convenience, I will refer to the

house as ‘18 NC’ as well. It was not disputed that Mdm Tan was in charge of this

and she spent much time on its design and supervising its construction in her own way,

including checking on the supply of materials.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.        On

29 September 1973, restriction on the ownership of residential property by non-Singapore

citizens was imposed although the actual legislation was enacted subsequently with

retrospective effect. Although Mdm Tan could still retain ownership of 18 NC, which was

residential property, neither she nor Tong Djoe could acquire any interest in any other

residential property, unless approval was obtained from the relevant authority, because

both were not Singapore citizens at the material time. Hua Ann was incorporated in 1974.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">23.        The

construction works for a house at 18 NC also commenced in 1974, according to Ming Min. On

8 January 1975, the Registrar of Titles gave Hua Ann clearance to acquire residential

property so long as all members and all directors of Hua Ann are Singapore citizens (DBD

1063).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.        On

31 July 1975, 18 NC was conveyed by Mdm Tan to Hua Ann for a consideration of $120,000.

Paragraph 6 of the Amended Statement of Claim states, ‘…It was not a sale. Mdm

Tan did not ask for any payment and there was no consideration for the transfer’.

However, although Mdm Tan did not receive the purchase price, she was recorded as a

creditor of Hua Ann for the sale price. Therefore it is not true to say that there was no

consideration for the transfer.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.        In

that same year, various properties were also acquired by Hua Ann from Mdm Tan:</font>

</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(see Jenny’s AEIC p 148

which exhibits a letter from John Ching &amp; Company, Chartered Secretaries and

Management Consultants, to the Comptroller of Income Tax (‘CIT’) dated 8 October

1978 and see the searches on some of the properties in DBD Vol 9. According to para 15 of

Jenny’s AEIC, Hua Ann also owned other properties). The letter dated 8 October 1978

from John Ching &amp; Company was sent on behalf of Hua Ann and it stated that Mdm Tan was

a creditor in respect of the properties purchased from her. Another letter dated 15

December 1978 from John Ching &amp; Company also to CIT stated in the last para, ‘We

wish to confirm that the Company is dealing in property and houses rental business. And

Mdm Tan Beow Hua is in no way related to the Company’. The last sentence was not

true, although I am not saying that John Ching &amp; Company knew it was untrue.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.        As

I have mentioned, 26 TA was transferred in April 1976 by John Sum to Keng Tit for $250,000

(DBD 1038). In May 1978, Keng Tit transferred 26 TA to Hua Ann for $200,000.00 (DBD 1056).

In the same year i.e 1978, a bank had repossessed 61 Grange Road where the Tong family had

been staying and they moved to 26 TA.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.        The

design and building of the house at 18 NC took about six years from 1973. It was common

ground that Mdm Tan was in charge and she spent much time on it, often changing her mind

as to what she wanted. Tong Djoe said he assigned some employees from Tunas to help Mdm

Tan deal with the architects and contractors. I would add that Ming Min married Keng Meng

in 1973 and Jenny married Keng Hiang in 1975. When Ming Min or Jenny was in Singapore,

each would be asked to assist Mdm Tan. The construction was completed in late 1979 and the

Temporary Occupation Permit or Licence was obtained in 1980.</font></p>

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">28.        As

I have said, it was not disputed that Mdm Tan spent a lot of time in the design and

construction of the house at 18 NC. It was and is a house with three levels each having

its own bedrooms, bathrooms and living and dining area and its own kitchen. It has a

swimming pool. The first and third levels are accessible from the Namly Crescent side

whereas the second level has its own access from Fourth Avenue. There is also an intercom

system which allowed the occupants on the various floors to communicate with each other

and a music system for music to flow throughout the whole house, including the garden (NE

153).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">29.        

Tong Djoe’s position was that these features demonstrated that Mdm Tan intended the

house to be used by the extended Tong family where each family staying there would have

privacy and yet stay together. The liquidator’s position was that the design of the

house enabled it to be rented out to various tenants and the first and second levels were

in fact, for much of the time, rented out to various tenants, whereas the third level was

rented out for two years between 1 August 1992 and 31 July 1994.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.        The

liquidator’s position was also that Hua Ann was a holding company and the use of 18

NC as a family home would be contrary to its memorandum. Furthermore, 18 NC was also

described as an investment property in Hua Ann’s books. Hence, even if Mdm Tan had

entered into an arrangement with Tong Djoe to allow him to live at the third level for the

rest of his life, as claimed by him, this would not have been in the best interest of Hua

Ann and would have infringed, in particular, Article 55 of Hua Ann’s Memorandum of

Association which provides for the doing of all things to enhance the value of any

property of Hua Ann (see para 68 and 69 of liquidator’s closing submission).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31.        To

counter the liquidator’s assertions, Mr Woo, Counsel for Tong Djoe, pointed out that

even when the first floor of 18 NC was being marketed to tenants, Mdm Tan had at one time

required some space on the first floor to be set aside so that one of her sons could stay

there. Indeed, at one time when the first floor was let out , the occupant and his wife

had to sign letters to allow one of Mdm Tan’s sons to use two of the rooms on that

floor. As for Hua Ann being an investment holding company and 18 NC being described as an

investment property, Hua Ann was a family company and there was nothing wrong with a

family company using its properties for the residence of family members. Indeed, the

liquidator accepted that it was not ultra vives the memorandum of Hua Ann for any of its

properties to be used for occupation by the Tong family (NE 181 and 183).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32.        I

am of the view that Mdm Tan had intended 18 NC to be a family home where Tong Djoe and her

could live in, if she so wished. That is why she spent so much time on its design and

construction and why there is an intercom system and a music system connecting the entire

house. However, her design of the house allowed separate levels to be rented out should

she so decide. The mere fact that Hua Ann is an investment holding company and 18 NC is

described as an investment property does not preclude family members from residing in 18

NC. I note also that 26 TA was an investment property of Hua Ann but it was used as a

residence of the Tong family. However, if there is a dispute among shareholders on the use

of properties owned by a company, then that is a different matter. Whether Tong

Djoe’s claim to have a right to live at the third level of 18 NC for the rest of his

life is ultra vives the Memorandum of Association of Hua Ann is another matter. For

reasons which are elaborated in my judgment, I need not decide on this point. However, I

would add that it is not sufficient for Tong Djoe to establish that 18 NC was originally

meant to be a family home and/or a retirement villa.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">WHO PAID FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND

RELATED COSTS AND RENOVATION COSTS OF THE HOUSE AT 18 NC?</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.        

Tong Djoe claims that he provided the money for the construction and related costs, such

as architects’ fees, and renovation costs of the house at 18 NC. For convenience, I

will refer to all such costs as ‘the construction costs’. However, the documents

he relied on did not establish that he had made direct payment for such costs. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.        In

so far as Tong Djoe had exhibited receipts and cheques (see, for example, his AEIC p 63,

67, 85), these documents illustrated that Hua Ann made the payments. As for some payments

made by Mdm Tan, they were credited in Journal Slips to her account meaning that she was

treated, probably by Hua Ann, as a creditor for these payments (see, for example, his AEIC

p 77 to 79). In so far as Tong Djoe relied on a list of names and amounts dated 30 April

1981 (see his AEIC p 95), he was not able to establish that he had made direct payment of

the amounts in the list.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35.        As

for payment vouchers of Tunas, there were two categories of such vouchers. The first

category demonstrated that Tunas had made various payments to the Comptroller of Property

Tax in respect of 18 NC. However, these were not gifts by Tunas to Hua Ann. These were

payments made on Hua Ann’s account and, in the absence of any contrary evidence, I

have to assume that they were debited against Hua Ann’s account with Tunas.

Accordingly, these payments by Tunas could not be gifts by Tong Djoe to Hua Ann.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36.        The

second category of Tunas’ payment vouchers demonstrated that there were various cash

payments made by Tunas mainly to Mdm Tan and some of which were made to her mother Mdm

Ang. Such cash payments were made on Tong Djoe’s account. Again, in the absence of

any contrary evidence, I have to assume that these payments were debited against Tong

Djoe’s account with Tunas. It was not in dispute that from time to time, Mdm Tan

would ask Tong Djoe for money as home expenses. Also, in cross-examination, Tong Djoe said

that the monies he provided for the construction costs were through Mdm Tan (NE 61).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">37.        

Furthermore, Jenny produced cheque butts of a bank account of Hua Ann for various payments

towards the construction costs. In addition, the liquidator’s Supplemental Report

also exhibited documentary evidence showing payments made by Hua Ann or charged to Hua

Ann’s account for the construction costs (see, for example, para 9.1, 9.16 to 9.19,

9.23 to 9.29 of his Supplemental Report).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38.        The

next question then is the identity of the source of Hua Ann’s money. As I have

mentioned, Jenny and Keng Hiang gave evidence that Mdm Tan had been running a profitable

tailoring business known as Li Ping. However, the liquidator’s closing submission did

not assert that the money for the construction costs came from the alleged profits. During

the trial, it was also suggested that rent from various properties were used to pay the

construction costs of 18 NC but again the liquidator’s closing submission did not

rely on this as being the source of the payments for the construction costs. The

liquidator relied only on financing from Bank of East Asia as being the source of the

payments (para 76 of liquidator’s closing submission). However, the documents relied

on by the liquidator, at most, demonstrated that Hua Ann’s account with Bank of East

Asia was being used to make the payments. They did not establish where the funds in that

account came from. Besides, there was no evidence that a $120,000 facility from The Bank

of East Asia Limited in April 1975 was ever drawn down or, if drawn down, was used to pay

the construction costs. Furthermore, the construction costs amounted to more than

$600,000. Another facility from this bank in 1984 for $1.5 million (Jenny’s AEIC p

360) was available only after 18 NC had been built.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39.        As

for the monies which Tong Djoe gave Mdm Tan from time to time as household expenses, the

liquidator’s position was that such monies were used to pay for Mdm Tan’s

personal expenses like car repair, home expenses, entertainment and funeral expenses. It

was submitted for the liquidator that there was no evidence that such monies were ever

used to pay the constructions costs.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40.       

Unfortunately, the accounting records of Hua Ann produced before me were not complete.

However, where available, they demonstrated that Mdm Tan had deposited various sums of

money into Hua Ann from time to time. I am of the view that there would have been no need

for her to do so if the facility from Bank of East Asia was sufficient to pay the

construction costs, as well as to buy other properties. Also, if the monies from Tong Djoe

for household expenses were used only for Mdm Tan’s personal expenses, she would not

have deposited them into Hua Ann. In my view, such monies were deposited into Hua Ann to

help pay the construction costs, as well as to buy other properties. However, it is

important to bear in mind that these deposits were not gifts by Mdm Tan to Hua Ann. Her

account with Hua Ann would show a credit in her favour for each sum deposited, meaning

that she was a creditor of Hua Ann for each sum. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41.        

Although I find that the monies deposited by Mdm Tan into Hua Ann came from Tong Djoe, I

also find that the monies were gifts to Mdm Tan by Tong Djoe although, at times, she would

tell him what she wanted the money for (NE 45, NE 47). </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42.        I

would add that after Mdm Tan’s death in October 1986, Tong Djoe continued to provide

monies for home expenses but this was because he was the patriarch of the family, as he

admitted (NE 45). The monies he provided were of smaller amounts (NE 241) and there is no

evidence that these monies were deposited with Hua Ann or that Hua Ann used them to pay

the construction costs of 18 NC or any other further renovation costs. </font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">WHOSE COMPANY WAS HUA ANN?</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43.        The

name ‘Hua’ was taken from Mdm Tan’s name i.e Tan Beow Hua, and the name

‘Ann’ was taken from the name of the youngest son Kheng Ann. The company was

named Hua Ann Brothers because at that time it was meant eventually for the sons. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44.        Mdm

Tan was an independent minded person. At times, she would even make decisions on financial

matters first before asking Tong Djoe for money (NE 64). Although neither Tong Djoe or Mdm

Tan was ever a director of shareholder of Hua Ann, Mdm Tan was, as I find, the person in

de facto control of Hua Ann while she was alive. She passed away in October 1986 while

swimming in a pool at 18 NC. No witness has disputed that she was in control of Hua Ann

except for Keng Hiang. He had initially admitted that she was in control (NE 261), but

then chose to deny this later (NE 289 to 290). Mdm Tan decided who would be the directors

and shareholders of Hua Ann from time to time. When her sons were not in Singapore, she

used her friends and Ming Min as directors and/or shareholders. When she used friends as

shareholders, she got them to sign trust deeds or declarations of trust in favour of her

sons. Some of these documents are exhibited in the AEIC of Tong Djoe.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45.        

Even when the sons became shareholders, she apparently got them (or some of them) to sign

trust deeds of their shares in her favour. For example, there was a trust deed signed by

Keng Meng of shares registered in his name (which he said belonged to Kheng Lay) in favour

of Mdm Tan. Kheng Ann said that he too signed a trust deed in her favour. There was a

letter from Chu Chan &amp; Partners to Mdm Tan dated 3 March 1986 stating, inter alia,

that Kheng Ann, Keng Tit and Tong Yee (Keng Meng’s son) had signed trust deeds and a

bill from the law firm for preparing five sets of trust deeds. However, no one from that

law firm gave evidence on the letter or the bill. Even then, I am prepared to accept for

the purpose of the present litigation that at least some, if not all, of her sons signed

trust deeds in her favour. As I have said, Mdm Tan was not the trusting sort of person and

this lack of trust extended to her sons or at least some of them.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46.        

Also, on 7 April 1975, a power of attorney was given by Hua Ann to Mdm Tan giving her

power to manage the business of Hua Ann and to exercise the powers of the directors (2PSB

1).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47.        It

is also significant to note that it was Mdm Tan, and not Tong Djoe, who was recorded as a

creditor for each sum of money deposited by Mdm Tan. Indeed, none of Hua Ann’s

accounts which were available showed Tong Djoe to be a creditor of Hua Ann (NE 56). It was

also Mdm Tan, and not Tong Djoe, who decided how much monies she would deposit with Hua

Ann (NE 46). I am of the view that this was because Tong Djoe was not supposed to have any

interest in Hua Ann. As Tong Djoe’s own witness Keng Meng had emphasized, Mdm Tan was

concerned about Tong Djoe’s generosity to his friends and his willingness to give his

personal guarantee for their businesses (see Keng Meng’s AEIC para 31 and NE 87, 89).

I also note from the trust deed of shares she obtained from Keng Meng that the trust deed

was in her favour and not Tong Djoe and that after Mdm Tan passed away in October 1986,

Tong Djoe did not request any of his sons to sign a similar trust deed in his favour.

Furthermore, after Mdm Tan’s death, Hua Ann was run by some of the sons from time to

time but never by Tong Djoe. Indeed, he was not even informed when shares in Hua Ann were

allotted to Soh Ting’s children in 1988, after Mdm Tan’s death (NE 77 and 78).

Also, monies were being withdrawn from Hua Ann by the sons, after Mdm Tan’s death,

apparently without the need for Tong Djoe’s approval. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">48.        In

my view, Hua Ann was Mdm Tan’s company while Tunas was Tong Djoe’s company. I

would add that 18 NC was mortgaged by Hua Ann from time to time without Tong Djoe’s

prior written consent.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">WHERE DID TONG DJOE STAY PRIOR TO

MDM TAN’S DEATH?</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49.        As

I have mentioned, the Tong family stayed at 61 Grange Road initially, although there is

some evidence that they stayed at 26 TA before they stayed at 61 Grange Road. After 61

Grange Road was repossessed by a bank in 1978, they stayed at 26 TA. At that time, the

construction of 18 NC had not yet been completed.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50.        

According to Tong Djoe, after 18 NC was completed, he chose to stay at the third level

thereof as it had the best view and he and his wife moved to the third level (see his AEIC

para 24 and 30). Yet he also said he stayed at 26 TA on weekdays, and lived at 18 NC on

weekends and even then, it was only on some Sundays that the family would gather at 18 NC

(see his AEIC para 34 and 73).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51.        

This evidence was corroborated by Keng Meng (see his AEIC para 42 and NE 92), Keng Hiang

(NE 310) and Jenny (NE 234). According to Keng Meng, it was Mdm Tan who would be insisting

that the family members attend the Sunday lunch if Tong Djoe was in Singapore (AEIC para

42 and NE 93). In my view, 26 TA was the main residence of Tong Djoe and Mdm Tan. They

went to 18 NC occasionally. This was primarily for Sunday lunches with the rest of the

family who would gather there.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52.        In

the meantime, Keng Tit had returned from overseas in 1984 and he was residing in one of

the rooms at the third level of 18 NC until he passed away in 1991 (see Keng Meng’s

AEIC para 38).</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">WHERE DID TONG DJOE STAY AFTER

MDM TAN’S DEATH?</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">53.        I

will deal with the question as to where Tong Djoe stayed after Mdm Tan’s death in

various stages:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) From 1986 to 1991 when Keng

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) From 1992 to 1994 when the

    third level of 18 NC was rented out</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c) From 1994 to February 1999

    when 26 TA was sold</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(d) After 26 TA was sold.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">From 1986 to 1991</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">54.        As

I have said, Mdm Tan passed away in October 1986. I am of the view that Tong Djoe

continued staying at 26 TA. Furthermore, with her death, the Sunday lunches and family

gatherings either stopped or became less frequent, and, consequently, Tong Djoe’s

visits to 18 NC became less frequent too (see again Keng Meng’s AEIC para 42 where he

said that the Sunday lunches continued until his mother passed away).</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Between 1992 to 1994</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">55.        As

I have mentioned, Keng Tit passed away in 1991. It is not disputed that for two years

between 1 August 1992 to 31 July 1994, the third level of 18 NC was rented to an outsider.

Yet in the AEICs of Tong Djoe, Keng Meng, Kheng Ann and Ming Min, this fact was not

mentioned. The impression from their AEICs was that Tong Djoe had been staying at the

third level all along.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">56.        For

example, in para 74 of Tong Djoe’s AEIC, he asserted that after Keng Tit’s

death, he did not stay at the third level but he did not remove all his belongings. I am

of the view that if he did not remove his belongings, the third level could not have been

rented out, unless his belongings were stored somewhere else at the third level. In any

event, that is a different picture from what he had painted in his para 74. A second

example is Kheng Ann’s AEIC where at para 65 he states that Tong Djoe has been

staying at the third level since 1979/1980 ‘up to this date’ meaning the date of

his AEIC. He reiterated this at NE 160. It was only later at NE 167 that he raised the

fact of the tenancy of the third level and then alleged, in NE 168, that Tong Djoe had

moved permanently to 18 NC from about July 1994.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Between 1994 to February 1999</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">57.        

According to the AEICs of Keng Meng, Kheng Ann and Ming Min, when Kheng Ann came back from

America in 1994, he stayed with Tong Djoe at the third level of 18 NC to help take care of

Tong Djoe until 1999 when Kheng Ann moved to stay at his own place in the Balmoral area.

In particular, Kheng Ann said in para 34 of his AEIC:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘34. My return to Singapore

    in 1994 was prompted by my father’s ill health. My father was about 70 years old.

    Further, my wife and I decided to start a family in Singapore. We stayed with our father

    at the 3<sup>rd</sup> level of 18 Namly Crescent to take care of him.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I reiterate that Kheng Ann had

also said in cross-examination that Tong Djoe moved back to 18 NC ‘permanently’

from July 1994 (NE 168).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">58.        

However, in cross-examination, Kheng Ann said that when he returned in 1994, he was living

at Soo Chow Gardens with his wife and then at 18 NC (NE 167). This corroborates para 52 of

Jenny’s AEIC where she said that in July 1994, Kheng Ann and his wife had moved into

the third level of 18 NC from Kheng Ann’s mother-in-law’s place at Upper Thomson

Road.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">59.        On

23 July 1994, Keng Hiang wrote a letter (DBD 378), in his capacity as Managing Director of

Hua Ann, to Kheng Ann, to state that locks to the third level had been changed without his

knowledge, that the third level was meant for rental and that Kheng Ann had committed

trespass. According to Kheng Ann, this was Keng Hiang’s way of hitting back at Tong

Djoe through him because by then the relationship between Tong Djoe and Keng Hiang had

soured and Keng Hiang was sacked from Tunas (NE 167). Secondly, Keng Hiang was unhappy

with Kheng Ann for looking after Keng Hiang’s son in America at Jenny’s request

without Keng Hiang’s knowledge (NE 168). Ming Min’s AEIC para 31 said that by

1994 the relationship between the children had strained over money issues of Hua Ann and

Kheng Ann was getting a lot of flak about a property in Los Angeles. Whatever the reason

or reasons, I accept that by 1994, Keng Hiang’s relationship with Tong Djoe and Kheng

Ann had soured. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">60.        I

would add that the occupant under the tenancy of the third level had probably moved out

earlier before the expiry of the tenancy and Kheng Ann then moved in in July 1994. I also

note that Kheng Ann did not respond to the 23 July 1994 letter to say that he was staying

at 18 NC to look after Tong Djoe.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">61.        

According to Jenny, Kheng Ann had cleverly asked Tong Djoe to stay with him at the third

level of 18 NC in 1994 on the pretext of taking care of Tong Djoe so that Keng Hiang would

not hassle Kheng Ann to move out. She said that Tong Djoe stayed there for three months

(her AEIC para 53) or five months (NE 249). Tong Djoe was diagnosed with prostrate cancer

in February 1995 and underwent an immediate operation, stayed in the hospital for a month

and thereafter returned to 26 TA (her AEIC para 54).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">62.        I

refer also to the minutes of an extra-ordinary General Meeting of Hua Ann held on 15

December 1998 (DBD 387 to 388). The minutes were signed by Keng Meng. They stated, inter

<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">63.        I

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘75. Thereafter, in 1994, I

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These paragraphs contradict the

assertion that Tong Djoe had moved back to 18 NC permanently from July 1994.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">64.        As

I have already said, and as admitted by Tong Djoe and Keng Meng, even when Mdm Tan was

alive, she and Tong Djoe went to 18 NC only occasionally for some of the Sunday lunches.

Their main residence was 26 TA. After Mdm Tan died in 1986, Tong Djoe continued residing

at 26 TA. Keng Tit was residing in a room at the third level of 18 NC from 1984 to 1991

but after he died in 1991, the third level was rented out in 1992 for two years. Tong Djoe

continued to reside in 26 TA during these two years. Therefore, when Kheng Ann came back

to Singapore in 1994, Tong Djoe was not staying at 18 NC but at 26 TA.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">65.        In

my view, when Kheng Ann returned to Singapore in 1994 with his wife, he had no place of

his own. He then stayed at his mother-in-law’s place at Soo Chow Gardens. However, it

is not true that Kheng Ann returned to Singapore to look after Tong Djoe at 18 NC. If that

were so, Kheng Ann would not have stayed first at Soo Chow Gardens. I find that Tong Djoe

must then have asked Kheng Ann to move to the third level of 18 NC as Tong Djoe was not

staying there. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">66.        

Then, Keng Hiang discovered that Kheng Ann had moved to the third level and that is why he

sent the letter dated 23 July 1994 to Kheng Ann (which I have referred to in para 59

above). Tong Djoe then decided to move temporarily to the third level to help Kheng Ann

out as he must have been told by Kheng Ann that Keng Hiang was trying to kick him (Kheng

Ann) out. I accept that subsequently Tong Djoe moved back to 26 TA after he was diagnosed

with cancer in February 1995 and after his stay in a hospital.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">67.        The

minutes of 15 December 1998 (which I have referred to in para 62 above) reflected Keng

Hiang’s insistence that the third level of 18 NC should be rented out and that Kheng

Ann was still residing there. Faced with Keng Hiang’s insistence, Kheng Ann promised

to move out. There was no mention in the minutes that Tong Djoe was staying at the third

level or that Kheng Ann was helping to take care of Tong Djoe at the third level.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">68.        As

for Kheng Ann’s evidence that Tong Djoe’s things were at the third level of 18

NC and a maid was also there (NE 169), I am of the view that those ‘things’ were

probably artefacts that Tong Djoe was in the habit of purchasing (whether for his own

business or for himself, I do not know). On this point, Keng Hiang produced photographs he

had taken of 26 TA in 1996 and 1997 (Exhibit D7) showing numerous items placed by Tong

Djoe inside and outside 26 TA and an enforcement notice dated 25 January 1997 from the

Urban Redevelopment Authority to Hua Ann stating that 26 TA had been used as a store

(Exhibit D8). Keng Hiang said that some of these artefacts were also stored at the third

level of 18 NC and I accept this evidence (NE 279 and NE 281). That is why Keng Hiang

pushed the directors to agree at the meeting on 15 December 1998 that ‘no

director/shareholder should allow third party to use 18 Namly Crescent as a storage place

or for any other purposes ….’ (DBD 387).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">69.        As

for the maid, I am of the view that she was there probably to help clean the place and

take care of Kheng Ann and his wife and perhaps the artefacts as well.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">70.        At

this stage, I would mention that I find Keng Hiang’s alleged concern about the

interest of Hua Ann to be hypocritical. While he wanted the third level of 18 NC to be

rented out, Jenny and he were staying at 26 TA free of rent together with other family

members. Furthermore, he had been taking money from Hua Ann to pay his personal

liabilities.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After February 1999</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">71.        The

next question is where Tong Djoe stayed after 26 TA was sold in February 1999. In para 76

of his AEIC, which I have cited in para 63 above, he said that he then moved over to stay

at 18 NC while a lot of his antiques had to be put temporarily at 53 Happy Avenue East.

Eventually they were kept at 18 NC. Interestingly enough, he was not cross-examined by Mr

Charles Ezekiel, Counsel for the liquidator, on this paragraph.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">72.        

However, on the other hand, Mr Woo also did not cross-examine Jenny on her contrary

assertion in para 61 of her AEIC. Paragraph 61 stated:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘61. When the 26 Third

    Avenue property was sold in February 1999 (Completion Date), the Plaintiff himself was not

    even allowed to reside in the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor apartment of the 18 Namly Crescent. In

    fact, the Plaintiff had to rent 2 houses to stay and to put all his personal belonging,

    antiques and artefacts. In particular, he rented a property at 53 Happy Avenue East, and

    another at 48 Gentle Road, Singapore from December 1998. He resided in 53 Happy Avenue

    East until December 1999.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">73.        

Neither did Mr Woo cross-examine Keng Hiang on para 24 of his AEIC which stated:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘24. Sometime in July 1999,

    Clement Tong moved out of the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor 18 Namly Crescent and he handed the

    keys of the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff did not lived there but

    stayed at his penthouse in Tunas Building. On 1 June 2000, I, in the capacity as Managing

    Director of the Defendant Company, wrote to Melvin Tong, the Chairman of the Defendant

    Company and objected to the Plaintiff’s antiques being placed at the 2<sup>nd</sup>

    floor, 3<sup>rd</sup> floor and the surrounding compound of 18 Namly Crescent. Annexed

    hereto and marked "TKH-8" is the letter dated 1 June 2000.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">74.        

Next, I refer to the minutes of a board meeting of Hua Ann on 12 April 1999 (PB 1256). The

minutes were signed by Keng Meng, Keng Hiang and Kheng Lay. The minutes stated, inter

alia:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘4) Following previous

    Boards’ decision, Clement confirm to move out from 18 Namly Crescent at a slightly

    later date but not later than mid-June 99. The <u>vacant</u> premise is either for Mr.

    Tong Djoe to stay if he wishes, or to be let out to generate additional income.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[Emphasis added.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">75.        In

my view, this demonstrated the true state of affairs as at that time. Tong Djoe was not

staying at 18 NC then (i.e April 1999). Although the minutes said that Tong Djoe could

stay (at the third level) if he wanted to, that was the intention then. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">76.        As

Keng Hiang had said in his AEIC, he had written on 1 June 2000 to object to Tong

Djoe’s antiques being placed on the second and third levels of 18 NC. The letter is

at DBD 392 and although it did not specifically mention Tong Djoe’s use of the second

and third levels for storage purposes, I accept that that was what the letter was alluding

to. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">77.        

Next, the minutes of a board meeting of Hua Ann on 7 June 2000 stated, inter alia:</font>

Meng.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">78.        

Although these minutes stated that the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor was ‘now’ occupied

by Tong Djoe, the current address on Tong Djoe’s identity card is an address in Tunas

building. He also admitted that he did not have any document showing 18 NC as his address

(NE 15). Furthermore, Mr Woo said in his opening statement that, ‘Plaintiff is

staying there [meaning 18 NC], perhaps not everyday, sometimes at the penthouse. His

possessions are at the 3<sup>rd</sup> level’ (NE 2).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">79.        I

am of the view that after 26 TA was sold, Tong Djoe was residing at a place other than the

third level of 18 NC. This place was probably the penthouse at Tunas Building. However,

Tong Djoe’s artefacts were and are stored at the third level of 18 NC.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">MY CONCLUSION</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">80.        

Tong Djoe’s claim, as pleaded, is that he has a right to live at the third level of

18 NC for as long as he lives. Yet, in cross-examination, he asserted repeatedly that 18

NC was his and that he was the true owner of Hua Ann. That was quite a different claim

altogether.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">81.        

Tong Djoe’s claim, as pleaded, is based on an alleged arrangement with Mdm Tan

whereby she allegedly agreed that he would have such a right if he provided the funds for

the purchase of 18 NC and the construction of the three storey house at 18 NC. Yet during

cross-examination, he relied not so much on the alleged arrangement with Mdm Tan but on

the fact that he had provided the funds. That was also the thrust of the evidence, during

cross-examination, of his witnesses Keng Meng, Kheng Ann and Ming Min.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">82.        Mr

Woo had sought to rely on the fact that although the sons, as directors of Hua Ann, had

wanted to sell 18 NC and/or 26 TA for some years before February 1999, no such sale was

entered into until 26 TA was sold in February 1999. He submitted that this was because

Tong Djoe had to be consulted before 18 NC or 26 TA could be sold. When 26 TA was sold,

this was done only with Tong Djoe’s consent. The suggestion was that the consultation

was an acknowledgment of the right Tong Djoe is claiming.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">83.        In

my view, there could have been many reasons why no sale was entered into for some time,

even though there was a common intention among the sons to sell. The sons were not seeing

eye to eye and might not have agreed on the price or how much weight should be given to

Tong Djoe’s views. In any event, none of the witnesses, including Tong Djoe, said

that the very reason why no sale was entered into earlier was because of the right he has

pleaded. For example, Keng Meng and Kheng Ann’s position that Tong Djoe would have to

be consulted was because he is the patriarch of the family who provided the funds (see,

for example, NE 112, 160 and 162) and not because he had some arrangement with Mdm Tan or

had some legal right to be consulted. In the case of 26 TA, Tong Djoe was also staying

there at the time.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">84.        Mr

Woo had also relied on the minutes of the directors’ meeting of 12 April 1999, which

I have quoted in para 74 above. He submitted that the minutes reflected Tong Djoe’s

right to stay at the third level of 18 NC. In addition, he also relied on a letter dated 8

August 2000 from Soh Ting to Keng Meng in which she said:</font>
</p><ol xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘<u>Re: Reside at No. 18

    Namly Crescent 3rd Level</u></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Dear Brother,</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After reading the letter which

    you fax to me dated 1<sup>st</sup> August 2000 from Peter Pang &amp; Co., I, Tong Soh Ting

    and my two children (Mr. Soon Cheng Yee and Miss Soon Tze Ling) hereby supported that Mr.

    Tong Djoe @ Tong Lian Joo should stay at the above mentioned property for the rest of his

    life, if he wants to.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You may consider for double

    protection to also have the Tenancy Agreement with Mr. Tong Djoe @ Tong Lian Joo at the

    father Mr. Tong Djoe @ Tong Lian Joo continue to stay at the above mentioned property for

    the rest of his life, if he wants too.’</font></p>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">85.        I

am of the view that the minutes of the directors’ meeting of 12 April 1999 fall quite

short of an acknowledgment of Tong Djoe’s right. Although the minutes appear to

reflect the wishes of the directors, at that time, that Tong Djoe be allowed to stay at

the third level of 18 NC if he so wished, the focus was on getting Kheng Ann out. Besides,

if Tong Djoe had the right to stay at the third level, the minutes would have been worded

differently. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">86.        I

am also of the view that the letter from Soh Ting dated 8 August 2000 falls short of

acknowledging Tong Djoe’s right as claimed. It was more of a plea that Tong Djoe be

allowed to stay at the third level if he wished. Besides, Soh Ting may no longer be of

that view as she is apparently now on the side of Keng Hiang where this issue is

concerned.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">87.        Mr

Woo also relied on the fact that the minutes of a board meeting of Hua Ann on 8 January

1999 (PB 1253) recorded that the balance of the sale proceeds of 26 TA would be divided

into six equal shares and if needed could be borrowed by each shareholder. Each

shareholder was to provide such sum ‘at their own accord’ to Tong Djoe.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">88.        

According to Keng Meng, the original intention was to buy a small property for Tong Djoe

from the balance of the sale proceeds from the sale of 26 TA but the shareholders began to

have differing views. So, it was agreed that each should come up with a sum for Tong Djoe

(NE 127). Mr Woo submitted that the decision to come up with a sum for Tong Djoe

recognised Tong Djoe’s right to reside in the family homes (i.e 26 TA and 18 NC). Mr

Woo also added that it was precisely because the sons recognised Tong Djoe’s right to

reside in the family homes that the minutes of a directors’ resolution of Hua Ann

dated 22 February 1999 recorded that a sum of $70,000 would be advanced to Tong Djoe

and/or Tunas.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">89.        I

do not agree with those submissions. If indeed the board had recognised Tong Djoe’s

right, the minutes of 8 January 1999 would not have said that each shareholder was to

provide such sum ‘at their own accord’ to him. The minutes merely reflected a

wish to benefit Tong Djoe and not an acknowledgement of his right. As events turned out,

there was a change of mind and no property was purchased for him from the balance of the

sale proceeds. Moreover, Tong Djoe did not assert that Hua Ann or its shareholders were

obliged to buy a property for him (see his AEIC para 103 to 105 and NE 41 where he said,

‘It is ok with me’ even though that intention was not carried out).</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">90.        As

for the directors’ resolution to advance $70,000 to Tong Djoe or Tunas, I am of the

view that this was because there was another change of mind by some of the shareholders.

Hence only Keng Meng agreed to give $50,000 to Tong Djoe which would be debited against

Keng Meng’s account and Soh Ting agreed to give Tong Djoe $10,000, i.e $5,000 from

each of her two children who are registered shareholders and debited to their respective

accounts with Hua Ann. There was no evidence as to whether the balance of $10,000 (to make

up $70,000) was given. Interestingly enough, the cheque for $50,000 was made in favour of

Tunas and recorded in the payment voucher as a loan to Tunas (see Tong Djoe’s AEIC p

406 to 410). </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">91.        In

any event, I am of the view that the $70,000 did not constitute an acknowledgment of a

legal right in Tong Djoe. It merely reflected the wish of some of his children to benefit

him or Tunas out of their love and respect for him and the belief that he had earlier

funded the purchase of some properties and the construction costs of 18 NC. If the monies

were supposed to compensate Tong Djoe for deprivation of a legal right, all the children

would have given something to Tong Djoe proportionately to their shares in Hua Ann.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">92.        Mr

Woo also submitted that there was no reason for Keng Meng, Kheng Ann and Ming Min, who are

all shareholders of Hua Ann, to support Tong Djoe’s claim to their own detriment

unless his claim is true. In my view, they have supported Tong Djoe’s claim out of

their love and respect for him and in appreciation for what they believe he has done for

the Tong family. While their motive may be commendable, it does not necessarily make all

their evidence true nor Tong Djoe’s claim valid.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">93.        I

find that there was no arrangement between Tong Djoe and Mdm Tan as pleaded by Tong Djoe.

He had assumed, not unnaturally, that, as the patriarch of the family who had provided the

funds and because Mdm Tan was controlling Hua Ann, he would be entitled to stay at 18 NC

if he so wished. I would add that a unilateral expectation is not binding on others. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">94.        I

have also found that Hua Ann was Mdm Tan’s company. She controlled it while she was

alive and she was not controlling it for Tong Djoe. After her death, Hua Ann was

controlled by her sons, not Tong Djoe. Hua Ann was incorporated for the benefit of her

sons and herself and the properties acquired by Hua Ann was for their benefit and not Tong

Djoe. True, if she were still alive, she would most probably have allowed Tong Djoe to

stay at the third level, or at any level, of 18 NC if he so wished. However, that would be

based on her knowledge of the financial support he had provided and her affection and

respect for him and not because he has an interest or right, enforceable in a court of

law. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">95.        In

any event, Mdm Tan was recorded in Hua Ann’s books as a creditor for the purchase

monies of 18 NC when she sold and transferred 18 NC to Hua Ann. Likewise, the monies which

Tong Djoe gave to Mdm Tan to assist in paying the construction costs of the house at 18 NC

and which were deposited by Mdm Tan in Hua Ann were not gifts by her to Hua Ann. As I have

mentioned, she was a creditor for each of the sums so deposited and, prima facie, she and

her estate would have had a claim for those monies, as well as the purchase monies,

against Hua Ann.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">96.        

Tong Djoe, as one of her beneficiaries (as she died intestate) would also, prima facie,

benefit from those claims. However, if Tong Djoe himself has a valid claim to the third

level of 18 NC against Hua Ann by reason of the monies he has provided, then that would be

a sort of double-counting against Hua Ann. The fact that Tong Djoe has chosen not to seek

monetary compensation in exchange for his alleged right is immaterial. The point is that

he would be entitled to seek such compensation were I to conclude that he has the right he

claims. I would add that I am not aware of the current position between Mdm Tan’s

estate and Hua Ann. There may well have been developments since 18 NC was transferred to

Hua Ann and since Mdm Tan deposited the monies and these developments may in turn affect

the account as between Mdm Tan and Hua Ann. That is a separate matter which is not before

me.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">97.        I

would also add that the cases cited by Mr Woo in support of Tong Djoe’s claim had

different facts which do not come close to those before me.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">98.        In

the circumstances, it is not necessary for me to reach a conclusion on another argument

taken by the liquidator of Hua Ann i.e that Tong Djoe’s claim is contrary to the

provisions of the Residential Property Act (Cap 274). I would only say that Tong

Djoe’s claim is not that of a bare licensee and it may well be that his claim would

have, in any event, run afoul of the Residential Property Act.</font></p>
<i xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">SUMMARY</font></p>
</b></i>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">99.        

This is not a case of an old man being kicked out onto the streets without a place to stay

in. That is the picture which Tong Djoe and his witnesses were painting. As I have said,

at all material times, Tong Djoe was and is not staying at the third level of 18 NC. He

spends part of his time in Indonesia, and, when he is in Singapore, he is staying

somewhere else. The real reason for his claim is his dissatisfaction with some of his

children and, in particular, Keng Hiang. The fortunes of Hua Ann have plummeted and Tong

Djoe believes that Keng Hiang will cause the sale of 18 NC, the last substantial asset of

Hua Ann, at a time when property prices have come down. During the trial, he expressed his

unhappiness about the price at which 26 TA was sold, which he felt was too low (NE 7 and

NE 41). Moreover, he is also afraid that his children will spend away the money which they

will receive from the sale of 18 NC (see his AEIC para 111 and NE 58). </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">100.        

Although I find Keng Hiang to be rude, ungrateful and pretentious, the burden of proof is

on Tong Djoe as the plaintiff. For the reasons I have stated, I find that he has failed to

discharge his burden. In the circumstances, I dismiss Tong Djoe’s claim. I will hear

the parties on costs. </font></p>
<p xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">101.        I

would add one observation. It came to my attention during the trial that the liquidator

had mentioned in his first report the substance of an offer that was made without

prejudice by Tong Djoe’s solicitors to his solicitors. In cross-examination, the

liquidator did not agree that he should not have done this. I am of the view that the

liquidator should not have mentioned the substance of the offer in his report. Having done

so, he and his solicitors should have blanked out that part of his report on the substance

of the offer before they used his report.</font></p>
