</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1.    This case involves an appeal against the

decision of the Appeals Board on a question of law under section 29(2) of the Land

Acquisition Act (Cap 152). The appellant, the Collector of Land Revenue, (the

"Collector") appealed against an award of $5,640,000 made by the Appeals Board

in favour of the respondent, Mr Mustaq Ahmad ("Mustaq"), as compensation for the

acquisition of his properties on the ground that the decision is contrary to the

provisions of section 33(5)(e) of the Land Acquisition Act. We allowed the appeal with

costs and now give the reasons for our decision.

<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

Background</p>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.    Mustaq owned No 38 and No 40 Owen Road ("the

properties"), which were acquired on 28 June 1996 for a public purpose, namely the

construction of the North-East MRT Line and the comprehensive development of the area. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.    For a more complete picture of the dispute between

the parties, the following ought to be noted:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(a) The acquired properties had a total area of 475 square metres and

  were located in a local shopping zone in the Master Plan.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) On 7 September 1993, written permission was granted by the

  competent authority for the development of the site and for a "3-storey and an attic

  residential building with a restaurant at the 1<sup>st</sup> storey". </p>
<p align="justify">(c) Construction work, which began in July 1994, was suspended in June

  1995 following an application by the architect to amend the written permission by adding a

  4<sup>th</sup> storey and by converting the residential building to a boarding house. </p>
<p align="justify">(d) Provisional permission for the amendments was obtained on 18 July

  1995. The provisional permission was valid for a period of 6 months from 27 July 1995. </p>
<p align="justify">(e) No written permission was obtained for the amendments to add a 4<sup>th</sup>

  storey and to convert the residential building to a boarding house and by the time the

  properties were acquired in June 1998, the provisional permission to increase the size of

  the building and to convert its use had lapsed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.    After the acquisition of his properties, Mustaq

made a claim for $7,107,500 as compensation for the said acquisition. On 11 September

1996, the Collector of Land Revenue (the "Collector") awarded him the sum of

$3,300,000. On 3 November 1996, Mustaq submitted a revised claim for $5,850,000, which

included a claim for $4,500,000 in respect of the land. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    The Appeals Board ruled that the market value of

the acquired properties was $5,640,000. In coming to this conclusion, it took into account

the fact that Mustaq had obtained provisional permission to increase the size of the

building and to convert the residential building to a boarding house. The Board took this

approach because it accepted that "the probable use of the acquired land for the

purpose of determining its market value is use for a restaurant on the 1<sup>st</sup>

storey and a boarding house on the upper storeys in a building with 4 storeys and an attic

as proposed in the appellant’s application for an amendment to the original

development proposal and for which provisional permission had been granted." A

discount was given because the provisional permission had lapsed by the time the

properties were acquired. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    The Collector, who disagreed with the approach of

the Appeals Board, appealed against its decision.</p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><br/>

The appeal</p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.    The main issue in the appeal was whether or not

the Appeals Board acted in contravention of section 33(5)(e) of the Land Acquisition Act

by taking into account the provisional permission for the purpose of awarding Mustaq

compensation for the acquisition of his properties. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.    Section 33(5)(e) of the Land Acquisition Act

provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[T]he market value of the acquired land shall be deemed not to exceed

  the price which a bona fide purchaser might reasonably be expected to pay for the land on

  the basis of its existing use or in anticipation of the continued use of the land for the

  purpose designated in the Master Plan, whichever is the lower, after taking into account

  the zoning and density requirements and any other restrictions imposed under the Planning

  Act and any restrictive covenants in the title of the acquired land, and no account shall

  be taken of any potential value of the land for any other more intensive use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.    The Collector pointed out that by taking into

account the provisional permission, the Appeals Board departed from the principles laid

down by a previous Appeals Board in <i>Beauty Park Development (Pte) Ltd v Collector of

Land Revenue </i>[1991] 2 MLJ li<i>. </i>In that case, two and half acres of land in Bukit

Timah were acquired by the Urban Renewal Authority. Prior to the acquisition, the

owners’ architect had prepared plans for a 27-storey commercial and residential

complex and had applied to the authorities for planning permission. After corresponding

with the relevant authorities, the architect met an officer in the Planning Department,

who advised him to amend the plans to provide for the construction of a 20-storey complex,

with 60% of the building allocated for residential purposes. Although no written

permission had been obtained for the proposed amendments, the owners of the acquired

property, who made a claim for $16.5m, asserted that as planning permission could

reasonably have been expected to be granted for the multi-storey shopping and residential

complex, this should be taken into account for the purpose of determining the market value

of the property. However, the Collector awarded the owners only $631,000. This sum was

increased to $1,832,484 before the hearing of the appeal against the Collector’s

award. The Appeals Board noted that the main issue before it was whether or not the

property should have been valued with the benefit of the planning permission that the

appellants alleged that they would have obtained but for the acquisition of their property

by the Urban Renewal Authority. The Board accepted that the owners had in their hands what

may be termed "in principle" approval for their plans to redevelop the acquired

site. However, it did not think that the "in principle" approval should be taken

into account for determining the compensation payable to the owners. Sinnathuray J, who

delivered the decision of the Appeals Board, said at pp <i>liv-lv </i>as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">There was evidence before the Board that at all material times, all

  that the appellants could be said to have got from the Planning Department at the very

  most was an ‘in principle approval’ of their plans. This however, did not

  necessarily mean that a final approval would have been granted to them. </p>
<p align="justify">Although it was said that it was reasonable then to expect that

  planning permission would have been granted to the appellants when they had amended their

  plans according to the directives given by the officer from the Planning Department, it is

  a wholly different thing to say that it was certain that they would have been granted such

  planning permission… </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.    We are of the view that the approach adopted by

the Appeals Board in <i>Beauty Park Development (Pte) Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue </i>is

correct. The provisional approval granted to Mustaq cannot be equated with written

permission to develop the site. If provisional permission for a proposed plan is to be

taken into account for the purpose of determining the market value of an acquired

property, it will be necessary to evaluate whether or not it is likely that written

permission will eventually be granted after the submission of building plans, and whether

or not the written permission may include restrictions, which have to be taken into

account. Such speculation is unnecessary and undesirable. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.    We thus remitted the case back to the Appeals

Board for the compensation payable to Mustaq to be computed on the basis of the written

permission granted for the development of the acquired properties.</p>
