Applying that principle, the court considers the most likely scenario aside from the approval of the scheme. If the positions of two groups of creditors under the proposed scheme as compared to under the most likely scenario differ to dissimilar extents, these two groups of creditors would have to be placed in different voting classes. Here, the most likely scenario in the event that the Scheme is not approved would be liquidation. Comparing the situation under the proposed Scheme to the situation in which the Applicant is liquidated, the Put Option Holders, TAMI and Phillip Asia are all favoured or prejudiced to similar extents as each other given that they are all beneficiaries of some form of guarantee given by the Applicant. Thus, they should not be classed separately.

In the circumstances, the terms imposed by the Subscriber are the best possible that could be obtained by the Applicant. The Applicant further cites general weakness and volatility in the stock market, insufficient cash flow, currency fluctuation, soft consumer demand, and competitive environment, to demonstrate its financial difficulties. Notably, the Applicant has also offered Phillip Asia the same terms of super priority in return for future financing, as that offered to the Subscriber.

The inference to be drawn must be that the Applicant included these contingent liabilities in the proposed Scheme in order to inflate the quantum of liabilities and to reduce Phillip Asia’s portion to below the 25% threshold and preclude any chances of its successful opposition to the proposed Scheme. The Applicant has also failed to respond to Phillip Asia’s request for categories of information and documents in order to clarify the basis for its contingent debts.

The guidance from <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> is that proper classification of creditors should be considered at the calling of meeting stage (at [59] and [61]–[62]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The court will consider if there is “no realistic prospect” of the scheme receiving the requisite approval: <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> at [64], citing with approval <span class="font-italic">Re N</span><span class="font-italic">g Huat Foundations Pte Ltd</span> [2005] SGHC 112 at [9]. Where the opposition is such that the required supermajorities cannot be met, there is no realistic prospect of the scheme receiving the requisite approval. Thus, if there is strong opposition expressed, it would be prudent for the applicant to indicate sufficient support to show that the scheme is at least within striking distance of the supermajorities required.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 However, as emphasised in <span class="font-italic">TT </span><span class="font-italic">International</span>, the court does not consider “the merits and fairness” of the scheme at the calling of meeting stage (at [63]). The court’s consideration is limited to matters going to its jurisdiction or power to subsequently sanction the scheme if it proceeds to the sanction stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The court will also be mindful of anything indicating abuse of process (<span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Punj Lloyd </span>at [26] and [29(c)]). In particular, the application should not be a sham, or an attempt to game the system to avoid winding up proceedings, or to obtain the benefit of a moratorium under s 210(10) of the CA without any serious <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> attempt at restructuring. In weighing this issue, the court will look to the details of the proposed scheme, the agenda of the proposed scheme meeting, as well as the past conduct of the parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I pause to note the recent decision of Justice Snowden in the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Indah </span><span class="font-italic">Kiat International Finance Company B.V.</span> [2016] EWHC 246 (Ch). That case was not addressed in the submissions before me; it could be read as stipulating that there be some examination of the scheme’s explanatory statement even at the calling of meeting stage. That issue is taken up directly in another case before me, so it may be more suitably addressed on another occasion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 As for the scheme proposed, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Conchubar</span> (at [25(c)] and [101]) reiterated the guidance in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> that the scheme should be one which “a man of business or an intelligent and honest man, being a member of the class concerned and acting in respect of his interest, would reasonably approve” (at [70(c)]). Any compromise, for instance, should be meaningful rather than something meaningless (see <span class="font-italic">Conchubar</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [95] and [100]–[101]). These considerations, however, would to my mind only come into play at the sanction stage, and I would not see it as being an issue before the court at the calling of meeting stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 As evident from the above pointers, the standard required for the court’s leave to convene a scheme meeting is not a particularly stringent one. So long as a scheme is proposed <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>with sufficient disclosure<span class="font-italic">, </span>in compliance with the CA provisions, there is nothing to indicate the futility of the exercise and the voting classes are fair, the court would generally be inclined to let the matter be determined by a vote of the creditors. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application on the facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Disclosure of material information </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The requirements imposed by the courts for all material information to be given by the applicant at the calling of meeting stage is intended to ensure that there is sufficient material before the courts for an informed decision to be made as to how the creditors’ meeting is to be conducted: see <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> at [62]. An applicant who fails to do so runs the risk of having the application dismissed. The material information to be disclosed at this stage would be matters that affect the issues of proper classification of creditors and the scheme’s realistic prospects of approval or anything indicating an abuse of process (see <span class="font-italic">Re </span><span class="font-italic">Punj Lloyd </span>at [31]). This, however, is not to be confused with the sufficiency of information that must be disclosed under s 211 of the CA, after the leave to convene the creditors’ meeting is granted. At this latter stage, more detailed information is required to ensure that the creditors will be able to “exercise their voting rights meaningfully” (<span class="font-italic">Conchubar</span> at [88]). Likewise, the proposed scheme does not need to be wholly clear and certain at the calling of meeting stage as opposed to the sanction stage, though a prudent applicant would presumably aim to win over those voting by being as clear as possible in the details of the scheme from the outset. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In the present case, Phillip Asia takes issue with the absence of details and supporting information regarding the Scheme.

</div> Whilst the information provided by the Applicant is indeed lacking definitiveness, it could not be said that the Scheme lacks material information insofar as is required at the calling of meeting stage. What the Applicant has outlined is essentially the issuance of further shares to its creditors, the attractiveness of which would presumably be the hope of the improved performance of the Applicant, as well as the classification of its various creditors. This is sufficient information for the court to make a decision as to how the meeting should be called. Some further information may be desirable and helpful, but such lack in itself does not cripple a scheme application at the calling of meeting stage. Phillip Asia’s argument might have gained traction at the sanction stage, where there will be additional considerations of whether the Scheme was clear and certain but these are not relevant to the calling of meeting stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Phillip Asia additionally alleges that there is non-disclosure to the court of information relating to the Put Option Holders and TAMI.

</div> The first of these allegations related to the non-disclosure of how these debts were previously reported by the Applicant. These debts were only treated as contingent amounts when the present application was made and it was not reflected in the Applicant’s previous financial statement. The suspicion, Phillip Asia argues, is that such a change in treatment is conjured to give the Applicant the 75% support it needs to have the Scheme passed.

</div>
</div>
</div> This difference in treatment is explained by the Applicant as flowing from the different purposes of the report from the present application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I cannot appreciate that there is such a difference in purpose as the Applicant argues. The different treatment is a matter of concern, and would no doubt be a relevant consideration for the court at the sanction stage. At this point though, the consideration is one that is left to the chairman of the meeting, to determine whether these creditors are indeed creditors, and what value should be accorded to the debts purportedly owed to them (see [46]–[47] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Nonetheless, the effect of any non-disclosure or late disclosure will need to be considered in the context of the overall circumstances, and more importantly whether these are material information to be considered first before the meeting of creditors is summoned. Where material information is not withheld and there is no clear evidence of an abuse of process, the court would not dismiss the application immediately, but rather, bear in mind these considerations to be given effect to at the sanction stage. There will be, as I indicated in <span class="font-italic">Re</span> <span class="font-italic">Punj</span><span class="font-italic"> Lloyd </span>at [26], some situations where an abuse of process is made out at the calling of meeting stage, and the court should dismiss the application in those cases.

These may also incidentally be matters that are material at the sanction stage. What would be significant non-disclosure at this point would be non-disclosure of material information that affects the court’s consideration as to whether a meeting should be called under s 210(1), which is absent in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Assessment of Scheme’s realistic prospects of approval</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Whilst the court would not act in vain in calling for a meeting concerning a scheme which has “no realistic prospect”, despite the arguments made by Phillip Asia that the requisite threshold of 75% is not met, I find that the present case is not one where the Scheme is doomed to fail for want of approval. Even though there were additional creditors who indicated that they were not consenting to the Scheme at the hearing before me, they did not <span class="font-italic">expressly</span><span class="font-italic"> object</span> to it like Phillip Asia did. Hence, there is still a realistic chance that the requisite 75% threshold may be met. The question of whether any risk is worth taking can still be made by the creditors at the meeting to be called in the exercise of their own interest and judgment. In the absence of any clear opposition, the court cannot do more than that without interfering with a matter that is a commercial judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Fairness of classification</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 With regard to the classification of creditors and whether Phillip Asia should be placed in the same class as TAMI and the Put Option Holders, the inquiry at the calling of meeting stage is only “a preliminary determination” (see <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> at [61]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Indeed, without a preliminary determination of the correct classification of creditors, how can it be known whether a scheme is likely to attract sufficient support and subsequently pass muster? Further, if it were certain from the outset that certain opposing creditors would be classified separately so that the scheme would never pass, then it would be a futile exercise to even conduct scheme creditors’ meetings…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Based on a preliminary determination, I am not convinced, on an application of the dissimilarity principle, that Phillip Asia should be in a separate class from TAMI and the Put Option Holders because all of their interests are similarly unsecured: see <span class="font-italic">TT</span> <span class="font-italic">International</span> at [140]–[143].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As regards whether TAMI and the Put Option Holders are creditors of the Applicant, this would have to be decided by the chairman of the meeting, who as noted in <span class="font-italic">TT</span><span class="font-italic"> International </span>has to carry out the “quasi-judicial task” of adjudicating disputes to decide whether to admit or reject proofs of debt lodged (at [67]). The concerns raised by the creditors<span class="font-italic"> </span>would need to be considered by the chairman. If any dissatisfaction remains, the chairman’s decision can be appealed against and may become relevant to the court’s granting of approval of the Scheme at the sanction stage, even if the proposal passes muster at the creditors’ (or members’) meeting: see <span class="font-italic">TT</span> <span class="font-italic">International</span> at [103]–[104] and [109]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As for the discounting of TAMI’s votes to account for related party interests, it would behove those running scheme meetings to be mindful of the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TT International</span> and further commented on more recently in <span class="font-italic">Conchubar</span>. But it would be premature for this to operate as a reason to refuse to call the meeting. The court cannot substitute its determination with that of the scheme manager at this time, unless the issue is one which would so clearly result in the scheme’s failure that it will be futile to call the meeting (see [45] above). There is nothing to suggest that here. It is for the Applicant and those running the meeting to consider the guidance laid down in past cases, and how it should apply to the facts before them. Until the meeting is held, the question of a discount does not strictly arise. Further, however obstinate an applicant and its scheme managers may seem, they should be given the opportunity to reconsider the details of the scheme right up to the voting by the creditors. Anything else would, to my mind, interfere too much with the process under s 210 of the CA. Separately, the votes of the Put Option Holders may also need to be discounted in view of the contingent nature of their interests. The degree to which there should be discounting of contingent creditors was considered in <span class="font-italic">TT</span><span class="font-italic"> International</span> (at [172]–[174]). Any discounting should properly be done by the chairman at the meeting stage or by the court at the sanction stage rather than presently at the calling of meeting stage. I do not consider it appropriate in general for leave for the calling of a creditors’ meeting to be denied simply because of the <span class="font-italic">possibility</span> that some of the supporting interests may need to have the proportions discounted unless there is incontrovertible evidence that there will be a significant discount of a supporting contingent creditor such that the requisite threshold of 75% will not be met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 For the above reasons, leave is granted under s 210(1) for the calling of a meeting for the creditors to consider the Scheme. Detailed directions, including a long-stop date for any application for sanction of the Scheme by the court, will be given separately. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Super priority application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The other application before me is for super priority to be accorded to future financing from the Subscriber to the Applicant.

I must emphasise that the US authorities and doctrine are referred to only as a useful guide as we develop our own law in this area. We may stick close to the US position, or we may depart from it: much will depend on the arguments put before us.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The statutory requirements for the grant of super priority are specified in s 211E.

There is nothing in the language of s 211E(9) that prohibits a rescue financier from stipulating conditions in the grant of its rescue finance.

</div> In my view, this is clear enough an expression of intent to extend rescue financing to the Applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The remaining issues in dispute are accordingly whether the conditions for granting super priority are met and whether the court should exercise its discretion to grant super priority.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Without intending to lay down anything that may constrict the flexibility that is often required in restructurings, I am compelled to point out that some thought should be given by applicants to the appropriate type or level of super priority sought, and they should also be prepared to provide the rationale for what they seek. Indeed, as Phillip Asia points out, the Applicant should have specified from the outset which limb of s 211E(1) is being invoked. Without such specification, proceedings will be hampered. Any opposing creditor would need to know which specific limb is being relied upon and prepare its arguments accordingly. Be that as it may, in the present proceedings, the Applicant eventually clarified in oral arguments that it is relying on sub-sections (<span class="font-italic">a</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of s 211E(1), that is priority as part of the expenses of winding up, or priority over all of the preferential and unsecured debts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Turning to the preliminary issue of standard of proof to be met by the Applicant to make out its case for super priority, the CA is silent on the required threshold. In my judgment, the court must be sufficiently satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is a basis for the matters raised in the affidavit to satisfy the requirements stipulated under the relevant provision in s 211E. It is not necessary to set a high threshold for the evidence. All that is required is that there is a minimum level of satisfaction. For that reason, it should be sufficient that there is credible evidence before the court. Any heavier burden would be too onerous at this stage of the proceedings. There must be something in the affidavit supporting the application which, on the face of it, supports what is being sought. Any contradiction or refutation contained in any response affidavit must be addressed in the reply affidavit or sufficiently neutralised in arguments. If the court retains a doubt on a balance of probabilities as to the applicant’s evidence, it is likely that the application for super priority status will fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Section 211E(1)(</span>a<span class="font-italic">)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Section 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) empowers the court to order, on the winding up of the company, that any rescue financing earlier obtained is to be treated as part of the costs and expenses of the winding up.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 As the Applicant points out, I recognise however that there are differences in the language of s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) in Singapore and the corresponding provision § 364(b) of Chapter 11 in the US. For this reason, the rule in <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re Johnson </span>cannot be directly applied. Instead, the broader point that the applicant should expend reasonable efforts to secure other types of financing (even though this is not a statutory requirement) is a useful yardstick to guide the court’s discretion to grant the application for super priority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Unlike s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (see [68] below), it is not a <span class="font-italic">condition</span> for super priority to be granted under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that financing would not have been available but for the grant of super priority. Thus, the court does not have to be <span class="font-italic">satisfied</span> when adjudicating an application under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) that the rescue financing would not be obtained but for the grant of super priority. However, to my mind, in most cases, this does not mean that the applicant need not show evidence of reasonable attempts at trying to do so. This view is justified in policy. Giving super priority disrupts the expected order of priority of the various creditors of the company. The grant of super priority should thus not ordinarily be resorted to and the courts would be slow to do so unless it is strictly necessary. Generally, it is only where there is some evidence that the company cannot otherwise get financing that it would be fair and reasonable to reorder the priorities on winding up, giving the rescue financier the ability to get ahead in the queue for assets. For this reason, even for an application under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the applicant should adduce some evidence of reasonable attempts at trying to secure financing on a normal basis, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, without any super priority, to move the court to exercise its discretion. To reiterate, this is not, however, a condition for the grant of super priority under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) but one of the factors to be considered when the court exercises its discretion on whether to grant the super priority. I should also note that this approach is consistent with the aforementioned position in the US.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In the present case, I decline to exercise my discretion to grant super priority under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). From the evidence disclosed, there is insufficient evidence of any efforts, let alone reasonable efforts, being expended by the Applicant to secure financing without any super priority. I substantiate below my reasons for finding as such at [72]–[73]. In the circumstances and in the absence of any other reasons cited by the Applicant that it would be fair and reasonable to grant super priority for the Subscriber’s financing, I am not at all convinced that the grant of super priority under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) is appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 For completeness, I should highlight the qualification in <span class="font-italic">In re Johnson</span> that there is no need to demonstrate availability of unsecured financing under § 364(b) of Chapter 11 where the “circumstances reasonably dictate that such efforts would be to no avail” (at 5).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 There have been several other US cases interpreting the same provision. In addition to the factors highlighted above, the following additional factors have been considered as relevant in US case law (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">In re Mid-State Raceway, </span><span class="font-italic">Inc and others</span> 323 BR 40 (Bankr, ND New York, 2005) (“<span class="font-italic">In re Mid-State Raceway</span>”) at 60):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the proposed credit transaction is necessary to preserve the assets of the estate, and is necessary, essential, and appropriate for the continued operation of the debtors’ businesses;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the terms of the financing agreement are fair, reasonable, and adequate in light of the circumstances of the debtor and the proposed lender; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the financing agreement was negotiated in good faith and at arm’s length between the debtor, on the one hand, and the agents and the proposed lender, on the other hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 These factors from the US cases are not expressly laid down in § 364(c) of Chapter 11 or for that matter under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>). Nonetheless, to my mind, they are relevant considerations for the court in the exercise of its discretion in adjudicating an application for super priority. Some of these factors will already be considered in Singapore under the statutory definition of “rescue financing”: see s 211E(9). In any event, in the present case, most of these factors are not directly relevant because the present application fails for non-satisfaction of the material condition of unavailability of financing without such super priority under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (see [69] below). It is therefore prudent for me to leave a closer consideration of these factors to a future case in Singapore where the issue specifically arises. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Turning to the present case, the Applicant fails to satisfy the material condition stated in s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>).

This is a condition for the grant of super priority. The local position is thus similar to the US where super priority can be granted under § 364(c) only where the debtor is “unable to obtain unsecured credit per [§ 364(b) of Chapter 11]”: see [65] above and <span class="font-italic">In re The Crouse Group, </span><span class="font-italic">Inc </span>71 BR 544 (Bankr, ED Pennsylvania, 1987) (“<span class="font-italic">The Crouse Group</span>”) at 549.

</div> Due to the difference in statutory language, what the reasonable efforts must be in respect of, should logically differ in Singapore but the broader idea remains that the applicant must expend reasonable efforts to source for less disruptive sources of financing, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, financing without the type of super priority sought.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In my judgment, in the context of s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), an applicant must demonstrate that <span class="font-italic">reasonable efforts</span> have been undertaken to explore other types of financing that did not entail such a priority, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, financing that did not entail priority over all preferential debts specified in the CA and all other unsecured debts.

It would be next to impossible for the court to determine whether other sources of funds were unavailable to the applicant unless the applicant adduces sufficient evidence that this was the case through evidence, for instance, of failed negotiations and attempts with other potential lenders. In view of the above, an applicant under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) needs to demonstrate that reasonable efforts were undertaken to secure financing without the type of super priority sought in order to demonstrate that it would not have been able to obtain the rescue financing “from any person” but for the super priority sought. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The undertaking of reasonable efforts does not however mean that the debtor must show that he had sought credit from “every possible source”: <span class="font-italic">In</span><span class="font-italic"> re Ames</span> at p 40.

</div> The idea remains that of reasonableness and this is a matter for the court’s assessment. The threshold of what constitutes reasonable efforts to demonstrate unavailability of funds can be discerned from several US cases. For instance, <span class="font-italic">In re Ames</span>, the court found that the burden was met where the debtors had approached four lending institutions with the capacity to loan the “large sums” needed by the debtors (at 40). In <span class="font-italic">In re Mid-State Raceway</span>, the court found that the debtor’s efforts, including conducting negotiations and discussions with various financial entities, constituted reasonable efforts (at 59). In stark contrast, in <span class="font-italic">The Crouse Group</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the court concluded that the burden was not met where the debtor had approached only one lending institution and never attempted to obtain financing from its existing creditors (at 550).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> In my view, this attempt is irrelevant for two reasons. First, this was not an effort by the Applicant to source for financing on a normal basis, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, without the type of super priority sought under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), since the Applicant extended the same terms of super priority to Phillip Asia as it did to the Subscriber. Even if it was an effort to obtain financing from Phillip Asia without any offer of super priority, there is a graver difficulty with its timing. Whilst the Applicant applied for super priority on 7 July 2017, the offer to Phillip Asia was only made on 3 August 2017. Before the application for super priority was taken out, the Applicant must have already attempted to search for other sources of financing and then come to the conclusion that it is left with little choice but to obtain rescue financing from the Subscriber on a super priority basis. It will make a mockery of the application process if the Applicant is allowed to adduce evidence of subsequent attempts to source for alternative financing after an application for super priority has already been made. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The Applicant cannot avoid the obligation to search for other sources of financing by merely asserting that such attempts would be futile due to its weak financial position and have the court believe that it was unable to obtain financing on other bases – even if such a belief is genuinely held, to satisfy the condition for the grant of super priority under s 211E(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>), the least the Applicant must do to convince the court that this condition is met is to adduce evidence that the Applicant expended reasonable efforts to source for less disruptive sources of financing. This is necessary because otherwise the court would have to play the role of a lender or investor and determine whether a reasonable lender or investor would have extended funds to the Applicant without such super priority. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The burden falls on the Applicant to make out the basis for the super priority status that it sought. For the above reasons, it has failed to do so and I accordingly dismiss its application in this regard. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Funds extended pursuant to a prior agreement </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 A tangential issue in the present case is whether “rescue financing” can be in the form of a proposed financing by an existing creditor with a present obligation to provide such financing. Such a creditor may take the position that its obligation to extend funds to the company no longer persists and is discharged because of a default of the company. It is, however, prepared to extend a further loan, or perhaps more accurately, ignore the default if it is given super priority in respect of the subsequent disbursed loans. It is not argued by Phillip Asia that the proposed financing from the Subscriber did not qualify as “rescue financing” because it arose from a prior obligation or agreement. However, as I had concerns about the propriety of such arrangements, I consider it briefly in this judgment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In principle, in order to come within the scope of “rescue financing” under s 211E(9), it is not necessary for the proposed financing to be entirely new; it can be additional financing from an existing creditor or it can even be premised on a prior obligation. What matters is whether that obligation persists: if the existing creditor is already bound to inject funds, then the provision of funds pursuant to that pre-existing obligation is not financing that should be accorded the protection and priority under s 211E. If, however, the injection of funds is at the option of the creditor, and its exercise of that option can be made contingent on its obtaining super priority status for these injected funds, then there is to my mind no reason why these funds could not, in appropriate cases, be conferred super priority under s 211E. This is consistent with the rationale expressed in Parliament that the laws on super priority are aimed at encouraging creditors to provide “additional financing” for troubled companies (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates</span>, <span class="font-italic">Official Report</span> (10 March 2017) vol 94 (Ms Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Finance)):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Rescue financing consists of <span class="font-italic">new loans</span> which provides working capital during the restructuring. Without rescue financing, a viable company may be unable to restructure, but lenders may be reluctant to provide <span class="font-italic">additional financing</span> to troubled companies.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 On the facts, the Applicant argues that the Subscriber is entitled to regard its obligations under the Subscription Agreement as terminated because of the Applicant’s failure to meet the condition precedent in the Subscription Agreement that there are no legal actions or proceedings against the Applicant. This failure excuses the Subscriber from dispensing further tranches of funds. This is also the position taken by the Subscriber in its letter dated 6 July 2017, addressed to the Applicant, where it notes that “an event of default has arisen”, thereby “giving us the right to terminate the Subscription Agreement forthwith by giving notice in writing to [the Applicant]”.

</div>
</div> I accept that it appears, from a perusal of the Subscription Agreement, that the Subscriber is not obliged to make further payments into the Applicant as a result of either the Applicant’s initiation of a scheme of arrangement (see cl 9.1(h) of the Subscription Agreement read with condition 12(k) of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes annexed to the Subscription Agreement) or the Suit brought by Phillip Asia against the Applicant (see cl 9.1(a) of the Subscription Agreement read with cl 8 of Schedule 2 to the Subscription Agreement).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 In the circumstances, any future extension of funds to the Applicant arising from the Subscriber’s continuation of the Subscription Agreement would be additional funding for the Applicant. Accordingly, notwithstanding the fact that the Subscriber is extending funds to the Applicant based on a prior agreement, this funding from the Subscriber constitutes “rescue financing” within the meaning of s 211E(9). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Indulgence to file supplementary affidavits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I close with an observation. On occasion, the courts have in restructuring applications allowed parties to file supplementary affidavits to make out their respective case. For instance, in the present case, the Applicant filed in total <span class="font-italic">six affidavits</span> from its Managing Director over a period of slightly more than two months. This is a matter of indulgence and should not be interpreted as a <span class="font-italic">right</span> that the parties have, which enable them to constantly supplement and add to their initial applications incrementally. Whether the court does so depends on all the circumstances, including the seriousness with which the initial application has been pursued, the gaps that remain to be filled, and the reasons why such gaps have arisen in the first place. Some pointers may be given in pre-trial conferences, but the onus always and ultimately lies on the applicant to make out its case, not on the courts to remedy any shortfall. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 For the foregoing reasons, I grant leave under s 210(1) for the Applicant to convene the creditors’ meeting to consider the Scheme as proposed. However, I decline to grant super priority status to the proposed financing from the Subscriber under s 211E.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 Directions on costs and any other specific orders will be given separately.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Aedit Abdullah <br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lawrence Lee Mun Kong (Aptus Law Corporation) <br/>for the Applicant;<br/>Leong Kah Wah and Lim Ruo Lin (Lin Ruolin) (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for Phillip Asia Pacific Opportunity Fund Ltd;<br/>Tee Su Mien (Rajah &amp; Tann Singapore LLP) for six individual creditors. </div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
