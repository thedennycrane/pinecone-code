        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This appeal arose from the judgment of the trial
                    judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Go Dante Yap v Bank
                        Austria Creditanstalt AG</em> [2010] 4 SLR 916 (“the
                    Judgment”), which concerned a dispute between the Appellant and the
                    Respondent regarding losses suffered on the Appellant’s investment
                    portfolio following the Asian financial crisis of 1997 (“the Asian
                    Financial Crisis”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Before the Judge, the Appellant advanced the
                    following two claims:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that 16 investments, entered into by the
                            Respondent in his name, with his own funds as well as with funds loaned
                            to him by the Respondent, were not authorised by him (the
                            “Authorisation Claim”); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">that the Respondent owed him, and breached,
                            contractual and tortious duties which obliged it to advise him whether
                            to make, hold or dispose of the investments that were to be made by the
                            Respondent on his behalf, which breach caused him to suffer losses in
                            relation to three of the 16 investments (the “Advisory
                            Claim”).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Judge dismissed both the Appellant’s
                    claims. On the Authorisation Claim, he found against the Appellant on the facts,
                    preferring the Respondent’s evidence, notwithstanding that it was of a
                    less than ideal quality. On the Advisory Claim, the Judge followed authorities
                    in England and Singapore and held that, on the facts, there was no contractual
                    or tortious duty on the Respondent to give investment advice to the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant appealed against both these
                    holdings. On the Authorisation Claim, the Appellant argued that the Judge should
                    have preferred his evidence over the Respondent’s, and/or that the Judge
                    should have drawn an adverse inference against the Respondent in view of the
                    poor quality of the latter’s evidence. On the Advisory Claim, the
                    Appellant argued that, although the Judge correctly appreciated the legal
                    principles involved, he had misapplied them to the facts of the
                case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the oral hearing before us, counsel for the
                    Appellant conceded that the appeal on the Authorisation Claim faced considerable
                    difficulties, and he stated that, although he was prepared to argue the point,
                    he preferred to focus his submissions on the Advisory Claim. Counsel was quite
                    right to do so for, as we indicated at the hearing, the Authorisation Claim was
                    hopeless in light of the Judge’s clear finding of fact that the Appellant
                    had not proven that the 16 investments were unauthorised. As we did not
                    think that the Judge’s finding in this regard could be said to have been
                    against the weight of the evidence, there was little point in pursuing the
                    appeal on that basis, and the main focus of the appeal was accordingly on the
                    Advisory Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed
                    the appeal and awarded 90% of the costs of the appeal to the Respondent. Given
                    our dismissal of the appeal in relation to the Authorisation Claim (for the same
                    reasons expressed by the Judge), what follows is an explanation of our decision
                    on the Advisory Claim, as we did not entirely agree with the Judge’s
                    reasoning in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellant was a businessman and national of
                    the Philippines, while the Respondent was an Austrian-incorporated bank which,
                    at the material times, operated branches in Hong Kong and Singapore. In early
                    1997, the Appellant was recommended the services of one Winnifred Natasha Tong
                    Ching Laude (“Ms Ching”), a vice-president of the
                    Respondent’s Hong Kong branch, and met with her for the purpose of opening
                    an account with the Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Account opening</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 3 June 1997, the Appellant opened two
                    accounts with the Respondent: a savings account with the Hong Kong branch (the
                    “Hong Kong account”) and an investment account with the Singapore
                    branch (the “Singapore account”), with Ms Ching handling both
                    accounts. Both accounts required the Appellant to execute the following
                    contractual agreements (collectively, the “Account-opening
                    Documents”):</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Account Opening and Custodian Agreement
                            (“AOCA”) for the Singapore account;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the AOCA for the Hong Kong
                        account;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Discretionary Investment Management Agreement
                            (“DIMA”) for the Singapore account;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the DIMA for the Hong Kong
                        account;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(e)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Investment Authority Instructions
                            (“IAI”) for the Singapore account; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(f)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the IAI for the Hong Kong account.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Both sets of AOCAs were in identical terms, as were both sets of DIMAs
                    and IAIs, and therefore each pair of identical documents will be referred to as
                    the “AOCA”, “DIMA” and “IAI”,
                    respectively. The DIMA conferred on the Respondent the power and discretion to
                    trade in securities on behalf of the Appellant using his account, without the
                    need for his specific authorisation. However, the Appellant desired to limit the
                    discretion that the DIMA conferred on the Respondent, and, to that end, executed
                    the IAI, under which it was agreed that, notwithstanding the terms of the DIMA,
                    the Respondent was not authorised to make any investment or sell any securities
                    for the Singapore or Hong Kong account without the Appellant’s
                    instructions. In other words, the Appellant was to have the final say in
                    deciding what securities to purchase or sell.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In addition, the Appellant also executed a loan
                    facility letter (“the Loan Facility”) under which the Respondent,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, agreed to furnish the Appellant
                    with a loan of up to US$5 million.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The investments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     From June to November 1997, the Appellant
                    remitted approximately US$5 million into the Singapore account. From July
                    to October 1997, 16 investments, which comprised mainly emerging market
                    debt instruments, were entered into by Ms Ching under the Appellant’s
                    Singapore account, partly or wholly financed by loans from the Respondent to the
                    Appellant’s Hong Kong account, pursuant to the Loan
                Facility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The monthly meetings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     From August to November 1997 (<em>ie</em>, throughout the period Ms Ching was entering
                    into the 16 investments), the Appellant and Ms Ching had monthly
                    meetings, where Ms Ching would show the Appellant the portfolio, currency
                    and money market analyses from the previous month’s transactions.
                    According to Ms Ching, the Appellant would go through and discuss these
                    documents with her, in order to review the performance of the Appellant’s
                    investments, which included examining the projected returns from these
                    investments.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">These proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     From September 1997 onwards, most of the
                    securities comprising the 16 investments were either sold before maturity
                    or redeemed upon maturity, while two securities were transferred by the
                    Appellant to a different bank account with the Respondent. Consequently, only
                    three of the 16 investments remained in the Singapore account by August
                    1998, on which the Appellant had suffered significant losses as a result of the
                    effects of the Asian Financial Crisis, and it was these securities which formed
                    the subject matter of the Advisory Claim:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Bakrie International Finance FRN;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Bakrie Brothers 1-year PN; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Rossiyskiy Kredit 10.25% Interest
                            Notes.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">The first two securities will be referred to collectively as the
                    “Bakrie bonds”, while the third will be referred to as the
                    “Rossiyskiy notes”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     From June to November 1999, there was an
                    exchange of correspondence between the parties, in which the Appellant expressed
                    unhappiness over the state of his investments (including complaints that certain
                    investments were unauthorised), eventually culminating in the Appellant
                    threatening legal action against the Respondent over its alleged
                    “mishandling” of his investment accounts. The Appellant
                    subsequently made good on his threat and commenced the present
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Judgment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In the Judgment, the Judge made the following
                    significant findings of fact:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Appellant had not proven that the
                            16 investments were unauthorised (see [68]–[75] of the
                            Judgment);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the 16 investments must therefore have been
                            authorised (see [76] of the Judgment);</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the Appellant could easily understand the nature
                            of the 16 investments and understood the types of risks involved,
                            had sufficient knowledge of investment principles, and was therefore not
                            an inexperienced and unsophisticated client who had to rely entirely on
                            the Respondent for investment advice (see [91]–[94] of the
                            Judgment); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Ms Ching provided recommendations of
                            investments to the Appellant the monthly meetings (see [100] and [109]
                            of the Judgment).</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In dealing with the Advisory Claim, the Judge
                    also considered a number of recent English and Singapore authorities, <em>viz</em>:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">After elaborating the principles to be distilled from these cases (with
                    which, on appeal, the Appellant did not quarrel), the Judge applied them to the
                    facts and held that the Respondent did not owe any contractual or tortious duty
                    to advise the Appellant as to his investments (see [107] and [111] of the
                    Judgment). It was therefore with the application of those principles to the
                    facts of this case that the Appellant took issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above, the only issue before us was whether the Judge was
                    correct in his reasoning and conclusion on the Advisory Claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Preliminary observations on contractual and tortious duties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As a preliminary point, we should note that,
                    although the Appellant did not dispute the applicable principles in this case,
                    we were of the view that there was some misconception as to what those
                    principles actually entailed, and that such misconception needed to be
                    clarified.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In dealing with the Advisory Claim, both
                    parties did not differentiate between the contractual and tortious duties which
                    the Respondent was alleged to have owed to the Appellant, presumably because
                    they regarded them as being completely co-extensive. The Judge approached the
                    Advisory Claim in a similar fashion (see [90] of the Judgment). However,
                    conflating contractual and tortious duties in this manner was apt to mislead,
                    and we considered it more helpful to approach the contractual and tortious
                    duties separately. In fact, it became apparent that the very phrase
                    “Advisory Claim” was something of a misnomer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The reason for this lay in the fact that
                    contractual and tortious duties differ in their nature (see to similar effect
                    the recent English Court of Appeal decision of <em>James Andrew
                        Robinson v P E Jones (Contractors) Limited</em> [2011] EWCA
                    Civ 9 (“<em>Robinson v Jones</em>”) at [76]
                        (<em>per</em> Jackson LJ)). Contractual duties
                    find their genesis in the express or implied agreement of the contracting
                    parties, and they may therefore be as narrow or specific as the parties desire.
                    Therefore, there is nothing wrong with the concept of an express or implied
                    “contractual duty to advise”. A duty of care in the tort of
                    negligence, however, is in general imposed by law upon the tortfeasor, and as a
                    result it is necessarily a broad duty to take such care as is reasonable in the
                    circumstances. Hence, it is not, strictly speaking, correct to speak of a
                    “tortious duty to advise” without more and, in particular, without
                    reference to any related contractual obligation (see by analogy the House of
                    Lords decision of <em>A C Billings &amp; Sons
                        Ltd v Riden</em> [1958] 1 AC 240 at 264 (<em>per</em> Lord Somervell of Harrow)). If there could be a
                    “tortious duty to advise”, there would be no logical limit to how
                    far a duty of care in the tort of negligence could be subdivided: the courts
                    would be flooded with claims of specific “tortious duties” to
                    answer telephone calls, respond to emails, read the newspapers or the like (see
                    for instance the House of Lords decision of <em>Qualcast
                        (Wolverhampton) Ltd v Haynes</em> [1959] 1 AC 743). Of course, it
                    could well be a <em>breach</em> of a tortious duty of care
                    (if one was owed) for someone not to give advice in certain circumstances, but
                    that is not the same as saying that there was a tortious duty to give advice. As
                    the author of T Weir, <em>A Casebook on Tort</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2004) put it (at p 129),
                    “[m]atters of detail are best treated as part of the question of breach,
                    not as raising sub-duties with a specific content” (see also J Murphy,
                        <em>Street on Torts</em> (Oxford University Press,
                    12th Ed, 2007) at pp 114-115). To frame a duty of care in the tort of
                    negligence as narrowly as a specific contractual obligation (as in the case of a
                    “tortious duty to advise”) would render the question of breach
                    nugatory, for the tortfeasor would then be under a duty to do precisely that
                    which he has been accused of not doing (<em>eg</em>, give
                    advice), and there would be no room for the court to inquire whether it was in
                    fact <em>reasonable</em> for him not to have done it
                    – an indispensable element of the tort of negligence – with the
                    result that, to quote a learned commentator (see D Howarth, “Many
                    Duties of Care – Or A Duty of Care? Notes from the Underground”
                    (2006) 26 OJLS 449 at p 466), “[t]he concept of fault would
                    disappear” (see too, by the same author, “Negligence after
                        <em>Murphy</em>: Time to Re-Think” [1991] CLJ 58
                    at p 72). Consequently, “[t]here is no reason why the law of tort
                    should impose duties which are identical to the obligations negotiated by the
                    parties” (see <em>Robinson v Jones</em> at [79]
                        (<em>per</em> Jackson LJ)), in so far as the
                    content of those contractual obligations is of a <em>different
                        scope</em> from a tortious duty of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Where, however, the parties have expressly or
                    impliedly negotiated an obligation on one of them to exercise care and skill in
                    the exercise of his rights or duties under the contract, it is entirely possible
                    that an identical duty of care could exist in the tort of negligence, as was
                    accepted by the House of Lords in the leading decision of <em>Henderson and others v Merrett Syndicates Ltd and others</em> [1995]
                    2 AC 145 (“<em>Henderson v
                    Merrett</em>”) (see especially the speech of Lord Goff of
                    Chieveley at 194–195). In other words, where a contract imposes a
                    contractual duty of care on one of the parties, that may be said to be “a
                    case where the relationship of proximity arises by virtue of the contract and
                    the work to be performed under it” (see <em>Bryan v
                        Maloney</em> (1995) 128 ALR 163 at 169 (<em>per</em> Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ)), which would in
                    general give rise to a corresponding duty of care in the tort of negligence in
                    the absence of any policy considerations militating against such a duty. In
                    apparent contrast to these views, however, Stanley Burnton LJ in <em>Robinson v Jones</em> at [94] stated that “[i]t is
                    important to note that a person who assumes a contractual duty of care does not
                    thereby assume an identical duty of care in tort to the other contracting
                    party.” We agree that a contractual duty of care does not <em>automatically</em> mean that there is a duty of care in the
                    tort of negligence, since it is always possible that, for example, the contract
                    might contain an express clause excluding a tortious duty of care (as was the
                    case in <em>Robinson v Jones</em> itself and in almost all
                    the cases relied on by the Judge), or that the contractual framework may be so
                    structured as to demonstrate that the parties intended thereby to exclude the
                    imposition of a tortious duty of care (see <em>Animal Concerns
                        Research &amp; Education Society v Tan Boon Kwee</em> [2011]
                    2 SLR 146 at [71]), but we do not concur with the implication contained in
                    Stanley Burnton LJ’s statement that the existence of a contractual
                    duty of care is always insufficient on its own to give rise to a tortious duty
                    of care, all other things being equal (see <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In addition to a contractual duty to advise,
                    therefore, it was also necessary to enquire whether there was, in this case, an
                    express or implied contractual duty of skill and care on the part of the
                    Respondent in discharging the instructions of the Appellant.</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Contractual duty to advise</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The Appellant contended (at para 62 of
                    the Appellant’s case) that the contractual framework between the parties
                    imposed on the Respondent a wide-ranging duty of:</p>

                            investments, as well as the risks involved with each investment selected

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     It was fair to say, as the Judge did (at [95]
                    of the Judgment), that the Account-opening Documents certainly did <em>not</em> contain any <em>express</em>
                    terms providing for such a detailed duty to advise. The Judge also rejected the
                    contention that the Respondent was under an <em>implied</em> contractual duty to advise the Appellant, and with this
                    conclusion we agreed entirely. The very specificity with which the Appellant
                    characterised the duty to advise, and the onerous obligations such a duty would
                    have imposed on the Respondent, made it highly implausible that this was the
                    presumed intention of the parties or that such a term was either necessary to
                    give business efficacy to the parties’ contractual relationship or was so
                    obvious that it went without saying (see the decision of this court in <em>Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd and others</em>
                    [2009] 3 SLR(R) 518 at [36], [80]
                    and [81]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Contractual duty of skill and care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The absence of an express or implied
                    contractual duty to <em>advise</em> the Appellant did not
                    mean, however, that the Respondent did not owe a contractual duty of <em>skill and care</em> to the Appellant under the
                    Account-opening Documents. In contracts under which a skilled or professional
                    person agrees to render certain services to his client in return for a specified
                    or reasonable fee, there is at common law an implied term in law that he will
                    exercise reasonable skill and care in rendering those services (see the House of
                    Lords decision of <em>Lister v Romford Ice and Cold Storage Co
                        Ltd</em> [1957] AC 555 at 572-573 (<em>per</em>
                    Viscount Simonds) and <em>Jackson &amp; Powell on Professional
                        Liability</em> (J L Powell and R Stewart gen eds)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2007) (“<em>Jackson &amp; Powell</em>”) at para 2-007), and, in
                    relation to banks specifically, it is trite law that a bank in carrying out the
                    instructions of its customer is under an implied contractual duty to exercise
                    skill and care (see the decision of this court in <em>Bank of
                        America National Trust and Savings Association v Herman Iskandar and
                        another</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 848 at [45]), albeit such a duty has usually been considered in the
                    context of whether the bank was put on notice that its customer was being
                    defrauded (see, for example, the decision of this court in <em>Yogambikai Nagarajah v Indian Overseas Bank</em> [1996] 2 SLR(R)
                    774 and the English High Court decision of <em>Selangor United
                        Rubber Estates Ltd v Cradock and others (No 3)</em> [1968]
                    1 WLR 1555).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Consequently, we considered that there was
                    ample authority from which to conclude that the Respondent owed the Appellant an
                    implied contractual duty of care in carrying out his instructions under the
                    Account-opening Documents. It should be said that the Judge did not expressly
                    deal with this point, but, to the extent that the Judgment suggested otherwise,
                    we were unable to agree.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tortious duty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     As to whether the Respondent owed the
                    Appellant a duty of care in the tort of negligence, we also disagreed with the
                    Judge’s conclusion that no duty of care had arisen. It was here that the
                    parties’ failure to articulate clearly the nature of a duty of care in the
                    tort of negligence was most keenly felt, for the Judge’s refusal to impose
                    a tortious duty on the Respondent would likely have been influenced by the
                    undesirability of requiring private banks to continuously give advice to their
                    clients on each and every one of the client’s investments throughout the
                    lifespan (no matter how long) of those investments, in the manner contended for
                    by the Appellant (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>
                above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     However, as we have noted at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above, the correct question was not whether
                    the Respondent owed the Appellant a tortious duty to advise, but whether the
                    Respondent owed the Appellant a tortious duty to take reasonable care in
                    rendering services to him and following his instructions, and, if so, whether it
                    had breached that duty by failing to give the advice which the Appellant alleged
                    should have been given in circumstances where any reasonable bank in the
                    Respondent’s position would have given that advice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In <em>Spandeck Engineering (S)
                        Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp; Technology Agency</em> [2007]
                    4 SLR(R) 100 (“<em>Spandeck</em>”), this
                    court laid down a single test to determine the imposition of a duty of care in
                    all claims arising out of negligence in the context of pure economic loss
                    (“the <em>Spandeck</em> test”), and rejected
                    the English approach of a general exclusionary rule against the recovery of pure
                    economic loss (which, incidentally, appeared to have influenced Stanley
                    Brunton LJ’s view in <em>Robinson v Jones</em>
                    at [94] that a contractual duty of care did not give rise to a tortious duty of
                    care (see <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above)). That the losses
                    suffered by the Appellant in this case were purely economic was therefore a
                    relevant, but not overriding, consideration. In addition, the <em>Spandeck</em> test was held to be a two-stage test comprising first,
                    proximity, and second, policy considerations, which were together preceded by
                    the threshold question of factual foreseeability. This court also made clear
                    that the <em>Spandeck</em> test was to be applied
                    incrementally with reference to analogous cases.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     We noted that, in the Judgment, the Judge did
                    not apply the <em>Spandeck</em> test in order to arrive at
                    his conclusion that no duty of care in the tort of negligence was owed by the
                    Respondent to the Appellant, but, instead, adopted and applied several
                    “‘lower level’ factors” formulated by Gloster J
                    in <em>Springwell</em> (see below at <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> as well as the Judgment at [80]). While this
                    was not necessarily incorrect insofar as these factors could ultimately be
                    placed within the framework of the <em>Spandeck</em> test
                    (and indeed we will refer to them later in these grounds), we believed that
                    applying the <em>Spandeck</em> test would have allowed
                    these factors to be seen in their proper perspective, thereby yielding a
                    different answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Factual foreseeability</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It was clearly foreseeable that, on the facts
                    of this case, if the Respondent did not exercise due care in the discharge of
                    its role under the Account-opening Documents, the Appellant would suffer loss,
                    and we did not understand counsel for the Respondent to have been arguing to the
                    contrary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Proximity</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Our view on proximity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     As for whether there was sufficient proximity
                    between the parties, within the meaning of the first stage of the <em>Spandeck</em> test, we were of the opinion that there clearly
                    was such proximity, and that this was well supported by the relevant
                    authorities. In <em>Spandeck</em> (at [78]), this court
                    endorsed the views expressed by Deane J in the High Court of Australia
                    decision of <em>Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman</em>
                    (1985) 60 ALR 1 at 55 to the effect that proximity might reflect:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… an assumption by one party of a responsibility to take care to
                        avoid or prevent injury, loss or damage to the person or property of another
                        or reliance by one party upon such care being taken by the other in
                        circumstances where the other party knew or ought to have known of that
                        reliance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     This concept of an “assumption of
                    responsibility” as the basis of a sufficiently proximate relationship so
                    as to give rise to a duty of care in the tort of negligence derived from the
                    seminal decision of <em>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp;
                        Partners Ltd</em> [1964] 1 AC 465 (“<em>Hedley Byrne</em>”), where the various members of the House of
                    Lords formulated the applicable principle in a number of ways, but that which
                    attracted the greatest support was Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest’s
                    statement (with which Lord Hodson (at 514) expressly agreed and
                    Lord Devlin (at 530) was prepared to agree) at 503 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… if in a sphere in which a person is so placed that others could
                        reasonably rely upon his judgment or his skill or upon his ability to make
                        careful inquiry, a person takes it upon himself to give information or
                        advice to … another person who, as he knows or should know, will
                        place reliance upon it, then a duty of care will arise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Hedley Byrne</em> at 530, after remarking
                    that his Lordship was prepared to endorse such a formulation, Lord Devlin
                    stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Such a relationship may be either general or particular. Examples of a
                        general relationship are those of solicitor and client and of <em>banker and customer</em> …
                        <em>Where there is a general relationship of this sort, it is
                            unnecessary to do more than prove its existence and the duty
                            follows</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     
          <em>Hedley Byrne</em> was
                    unanimously approved by the House of Lords in <em>Henderson v
                        Merrett</em>, where one of the issues was whether, in addition to the
                    admitted contractual duty of skill and care that was owed by Lloyd’s
                    managing agents to members (“Names”) of the underwriting syndicate
                    managed by the managing agents (“direct Names”), a duty of care in
                    the tort of negligence was also owed by the managing agents to the direct Names.
                    Lord Goff, with whom all of their Lordships agreed, stated (at 180)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[The principle laid down in <em>Hedley Byrne</em>]
                        rests upon a relationship between the parties, which may be general or
                        specific to the particular transaction, and which <em>may or
                            may not be contractual in nature</em> … In particular
                        … where the plaintiff entrusts the defendant with the conduct of his
                        affairs, in general or in particular, he may be held to have relied on the
                        defendant to exercise due skill and care in such conduct. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Goff applied the <em>Hedley Byrne</em>
                    principle to the relationship between the direct Names and the managing agents
                    to find a tortious duty of care, and concluded (at 182) that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For my part I can see no reason why a duty of care should
                        not … be owed by managing agents at Lloyd’s to a Name who
                        is a member of a syndicate under the management of the agents [<em>ie</em>, a direct Name]. Indeed … the relationship
                        between Name and managing agent appears to provide a classic example of the
                        type of relationship to which the principle in <em>Hedley
                            Byrne</em> applies. In so saying, I put on one side the question
                        of the impact, if any, upon the relationship of the contractual context in
                        which it is set. But, that apart, there is in my opinion plainly an
                        assumption of responsibility in the relevant sense by the managing agents
                        towards the Names in their syndicates. The managing agents have accepted the
                        Names as members of a syndicate under their management. They obviously hold
                        themselves out as possessing a special expertise to advise the Names on the
                        suitability of risks to be underwritten; and on the circumstances in which,
                        and the extent to which, reinsurance should be taken out and claims should
                        be settled. The Names, as the managing agents well knew, placed implicit
                        reliance on that expertise, in that they gave authority to the managing
                        agents to bind them to contracts of insurance and reinsurance and to the
                        settlement of claims. I can see no escape from the conclusion that, in these
                        circumstances, prima facie a duty of care is owed in tort by the managing
                        agents of such Names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     As we alluded at <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> above, the implied contractual duty of skill and care owed
                    by the Respondent to the Appellant under the Account-opening Documents was
                    sufficient to create the necessary proximity required by a duty of care in tort.
                    Indeed, it was difficult to imagine a clearer example of “an assumption
                    by one party of a responsibility to take care to avoid or prevent injury, loss
                    or damage” to another party (see <a href="#p1_31">[31]</a>
                    above) than a contractual duty to exercise care and skill, and it was plain that
                    Lord Goff had just such a possibility in mind in <em>Henderson v Merrett</em> (at 180 (see <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above) and 187), a conclusion which was also reached by
                    Lord Devlin with specific reference to banks and their customers in
                        <em>Hedley Byrne</em> (see <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However, even leaving aside the contractual
                    framework established by the Account-opening Documents, by analogy with
                    Lord Goff’s reasoning, there was unmistakeably an assumption of
                    responsibility in the relevant sense by the Respondent towards the Appellant.
                    The Respondent accepted the Appellant as someone whose money and assets were
                    under its control, and on whose behalf it could and was expected to expend
                    considerable sums in order to acquire various investments. It could hardly be
                    denied that the Respondent, in offering private banking and wealth-management
                    facilities, held itself out as possessing special skill or expertise (a concept
                    that was to be understood broadly (see <em>Henderson v
                        Merrett</em> at 180)) to manage investments and transact in emerging
                    market securities, or to search for and recommend such investments (which
                    Ms Ching in fact did (see [100] of the Judgment)). The Appellant, as
                    Ms Ching well knew, placed implicit reliance upon that expertise, in that
                    he gave her (and therefore the Respondent) authority to bind him to purchases of
                    the Bakrie bonds and the Rossiyskiy notes, as well as other securities. Given
                    that Ms Ching was so placed that the Appellant could reasonably rely upon
                    her judgment, skill or her ability to make careful inquiry, and given also that
                    she was actively giving information or advice to the Appellant (in the form of
                    recommending suitable investments to him and, by her own evidence, advising him
                    of the pros and cons of those investments), who, as she should have known, would
                    place reliance on her judgment, skill and ability to take care (see
                    Lord Morris’s statement of principle at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above), it was difficult to resist the conclusion that, in
                    line with <em>Hedley Byrne</em> and <em>Henderson v Merrett</em>, there was sufficient proximity between the
                    parties to give rise to a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care
                    in the tort of negligence on the part of the Respondent. The point was
                    reinforced in <em>Jackson &amp; Powell</em>, where it was
                    stated at para 15-032 (albeit without any authority being cited) that
                    “[a] financial practitioner will <em>generally</em>
                    owe a duty of care in tort to his client quite apart from any contract that
                    exists between them” [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The Judge’s views</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     As we stated at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above, the Judge adopted a somewhat different approach to
                    the question of the Respondent’s tortious duty of care in the court below,
                    relying on a number of “‘lower level’ factors”
                    articulated by Gloster J in <em>Springwell</em>, in
                    which the learned judge took the cue from Lord Hoffman in <em>Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc</em>
                    [2007] 1 AC 181 at [36] to develop
                    “lower-level principles which could be more useful than the high
                    abstractions commonly used in … debates [concerning the question of
                    whether a duty of care existed]”. The relevant “‘lower
                    level’ factors” adopted by the Judge from <em>Springwell</em> (at [52])
                    were as follows (see [90] of the Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     the extent of the Appellant’s
                        financial experience and sophistication;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     the contractual context;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_c"></a>(c)     the actual role played by
                        Ms Ching; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_d"></a>(d)     the extent of the Appellant’s reliance on
                    Ms Ching.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We gave consideration to these factors in so
                    far as they affected the proximity between the parties for the purposes of the
                        <em>Spandeck</em> test, and our conclusions were as
                    follows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     We had no reason to disagree with the
                    Judge’s assessment (at [94] of the Judgment) that the Appellant was not an
                    inexperienced and unsophisticated client who had to rely entirely on the
                    Respondent for advice relating to the management of his investment portfolio.
                    However, the real question was not whether he was relying on the Respondent for
                    advice, but whether he was relying on the Respondent to take such care as was
                    reasonable in the circumstances. In addition, we were of the view that the
                    commercial experience of the Appellant was more relevant to the question of the
                    standard of care (<em>ie</em>, whether the Respondent had
                    breached its duty of care (see <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> below)),
                    than to the existence of the duty of care itself. After all, it was difficult to
                    see why, taking a simple illustration, a doctor would not owe his patient a duty
                    to take care in treating him simply because his patient was also a
                    doctor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As for the contractual context, there were two
                    matters to be considered: first, the execution by the Appellant of the IAI, and
                    second, the Judge’s reliance on the various cases cited at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a> above. It was true that the IAI represented a
                    significant curtailment of the Respondent’s discretionary power to manage
                    and apply the assets of the Appellant, in that his final approval was always
                    needed. That surely did not mean, however, that the Respondent was not assuming
                    a responsibility to exercise skill and care, or that the Appellant was not
                    relying on such skill and care being exercised, within the limits of the
                    Respondent’s reduced mandate. As for the cases relied on by the Judge, it
                    was drawn to his attention that the respective banking relationships in those
                    cases were governed by express terms and disclaimers that negated the existence
                    of a tortious duty of care (see [105] of the Judgment), but the Judge was not
                    persuaded that this difference was critical (see [106] of the Judgment). With
                    respect, we begged to differ. It was clear from the actual decision in <em>Hedley Byrne</em> itself that an express disclaimer of
                    responsibility could prevent a tortious duty of care from arising, by negating
                    the proximity sought to be established by the concept of an “assumption
                    of responsibility”. Where such a disclaimer takes the form of a
                    contractual exclusion clause, such a term would now be subject to the Unfair
                    Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed) (“UCTA”) (see the House
                    of Lords decision of <em>Smith v Eric S Bush</em> [1990]
                    1 AC 831), but the general principle is still the same. In <em>Goldman Sachs</em>, <em>Springwell</em>
                    and <em>Titan Steel</em>, the material terms of the
                    contracts governing the banking relationship were highly detailed and, as was
                    accepted by the respective judges deciding those cases, the relevant terms made
                    it abundantly clear that the banks were not accepting or assuming any
                    responsibility to take care, and/or that the client was not relying on such care
                    being taken. In such circumstances, it was inevitable that no duty of care in
                    tort was found to be owed by the banks in those cases. In contrast, the
                    Account-opening Documents in this case were disorganised and somewhat
                    inadequately drafted, and did not unequivocally demonstrate an understanding
                    between the parties that the Respondent was not prepared to be responsible or
                    careful in the provision of any information, advice or service it furnished to
                    the Appellant. Certainly, as we have stated earlier in this paragraph, the IAI
                    was not sufficient to achieve that effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In so far as the last two factors (see
                        <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above) were concerned, the Judge
                    held that, although Ms Ching had provided recommendations of investments to
                    the Appellant at monthly meetings, the Appellant had conceded during
                    cross-examination that he had not relied on Ms Ching’s
                    recommendations, and that this was fatal to the existence of a duty of care in
                    negligence. We would stress again that the requisite assumption of
                    responsibility and reliance under the <em>Hedley Byrne</em>
                    principle is an assumption of responsibility by the tortfeasor to <em>take care</em> in the giving of information or advice or the
                    performance of a service, and reliance by the plaintiff on such care being taken
                    (see the statements of Lord Morris and Lord Goff cited at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> and <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>
                    above, and the judgment of Lord Reid at 486 of <em>Hedley
                        Byrne</em>), and not, as the Judge seemed to have thought, an
                    assumption of responsibility by the tortfeasor to do specific acts (<em>viz</em>, the giving of investment advice) and reliance by
                    the plaintiff on those acts (see [109] and [110] of the Judgment). That is of
                    course consistent with what we have already said in relation to the nature of a
                    duty of care in the tort of negligence (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Policy considerations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Having decided, therefore, that a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care was owed in tort by the
                    Respondent to the Appellant, the second stage of the <em>Spandeck</em> test required a determination of whether that duty was
                    negated by policy considerations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Our view was that there were no such policy
                    considerations militating against the imposition of a duty of care in the tort
                    of negligence on a private bank that was concurrent and co-extensive with the
                    implied contractual duty of care and skill owed to its customers. <em>Ex hypothesi</em>, if the law has seen fit to imply a
                    contractual duty of care into the banker-customer relationship, a tortious duty
                    of care with the same scope and content was unlikely to run afoul of policy
                    considerations such as consistency with any existing statutory or regulatory
                    framework, the avoidance of indeterminate liability and undue interference with
                    market activity. As observed in Justice W P M Zeeman,
                    “Contributory Negligence – A Defence Limited to Actions in
                    Tort?” (1994) 2 Tort LR 16 (at p 17), it was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… difficult to imagine a case where there is implied into a
                        contract a term whereby a party to the contract is required to act without
                        negligence where there is not created a corresponding duty of care
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the issue of duty of care</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     For the foregoing reasons, therefore, we
                    considered that the Respondent did owe the Appellant a duty of care in contract
                    and in tort.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The Asian Financial Crisis and the recent
                    global financial crisis have demonstrated that imprudent behaviour on the part
                    of financial institutions can have disastrous consequences not just for
                    individual customers, but for the economy as a whole. The Respondent’s
                    position on when banks would owe their customers a duty of care, to the effect
                    that such a duty was a highly exceptional one, seemed rather anomalous when
                    viewed against that background.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In our view, it was always open to banks and
                    other providers of financial services to exclude or limit their duty of care via
                    disclaimers or exclusion clauses, subject of course to the controls of the UCTA
                    and/or the common law. The absence of such measures, coupled with the factual
                    circumstances of this case, led us to the conclusion that a duty of care was
                    owed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Breach of duty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Our conclusion that the Respondent owed a duty
                    of care to the Appellant in contract and in tort, however, was not the end of
                    the analysis. It was still necessary to decide whether, on the facts, such a
                    duty had been breached by the Respondent, because it did not provide information
                    to and/or advise the Appellant to the extent he alleged that it should have (see
                        <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     It was trite that the Respondent was required
                    to exercise “reasonable skill and care”, but the exact standard of
                    care in this case was informed by a number of matters, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     the prevailing circumstances and the
                        danger of hindsight;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     the experience and sophistication of the Appellant;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_c"></a>(c)     the contractual
                        framework.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The prevailing circumstances and hindsight</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     It had to be borne in mind that the situation
                    in which the parties found themselves in mid-1997 was one of extreme economic
                    turbulence and turmoil. Many of the world’s best financial minds were
                    caught unawares by the speed with which the Asian Financial Crisis unfolded, and
                    the extent of damage which was to follow. As global financial markets are by
                    their very nature volatile, speculative and unpredictable, it seemed to us that
                    the law ought not to make excessive demands of the level of competence and care
                    to be expected of a private bank in the position of the Respondent (see, for
                    example, the New South Wales decision of <em>Lloyd v Citicorp
                        Australia Ltd and another</em> (1986) 11 NSWLR 286
                        (“<em>Lloyd v Citicorp</em>”) at
                    287-288), especially during the height of the Asian Financial Crisis. In this
                    respect, it was also useful to recall the words of Denning LJ in the
                    English Court of Appeal decision of <em>Roe v Minister of Health
                        and another</em> [1954] 2 WLR 915 at 923–924, cautioning
                    against the use of hindsight in assessing whether an alleged tortfeasor has been
                    negligent, since it was easy to be wise after the event; and the chaotic events
                    of 1997 should not (adopting the language of the learned judge) be viewed
                    dispassionately with 2011 spectacles, with the effect of imposing an
                    artificially high standard of care in an area of conduct where risks and gambles
                    were expected to be taken on a daily basis. As has been aptly observed in
                        <em>Jackson &amp; Powell</em> at
                    para 2-001:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Traditionally, the professions operate in spheres where success cannot be
                        achieved in every case. Very often success or failure depends upon factors
                        beyond the professional person’s control ... Even where the critical
                        factors are within the professional person’s control, he still cannot
                        guarantee success. In matters of fine judgment or great complexity no human
                        being can be right every time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The Appellant’s experience</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As the Judge found (see [91]–[94] of the
                    Judgment), the Appellant was commercially savvy and had sufficient knowledge of
                    investment principles to understand the types of risk involved. Again, this fact
                    would have served to lower the standard of care to be expected of the Respondent
                    in <em>this</em> particular case (see <em>Lloyd v Citicorp</em> at 288-289), for it would have been entitled to
                    assume that the Appellant could rely on his own judgment and sources of
                    information, without requiring constant updates and advice from
                    Ms Ching.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The contractual framework</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Indeed, given the existence of the IAI, it was
                    clear that the parties had contracted on the basis that the Appellant was to
                    maintain a significant degree of control over his accounts and investment
                    portfolio, and while this contractual arrangement might not have been sufficient
                    to displace the duty of care owed by the Respondent (see <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above), it did mean that standard of care
                    placed on the Respondent was less onerous than it might otherwise have
                    been.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     It was also noteworthy that cl 6 of the
                    DIMA provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">6.   Liability of the [Respondent]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">
<em>The [Respondent] shall not be liable for any error
                                of judgment … or for any loss</em> arising out of any
                            investment or for any act or omission in the execution and management of
                            the [assets and investments under the custodianship of the Respondent]
                                <em>unless such loss has been occasioned by
                                the</em> default, fraud or <em>gross negligence
                                of the [Respondent] …</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The effect of cl 6 of the DIMA was not addressed to us in
                    argument, and it would therefore be inappropriate for us to express a concluded
                    view on the matter, save to say that one possible effect of cl 6 was that the
                    use of the words “gross negligence” served to drastically reduce
                    the standard of care owed by the Respondent, such that the Respondent would only
                    be liable if it had been extremely careless. Courts in Singapore have not often
                    been called upon to construe the meaning of the phrase “gross
                    negligence” in this context (an exception being the Singapore High Court
                    decision of <em>Sie Choon Poh (trading as Image Galaxy) v Amara
                        Hotel Properties Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 576), and, in view
                    of the differences of approach in other Commonwealth jurisdictions (see the
                    treatment of the subject in <em>Charlesworth &amp; Percy on
                        Negligence</em> (C Walton gen ed)
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2010) at para 1-15 as compared to
                    that in A M Linden and B Feldthusen, <em>Canadian
                        Tort Law</em> (LexisNexis Butterworths, 8th Ed, 2006) at
                    pp 196-198) as well as the commercial importance of such clauses, we were
                    content to reserve our analysis for a case in which the issue arose squarely for
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Conclusion on the issue of breach</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Given that the standard of care imposed on the
                    Respondent was not a high one, we were of the view that the Respondent had
                    discharged its duty of care, whether in contract or tort, by virtue of the fact
                    that Ms Ching, in the course of her monthly meetings with the Appellant,
                    consistently recommended suitable investments to him, advised him of the pros
                    and cons of those investments, as well as reviewed the performance of
                    investments already entered into on his behalf. There was much disagreement
                    during the trial between Ms Ching and counsel for the Appellant as to
                    whether such actions were to be regarded as “advice” or
                    “information” or “recommendations” (as a result of
                    the unfortunate focus on whether the Respondent had a tortious “duty to
                    advise”), but the exact terminology was unimportant because Ms Ching
                    was steadfast and unshaken in her testimony that she would have drawn to the
                    attention of the Appellant the various factors and considerations germane to his
                    investments, and that, to the best of her recollection, she did in fact do so.
                    For the reasons we have given, we considered that that was sufficient to
                    discharge the Respondent’s duty of care to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the result, we upheld the Judge’s
                    decision on the Advisory Claim (albeit for somewhat different reasons) and
                    dismissed the Appellant’s appeal, with the Respondent being awarded 90% of
                    the costs of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     On the issue of costs, we were dismayed upon
                    receiving the Appellant’s and Respondent’s cases to discover that
                    they ran to about 250 and 500 pages, respectively, which were among the
                    longest this court has ever received. In an appeal which was fairly
                    straightforward, it was astonishing that the parties’ written submissions
                    were so prolix. It was even more troubling that despite their length, the
                    parties’ cases were not especially illuminating as to the key issues of
                    law involved. The parties’ submissions were therefore of a wholly
                    unhelpful and unnecessary length. In <em>Mühlbauer AG v
                        Manufacturing Integration Technology Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR 724 at
                    [109]–[113], this court cautioned against <em>excessively</em> voluminous written cases, and we wish to reiterate
                    those observations, lest this particular style of written advocacy takes root at
                    the Bar. In order to register our disapproval of <em>excessively</em> lengthy Appellant’s or Respondent’s
                    cases, we accordingly awarded the Respondent only 90% of the costs of the
                    appeal.</p>
