<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case is a unique situation where the law of
                    set-off meets the law of assignment, involving a curious creature known as a
                        ‘<em>tripartite</em> contractual set off
                    agreement’ and the notion of a ‘silent assignment’ that was
                    manifested in a facultative agreement to assign. Commercial men, either due to
                    lack of foresight or diligence or good legal advice or whatever, sometimes fail
                    to appreciate or underestimate the risks involved in the transactions they enter
                    into or the omissions they make in relation thereto. With specific reference to
                    the law of assignment, this case is an example of what can go wrong when no
                    timely notice of assignment to the debtor is given by the assignee of a
                    debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       In this dispute, Motorola Electronics Pte Ltd
                    (“the defendant”) is a company incorporated in Singapore and
                    carries on the business of manufacturing and selling telecommunications
                    equipment. Both the defendant and another Singapore company called Motorola
                    Trading Center Pte Ltd (‘MTC’) are wholly-owned subsidiaries of
                    Motorola Inc., a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange of the United
                    States of America.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank
                    B.A. (“the plaintiff”) is the Singapore branch of a bank
                    incorporated in the Netherlands and it carries on banking business generally
                    including the provision of corporate and investment banking
                services.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The plaintiff claimed against the defendant the
                    sum of US$5,178,212.41, which represented the total net value of receivables
                    under invoices which were issued by Jurong Hi-Tech (‘JHT’) to the
                    defendant, and which had been subsequently assigned by Jurong Hi-Tech Industries
                    Pte Ltd (‘JHTI’) to the plaintiff. JHT is a sole proprietorship
                    owned by JHTI. JHTI was a company engaged in the assembly of printed circuit
                    boards and electronics and the manufacture of plastic and metal precision
                    components. JHTI has been under judicial management since 20 February 2009.
                    Both JHT and JHTI were subsidiaries of a listed entity called Jurong
                    Technologies Industrial Corporation which itself is under judicial
                    management.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       JHTI had been manufacturing electronic products
                    for the defendant since 2003. The products include printed circuit board
                    assemblies and modules which were used in the manufacture of Motorola
                    telecommunications equipment. The defendant’s position was that since
                    2003, the defendant would set-off on a monthly basis, amounts due to it for the
                    materials it supplied to JHTI, against amounts it owed to JHTI for electronic
                    products which JHTI had manufactured for the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 28 July 2004, the defendant and JHTI
                    entered into an agreement known as the Manufacturing and Assembly Agreement
                    (“MAA”), under which JHTI agreed to manufacture electronic
                    products for the defendant using materials and components purchased from the
                    defendant and/or other suppliers approved by the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Under cl 2.1 of the MAA, JHTI would
                    purchase all materials and components required for manufacturing from suppliers
                    as so notified by the defendant. Notwithstanding this clause, the defendant
                    reserved the right to require JHTI to purchase requisite materials from the
                    defendant directly, under the same clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Clause 11.2 of the MAA which is a set-off
                    provision states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where Materials are purchased directly from Motorola [the defendant],
                        Motorola shall have the right to offset payments due to it against amounts
                        payable to the Contractor [JHTI] for such Materials. The payment shall be
                        made in arrears against correct invoices issued by the Contractor for the
                        same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 5 July 2005, MTC began to supply
                    materials to, as well as purchase electronics products from, JHTI. MTC
                    specialises in the “buy-sell” business of Motorola whereby MTC
                    would buy raw materials in order to sell them to suppliers (such as JHTI in the
                    present case) that manufacture electronic products. The products are then sold
                    to various Motorola companies around the world.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The defendant’s position was that since
                    5 July 2005, sums owing by the defendant and MTC were set off on a monthly
                    basis (which typically took place in the last 10 days of each month) against
                    sums owing by JHTI to the defendant and MTC; specifically, the accounts
                    receivable of MTC arising from the sale of raw materials to JHTI were set off
                    against the accounts payable of MTC and the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 28 March 2006, Motorola Inc. and JHTI
                    entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement (‘MSA’) for JHTI to
                    manufacture Motorola products. Under cll 6b and 6c of the MSA, JHTI was required
                    to purchase materials from Motorola Inc. for the manufacture of Motorola
                    products. There was no set-off provision in the MSA. The defendant submitted
                    that the defendant and MTC were parties to the MSA as cl 2 therein
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">“Affiliate” means any corporation or other entity that
                        controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party. A
                        corporation or other entity shall be deemed to control another if it owns or
                        controls more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting stock or other
                        ownership interest of the corporation or entity. References herein to
                        Motorola and Company shall be deemed to include references to their
                        Affiliates unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise
                        requires.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 15 February 2007, the plaintiff and
                    JHTI entered into a Master Receivables Purchase Agreement (‘MRPA’)
                    to provide receivable financing facilities of up to US$20m to JHTI. The
                    “Debtor” referred to in the agreement was the defendant, where the
                    sums owing by the defendant to JHTI were the subject matter of the receivables
                    under MRPA. Clause 2 of the MRPA stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Bank [the
                        plaintiff] may from time to time be offered Receivables by the Company
                        [JHTI] serving a Purchase Request [found in Schedule 1 of the MRPA] on the
                        Bank and the Bank at its sole discretion may agree to acquire any of those
                        Receivables.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Under cl 4 of the MRPA, the plaintiff would
                    purchase receivables by its acceptance of the purchase request through the
                    acceptance form in Schedule 2 of the document. Under cl 5.2, if a purchased
                    receivable was unpaid, the plaintiff could look to JHTI for payment. Under cl
                    11(c), JHTI represented itself as the legal and beneficial owner of each
                    receivable offered for purchase and that JHTI had not assigned and <em>inter alia</em>, created any encumbrance over each receivable
                    offered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On or about 12 September 2008, the
                    plaintiff decided to cease its commercial relationship with JHTI. On
                    7 October 2008, the plaintiff decided not to accept from JHTI new purchase
                    requests or grant further new drawings or allow a rollover of existing loans to
                    the latter. On 13 November 2008, the plaintiff cancelled the receivables
                    financing facilities extended to JHTI under the MRPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The plaintiff notified the defendant in
                    writing of the assignments of the purchased receivables by way of a letter dated
                    17 November 2008. It was not in dispute that the defendant received this
                    letter on 25 November 2008. The letter dated 17 November 2008 had
                    enclosed notifications of assignments variously dated between 31 July 2008
                    and 29 September 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The plaintiff wrote on 4 December 2008 to
                    the defendant setting out the sums that were owing pursuant to the
                    notifications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The defendant acknowledged receipt of the
                    letter dated 17 November 2008 in a letter dated 8 December 2008 to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Subsequently, the plaintiff sent a letter
                    dated 17 December 2008 to the defendant to enclose copies of further
                    notifications because the plaintiff’s earlier letter dated
                    17 November 2008 had omitted two notifications of the assignments of
                    receivables dated 28 July 2008 and 18 August 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The defendant’s position was that the
                    assignment of receivables between the plaintiff and JHTI was subject to an
                    express or implied tripartite contractual set-off agreement between JHT, MTC and
                    the defendant. The agreement was to set off sums owing by the defendant and MTC
                    to JHTI, being payment for the sale by JHTI of electronic products, against sums
                    owing by JHTI to the defendant and MTC, being payment for materials and
                    components supplied by them to JHTI. Specifically, the defendant contended that
                    the invoices which formed the subject matter of the assignment were part of a
                    set-off which had taken place on 22 October 2008 and 21 November 2008,
                    between the defendant, MTC and JHTI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff’s response was that there
                    was no evidence to support the finding of such an agreement, express or implied
                    and, that such an agreement was unsustainable in law specifically due to lack of
                    mutuality.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The plaintiff’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Tan Wah Yam (“Tan”) was/is the
                    plaintiff’s chief credit analyst. Tan gave evidence that pursuant to the
                    MRPA in [12], JHTI would from time to time present invoices (together with
                    purchase requests) to the plaintiff for the purchase of receivables from the
                    defendant. The plaintiff would purchase such receivables by way of credit
                    advices accepting the respective purchase requests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     On 11 November 2008, Richard Lee Seow
                    Hong (“Richard”), (the plaintiff’s managing-director for
                    relationship management from August 2005 to September 2009) contacted Lim Buay
                    Eng (“Pauline”), the Asia region credit director of the defendant
                    (and an old contact of Richard). The ‘principal purpose’ of this
                    call was to enquire who in the defendant’s organisation should the
                    plaintiff’s notifications of assignment be sent. Richard recalled touching
                    base with Pauline generally on the receivables due to JHTI from the defendant.
                    In that conversation, Pauline had enquired what facilities had been granted,
                    what were the amounts of the facilities and probed further into details of the
                    facilities. Richard did not reveal very much for reasons of banker-customer
                    confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The plaintiff decided to give express notice
                    of assignments to the defendant by its letters dated 17 November 2008 and
                    17 December 2008. However, as the 17 November 2008 letter ‘had
                    inadvertently omitted’ the two notifications of assignments dated
                    28 July 2008 and 18 August 2008, the same were forwarded to the
                    defendant in the plaintiff’s subsequent letter dated 17 December
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Richard recalled making two follow-up
                    telephone calls to Pauline in November 2008. On 24 November, Pauline
                    informed him that he could attention the notifications to one Ng Beng Chong
                    (“Ng”), the then financial controller of the defendant (who has
                    since left).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Richard’s position was that Ng had
                    informed him in a telephone conversation that Ng was unaware of the assignments;
                    and that Ng told him the defendant had no issues paying the monies due to JHTI
                    into its bank account with the plaintiff so long as JHTI instructed accordingly.
                    Ng informed Richard that a set-off arrangement was in place. After the
                    conversation, Richard called JHTI’s finance director, Chung Siang Joon
                    (“Chung”). Chung denied there was any set-off arrangement and told
                    Richard that it was the defendant who had recently started imposing a set-off
                    arrangement on its suppliers. Richard further contended that Chung had said that
                    JHTI had been resisting, and would continue to resist all such set-off attempts
                    from the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The plaintiff’s position was that in a
                    meeting on 25 November 2008 between Tan, Richard, and representatives of
                    JHTI, JHTI had informed the plaintiff that since October 2008, the defendant had
                    liquidity problems and had stopped making payments on the receivables due to
                    JHTI, and had unilaterally imposed a set-off arrangement to offset all
                    receivables due to and from JHTI against the defendant. The plaintiff insisted
                    in that meeting that no set-off was allowed as the assigned receivables belonged
                    to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 3 December 2008, Tan and Richard had a
                    meeting with JHTI’s representatives. Chung confirmed to the plaintiff that
                    the defendant had not made payment as the defendant was at that time in
                    discussions with JHTI on the set-off issue. The plaintiff reiterated in that
                    meeting that no set-off was allowed as the assigned receivables belonged to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On 5 December 2008, Tan, William Hendriks
                    (the plaintiff’s then regional head) and Richard met with JHTI’s
                    Chairperson Joyce Lin (“Joyce”). The plaintiff contended that
                    Joyce explained that since about October 2008, the defendant had imposed the
                    set-off arrangement on its suppliers due to the credit crunch. The plaintiff
                    further contended that Joyce had assured their representatives that JHTI had not
                    agreed to the defendant’s demands on the set-off
                arrangement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     On 9 December 2008, Joyce informed Tan
                    and Richard in a meeting that there may have been a mistake and that there was a
                    set-off arrangement with the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The plaintiff’s position was that in
                    none of the meetings (on 25 November, 3, 5 and 9 December 2008) had
                    they been informed that the set-off arrangement involved MTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The defendant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Coimbatore Sahasranaman Lakshmanan
                    (“Lakshmanan”) has been the finance manager of MTC since 2005.
                    Prior to 2005, he was the cost accountant in the defendant company. At the
                    defendant company, Lakshmanan had overseen the accounts payables and
                    inter-company receivables of the defendant. Since 2005, Lakshmanan had been
                    overseeing MTC’s accounts receivable and accounts payable. He testified
                    that his scope of responsibility extended to overseeing the defendant-related
                    accounting transactions. (N/E 125). Luo Chen (“Chen”) is the
                    accounting manager of Motorola (China) Electronics Pte Ltd who took over the
                    JHTI account from an ex-employee of the defendant Ng Cheng Soon, in October
                    2008. Since then, Chen has been involved in three broad processes which involved
                    the defendant, MTC and JHTI. The processes are the external reconciliation
                    process, the internal reconciliation process, and the external set-off
                    process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Lakshmanan adduced evidence to show
                    MTC’s involvement in forming a tripartite contractual set-off agreement
                    since 5 July 2005. In his AEIC (at exhibit ‘CSL-12’),
                    Lakshmanan produced a summary of records of payments that had been made by MTC
                    to JHTI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The monthly set-offs were either mutual (sums
                    owing by the defendant to JHTI were set off against the sums owing by JHTI to
                    the defendant), or cross-entity set-offs (sums owing by the defendant to JHTI
                    were set off against the sums owing by JHTI to MTC). The cross-entity set-offs
                    formed the bulk of the monthly set-offs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Every month, Chen would send an email to Chai
                    Lee, JHTI’s accountant, attaching a reconciliation statement that listed
                    all outstanding invoices issued by JHTI to the defendant and MTC and outstanding
                    invoices issued by the defendant and MTC to JHTI. Chai Lee would go through the
                    statement, and if any inconsistencies arose, he would contact Chen. (The
                    reconciliation statement for August 2008 was shown in exhibit
                    ‘CSL-4’ of Lakshmanan’s AEIC).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     After this external reconciliation process,
                    all the invoices for which payment had fallen due from JHTI, MTC and the
                    defendant would be removed from the reconciliation statement and put in a
                    separate set-off statement. Before this set-off statement was sent to Chai Lee,
                    a debit note would be raised by the defendant internally while a credit note
                    would be raised by MTC internally, for the cross-entity set-offs to be
                    approved.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     A debit note request form would be raised by
                    the defendant to set off amounts owing by the defendant to JHTI against amounts
                    owing by JHTI to MTC. Chen testified that in order to simplify the procedure
                    internally within the defendant’s organisation, he removed this
                    requirement to have a debit note request form such that it had no effect on the
                    external set-off arrangement with JHTI (see N/E 250).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     A credit note would be raised by MTC for every
                    set-off for accounting purposes. To set off sums owing by the defendant to JHTI
                    against sums owing by JHTI to MTC, MTC would issue a credit note to JHTI. MTC
                    would transfer to the defendant the sums owing by JHTI to MTC, such that JHTI
                    would then be owing the said sums to the defendant. The said sums were then set
                    off against monies owing by the defendant to JHTI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The set-offs had to be approved by Lakshmanan,
                    Ng and John Kozlowski (the overall financial controller of Motorola’s
                    businesses in Asia). The monthly set-offs were reflected internally in the MTC
                    accounts receivables set-off statement. This statement listed all invoices and
                    credit notes issued by MTC to JHTI. An example of such statements for the months
                    of April to December 2008 were exhibited in Chen’s AEIC. Once the
                    statement, debit and credit notes had been approved, the set-off statements
                    would be sent to Chai Lee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The details of the invoices issued by JHTI to
                    the defendant and MTC, and those issued by the defendant and MTC to JHTI, were
                    stored in the Motorola database. Chen would extract the information from the
                    database and compile a table which summarised the set-offs to be effected
                    between the defendant, MTC and JHTI for a particular month.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Chen would upload the monthly reconciliation
                    statement onto Motorola’s Accounts Payables Inquiry Application
                    (‘APIA’) for JHTI to have access to the details of invoices which
                    had been set off. The sample statement for October 2008 in exhibit
                    ‘LC-14’ of Chen’s AEIC showed the set-offs between sums due
                    and payable under invoices issued by MTC to JHTI, against sums due and payable
                    under invoices issued by JHTI to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On 22 October 2008, Chen emailed Ng and
                    Lakshmanan to seek approval for the set-off of US$4,694,848.57 owed by JHTI to
                    MTC against US$4,694,848.57 owed by the defendant to JHTI. The approval of the
                    set-off was exhibited in ‘LC-4’ of Chen’s AEIC. MTC issued a
                    credit invoice no. 1260000986 dated 22 October 2008 to JHTI, as shown in
                    exhibit ‘LC-7’ of Chen’s AEIC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     On 17 November 2008, Chen emailed Ng and
                    Lakshmanan to seek approval for the set off of US$1,761,942.26 owed by the
                    defendant to JHTI, and the sum of US$826,408.03 owed by MTC to JHTI, against the
                    sum of US$2,588,350.29 owed by JHTI to MTC. The approval of the set-off was
                    shown in exhibit ‘LC-6’ of Chen’s AEIC for which MTC issued
                    credit invoice no. 1260001070 dated 22 October 2008 to JHTI.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Pauline testified that she received a call
                    from Richard on 11 November 2008 during which Richard enquired to whom the
                    plaintiff should direct the notifications of assignment when they were sent to
                    the defendant. Richard had informed Pauline that there had been an assignment of
                    invoices issued by JHT to the defendant. However, he did not provide any details
                    as to the amount owing under the invoices or any particulars of the invoices
                    that had been assigned. Pauline informed Richard that the appropriate person to
                    direct the notifications to could be Ng but she would have to check. Although
                    the telephone records produced by the plaintiff (at PB89) revealed that the call
                    lasted six minutes and thirty seconds, Pauline claimed (at N/E 330) that this
                    aspect was all that she could remember of that conversation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Richard called Pauline again on
                    14 November 2008 to confirm the addressee of the notifications. Pauline
                    again said she would check and let him know. Richard responded that he would
                    nevertheless still send the notifications to Motorola on 17 November
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Pauline testified that she had no recollection
                    of telephone conversations with Richard other than the two conversations on 11
                    and 14 November 2008. However, the telephone records showed that on
                    24 November 2004, there was a three minute call at 4.49pm. Pauline’s
                    response was that she had no recollection of nor records of such a
                    conversation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The defendant took the position that it was
                    not liable to make payment under invoices numbered 90075199, 90075207 and
                    90075249 totalling US$17,359.20 as those had been erroneously addressed to the
                    defendant when they related to purchase orders that were made by other companies
                    in the Motorola Group. The defendant contended that MTC had already set off with
                    JHTI on 29 December 2008 the sums due under the three
                invoices.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The issues that arise for determination
                    are;</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Was there sufficient evidence to establish a
                            tripartite set-off agreement between JHTI, MTC and the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In answering the third issue first, it is
                    necessary to determine the relevant date of the notice which fixed the date from
                    which the plaintiff as assignee took the assignment subject to pre-existing
                    equities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The findings</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Nature of the plaintiff’s assignment </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Before going into the findings on the
                    substantive issues, it is useful to understand the nature of the assignment
                    involved. At law, there are two recognised <em>forms</em>
                    of assignment. The first form of assignment is by way of an equitable
                    assignment. No notice is required, and the assignment need not be in writing so
                    long as the intentions of the parties are clear. It is necessary for the
                    assignee of an equitable assignment to recover the debt in the assignor’s
                    name. One rationale for this requirement is to protect the debtor from being
                    exposed to double action for the same debt. This requirement has been
                    liberalised in several jurisdictions such as New Zealand (see <em>Commercial Factors Ltd v Maxwell Printing Ltd</em> [1994]
                    1 NZLR 724 (“<em>Commercial
                    Factors</em>”) where it was held that this requirement can be
                    dispensed with as there was no practical possibility of the debtor facing a
                    claim from the insolvent assignor in that case).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     To counter this procedural bar of having to
                    add the assignor as a party to the action to recover the debt, the statutory
                        <em>form</em> of assignment was created. Section 4(8)
                    of the Civil Law Act Cap 43 (1999 Rev Ed) (“the Civil Law Act”)
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Assignment of debts and choses in
                            action effectual to pass right and remedy</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(8) Any <em>absolute</em> assignment by <em>writing</em> under the hand of the assignor, not
                        purporting to be by way of charge only, of any debt or other legal chose in
                        action of which <em>express notice in writing has been given
                            to the debtor</em>, trustee or other person from whom the assignor
                        would have been entitled to receive or claim such debt or chose in action,
                        shall be and be deemed to have been effectual in law, <em>subject to all equities which would have been entitled to priority over
                            the right of the assignee</em> under the law as it existed before
                        23rd July 1909, to pass and transfer the legal right to such debt or chose
                        in action, f<em>rom the date of such notice</em>, and
                        all legal and other remedies for the same, and the power to give a good
                        discharge for the same, without the concurrence of the assignor. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The plaintiff’s assertion that it had a
                    “silent assignment” was a convenient commercial label that added
                    nothing to the <em>substance</em> of the assignment. It
                    however highlighted the risks that the plaintiff undertook in the receivables
                    arrangement with JHTI. An analysis of the terms of the factoring agreement
                        (<em>viz</em> the MRPA) revealed that it did not exist
                    as an assignment in itself but was an <em>agreement</em> to
                    assign. The MRPA is a form of facultative agreement (see Salinger on Factoring,
                    Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2006 4<sup>th</sup> ed at page 140),
                    where the assignor offers debts for the assignee to purchase (see the purchase
                    request in Schedule 1 of the MRPA), and where the assignee has the option to
                    purchase the debt by signing an acceptance (see Acceptance form in Schedule 2 of
                    MRPA), or if the assignee deems the offered debt to be non-commercially viable,
                    to decline to accept the debt (see cl 2 of the MRPA which gives the assignee the
                    ‘sole discretion’ to agree to acquire offered debts). The
                    assignee’s option to accept or decline debts offered presents it with the
                    flexibility to choose only debts that it deemed as good debts; the
                    presupposition is that the assignee has done its due diligence in ascertaining
                    the commercial viability of the debt offered before acceptance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In a “silent assignment”, no
                    notice is given to the debtor. As such, an equitable assignment is created upon
                    acceptance (see s 4 of the MRPA). As clarified by Hans Tjio in <em>Factoring and Stamp Duty in Singapore and Malaysia</em>,
                    [1994] SJLS 183 at 186, the act that assigns the debt is the
                    acceptance of the factor, not the master agreement itself. The MRPA itself
                    cannot be a statutory assignment, as a requirement of a statutory assignment is
                    for there to be an absolute assignment of the debt. An absolute assignment
                    requires an immediate transfer of the assignor’s entire interest in the
                    chose in action, and this cannot be achieved by a mere agreement to assign
                    offered debts as and when the assignor chooses to submit a purchase
                    request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     I pause here to highlight the importance of
                    giving notice, in both equitable and statutory assignment, before I address the
                    substantive issue of notice. Receipt of the notice of assignment by the debtor
                    prevents the discharge of the debt by the debtor’s payment to the assignor
                    (see <em>William Brandt’s Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Co
                        Ltd</em> [1905] AC 454) and it fixes the rights of the
                    parties in relation to the debtor’s countervailing rights, primarily the
                    right to set off its debts against debts owed by the assignor to the
                    debtor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Was there sufficient evidence to establish an implied contractual
                set-off agreement?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Counsel for the plaintiff argued that there
                    was insufficient evidence of a tripartite contractual set-off agreement.
                    Specifically, although cl 11.2 of the MAA provided a set-off provision, the
                    MAA was only made between JHTI and the defendant, without MTC’s
                    involvement. Further, this set-off provision was arguably insufficient and could
                    not be compared to an independent and express set-off agreement, which was not
                    the case here. In addition, although the defendant, MTC, and JHTI were arguably,
                    parties to the MSA by way of cl 2’s definition of
                    ‘affiliates’, the MSA did not have a set-off
                provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Counsel’s arguments required the Court
                    to <em>artificially</em> analyse each piece of evidence in
                        <em>isolation</em>. Although I find that there was no
                        <em>express</em> set-off agreement in existence, I note
                    that in inferring the existence of a set-off agreement, the Court must look at
                    the evidence in <em>its totality</em> to determine the true
                    course of dealings between the parties. The case of <em>Commercial Factors</em> is informative for its closely analogous
                    factual matrix. It is persuasive authority that a contractual set-off agreement
                    can be <em>implied</em> from the surrounding circumstances
                    and conduct of the parties and that such a contract is an equity that the
                    assignee takes subject to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In that case, Export had assigned moneys owed
                    to it by Maxwell to Commercial Factors (assignee), pursuant to a factoring
                    agreement. The invoices relied on by Commercial Factors were issued between
                    6 May 1991 and 30 September 1991. Prior to this period of time, there
                    had been a flow of work between Maxwell, Export and IPL Publishing
                    (Export’s associated company). Maxwell had been paying for work done by
                    Export on 90 day terms. Specifically, before April 1991, there was an
                    arrangement between Export and Maxwell to exchange cheques on the 90 days for
                    amounts owing between them on the 20<sup>th</sup> of each month.
                    The High Court observed the general rule that, (per Hammond J at 738):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As to what is required to establish a contractual set-off, it can be
                        explicit; it may arise by custom (<em>Bamford v
                            Harris</em> (1816) 1 Stark 343; or it may be inferred from conduct
                            (<em>Wallis v Bastard</em> (1853) 4 De GM &amp; G
                        251).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The Court inferred from the evidence that the
                    cheque-swapping arrangement had amounted to a contractual set-off agreement, and
                    found that this agreement was an equity that the assignee had taken subject to
                    (per Hammond J at 739):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It will be recalled that the evidence was that there was to be no exchange
                        of cheques or settlement between the parties without the compliance of the
                        other party. Further, if I ask myself the question: could either party have
                        sued in contract on that arrangement?, the answer I think would have to be
                        "Yes". And, if one party had attempted to resile back to a 30-day
                        arrangement, I think that would have provided a defence, at least without
                        further negotiations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That contractual set-off arose prior to the May invoices, which is the
                        important date for present purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the effect of the arrangement was that the assigned invoices from
                        May 1991 onwards were always subject to Maxwell's pre-existing right as
                        debtor to refuse to pay the same if Export failed to pay Maxwell for their
                        outstanding debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Having considered the New Zealand position, it
                    would be appropriate at this juncture to consider the English position in
                    inferring a contractual set-off agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The English Position</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In <em>Downam v Matthews Ch.
                        Prec. 580</em> [1721], ‘A’ a clothier and ‘B’
                    a dyer had mutual dealings for several years without payment of money from
                    either side. When B died, the administrators of his estate sought against A sums
                    of money allegedly due by A to B. The Court (at page 582) found there to be
                    an agreement to set off arising from the course of dealings:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…where it appeared that the <em>mutual
                            dealing</em> between the intestate and the plaintiffs [party A]
                        were carried on for several years in this manner, without payment of money
                        on either side, it was a <em>strong presumptive argument of
                            an agreement to this purpose</em>, and that without such liberty
                        of retaining against each other, they would not have continued on their
                        dealings; but if it had been insisted upon by either party, that the other
                        should not be allowed to set off his debt out of what was owing by him to
                        the other, as they could, that this would have soon broke off all dealings
                        between them;…[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     More recently, in <em>Paul
                        Smith Ltd v H &amp; S International Holding Inc</em> [1991]
                    2 AC 127, the plaintiff had based its Order 14 application on a no
                    set-off clause in an agreement between the defendants and itself. The English
                    Commercial Court considered that a set-off agreement inferred from a course of
                    dealing between the parties may even be strong enough to override the no set-off
                    provision, thereby giving rise to a disputable claim unsuitable for summary
                    determination. Steyn J said at page 131:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…the affidavit of Mr Dobson…shows convincingly that there
                        was a course of dealing between the parties which in one respect at least
                        varied the “no set-off” clause. By course of dealing it was
                        agreed that the defendants would be entitled to set off the purchase price
                        of goods sold to the plaintiffs against the royalties. It may be said that
                        this is a variation of the “no set-off” clause only quoad the
                        purchase price of the goods. On the other hand, it seems to me arguable that
                        the course of conduct, which on any view had an impact on the “no
                        set-off” clause, in fact had the consequence of deleting it
                        altogether. The claim…is therefore…a genuinely disputable
                        claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Indeed, the English authorities have set a
                        <em>low</em> evidential threshold in implying a
                    contractual set-off agreement. It has been held that <em>slight
                        evidence</em> of the agreement is sufficient to imply such an
                    agreement. The rationale of this position is that the law encourages contractual
                    set-offs in order to prevent multiplicity of suits and circuity of action. In
                        <em>Jeffs v Wood</em> [1723] 2 P WMS 128
                    the then Master of the Roles, Sir Joseph Jekyll said at page 129:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true, stoppage [the old term for set-off] is no payment at law,
                        nor is it, of itself, a payment in equity, but then a very slender agreement
                        for discounting or allowing the one debt out of the other, will make it a
                        payment, because this prevents circuity of action and multiplicity of suits,
                        which is not favoured in law, much less in equity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…<em>the least evidence of an agreement for a
                            stoppage will do</em> …and in these cases equity will
                        take hold of a very slight thing to do both parties right. And it is still
                        more reasonable, that where the matter of the mutual demand is concerning
                        the same thing, there the Court should interpose, and make the balance only
                        payable.[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     In <em>Lundy v
                        McCulla</em> (1865) 11 Gr. 368, it was held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the view of equity the setting off one demand against another between
                        the same parties is extremely just; and where there is any technical
                        difficulty in the way of its being done without an agreement, the court
                            <em>accepts slighter evidence of such an agreement than
                            is usually required in order to establish disputed
                        facts</em>.[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The English authorities’ marked
                    readiness to assist in finding an implied contractual set-off agreement from the
                    circumstances and conduct of the parties can be seen from the decision of
                        <em>Wallis v Bastard</em> (1853)
                    4 De GM &amp; G 251, where Lord Cranwoth LC said
                    at p 257:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This much, however, I think may be stated as a very safe proposition, that
                        the principle of set-off is quite consistent with natural equity, and that
                        where it can be adopted, <em>it is an arrangement which this
                            Court will be very ready to assist</em>, while it will look to any
                        circumstances that occurred at the time when persons became reciprocally
                        indebted, in order to say that a set-off did in fact take place. In the
                        present case, from the circumstance that possession was taken in 1842 by the
                        mortgagee, and that no claim was made for interest by either party, I infer
                        that, <em>whether expressed or not, it was the agreement
                            perfectly understood between the parties that the one debt should wipe
                            off a portion of the other debt</em>; in effect, that there should
                        pro tanto be a set-off. I do not, therefore, feel called upon to speculate
                        as to the exact course this Court would have pursued if the parties had, in
                        the year 1842, adversely asserted against each other their mutual rights;
                        but not having done so, they must be understood, like reasonable persons, to
                        have adopted an arrangement perfectly obvious and in conformity with what
                        ought to have been done. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Arguably, these English cases are not
                    conclusively authoritative as they deal with the inference of a bilateral, as
                    opposed to a tripartite set-off agreement. Nonetheless, whether the set-off
                    agreement is bilateral or tripartite, the basis of such agreements is <em>contractual</em>. In this regard I refer to the textbook of
                    Philip R. Wood, <em>English and International Set Off</em>
                    Sweet &amp; Maxwell 1989 which commented at para 5-17,
                    page 154:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A contract to set off must satisfy the normal contractual rules as to
                        formation of contract, <em>eg</em>. offer and
                        acceptance and communication of the acceptance, as to whether an offer is
                        merely an invitation to treat, and as to certainty of terms and contractual
                        intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Further, it was stated in Treitel on The Law
                    of Contract (12<sup>th </sup>ed, Sweet &amp; Maxwell) at
                    page 186, para 4-021:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The question of contractual intention is, in the last resort, one of fact.
                        In deciding it, a distinction must be drawn between implied and express
                        agreements. Claims based on <em>implied</em> agreements
                        are approached on the basis that “contracts are not lightly to be
                        implied” and that the court must therefore be able to
                        “conclude with confidence that…the parties intended to create
                        contractual relations”. The burden of proof on this issue is on the
                        proponent of the implied contract… .</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     There is an English decision where the court
                    found there to be sufficient evidence of a <em>tripartite</em> set-off agreement. In <em>Latreefers
                        Inc (In Liquidation) v Tangent Shipping Co Ltd</em>
                    [2000] BCLC 805, there was a debt owed by Tangent to Latreefers, while
                    at the same time, Latreefers owed a debt of a larger sum to Latstrand. Tangent
                    was at the material time the subsidiary of Latstrand, while both Latsrand and
                    Latreefers were subsidiaries of Latmar. Latmar was in turn a subsidiary of
                    Latvian. The Court identified the real issue as whether there was evidence of an
                    agreement to set off the debt owed by Tangent to Latreefers against
                    Latreefers’ debt owed to Latstrand (Tangent’s parent company). It
                    was found that there was evidence of the set off agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     I note that the court made the above finding
                        <em>without</em> the benefit of extrinsic evidence such
                    as reconciliation statements and records of invoices. The court found there to
                    be sufficient evidence from the correspondence between Latreefers’
                    solicitors and Latmar’s accountant, as well as the affidavits of
                    Tangent’s solicitors, Latmar’s solicitor, and Latmar’s
                    managing director. Nonetheless, each case rests on its own facts and I proceed
                    to consider the evidence in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">The evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In the present case, the MSA dated
                    28 March 2006 made between JHTI and Motorola Inc at [11] for JHTI to
                    provide manufacturing services to Motorola Inc., has to be read with the
                    ‘‘full and final settlement of accounts payable” dated
                    22 June 2007 (AB 69). The letter had referred to the ‘on going’
                    reconciliation exercise between Motorola Inc. and JHTI in respect of services
                    and products provided by JHTI. I note that the definition of
                    ‘affiliates’ in the MSA covered the defendant and MTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     There were records of invoices of JHTI’s
                    accounts payables representing the sums owed by JHTI to MTC which ranged from
                    23 August 2005 to 3 October 2009. This should be <em>read together</em> with the records of invoices of JHTI’s
                    accounts payables representing the sums owed by JHTI to the defendants from
                    December 2004 to March 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The defendant had provided comprehensive
                    set-off statements that evidenced set-offs on 22 October 2008 and
                    21 November 2008, attached to the correspondence between Chai Lee and Chen
                    dated 25 October 2008. Those comprehensive set-off statements had dedicated
                    columns and accounting figures for: (i) offsetting JHTI’s accounts
                    receivable from MTC against JHTI’s accounts payable to MTC, (ii)
                    offsetting JHTI accounts payable to Motorola Electronics (the defendant) against
                    JHTI accounts receivable from MTC, (iii) offsetting JHTI’s accounts
                    receivable from Motorola Electronics against JHTI’s accounts payable to
                    Motorola Electronics, and (iv) a net offsetting amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The evidence of columns (i) and (ii) was
                    further supported by Chen’s testimony (N/E 222), where he explained that
                    the Motorola APIA extract (see [40]) in his exhibit ‘LC-17’ showed
                    invoices from 8 August 2008 to 22 September 2008 that represented the
                    sums set off between MTC and JHTI; while the APIA extract in his exhibit
                    ‘LC-16’ showed invoices from 14 August 2008 to 24 November
                    2008 that represented the set-off between the defendant, MTC, and JHTI. Those
                    two extracts parallel the above items (i) and (ii) respectively, presenting a
                    practice pursuant to an existing reconciliation system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Indeed, exhibit ‘LC-15’ in
                    Chen’s AEIC showed that as far as Motorola was concerned, MTC’s
                    accounts receivable had been set off against the defendant’s accounts
                    payable for October 2008 – the invoices beginning with ‘13000’
                    were MTC’s accounts receivable invoices to JHTI, and the invoices
                    beginning with ‘900’ were JHTI’s receivables as recorded in
                    the defendant’s accounts payable (N/E 255 and 258).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     In addition, the approval for the tripartite
                    set-offs on 22 October 2008 and 17 November 2008 were exhibited in
                    ‘LC-4’ and ‘LC-6’ of Chen’s AEIC. The
                    correspondence between Chen and Chai Lee dated 28 October 2008 clearly
                    stated that for due invoices as of 23 October 2008, it was a
                        “<em>net receivable</em>” from Motorola
                    to JHT. This presupposed that the set-off had already been
                effected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     There were also records of the correspondence
                    between Chen and Ng dated 22 October 2008 reflecting that a sum of
                    $5,348,520.20 of JHTI’s accounts payable to the defendant were to be
                    offset against JHTI’s accounts receivable from MTC, with attached credit
                    notes as evidence of such set-off (where the phrase OU_SGP represented the
                    defendant, and OU_BUY_SELL represented MTC). The correspondence dated
                    17 November 2008 showed that a sum of $1,761,942.26 of JHTI’s
                    accounts payable to the defendant were to be offset against JHTI’s
                    accounts receivable from MTC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In this regard I reject the plaintiff’s
                    submission that there was no evidence of the credit and debit notes.
                    Lakshmanan’s and Chen’s evidence (in their respective AEICs) on the
                    debit and credit notes was further corroborated by the debit note request form,
                    and credit note request form, both dated 24 June 2008 annexed to Ng Cheng
                    Soon’s email to Ng to inform the latter of the amount to be offset, as
                    well as Lakshmanan’s reply email to approve the set-off. Further evidence
                    was to be found in the credit note request forms dated 22 October 2008 and
                    17 November 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     The plaintiff also submitted that Lakshmanan
                    had agreed during cross-examination that three letters dated 22 June 2007
                    (AB 69–74) constituted three separate bilateral agreements executed by the
                    specific Motorola companies and JHTI, and was not evidence of a ‘broader
                    agreement’. However, the plaintiff’s counsel had extracted this
                    answer from Lakshmanan in the <em>context</em> of finding a
                    tripartite <em>express</em> agreement. The
                    plaintiff’s counsel had asked Lakshmanan (at N/E 135):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">So you do not see, in any of the three agreements that I’ve just
                        shown you, more than one Motorola company entering into a settlement
                        agreement of accounts payable with JHTI and JHTC <em>in the
                            same agreement</em>; do you accept? It’s all separate for
                        each of the Motorola companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In that context, Lakshmanan’s answer
                    that the three letters were not evidence of a broader agreement was merely an
                    admission that none of the three letters expressly incorporated the three
                    parties (JTHI, MTC and the defendant) in the same agreement. Lakshmanan’s
                    answer had no bearing on the <em>inference</em> of an
                    agreement, by reading the three letters in totality with other extrinsic
                    evidence presented to the court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     In the light of the evidence adduced read
                    together with the set-off provision under cl 11.2 of the MAA between the
                    defendant and JHTI as well as the MSA which was a contract between, <em>inter alia</em>, JHTI, MTC and the defendant, I have no doubt
                    that the defendant has discharged its burden of proof on a balance of
                    probabilities. Based on the <em>totality</em> of the
                    evidence before me, I find there to be more than sufficient evidence to imply a
                    tripartite contractual set-off agreement, and that there had been set-offs
                    exercised on 22 October 2008 and 21 November 2008 <em>pursuant</em> to this tripartite agreement. The evidence, especially
                    through the reconciliation statements and invoice records, convincingly
                    establishes a <em>consensus ad idem as</em> manifested by
                    the course of dealings where MTC and the defendant would supply materials to
                    JHTI for manufacturing and sale, such that the amounts owing to one another
                    would be set off. This tripartite agreement without doubt existed with effect
                    from October 2008. Although it may have existed from 2005, it is not necessary
                    for present purposes to look so far back into the parties’ course of
                    dealings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In addition, I find that the plaintiff has no
                    claim on the three invoices numbered 99075199, 90075207 and 90075249. Those
                    corresponded with the references ERS-MOT2008090074-308915,
                    ERS-MOT2008090080-308912 and ERS-MOT2008090093-309368 respectively and the
                    records showed that the purchase order numbers for the references had the
                    inclusion of ‘MTC’ at the end of each purchase order number. This
                    indicated that the purchase orders were issued by MTC. It is not in dispute that
                    the MRPA signed between the plaintiff and JHTI only covered choses in action
                    owed by the defendant. It was not the plaintiff’s pleaded case and neither
                    was there evidence, that the above references had been forged by the defendant.
                    I therefore find that the defendant is not liable to pay invoices numbered
                    99075199, 90075207 and 90075249.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Given that there is more than sufficient
                    evidence to establish the existence of an implied tripartite agreement to set
                    off, there was no necessity for the defendant to call JHTI’s personnel as
                    witnesses to establish the same. I note that the plaintiff itself had relied on
                    statements made by JHTI’s personnel (see [25] to [28]) but did not call
                    them as witnesses. The plaintiff had contended that several representatives from
                    JHTI had informed the former that there was no set-off arrangement in existence,
                    that the defendant had unilaterally imposed the set-off agreement since October
                    2008 and that JHTI had refused to agree to a set-off arrangement. As the court
                    pointed out to counsel for the plaintiff, there was no proprietary right to
                    witnesses by litigants. If the defendant chose not to call representatives of
                    JHTI to testify, the plaintiff could have done so but it did not. Whatever that
                    was said by JHTI’s personnel to Tan and/or Richard was therefore hearsay
                    and inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     I also reject as inadmissible, the two email
                    threads (between the defendant and JHTI) obtained by the plaintiff from the
                    judicial managers of JHTI. Similarly, I reject the report of the judicial
                    managers (at 2PB 879) as they were not called to testify.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">
<b>Was the tripartite contractual set-off agreement
                    unsustainable in law for lack of mutuality?</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Requirement of Mutuality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     As a general rule, there must be mutuality
                    between the two claims to be set off. For example, a debt owed by B to A cannot
                    be set off against a debt owed by A to C, even if B and C are related companies:
                        <em>Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd
                        (In Liquidation) v Habib Bank Ltd</em> [1999] 1 WLR 42. <em>Prima facie</em>, as the plaintiff argued, there was no
                    mutuality between the debt owed by the defendant to JHT and the debt owed by JHT
                    to MTC, notwithstanding that the defendant and MTC are related
                companies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The purpose of the requirement of mutuality is
                    to ensure that, in the situation where B owes a debt to A (an insolvent entity)
                    and A owes a debt to C, the insolvent’s estate is not deprived of an asset
                    (a claim by A against B) which belongs to the insolvent and which should be
                    available for division amongst secured creditors; and to ensure that B is not
                    unjustly enriched by an asset not belonging to the insolvent; (see Philip R.
                    Wood, <em>English and International Set-Off</em> (1989) at
                    para 14-5, page 769).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     However, in the absence of insolvency, the
                    requirement of mutuality can be overridden by the existence of a <em>contractual set-off agreement</em>. As observed in <em>Goode on Legal Problems of Credit and Security</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell 2008 4<sup>th</sup> Ed) at page 285,
                    para 7-21:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The ordinary requirement of mutuality may be overridden by the <em>agreement</em> of the parties, so that, for example, a
                        parent company may agree to allow debts due from its subsidiaries to be
                        set-off against its own credit balance,…and set-off may be effected
                        in any manner provided by the contract without the need of legal
                        proceedings. [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     The same view was expressed in Philip R. Wood,
                        <em>English and International Set-Off</em> (1989) at
                    page 168 para 5-70:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the claims are <em>not mutual</em>, the
                        relevant parties <em>may validly agree</em> that the
                        claims may nevertheless be set off provided that insolvency has not
                        intervened.[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     A leading commentator in this area of law has
                    observed in Rory Derham, <em>The Law of Set-Off</em>
                    (Oxford 2004), at page 467 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In the absence of</em> an agency or trust
                        relationship which brings about mutuality in equity, or <em>alternatively, before bankruptcy or liquidation, of a set-off agreement
                            between the parties</em>, A’s right to sue B may not be set
                        off against A’s indebtedness to C. This applies where B and C are
                        related companies, and also where C is a director of company B or is the
                        beneficial owner of company B. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Indeed, this principle has much historical
                    pedigree. In the case of <em>Freeman v. Lomas</em> (1851)
                    9 Hare 109, Turner VC held (at 114) that where there is an absence of
                    mutuality because the cross-demands in that case had existed in separate rights
                    (where a legatee claimed his legacy and the executor sought to set off a private
                    debt owed to the executor by the legatee), then an agreement whether express or
                    implied, may confer a right of set-off and slight circumstances would be
                    sufficient to warrant the court in presuming such an agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     Langley J. had decided in <em>Latreefers Inc (In Liquidation) v Tangent Shipping Co
                        Ltd</em> (<em>supra</em><a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>) that there was sufficient evidence to
                    establish an agreement to set off a debt owed by Tangent to Latreefers, against
                    a debt owed by Latreefers to Latstrand, where Latstrand was the parent company
                    of Tangent. The loan given by Latstrand to Latreefers had fully discharged
                    Tangent’s indebtedness under a prior loan given by Latreefers to Tangent.
                    The direct effect of this decision is that the requirement of mutuality can be
                    overridden by a contractual set-off agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     I therefore disagree with the
                    plaintiff’s argument that the contractual set-off agreement is
                    unsustainable in law due to want of mutuality. This submission is at odds with
                    commercial reality where associated companies (such as the defendant and MTC in
                    the present case) agree amongst themselves to allocate their debts and assets in
                    line with their commercial strategies and objectives. It contradicts authorities
                    which allow the requirement of mutuality to be overridden by agreement in the
                    absence of insolvency. I note that the exercised set offs on 22 October
                    2008 and 21 November 2008 were pursuant to a contractual agreement that
                    existed at least from October 2008 and took place prior to JHTI’s judicial
                    management on 20 February 2009. In any case, although it is not an issue
                    here, it should be noted that the decision in <em>Altus
                        Technologies Pte Ltd (under judicial management) v Oversea-Chinese Banking
                        Corp Ltd</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 296, has clarified that
                    contractual set-offs can be exercised in judicial management as the <em>pari passu</em> principle applies not in judicial management,
                    but in winding-up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Given that I have found the existence of a
                    contractual set-off agreement, and that the requirement of mutuality can be
                    overridden by such agreement in the absence of insolvency, it is not necessary
                    for me to analyse whether there was an equitable set-off on the facts, and
                    whether there was a requirement of mutuality for such equitable
                set-off.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Notice of Assignment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     It is a well settled principle of law that the
                    assignee of a debt takes subject to equities that existed prior to the notice of
                    assignment being given to the debtor, as the assignee takes the chose in action
                    as it is and cannot be in a better position than the assignor (see The Jarguh
                    Sawit [1998] 1 SLR(R) 648 at para [64]; <em>Pacrim
                        Investments Pte Ltd v Tan Mui Keow Claire and another</em>
                    [2005] 1 SLR(R) 141 at para [20]; <em>Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd v United Overseas Bank
                        Ltd</em> [1992] 1 SLR(R) 579 at para  [48] and

                    3 QBD 569).The assignee takes precisely the same interest and is
                    subject to the same liabilities as the assignor (<em>Mangles v
                        Dixon</em> (1852) 3 HLC 702, 10 ER 278). The assignee takes
                    subject to a contractual set-off agreement, provided that the agreement was made
                        <em>prior</em> to notice of assignment given to the
                    debtor (see <em>Roxburghe v Cox</em> (1881) 17 Ch. D.
                    520; see Salinger on Factoring (Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2006) at
                    page 211).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     This principle applies to an equitable
                    assignment as well as to a statutory assignment, as expressly provided for in s
                    4(8) of the Civil Law Act. However, this rule can be excluded or modified by the
                    terms of the contract between the debtor and assignor, where the debtor agrees
                    that he will not raise the set-off against the assignee (<em>Re
                        Agra and Masterman’s Bank</em> (1867) L.R. 2 Ch. App.
                    391)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Having found that there were set-offs on
                    22 October 2008 and 21 November 2008 exercised pursuant to a
                    pre-existing contractual set-off agreement, the next inquiry would be to
                    determine the date of notification of assignment. The relevant date to determine
                    effective notice is the date on which the notice is received by the debtor and
                    not that on which it is sent: <em>Johnstone v Cox</em>
                    (1881) 16 Ch.D. 17. As such, I find that the equitable assignment had
                    been perfected into a statutory assignment with the <em>written</em> notification letter received by the defendant on
                    25 November 2008. However, before this perfection, Pauline had received
                    calls from Richard on 11 and 14 November 2008. The telephone records showed
                    that there had been a conversation on 24 November 2008. It is possible that
                    any of those conversations could constitute notice of the equitable assignment
                    (before its perfection to a statutory assignment) as there is no requirement at
                    law for the notice to be in written form.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     As to what constitutes sufficient notice to
                    the debtor, Lord Macnaghten held in <em>William Brandt’s
                        Sons &amp; Co v Dunlop Rubber Co</em> (<em>supra</em><a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>) at 462:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The language is immaterial if the meaning is plain. All that is necessary
                        is that the debtor should be given to understand that <em>the
                            debt</em> has been made over by the creditor to some third person.
                        If the debtor ignores such a notice, he does so at his peril. [emphasis

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The issue of notice was considered in

                        American Dress</em> Co Ltd [1940] 3 All E.R. 592, where the
                    notice given to the debtor stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To facilitate our accountancy and banking arrangements, it has been agreed
                        that this invoice be transferred to and payment in London funds should be

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     On the general point of adequacy of notice,
                    Mackinnon LJ quoted <em>Denney, Gasquet &amp; Metcalfe v
                        Conklin</em> [1913] 3 KB 177 (at 180):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The language is immaterial if the meaning is plain, but that plain meaning
                        must be that <em>the debt</em> and the right to receive
                        it have been transferred to the third party. It is not merely that I have
                        made some arrangement by which I request another to pay this money to the
                        third party as my agent. The question is whether this stamped clause put
                        upon the invoices did amount to a plain intimation to the first defendants
                        that the right to receive this money had been transferred to the plaintiffs.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Mackinnon LJ further emphasized on the
                    need for the notice to be plain and unambiguous, it is insufficient if the
                    language of the notice is equally capable of a contrary interpretation:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think that this notice stamped on the invoice was ambiguous. I think
                        that it is equally consistent with being merely a request to pay to the
                        plaintiffs, as agents of the creditor to receive the money, and it does not
                        indicate sufficiently clearly that there has been an assignment of <em>the debt</em> to the plaintiffs so that they should
                        become the real creditors of the first defendants, be the only persons
                        entitled to be paid the money. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     A fundamental presupposition implicit in the
                    above proposition is that the relevant assigned debt must have first been
                    sufficiently <em>identified</em>. References to
                        ‘<em>the debt</em>’ (as emphasized in the
                    above passages) presuppose that the relevant debt has been adequately
                    identified. Once identified, there must be sufficient notice to inform the
                    debtor that the relevant debt can be effectively discharged by making payment to
                    the assignee.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     There are cases that have determined the
                    adequacy of notice for the purposes of the <em>Dearle v.
                        Hall</em> rule, although it must be remembered that the rationale
                    behind this rule concerns the allocation of priorities as between competing
                    assignees whereas in our present case, we are concerned with the relevant notice
                    that fixed dates from which the assignee takes the assignment subject to
                    equities. For notices relevant to the <em>Dearle v
                        Hall</em> rule, the notice must be clear and distinct (<em>Bence v Shearman</em> [1898] 2 Ch 582). There must be
                    proof that the mind of the debtor has been brought to an ‘intelligent
                    apprehension of the assignment’ so that the reasonable man, or an ordinary
                    man of business, would act upon the information and would regulate his conduct
                    by it; and constructive notice would not suffice (<em>Lloyd v
                        Banks</em> (1868) LR 3 Ch App 488 at 490).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In the absence of any other evidence and in
                    the face of Pauline’s testimony that she had no recollection of having had
                    any conversation on 24 November and that no substantive matters were
                    discussed in Richard’s call on 14 November 2008, the plaintiff has
                    failed to discharge its evidential burden to show that there had been adequate
                    notice of assignment given to the defendant on either of the two dates. Although
                    there were telephone records to show the two calls were indeed made, the
                    plaintiff failed to adduce further evidence of the substance of the
                    conversations that took place. Needless to say, the <em>mere</em> fact that a telephone conversation took place does not
                    equate to <em>notice</em> of assignment having been
                    given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    As regards the telephone conversation on
                    11 November 2008, it was Pauline’s evidence that Richard had told her
                    that there had been an assignment of invoices issued by JHTI to the defendant.
                    The telephone records showed that the duration of this conversation exceeded 6
                    minutes. However, what constitutes adequate notice must depend on the context of
                    each case. Here, Richard testified that the principal purpose of his call
                        <em>was to enquire to whom he should attention the
                        Notifications to</em> when sending them to the defendant. Although
                    this is not to be a legal test of any form, it does show that even the plaintiff
                    itself had not intended for this telephone conversation to be a notification of
                    the assignment. Richard admitted he <em>did not reveal
                        much</em> in this conversation due to banker-customer confidentiality
                    and he had only been “touching base with the defendant <em>generally on the receivables due</em>” to JHTI. There were
                    hundreds of invoices involved between JHTI and the defendant, a general
                    information that invoices had been assigned is vague and/or ambiguous as it
                    leaves the debtor (defendant here) none the wiser as to <em>which
                        invoices</em> had been assigned. The relevant choses in action that
                    had been assigned were not sufficiently identified. As such, I find that the
                    telephone conversation on 11 November 2008 did not constitute sufficient
                    notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Arguably, a lot could have been said in that
                    6 minute conversation. In any case however, even if I find that the conversation
                    on 11 November 2008 was adequate notice of the equitable assignment, the
                    plaintiff would still take its assignment subject to the invoices which had been
                    set off on 21 November 2008. The <em>due date</em> for
                    invoices numbered 1300064025, 1300063914, 1300063912 was 11 November 2008,
                    while the invoices’ date was 28 August 2008. The <em>due dates</em> for the rest of the invoices which had been set off on
                    21 November 2008 were all <em>prior</em> to
                    11 November 2008, save for invoice number 1300064200 where the due date was
                    12 November 2008. Even though the actual debiting (set-off) had taken place
                    after the notice on 21 November 2008, the relevant debts had <em>accrued prior to</em> the notice. The plaintiff has to take
                    subject to this equity which had existed prior to its notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    As was observed by Rory Derham in <em>The Law of Set-Off</em> (3<sup>rd</sup> ed.
                    Oxford University Press, 2003) at page 787, para 17.12, the general
                    rule is that there must be an existing debt owing by the assignor to the debtor
                    before notice; if a debt accrues only after notice pursuant to a contract
                    entered before notice, the debt cannot be set off; <em>Business
                        Computers Ltd v. Anglo-African Leasing Ltd</em> [1977] 1 WLR 578
                    at 585. However, if a debt has accrued prior to notice, the assignee takes
                    subject to an agreement to set off this debt, even if the actual debit of the
                    debt took place after the notice; <em>The Law of
                        Set-Off</em> at page 808, para 17.41.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    This principle has been reiterated in Philip
                    R. Wood, <em>English and International Set-Off</em> (1989)
                    at para 16-33, page 861:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the assignor and the debtor agree that the claims shall be set off
                        … and the assignor assigns the claim owing to him to an assignee, the
                        assignee should take subject to this contract and exercise the same solvent
                        set-off against the assignee that he could have exercised against the
                        assignor in the absence of the assignment, provided that the agreement was
                        made prior to notice to the debtor of the assignment and provided (probably)
                        that both the assigned claim and the cross-claim were <em>incurred before such notice</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The plaintiff therefore takes its assignment
                    subject to invoice number 1300064200 which due date was 12 November 2008
                    and where the set-off took place on 21 November 2008. Where a chose in
                    action that <em>accrues after</em> notice of assignment had
                    been given, it can still be subject to set-off provided that there was an
                        <em>agreement</em> made between the debtor and the
                    assignor <em>prior</em> to the notice of assignment to
                    set-off the last accrued chose in action against the cross debt, and provided
                    that the chose in action arose from a contract entered into prior to the notice.
                    In <em>Watson v Mid Wales Railway Co</em> (1867) LR 2 CP
                    593 (“<em>Watson”</em>), the maker of a bond
                    granted a lease to the original bondholder. The original bondholder had assigned
                    the bond. The lease was granted after the making of the bond but before the
                    notice of assignment had been given to the maker. It was held that the rent that
                    had <em>accrued due after</em> the notice of assignment
                    could not be set off against the assignee, unless it could be <em>inferred</em> from the evidence that there was an agreement between
                    the maker and the original bondholder to set-off the rent against the
                    debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    It was held in <em>Watson</em> that if there were sufficient facts to support the
                        <em>inference</em> of a contractual set-off agreement,
                    the agreement would be an equity that the assignee had taken subject to.
                    However, the Court there found there were insufficient facts to support such an
                    inference. It was held at page 600 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…if there is to be <em>implied</em>, or
                            <em>fairly to be presumed from the transaction, an
                            agreement, or an understanding amounting to a contract</em>, that
                        the one shall go in liquidation of the other, and the balance only be
                        considered as the debt between the parties, <em>then each
                            party has a right to demand that the one claim shall not be enforced
                            independently of the other</em>. But there is no such thing
                        here…there is nothing to support the inference that the one was
                        contracted with any reference to the other, or that there was any agreement
                        that the defendants should only pay the balance of the two. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I find that there had not been sufficient
                    notice of the assignment given in the 11 November 2008 telephone
                    conversation. The requisite notice was given on 25 November 2008 when the
                    defendant received the plaintiff’s letter dated 17 November 2008. In
                    any case, the existence of the set-off agreement predated the alleged date of
                    notice. Even if the 11 November 2008 conversation had been sufficient
                    notice, the plaintiff takes subject to the debts that had <em>accrued</em> prior to the notice on 11 November 2008. The
                    plaintiff also takes subject to the invoice which had accrued on
                    12 November, as there had been a pre-existing set-off agreement made
                        <em>prior</em> to the notice (on 11 November 2008)
                    to set off that debt.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Although notice of the assigned receivables

                    28 July 2008 and 18 August 2008 came at a later date, via the
                    17 December 2008 letter from the plaintiff. By Tan’s own admission
                    (and para 20 of the plaintiff’s opening statement), the letter dated
                    17 November 2008 had omitted two notifications of the assignments of
                    receivables dated 28 July 2008 and 18 August 2008. The plaintiff sent a
                    subsequent letter dated 17 December 2008 with the attached

                    notice, per Lord Denning MR at 613:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It seems to me to be unnecessary that it should give the date of the
                        assignment so long as it makes it plain that there has in fact been an
                        assignment so that the debtor knows to whom he has to pay the debt in the
                        future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The decision of <em>Van
                        Lynn</em> can be distinguished because in that case, there had only
                    been one lump sum debt involved. As such, there was no need to specify the date
                    of assignment to identify the relevant assignment. In the present case, there
                    were <em>several</em> assignments made at <em>different</em> dates. As such, the plaintiff’s omission
                    to include the two notifications in the 17 November 2008 letter was
                    insufficient notice. Indeed, Lord Denning had implicitly accepted (at
                    page 612) the requirement to specifically identify the relevant assignment
                    when he endorsed the principle that there is no valid notice if a <em>wrong</em> date of assignment had been given:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There is the case of <em>Stanley v. English Fibres
                            Industries Ltd</em>., which was accepted and applied by this court
                        in <em>W. F. Harrison &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Burke</em>.
                        Those cases show that, if a notice of assignment purports to identify the
                        assignment by giving the date of the assignment, and that date is a wrong
                        date, then the notice is bad. The short ground of those decisions was that
                        the notice with a wrong date was a notice of a non-existing document.
                        Assuming those cases to be correct, they leave open the question whether it
                        is necessary to give the date of the assignment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    As such, I find that the proper notice of
                    the two assignments dated 28 July 2008 and 18 August 2008 had been
                    given only by the plaintiff’s letter dated 17 December
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    It follows from my findings that the
                    plaintiff’s claim is dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed
                    unless otherwise agreed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    In regard to costs, the defendant had made
                    an Offer to Settle to the plaintiff on 6 January 2010 pursuant to Order 22A of
                    the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”) in the following
                    terms:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the plaintiff to discontinue this suit with no
                            order as to costs with the Notice of Discontinuance to be filed and
                            served within seven days of the date of acceptance of the Offer to
                            Settle;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">each party would bear its own costs of this suit
                            save where the court had ordered otherwise prior to the Offer To
                            Settle;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the terms of the Offer To Settle would constitute
                            a full and final settlement of all the plaintiff’s claims made in this
                            suit.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    As the plaintiff did not accept the
                    defendant’s Offer To Settle and its claim is dismissed, the plaintiff has failed
                    to obtain a judgment more favourable than the terms of the defendant’s Offer to
                    Settle. The defendant is consequently entitled, under Order 22A rule 9(3) of the
                    Rules, to costs on a standard basis up to and including 6 January 2010 and
                    thereafter to costs on an indemnity basis, and I so order.</p>
