        Tan Lee Meng J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, Mdm Zhu Yong Zhen
                    (“Mdm Zhu”) sued the first defendant, American International
                    Assurance Company, Limited (“AIA”), for breach of contract and the
                    second defendant, her former solicitor, Mr Chia Ti Lik
                    (“Mr Chia”), for colluding with AIA against her. She appealed
                    against a number of orders made by Assistant Registrar Jason Chan (“AR
                    Chan”), which included the striking out of her claim against AIA and
                    Mr Chia and the dismissal of her application to strike out AIA’s
                    defence and counterclaim and Mr Chia’s defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       At the outset, it may be noted that although AIA
                    and Mr Chia are the only defendants in the action, Mdm Zhu alleged in
                    her Statement of Claim that another of her former solicitors, Ms Carrie
                    Gill (“Ms Gill”) from M/s Engelin Teh Partnership
                    (“ETP”), had also colluded with AIA to give the latter
                    “defending and fighting power” against her. She also alleged that
                    Mr Amarjeet Singh SC, the independent Adjudicator who had tried to resolve
                    her dispute with AIA, was not independent and had wasted her time. Finally,
                    Mdm Zhu asserted that a Senior Assistant Registrar and an Assistant
                    Registrar of the Supreme Court had taken deliberate steps to sabotage her claim
                    against AIA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       I dismissed Mdm Zhu’s appeal against
                    AR Chan’s decisions to strike out her claim against AIA and Mr Chia,
                    and to dismiss her application to strike out AIA’s defence and
                    counterclaim and Mr Chia’s defence. The reasons for my decision are
                    set out below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       AIA’s life policies include policies that
                    enable the assured to participate in the company’s surpluses in the form
                    of dividends. Two such policies are the “Financial Guardian”
                    policies and the “Whole Life Participating With Dividends”
                    policies. Some of these policies that had been sold between 1 May 1986 and
                    20 April 1994 included a feature known as the “critical
                    year”, which refers to the year in which the life policy would have
                    accumulated sufficient dividends to enable the policyholder to continue to enjoy
                    life assurance coverage without having to pay any more premiums. AIA issued
                    documents explaining the critical year feature but it maintained that while a
                    critical year may be projected, there was no guarantee that it would not shift
                    because much depended on the amount of dividends declared annually and on the
                    interest rate earned by the accumulated dividends. In fact, the document
                    illustrating the critical year feature made it clear that dividends and interest
                    rate were not guaranteed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In 1993, Mdm Zhu effected a
                    “Financial Guardian” life policy (“the policy”) with
                    a critical year feature with AIA. The assured sum under her policy No L518324553
                    was $200,000 and the policy enabled her to participate in the company’s
                    surpluses in the form of dividends. Her annual premium was
                $3,883.00.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Before the policy was effected, Mdm Zhu had
                    discussions with AIA’s representative, Mr Oscar Huang
                    (“Oscar”), who gave her a document that illustrated the critical
                    year feature for an assured sum of $100,000, and not $200,000, which was the
                    assured sum in her case. Mdm Zhu referred to this document as an
                    “Original Policy Quotation” or “OPQ” while AIA
                    called it a “Policy Benefit Illustration”. As these titles did not
                    appear on this document, it will hereinafter be referred to as “the CY
                    document”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It is crucial to note that while the
                    calculations in the CY document showed that the critical year was the
                        16<sup>th</sup> year after the policy had been effected, the
                    CY document expressly provided that the calculations were based on the current
                    rate of dividends and an interest rate of 7%, both of which were not guaranteed.
                    These disclaimers were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(1)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">THE DIVIDENDS
                            ARE BASED ON CURRENT SCALE. <em>FUTURE DIVIDENDS ARE NOT
                                GUARANTEED</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">(3)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">THE INTEREST RATE USED … FOR ACCUMULATION
                            IS 7%. <em>THIS RATE IS NOT GUARANTEED</em> AND IS
                            USED FOR <em>ILLUSTRATION PURPOSES
                            ONLY</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       After her discussions with Oscar, Mdm Zhu
                    applied for the policy on 14 May 1993. The application form submitted by
                    her to AIA contained the following important declaration by her:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>No statement, information</em> or agreement made
                        or given by or to the person soliciting or taking this application by or to
                        any other persons <em>shall be binding</em> on the
                        Company, <em>unless reduced to writing, and then, if
                            presented to and approved by an officer specified in the
                            policy</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Furthermore, the application form contained the
                    following clause as to when the policy would take effect:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any insurance herein applied for shall not take effect unless and until
                        the relevant policy is/are issued and delivered to me on this application
                        and the first premium thereon actually paid in full during my lifetime and
                        good health provided, however that if any payment of premium is made in cash
                        at the time of signing this application and a conditional binding deposit no
                        ….. dated …. issued therefore, the terms of the receipt shall
                        apply hereto and are agreed to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     It was not disputed that when Mdm Zhu
                    signed the application, she did not pay the premium in cash.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The policy that was issued to Mdm Zhu
                    contained an “entire agreement clause”, which provided that
                    “the policy and the application for it, a copy of which is attached to
                    and made a part of the policy, constitute the entire contract”. The CY
                    document was not attached to or made a part of the policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Notwithstanding the express terms of the CY
                    document, which clearly stated that the interest of 7% was not guaranteed, her
                    declarations in the application form and the entire agreement clause in the
                    policy, Ms Zhu claimed that she understood the CY document to be a
                    contractual promise by AIA that the policy would reach the critical year in
                    2008. However, AIA contended that the CY document shown to Mdm Zhu by Oscar
                    before she applied for the policy had merely illustrated the position for a
                    $100,000 policy on the basis that dividends were based on the then current scale
                    and interest rate on accumulated dividends did not dip below 7%. It also pointed
                    out that Mdm Zhu had not asked for a document that illustrated the critical
                    year for a $200,000 policy such as the one that she effected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     There were other policyholders who were
                    affected by problems relating to the critical year feature in their policies.
                    AIA announced a number of packages for affected policyholders and in 2003, it
                    appointed an independent Adjudicator to resolve individual cases of
                    policyholders who accepted the adjudication process. AIA agreed to abide by the
                    decision of the Adjudicator. The Adjudicator at the material time was
                    Mr Amarjeet Singh SC, a former judicial commissioner of the Supreme
                    Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In early 2008, AIA wrote to Mdm Zhu to
                    inform her about a range of alternatives in relation to the future of her
                    policy. AIA also stated that if she did not respond to the letter, it would be
                    assumed that she would continue to pay her premium, in which case, the cover
                    afforded by the policy would be unaffected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 9 April 2008, Mdm Zhu wrote to
                    AIA to explain that she did not have to pay any premiums after 2008. She
                    enclosed a copy of the CY document to support her case. AIA replied that her
                    policy was for $200,000 and the projected critical year in her case was 15 years
                    and not 16 years, as shown in the CY document, which related to a policy for
                    $100,000 and not $200,000. Thereafter, Mdm Zhu and AIA had a lengthy
                    exchange of letters. In March 2009, Mdm Zhu instructed AIA to pay the
                    premium for 2009 from her dividends. AIA forwarded her a form to authorise the
                    use of her dividends to pay for the premium and asked her to sign it.
                    Mdm Zhu defaced parts of the authorisation form that were not to her
                    liking. AIA informed her that as she had defaced the authorisation form, her
                    request to use her accumulated dividends to pay for her premium for 2009 could
                    not be processed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Zhu asks AIA to invest $1.5m in her business </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 20 August 2008, Mdm Zhu wrote to
                    AIA to propose what she thought was a “win-win” manner of
                    resolving their dispute over the critical year. At that time, she required $1.5m
                    to set up a business to manufacture and sell health supplements in the form of
                    “Silver Bullets”. She asked AIA to invest $1.5m in her business to
                    end their dispute. In her e-mail on 20 August 2008, she stated as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I] do not like to see AIA get into big troubles although I am angry at
                        what AIA did in the process to revolve the dispute with me. Hence, I propose
                        a win-win solution….Here it is.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I have a business plan. I am going to look for strategic investors to
                        invest on my intended business….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">….</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I like to have your decision. <em>Could you please let me
                            know within one week?</em> After that, my proposal will lapse and
                        I will look for other investors. <em>In the meanwhile, I may
                            take the dispute to the courts and get best lawyers to sue
                            AIA</em>. It shall be a meaningful lawsuit. …
                        <em>Therefore, the key to resolve the dispute is in your
                            hands</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Mdm Zhu forwarded to AIA an <em>“Executive Summary on Manufacturing, Marketing and
                        Distributing MySilver – A High Quality Nano Product and A Special
                        Health Supplement”</em>. She also sent AIA a rather detailed
                    confidential non-disclosure agreement in relation to the proposed business
                    collaboration between her and AIA for the latter’s
                signature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     After AIA declined to invest $1.5m in her
                    company, Mdm Zhu asked AIA on 10 October 2008 to compensate her for
                    surrendering her policy. In an e-mail dated 13 October 2008, she clarified
                    that the compensation she wanted from AIA for surrendering her policy was the
                    “investment amount” (<em>ie</em> $1.5 m)
                    stated in her business plan that had been forwarded to AIA on 20 August
                    2008. In short, she now sought $1.5m from AIA without requiring the latter to
                    invest anything in her business. AIA did not accept her latest offer to settle
                    its dispute with her.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Zhu’s blog</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Mdm Zhu decided to set up a blog to
                    inform the public about her “findings” on her dispute with AIA. In
                    the blog, she accused AIA of lying to policyholders and of illegally modifying
                    the critical year with bad intentions. She also asked whether AIA was trying to
                    mislead and cheat its policyholders and added that she did not know how AIA
                    could have been ISO 9002 certified. What she wrote in her blog was the subject
                    matter of AIA’s counterclaim for defamation against her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Before Mdm Zhu put her blog online, she
                    wrote to AIA on 13 October 2008 as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     On the following day, Mdm Zhu e-mailed
                    AIA as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Since you do not intend to resolve the dispute, I suggest you to go to my
                        Blog to make a final check before I open it to the public at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Let me know if you have anything to clarify with regard to the content of
                        my Blog.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">On the same day, she also e-mailed AIA as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I understand AIA is going to be sold. But, how to get a good price if the
                        scandal of AIA is getting popular and hot tomorrow.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     AIA viewed Mdm Zhu’s blog as an
                    attempt by her to extort money from it. On 4 November 2008, its solicitors,
                    M/s Rajah &amp; Tann LLP, wrote to Mdm Zhu to demand that the blog be
                    deactivated. On 10 November 2008, she deactivated the blog.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The independent Adjudicator</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The dispute between Mdm Zhu and AIA
                    dragged on. Between November and December 2009, Mdm Zhu contacted the
                    independent Adjudicator, Mr Amarjeet Singh SC, for assistance to resolve
                    her dispute with AIA. However, she refused to complete and sign the
                    “Request for Adjudication” form (“the form”). On
                    25 December 2008, she wrote to the Adjudicator’s Office as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I like to clarify that I do wish to submit my case to the Adjudication
                        Process. But, I do not wish to sign the “Request for Adjudication
                        Form” since there is no reason for me to make any
                        declarations.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I … deeply regret that the Adjudication Process makes such kind of
                        requests.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The adjudication process was then aborted
                    because of Mdm Zhu’s refusal to complete and sign the form.
                    Mdm Zhu claimed that the Adjudicator was not independent and in
                    para 20 of her Reply and Defence to the Counterclaim, she accused the
                    Adjudicator and his assistant, Ms Jocelyn Lin, of helping AIA to frustrate
                    her “through lies, confusing messages and delays”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Zhu appoints ETP to act for her</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     In February 2009, Mdm Zhu instructed ETP
                    to act for her in relation to her dispute with AIA. Apparently, from
                    Mdm Zhu’s lengthy narration of events in her Statement of Claim, ETP
                    did not think that she had a strong case if it was based solely on the CY
                    document because it had stated that neither the dividends nor interest rate on
                    accumulated dividends were guaranteed. Mdm Zhu said that ETP had suggested
                    that her case would be strengthened if she alleged that Oscar or AIA had
                    misrepresented the position on the critical year to her. She said that she
                    rejected this suggestion and she pleaded in her Statement of Claim that there
                    had been no such misrepresentation by Oscar. She continued to believe that the
                    CY document contained all that she needed to prove her case against AIA for
                    breach of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     By May 2009 at the latest, ETP had ceased to
                    act for Mdm Zhu, who accused ETP’s Ms Gill, who had handled her
                    case, of colluding with AIA against her. Mdm Zhu alleged in her Statement
                    of Claim at para 225 that Ms Gill had had an “ulterior
                    motive” and in her written submissions for the appeal, she complained
                    that Ms Gill had sent her “plenty of misleading messages to
                    confuse” her. She even claimed at para 33 of her submissions that
                    Ms Gill had helped AIA to “steal” her documents, including
                    her policy file.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Zhu appoints Mr Chia Ti Lik to act for her</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As Mdm Zhu was dissatisfied with
                    ETP’s advice, she instructed Mr Chia to act for her against AIA. She
                    sent Mr Chia a document prepared by her entitled “Introduction of my
                    insurance dispute with AIA” (the “introduction document”).
                    She was very displeased when he did not include what she perceived to be
                    important parts of the introduction document in his draft Statement of Claim.
                    Mr Chia had explained to her that much of what she had written in the
                    introduction document should appear in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief
                    (“AEIC”) and not in the Statement of Claim. On 8 June 2009,
                    Mdm Zhu wrote to Mr Chia as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The way you wrote did not benefit my case, but otherwise. As such, I will
                        get someone else to do it and take my case. Let me know if you have any
                        explanation on the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On the following day, Mr Chia replied
                    that it was Mdm Zhu’s prerogative to find someone else to handle her
                    matter and requested her to pay $1,800 as his costs for drafting the writ of
                    summons. Mdm Zhu refused to pay the amount claimed by
                Mr Chia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Zhu acts in person</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Mdm Zhu decided to act in person. On
                    16 June 2009, she filed her writ of summons, in which she accused AIA of
                    breach of contract and Mr Chia of colluding with AIA. Unlike
                    Mr Chia’s draft Statement of Claim, which contained 11 paragraphs,
                    Mdm Zhu’s Statement of Claim contained 381 paragraphs. Undoubtedly, a
                    very large part of her Statement of Claim should, as had been advised by
                    Mr Chia, have been put into her AEIC instead.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Although her policy was for $200,000,
                    Mdm Zhu sought from AIA liquidated damages of $1,146,885.00 and
                    unliquidated damages of $800,000.00 for breach of contract and “serious
                    inappropriate doings and misconduct”. Having failed to persuade AIA to
                    invest $1.5m in her business or to compensate her $1.5m for surrendering her
                    policy, Mdm Zhu now claimed almost $2m from AIA. As for Mr Chia, to
                    whom she had paid nothing for his legal services, she claimed unliquidated
                    damages of $50,000 from him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     AIA filed its defence and counterclaimed
                    against Mdm Zhu for damages for defamation. It also applied for an
                    injunction to restrain Mdm Zhu from publishing the blog. As for
                    Mr Chia, he filed a defence denying that he had colluded with
                AIA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mdm Zhu accuses the Registry of the Supreme Court of siding with
                AIA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Mdm Zhu obviously did not understand the
                    role of the courts in the litigation process. She complained that the Registry
                    of the Supreme Court had made it difficult for her to proceed with her case and
                    that Senior Assistant Registrar Yeong Zee Kin (“SAR Yeong”) and AR
                    Chan had sabotaged her case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Mdm Zhu said that SAR Yeong arranged a
                    Pre-Trial Conference (“PTC”) on 13 January 2010 to give her
                    trouble through “unwarranted” directions and another PTC on
                    26 January 2010 to allow Mr Chia to get information from her. She also
                    alleged that SAR Yeong arranged a PTC on 9 March 2010 so that AIA could
                    “represent” her. What occurred on 9 March 2010 was that
                    AIA’s solicitor had called Mdm Zhu to remind her of a PTC scheduled
                    for that morning. She claimed that she had had no notice of the PTC and that she
                    e-mailed AIA’s solicitor as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think that you just should proceed with the PTC. If possible, could you
                        please <em>do me a favour and let me know the directions of
                            [SAR Yeong] after the PTC</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     AIA’s solicitor then messaged
                    Mdm Zhu as follows: “As agreed, we will mention on your behalf at
                    the PTC today”. Mdm Zhu saw something very sinister in what was her
                    own arrangement with AIA’s solicitor and she accused SAR Yeong for
                    allowing AIA’s solicitor to “represent” her at the PTC. This
                    was an absolutely baseless accusation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     As for AR Chan, who struck out the claims
                    against AIA and Mr Chia, Mdm Zhu wrote to the Registry on
                    21 April 2010 to object to any publication of his judgment in the media. In
                    her written submissions at the hearing of her appeal, she accused AR Chan of
                    being biased. She also alleged that AR Chan had not informed her of a vacated
                    hearing on 15 December 2009 so that the defendants could “harass and
                    threaten her” without explaining how this could have been the case. She
                    also accused AR Chan of arranging an “unwarranted” hearing on
                    23 December 2009 in order to waste her time, and a “dummy”
                    hearing on 1 March 2010 to undermine her case.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Whether or not the CY document was part of the
                    contract between AIA and Mdm Zhu was a question which could be suitably
                    determined under O 14 r 12 of the ROC without a full trial. After all,
                    Mdm Zhu’s case was that the CY document proved her case against AIA
                    and she pleaded in her Statement of Claim at para 17:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The dispute between the Plaintiff and [AIA] is on the first page of [the
                        CY document]. <em>The dispute is about whether the policy,
                            dividends, policy values and the premium-paying period that the first
                            page of [the CY document] are guaranteed or just for illustration
                            purposes only</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The CY document was not a part of the contract
                    between AIA and Mdm Zhu. It was furnished to her by Oscar <em>before</em> her application for the policy, which was her
                    offer to AIA to enter into the contract of assurance. In her application form,
                    Mdm Zhu had categorically declared that no statement, information or
                    agreement given by anyone soliciting or taking her application “shall be
                    binding on the company” unless it was presented to and approved by an
                    officer specified in the policy. She did not assert that the requisite approval
                    had been obtained for the CY document to be binding on AIA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     In any case, even if the CY document had been
                    a part of the contract, it did not guarantee that the projected critical year
                    was fixed. Mdm Zhu accepted that it was stated in the CY document that the
                    dividends payable and the interest rate on accumulated dividends were not
                    guaranteed. However, she advanced the preposterous argument that as only the
                    dividends and interest rate on accumulated dividends were not guaranteed,
                    everything else, <em>including the critical year</em>, was
                    guaranteed. This argument could not be countenanced for, if the dividends and
                    interest rate were less than that illustrated in the CY document, the critical
                    year would shift. In fact, Mdm Zhu revealed in her Statement of Claim that
                    this was the position taken by her former solicitor, ETP as she pleaded at
                    para 222 as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The [document] and its surrender values at the various years is based
                            on the interest element of 7%, which is specifically stated as non
                            guaranteed. So if the interest rate changes, the surrender values will
                            change. <em>This is pure logic</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I now turn to the “entire
                    agreement” clause in the policy. In <em>Lee Chee Wei v Tan
                        Hor Peow Victor and others and another appeal</em> [2007]
                    3 SLR(R) 537 (“<em>Lee Chee
                    Wei</em>”), the Court of Appeal approved of the following statement
                    by Lightman J on the intent of such a clause in <em>Inntrepreneur Pub Co v East Crown Ltd</em> [2000]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 611, (at [7]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The purpose of an entire agreement clause is to preclude a party to a
                        written agreement from threshing though the undergrowth, and finding in the
                        course of negotiations some (chance) remark or statement (often long
                        forgotten or difficult to recall or explain) on which to found a claim such
                        as the present to the existence of a collateral warranty. The entire
                        agreement clause obviates the occasion for any such search and the peril to
                        the contracting parties posed by the need which may arise in its absence to
                        conduct such a search. For such a clause constitutes a binding agreement
                        between the parties that the full contractual terms are to be found in the
                        document containing the clause and not elsewhere, and that accordingly any
                        promises or assurances made in the course of the negotiations (which in the
                        absence of such a clause might have effect as a collateral warranty) shall
                        have no contractual force, save insofar as they are reflected and given
                        effect in that document.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>PT Panasonic Gobel
                        Indonesia v Stratech Systems Ltd</em> [2009] 1 SLR(R) 470,
                    Judith Prakash J stated (at [46]) that an entire agreement clause
                    “makes it clear to both parties that their obligations are contained
                    entirely within the bounds of the written agreement and that they should put
                    everything that they want to have contractual force into the agreement and not
                    rely on anything that was said before the contract was concluded as being
                    binding”. Similarly, in <em>IBM Singapore Pte Ltd v UNIG
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2003] SGHC 71, Tay Yong Kwang J, while
                    construing an entire agreement clause, held (at [39]) that the contractual
                    relationship between the parties was circumscribed by the signed agreements and
                    by those alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Admittedly, much will also depend on the
                    wording of the clause in question: see <em>Lee Chee
                        Wei</em>. In the present case, the entire agreement clause clearly
                    provided that “the policy and the application for it, a copy of which is
                    attached to and made a part of the policy, constitute the entire
                    contract”. As the CY document was not attached to or made a part of the
                    policy, the entire agreement clause was another reason why the CY document could
                    not be relied on by Mdm Zhu in her claim against AIA for breach of
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     I thus affirmed AR Chan’s decision that
                    the CY document was not a part of the contract of assurance and that its
                    contents could not be interpreted as guaranteeing Mdm Zhu that the critical
                    year in the policy would be reached in 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(2)   Whether the action against AIA should be struck
                out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In the light of my finding that the CY
                    document was not a part of the contract of assurance between AIA and
                    Mdm Zhu and that it did not guarantee that the critical year in the policy
                    was 2008, a question arose as to whether the court should exercise its power
                    under O 14 r 12(2) of the ROC, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon such determination, the Court may dismiss the cause or matter or make
                        such order or judgment as it thinks just.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     As Mdm Zhu’s case rested entirely
                    on her erroneous assumption that the CY document was a part of the contract and
                    that it guaranteed that the critical year would be reached in 2008, her action,
                    as pleaded, had no leg to stand on and especially so since she made it clear in
                    her Statement of Claim that Oscar had not misrepresented to her that the
                    interest rate in the CY document was guaranteed. While complaining that her
                    former solicitor, Ms Gill from ETP had told her that her case was not
                    strong unless she pleaded misrepresentation, Mdm Zhu stated at paras
                    224-226 of her Statement of Claim as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">224</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Ms Gill was
                            convincing the Plaintiff of her misleading logic and theory and
                            convincing the Plaintiff to involve Oscar Huang in the
                        case.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">….</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">225</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Ms Gill revealed her <em>ulterior motive</em> to involve Oscar Huang through her email
                            ….</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">226</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The Plaintiff was surprised that Ms Gill
                            intended to let Oscar Huang state that the interest rate is a finite
                            while the [CY document] stated that the interest rate is not guaranteed.
                            She dared to lie to the Plaintiff openly. <em>It is
                                impossible that either Oscar Huang or the Plaintiff had stated that
                                the interest rate is a definite</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     As the foundation on which Mdm Zhu
                    asserted her claim disappeared, it followed that her claim against AIA had to be
                    dismissed. After all, she had pleaded in her Statement of Claim at para 222
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[AIA] did not repudiate the Plaintiff’s policy, did not force the
                        Plaintiff to surrender her policy, did not attempt to terminate her policy,
                        and did not unilaterally change the terms and conditions of the
                        policy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     For the reasons stated, I affirmed AR
                    Chan’s decision to dismiss her claim against AIA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(3)   Whether Mdm Zhu’s claim against Mr Chia
                should be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In SUM 4926 of 2009, Mr Chia applied for
                    Mdm Zhu’s claim of collusion against him to be struck out under
                    O 18 r 19 (1)(a) of the ROC on the ground that it disclosed no
                    reasonable grounds of action. His application was allowed by AR
                Chan.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     That an action should not be too readily
                    struck out has been emphasized by the courts on numerous occasions. In <em>Gabriel Peter &amp; Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and
                        others</em> [1997] 3 SLR(R) 649 (“<em>Gabriel Peter</em>”), the Court of Appeal explained at [18] as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases that the power of
                        striking out should be invoked. … It should not be exercised by a
                        minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case in
                        order to see if the plaintiff really has a cause of action. The practice of
                        the courts has been that, where an application for striking out involves a
                        lengthy and serious argument, the court should decline to proceed with the
                        argument unless, not only does it have doubts as to the soundness of the
                        pleading but, in addition, it is satisfied that striking out will obviate
                        the necessity for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a
                        trial.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     While the courts are slow to utilise their
                    draconian power to strike out an action, a case which is hopelessly doomed to
                    fail will be struck out. In <em>Bandung Shipping Pte Ltd v Keppel
                        TatLee Bank Ltd</em> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 295 , Chao Hick
                    Tin JA explained at [34] that allowing a hopeless claim to proceed to trial
                    would be to compel the defendant to expend time and money in defending a case
                    with no merit whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the present case, as Mr Chia asserted
                    that Mdm Zhu’s Statement of Claim disclosed no reasonable cause of
                    action against him, reference may be made to <em>Gabriel
                        Peter</em>, where the Court of Appeal explained as follows at
                    [21]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The guiding principle in determining what a "reasonable cause of action"
                        is under O 18 r 19(1)(a) was succinctly pronounced by Lord Pearson
                        in Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association [1970] 1 All ER 1094. A
                        reasonable cause of action, according to his lordship, connotes a cause of
                        action which has some chance of success when only the allegations in the
                        pleading are considered. As long as the statement of claim discloses some
                        cause of action, or raises some question fit to be decided at the trial, the
                        mere fact that the case is weak and is not likely to succeed is no ground
                        for striking it out. Where a statement of claim is defective only in not
                        containing particulars to which the defendant is entitled, the application
                        should be made for particulars under O 18 r 12 and not for an
                        order to strike out the statement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Mr Chia asserted that while
                    Mdm Zhu’s claim against him appeared to be based on the tort of
                    conspiracy, there was no proper pleading that he had committed such a tort. In
                    her written submissions, Mdm Zhu stated her case confusingly in Part 3
                    para 4 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In [this] action I sue [Mr Chia] for his <em>serious
                            breach of trust</em>. I verily believe that he colluded with [AIA]
                        to sabotage and jeopardise my case and my claim when he acted for me against
                        [AIA] in May and June 2009. I believe that he committed serious wrongdoings
                        and misconduct.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mdm Zhu’s allegation that
                    Mr Chia colluded with AIA, as pleaded in her Statement of Claim, rested
                    entirely on her dissatisfaction with the draft Statement of Claim prepared by
                    Mr Chia. Her references to Mr Chia in her Statement of Claim were
                    found under the heading “The 1<sup>st</sup> and
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant were <em>suspected</em> to have colluded on the Plaintiff’s case; a
                        <em>problematic draft of the Writ of
                    Summons</em>” (emphasis added). In para 76 of her reply,
                    Mdm Zhu made her position clearer by stating that she averred that there
                    was collusion between AIA and Mr Chia. However, nothing in the Statement of
                    Claim suggested that Mr Chia had colluded with AIA. All that had been
                    pleaded was a litany of complaints against Mr Chia’s handling of the
                    case. At para 350 of her Statement of Claim, Mdm Zhu pleaded as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The draft was full of mistakes and errors. It was ambiguous and hideous
                            (<em>sic</em>) messy. It was difficult to
                        understand. There was no single paragraph clear, correct or beneficial to
                        the Plaintiff’s case. There was nothing correct except who the
                        Defendant is.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Mdm Zhu’s written submissions were
                    also focussed on complaints about the Statement of Claim drafted by
                    Mr Chia. She was unhappy that the draft Statement of Claim was delivered
                    late, that it was “extremely short”, that it did not contain
                    “any correct paragraph”, that it was “full of
                    mistakes” and that it “did not plead any correct
                    facts”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Mdm Zhu was also suspicious as to why
                    Mr Chia wrote to AIA’s solicitors, Rajah &amp; Tann LLP, and her
                    former solicitors, ETP, before the writ was issued. With regard to this,
                    Mr Chia had explained to her as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">My purpose in writing to Rajah &amp; Tann is that as a matter of
                        professional conduct, I have come to be aware that Rajah &amp; Tann are
                        acting for AIA and also that you were previously represented by Engelin Teh
                        &amp; Partners. In order for proper housekeeping and order, it is imperative
                        that before we issue the writ, I inform Engelin Teh that I am taking over
                        the conduct of the matter and that before we serve the writ we ask that
                        Rajah &amp; Tann confirm its instructions to accept service of the writ on
                        behalf of AIA. This is part of the professional conduct which I am supposed
                        to adhere to as a lawyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Despite Mr Chia’s clarification,
                    Mdm Zhu stated in her Statement of Claim that she did not understand the
                    former’s logic in writing to ETP as she had informed him that ETP was no
                    longer acting for her.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Instead of dealing with events or documents
                    that suggested that Mr Chia had colluded with AIA, Mdm Zhu had merely
                    posed a number of questions to him in her Statement of Claim at para 373
                    and added that if he had not colluded with AIA, he should have been able to
                    answer them easily. The questions are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">a.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Why did he not ask the Plaintiff to sign any

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">b.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Why did he not inform the Plaintiff his service

                            first. If the Plaintiff satisfied with his draft, he would quote his
                            price for writing the writ. He is an experienced lawyer. He should be
                            very clear how he charges clients.</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     When asked why she had pleaded that
                    Mr Chia had colluded with AIA when the facts relied on by her did not
                    support such an assertion, Mdm Zhu strayed completely from the issue at
                    hand and suggested that Mr Chia was guilty of breach of
                trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     As there was nothing in the pleadings to
                    suggest that Mr Chia had colluded with AIA, it was plain and obvious that
                    Mdm Zhu’s case against him for conspiracy could not succeed. As such,
                    I affirmed AR Chan’s decision to strike out Mdm Zhu’s claim
                    against Mr Chia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(4)   Mdm Zhu’s application to strike out AIA’s
                defence and counterclaim and Mr Chia’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As I had dismissed Mdm Zhu’s claim
                    against AIA, her application to strike out AIA’s defence became an
                    academic question. Even so, it may be noted that Mdm Zhu’s approach
                    was that AIA had no defence because the latter had denied her claim with a pack
                    of lies. She could not understand that the veracity of AIA’s defence
                    should have been tested during the trial and not at this stage of the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     As for Mdm Zhu’s application to
                    strike out the counterclaim, she argued that AIA had no case because the latter
                    had not said that her words were untrue and had primarily been concerned with
                    the determination of the meaning of her allegedly defamatory words. This
                    argument was flawed as AIA had pleaded that the contents of Mdm Zhu’s
                    blog were “false and defamatory” and that she had acted with
                    malicious intent and ill-will.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     As Mdm Zhu did not have any convincing
                    argument as to why AIA’s defence and counterclaim should be struck out
                    under O 18 r 19 of the ROC, her appeal against AR Chan’s
                    dismissal of her striking out application was dismissed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     As for Mdm Zhu’s appeal with
                    respect to her application to strike out Mr Chia’s defence to her
                    claim, and for judgment to be entered against the latter for colluding with AIA,
                    this also became an academic issue after her claim against Mr Chia was
                    struck out. All the same, it ought to be noted that the application to strike
                    out Mr Chia’s defence had no merit. In his Defence, Mr Chia
                    pleaded that his draft Statement of Claim had correctly set out
                    Mdm Zhu’s claim in contract, that he had not conducted himself
                    inappropriately in relation to the matter and that pending discovery and/or
                    interrogatories, he was not obliged to answer the many questions posed to him in
                    para 373 of Mdm Zhu’s Statement of Claim. All that Mdm Zhu
                    could say about Mr Chia’s defence was that it contained lies. This
                    was not a reason to strike out Mr Chia’s defence at this stage of the
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(5)   Meaning of the allegedly defamatory words in
                Mdm Zhu’s blog</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     For the sake of completeness, it ought to be
                    mentioned that I disagreed that the meaning of the allegedly defamatory words
                    should have been determined at this stage. As such, I overruled AR Chan’s
                    decision to construe the meaning of the said words and reversed his order on
                    costs. However, as AIA has not lodged any appeal on this matter, it need not be
                    further considered in this judgement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(6)   Whether the costs awarded in the court below should be
                reduced</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Mdm Zhu complained that the costs awarded
                    by AR Chan were too high and should be reduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     AIA was awarded costs of $12,500 in the court
                    below. The hearing before AR Chan spanned 3 days. AIA’s counsel,
                    Mr Adrian Wong, who argued that the costs below should not be disturbed,
                    agreed not to ask for costs of the appeal even though he had succeeded in
                    persuading me to dismiss Mdm Zhu’s appeal in relation to whether the
                    CY document was a part of the contract and on the interpretation of the CY
                    document. AIA had also succeeded in the appeals relating to its striking out
                    application as well as that of Mdm Zhu. On the other hand, I had disagreed
                    with the court below on the question of whether the allegedly defamatory words
                    in the counterclaim should have been determined at this stage of the proceedings
                    and ordered that the determination should have been left to the trial judge. I
                    thus made no order on the costs of the appeal and did not disturb the costs
                    awarded below in relation to the determination under O 14 of the ROC and
                    the striking out applications of both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     As for Mdm Zhu’s appeal against the
                    costs of $8,500 awarded to Mr Chia by AR Chan at the hearing below, I also
                    did not vary the order. Apart from the fact that the parties had appeared before
                    AR Chan for three days, Mr Chia had agreed not to ask for the costs of the
                    hearing of the appeal even though Mdm Zhu’s appeal against the
                    striking out of the claim against him had been dismissed.</p>
