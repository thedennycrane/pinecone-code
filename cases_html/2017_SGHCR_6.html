The Patent consists of 12 claims. Of these, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendants have jointly or severally infringed claims 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11 by carrying out a number of alleged acts listed in the Plaintiff’s Particulars of Infringement (Amendment No 1) dated 2 February 2017.

Beyond this list, the validity of a patent “may not be put in issue in any other proceedings” (s 82(2) of the Patents Act). Section 82 of the Patents Act reads, in relevant part, as follows:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Proceedings in which validity of patent may be put in issue</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">82</span>.—(1) Subject to this section, the validity of a patent may be put in issue —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) by way of defence, in proceedings for infringement of the patent under section 67 or proceedings under section 76 for infringement of rights conferred by the publication of an application;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) in proceedings under section 77;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) in proceedings in which a declaration in relation to the patent is sought under section 78;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)  in proceedings before the Registrar under section 80 for the revocation of the patent; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">e</span>) in proceedings under section 56 or 58.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  The validity of a patent may not be put in issue in any other proceedings and, in particular, no proceedings may be instituted (whether under this Act or otherwise) seeking only a declaration as to the validity or invalidity of a patent.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Plaintiff objects to the Defendants putting the validity of the Unasserted Claims in issue. This is because each claim in a patent stands on its own, and even within a single patent, each individual claim has to be assessed separately (see <span class="font-italic">Astrazeneca</span><span class="font-italic"> AB v Ranbaxy (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd </span>[2012] SGHC 7 at [8] (“<span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span>”)). As such, given that the Plaintiff has not relied on the Unasserted Claims, it contends that the Defendants should not be allowed to seek invalidation of the Unasserted Claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The Plaintiff therefore brought the present application, seeking a striking out of the following: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, paragraphs 4 and 14 of the Defence and Counterclaim, to the extent that the validity of claims 2, 6, 8 and 12 of the Patent are put in issue. The paragraphs provide as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. Save that it is admitted that the Singapore Patent Application No.10201405341Y (the “Patent”) was filed on 29 August 2014 and was subsequently granted on 8 June 2016, paragraph 3 of the SOC is denied. The Defendants aver that the Patent is and has at all material times been invalid for the reasons set out in the Defendants’ Particulars of Objection.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the Defendants seek to rely on the invalidity of the Patent as set out in the Particulars of Objection filed herein as a defence to the Plaintiff’s allegations of infringement.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, paragraph 16 of the Defence and Counterclaim, which provides as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">16. The Defendants aver that the Patent has always been invalid for the reasons set out in the Particulars of Objection served herewith.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, paragraph 1 of the Particulars of Objection, to the extent that the validity of claims 2, 6, 8 and 12 of the Patent are put in issue. The paragraph provides as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1.  The alleged invention, which is the subject of the Patent is not a patentable invention, is invalid, and ought to be revoked by reason of Section 80(1)(a) of the Patents Act (Cap 221) on the basis that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a.  the alleged invention lacks novelty; …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-2 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">b.  the alleged invention of the Patent involves no inventive step. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The Defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were entitled to put in issue the validity of the entire Patent, including the Unasserted Claims, on each of the grounds stipulated in [11] below.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The issues before this court are whether the Unasserted Claims are properly put in issue by the Defendants on any of the following grounds: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) by way of <span class="font-italic">defence</span> against the Plaintiff’s infringement claim, pursuant to s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Patents Act;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) by way of a <span class="font-italic">counterclaim for groundless threats of infringement proceedings</span>, pursuant to s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Patents Act; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) by way of a <span class="font-italic">counterclaim for </span><span class="font-italic">revocation of the Patent</span>, pursuant to s 80 (read with s 91) and s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Patents Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The parties agreed that if any one or more of the above grounds are made out, the present application for striking out will fail. I turn to analyse each of the grounds in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 82(1)(a) of the Patents Act – defence against infringement claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The first issue is whether the Unasserted Claims can be put in issue by way of defence against the Plaintiff’s infringement claim, pursuant to s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Patents Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Counsel for the Plaintiff (“Mr Louis”) argued, citing the authority of <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span>, that the Unasserted Claims cannot be put in issue by way of defence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span>, the defendant applied to the Singapore Health Sciences Authority for the grant of product licences pursuant to the Medicines Act (Cap 176, Rev Ed 1985) (“the Medicines Act”). The plaintiff instituted proceedings against the defendant, seeking a declaration that certain claims (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>claims 1, 2, 3, 11 and 12) of its patent would be infringed by the defendant’s intended acts of infringement. The defendant, in its Defence and Counterclaim and Particulars of Objection, put in issue the validity of other claims (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>claims 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17 and 18) that had not been asserted.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 The court in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span> held that the defendant was not entitled to put in issue the validity of claims that had not been asserted by the plaintiff. The reasons were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Patents Act cannot be read to give the defendant the right to put in issue the validity of a patent, where the plaintiff has only alleged infringement of some (but not all) of the claims in the patent. This is by virtue of claim independence and as a matter of logic – putting a claim in issue does not function as a<span class="font-italic"> defence</span> to infringement of another claim. See <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [8]–[9].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the fact that the plaintiff may subsequently assert the other unasserted claims is more properly dealt with by the court as and when the situation arises. The court would, at that time, have to consider <span class="font-italic">inter alia </span>whether the plaintiff’s fresh assertions of the previously unasserted claims should be struck out as an abuse of the court’s process. In particular, the plea of <span class="font-italic">res judicata </span>may apply. See <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [5]–[6] and [10].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, there are practical considerations as to why a defendant should not be allowed to put in issue claims that have not been asserted. Allowing a defendant to do so would be “putting the cart before the horse” (<span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [29]), and would result in the expending of unnecessary costs and time. While the plaintiff may subsequently attempt to bring infringement proceedings for the previously unasserted claims, this may well be struck out as an abuse of process (see [16(b)] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In summary, <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>stands for the proposition that, for the purposes of s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Patents Act, a defendant can only put in issue claims that have been asserted to be infringed; there is no <span class="font-italic">carte blanche</span> for a defendant to put in issue the validity of the entire patent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 With regard to <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>counsel for the Defendants (“Ms Leow”) raised the following three arguments:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span> ought to be distinguished from the present case. Unlike the claim in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span>, which concerned a declaration of intended infringement under the Medicines Act, the present case relates to infringement proceedings commenced under the Patents Act. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span> ought to be disregarded, because that case related to a claim under the Medicines Act instead of the Patents Act and, as such, s 82(1) of the Patents Act should not have been applicable at all.  In this regard, Ms Leow cited <span class="font-italic">AstraZeneca AB (SE) v Sanofi-Aventis Singapore Pte Ltd </span>[2012] SGHC 16 (“<span class="font-italic">Sanofi-Aventis</span>”) at [30] for the proposition that an action brought pursuant to s 12A of the Medicines Act is “incompatible” with a patent infringement action brought under s 67 of the Patents Act. Ms Leow further suggested that the incompatibility between the two legislative regimes was “the fundamental reason” that the court in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>found that the defendant was unable to put the validity of the entire patent in issue under s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Patents Act. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, unlike the Defendants, the defendant in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>could not avail itself of any of the other grounds in s 82 of the Patents Act (<span class="font-italic">viz</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to (<span class="font-italic">e</span>) of the Patents Act). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In my view, the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is applicable to the present application, for four reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, while the underlying claim in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(under the Medicines Act) is different from the underlying claim in the present case (under the Patents Act), the mere fact of this difference does not, in and of itself, mean that the <span class="font-italic">reasoning</span> in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>is of no application. Indeed, given that the decision in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>was specifically based on s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Patents Act, the reasoning <span class="font-italic">ought</span> to be considered in the present application. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the relevant holding in <span class="font-italic">Sanofi-Aventis </span>is that s 12A of the Medicines Act provides a separate cause of action from s 67 of the Patents Act. The issue of whether s 82 of the Patents Act applies to a cause of action under s 12A of the Medicines Act was not discussed at all in <span class="font-italic">Sanofi-Aventis</span>. As such, the “incompatibility” referred to by Ms Leow (see [18(b)] above) does not have any direct bearing on the applicability or persuasiveness of the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span>. Indeed, it ought to be noted that Ms Leow’s alleged “fundamental reason” for the decision in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span> was neither mentioned in, nor implied by, the published decision itself. It should also be noted that the decisions in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy </span>and <span class="font-italic">Sanofi-Aventis </span>were rendered just 6 days apart, and that the former decision did not appear to have been cited to the court deciding the latter case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, in <span class="font-italic">Sanofi-Aventis</span>, the court recognised that actions under both s 12A of the Medicines Act and the Patents Act similarly require that the allegedly infringing product must fall squarely within the claim of the patent (see <span class="font-italic">Sanofi-Aventis </span>at [31], read with [19] and [23]). This is consistent with the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span>, <span class="font-italic">viz</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>that infringement is tied to specific patent claims. It also implies that the invalidation of an unasserted claim is no defence to infringement of an asserted claim.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, even assuming that the court in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>had incorrectly proceeded on the basis of s 82 of the Patents Act, the three reasons highlighted at [16] above continue to hold true in the context of infringement proceedings taken out under the Patents Act. In this regard, Ms Leow did not provide any compelling reason to justify putting the Unasserted Claims in issue by way of defence. While she argued that a claim under s 12A of the Medicines Act deals with intended infringement (<span class="font-italic">contra </span>actual infringement), the point remains that the question of infringement – whether<span class="font-italic"> intended </span>or <span class="font-italic">actual </span>– is tied to specific asserted claims in the patent (see the analysis of <span class="font-italic">Sanofi-Aventis </span>at [19(c)] above).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 As such, applying the approach at [16] above, I find that the Defendants are <span class="font-italic">not</span> entitled to put the Unasserted Claims in issue by way of defence under s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Patents Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 82(1)(b) of the Patents Act – counterclaim for groundless threats</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The next issue is whether the Unasserted Claims can be put in issue by way of a counterclaim for groundless threats of infringement proceedings, under s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Patents Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Ms Leow argued that the validity of the entire Patent, including the Unasserted Claims, can be put in issue once groundless threats proceedings are brought. She cited the following reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, nothing in the plain wording of s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Patents Act imports a restriction against putting the validity of the entire Patent in issue in groundless threats proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, none of the Plaintiff’s threats complained of had made reference to any specific claims in the Patent. As such, the Defendants are entitled to put the validity of the entire Patent in issue.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the scope of infringement proceedings is irrelevant to proceedings for groundless threats, because the commencement of proceedings is, in itself, not a “threat” (citing <span class="font-italic">Singsung</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v LG 26 Electronics Pte Ltd (trading as S Electrical Trading) </span>[2016] 4 SLR 86 at [134], in the context of the Copyright Act). It follows that the entire Patent can be put in issue regardless of the fact that the Plaintiff has relied only on selected claims in the Patent. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, there are precedent cases, such as <span class="font-italic">Siegfried </span><span class="font-italic">Demel (Trading as Demotec Siegfried Demel) v C &amp; H Jefferson (A Firm) and Another </span>[1999] FSR 204 (“<span class="font-italic">Siegfried</span>”), in which the validity of entire patents have been put in issue in groundless threats proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Mr Louis submitted that only asserted claims can be put in issue in groundless threats proceedings. He raised the following three counter-arguments to Ms Leow’s position that the Defendants have a <span class="font-italic">carte blanche </span>right to invalidate the entire Patent in groundless threats proceedings:  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Ms Leow’s position flies in the face of the express wording and structure of s 77 of the Patents Act. In particular, the phrase “in a relevant respect” in s 77(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Patents Act (the relevant legislation is reproduced at [24] below) precluded the Defendants from putting the Unasserted Claims in issue. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, allowing the Defendants to put the Unasserted Claims in issue would result in wasted time and costs for the parties as well as the court. The statutory framework could not have been intended to entitle a party to embark on a pointless and often costly exercise of invalidating unasserted claims of a patent, when these are ultimately irrelevant to the groundless threats proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, on closer inspection of the cases cited by Ms Leow as examples of the validity of entire patents being put in issue in groundless threats proceedings, none of these were helpful to her case. For instance, with regard to <span class="font-italic">Siegfried</span>, the parties had in fact commenced separate applications for revocation of the patent in question.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Section 77 of the Patents Act provides the statutory framework for groundless threats proceedings. Of relevance to the present application is s 77(1)–(3) of the Patents Act, reproduced below. To avoid doubt, the reference to “plaintiff” therein includes a plaintiff in a counterclaim (<span class="font-italic">viz</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the Defendants, in the present case).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedy for groundless threats of infringement proceedings</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">77</span>.—(1) Where a person (whether or not the proprietor of, or entitled to any right in, a patent) by circulars, advertisements or otherwise threatens another person with proceedings for any infringement of a patent, a person aggrieved by the threats (whether or not he is the person to whom the threats are made) may, subject to subsection (4), bring proceedings in the court against the person making the threats, claiming any relief mentioned in subsection (3).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  In any such proceedings, the plaintiff shall, if he proves that the threats were so made and satisfies the court that he is a person aggrieved by them, be entitled to the relief claimed unless —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) the defendant proves that the acts in respect of which proceedings were threatened constitute or, if done, would constitute an infringement of a patent; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the patent alleged to be infringed is not shown by the plaintiff to be invalid in a relevant respect.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3)  The said relief is —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) a declaration to the effect that the threats are unjustifiable;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) an injunction against the continuance of the threats; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) damages in respect of any loss which the plaintiff has sustained by the threats.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 In my view, s 77 of the Patents Act should be approached as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) A person (“the threatenor”), whether or not the proprietor of the patent in question, threatens another person with proceedings for infringement of the patent. There is no requirement that the threat must stipulate the specific claims of the patent that are allegedly infringed; indeed, in many cases, there would probably be no such specificity in the threats. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) A person aggrieved by the threats (“the aggrieved person”), whether or not he is the person to whom the threats are made, brings proceedings in court against the threatenor, for the making of groundless threats. The aggrieved person will have to prove <span class="font-italic">both</span> that the threats were made, <span class="font-italic">and</span> that he is a person aggrieved by them. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If the threatenor does not seek to justify the threats made, the aggrieved person succeeds on his claim for groundless threats. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) If the threatenor seeks to defend himself against the claim for groundless threats, he will have to justify the threats made. In this regard: </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) The threatenor will have to prove that the patent has been, or will be, infringed by the acts in respect of which the threats were made. In doing so, he must necessarily <span class="font-italic">specify the claim or claims</span> that he alleges have been, or will be, infringed. If he fails to prove actual or potential infringement of those claims, the aggrieved person succeeds on his claim for groundless threats. For example, in <span class="font-italic">Bean Innovations Pte Ltd and another v </span><span class="font-italic">Flexon (Pte) Ltd </span>[2001] 2 SLR(R) 116, the patent proprietor sought to defend itself against groundless threats proceedings by relying on only one claim of its patent. It was unable to establish infringement of this specific claim. As such, the aggrieved party succeeded in its claim for groundless threats.</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) The aggrieved person may seek to prove that the patent is invalid “in a relevant respect”, pursuant to s 77(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Patents Act. This means that he must seek to invalidate the <span class="font-italic">specific claims</span> that were relied upon by the threatenor in the threatenor’s defence against the claim for groundless threats. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The crux of the issue before me is whether the phrase “in a relevant respect” in s 77(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Patents Act limits an aggrieved person to putting <span class="font-italic">only </span>the specific asserted claims in issue; or, put the other way, whether the phrase <span class="font-italic">precludes </span>an aggrieved person from putting unasserted claims in issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 On the one hand, the phrase itself does not expressly prescribe any preclusion of putting unasserted claims in issue. Indeed, as a “relevant respect” of a patent is, by definition, a <span class="font-italic">subset</span> of the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> patent, invalidating the <span class="font-italic">entire </span>patent will necessarily also mean that the patent is invalid “in a relevant respect”. As such, the phrase may be interpreted simply to mean that an aggrieved person does not have the burden to invalidate the entire patent in order to make out his claim for groundless threats; all he has to do is to show that a “relevant respect” – <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the asserted claims – of the patent is invalid. A literal interpretation therefore does not determine whether or not an aggrieved person is <span class="font-italic">precluded </span>from putting unasserted claims in issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 On the other hand, there is merit in Mr Louis’ observation that, in the context of groundless threats proceedings, it would be entirely futile for an aggrieved person to put the validity of unasserted claims in issue. This is because invalidating those claims would not assist, in any way, his claim for groundless threats. To illustrate, if a threatenor defends against a groundless threats claim by contending that claims 1 and 2 of a 4-claim patent have been infringed, it is pointless for the aggrieved person to prove that claims 3 and 4 of the patent are invalid – for even if he successfully so proves, he still fails to make out his claim for groundless threats. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 For the reasons stated in [28] above, in the context of groundless threats proceedings, the issue of validity of patent claims ought to be limited to the claims for which actual or potential infringement is alleged. Precluding an aggrieved person from putting unasserted claims in issue would also be consistent with the approach taken <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>defence (see [16] read with [19] and [20], above). If the aggrieved person is really seeking to invalidate all the claims in a patent, including unasserted claims, the proper approach is for him to commence revocation proceedings, instead of relying on a claim for groundless threats.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I therefore find that the Defendants are <span class="font-italic">not</span> entitled to put the Unasserted Claims in issue by way of a counterclaim for groundless threats of infringement proceedings, under s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Patents Act.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Section 82(1)(d) of the Patents Act – counterclaim for revocation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The final issue is whether the Unasserted Claims can be put in issue by way of the Defendants’ counterclaim for revocation of the Patent. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Parties’ arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 At the hearing, Mr Louis cited s 82(2) of the Patents Act for the proposition that proceedings cannot be instituted to seek only a declaration as to the invalidity of a patent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 However, Ms Leow clarified that for the purposes of the application, the Defendants were not relying on a declaration as to the invalidity of a patent. Rather, they were relying on a separate cause of action under the counterclaim, which is for an order “that the Patent be revoked” under s 80 of the Patents Act. Paragraph 1 of the Particulars of Objection (see [9(c)] above) makes this clear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Ms Leow made the following submissions. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the validity of the entire Patent can be put in issue where revocation is brought as a counterclaim in infringement proceedings. This is because s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Patents Act permits validity of a patent to be put in issue “in proceedings before the Registrar [<span class="font-italic">viz</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the Registrar of Patents] under section 80 for the revocation of the patent”. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, while s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Patents Act makes express reference to “proceedings before the Registrar”, and s 80 of the Patents Act mentions only “the Registrar” and not “the court”, revocation proceedings can nonetheless be brought directly before the court at first instance. This is in view that s 91 of the Patents Act empowers the court to “make any order or exercise any power which the Registrar could have made or exercised… ”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Mr Louis agreed that under ss 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) read with 80 of the Patents Act, a party is entitled to put in issue <span class="font-italic">all </span>claims of a patent because, in his view, s 80 of the Patents Act “does not contain any express limitation”. In this regard, he drew a distinction between revocation proceedings and the situations envisaged under ss 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) (<span class="font-italic">viz</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>defence) and (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) (<span class="font-italic">viz</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>claim for groundless threats) of the Patents Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 However, he contended that the right to institute revocation proceedings is confined to proceedings before the Registrar, citing the express wording in ss 80 and 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Patents Act (see [34(b)] above). He argued that such wording evinced a careful delineation of the proper forum for revocation proceedings to be brought at first instance. In this regard, he cited <span class="font-italic">Energenics</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Musse Singapore Pte Ltd and another suit</span> [2013] SGHCR 21 (“<span class="font-italic">Energenics</span>”) at [56]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is important to distinguish between the legislative provisions which refer to a “single point of entry” (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that the applicant must <span class="font-italic">first </span>refer a question to a specific forum, which may either be the Registrar of Patents or the High Court as specified in the relevant provision), and one where there is a “choice of points of entry” (<span class="font-italic">viz</span>, that the applicant may commence proceedings with <span class="font-italic">either </span>the Registrar of Patents <span class="font-italic">or </span>the High Court). [emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 At the hearing, I informed Mr Louis and Ms Leow that an appeal had been successfully brought against the decision in <span class="font-italic">Energenics</span>, although there is no published judgment or grounds of decision of the appeal. Nonetheless, Mr Louis maintained that the proposition in [56] of <span class="font-italic">Energenics</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>should still be considered in the present application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Finally, Mr Louis also pointed out that in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span>, the court had similarly considered a situation in which the defendant had included a prayer for revocation of the patent. The court appeared to disagree with the defendant’s attempt to “[sidestep] the statutory restriction in s 82(2)” by seeking a declaration as to invalidity along with revocation (<span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy </span>at [17]). The court concluded, at [20], that the defendant had “put the validity of the plaintiff’s unasserted patents in issue on a basis falling <span class="font-italic">outside </span>of those enumerated in s 82(1),  [and therefore] has invariably run afoul of the general rule in s 82(2)” (emphasis in original). Mr Louis thus relied on <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy</span> to argue that, in the present case, the Patent is similarly being put in issue in instances falling outside of s 82(1) of the Patents Act, and that this is contrary to s 82(2) of the Patents Act. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 It is undisputed that in revocation proceedings, a party is entitled to put the validity of <span class="font-italic">all </span>claims, including unasserted claims, in issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 It is also uncontroversial that s 91 of the Patents Act empowers the High Court to determine revocation proceedings brought under s 80 of the Patents Act. If authority is needed for this trite proposition, it suffices to cite Ng-Loy Wee Loon, <span class="font-italic">Law of Intellectual Property of Singapore </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2009) at paragraph 30.06, where the learned author observed that an application for revocation under s 80(1) of the Patents Act “may be made to the Registrar of Patents <span class="font-italic">or to the High Court</span>” (emphasis added), and included a footnote reference indicating s 91(1) of the Patents Act as the source of the High Court’s power to hear revocation proceedings.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The key issue in contention is therefore whether, in the present case, revocation proceedings may properly be commenced in the High Court at first instance.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In this regard, it should be noted that despite Mr Louis’ reliance on <span class="font-italic">Energenics</span>, the decision does not actually further his arguments. The court did <span class="font-italic">not </span>make any finding on the <span class="font-italic">existence </span>of the court’s <span class="font-italic">jurisdiction</span> to deal with issues for which the Registrar is, at least based on the wording of s 20(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Patents Act, stipulated as the port of call. Rather, it dealt with whether it was an <span class="font-italic">abuse of process</span> for a party to circumvent the legislative framework by commencing such proceedings in the High Court at the first instance (see <span class="font-italic">Energenics</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [60] and [67]). Furthermore, the decision did not deal at all with s 80 of the Patents Act, which calls for separate analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In my view, revocation proceedings can properly be commenced in the High Court at first instance, particularly (as in the present case) where infringement proceedings are already before the High Court and revocation proceedings are brought by way of counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Indeed, s 82(7) of the Patents Act supports this conclusion. That section provides that where proceedings with regard to a patent are pending in the High Court under any provision mentioned in s 82(1) of the Patents Act (including, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, proceedings for patent infringement), revocation proceedings cannot be instituted before the Registrar except with the leave of the High Court. This means that where revocation proceedings are brought as a counterclaim in proceedings concerning the patent in question, the matter <span class="font-italic">should</span>, as a starting point, be brought before the High Court at first instance, unless the High Court grants leave for the matter to go before the Registrar. There is good reason for such an approach – it will avoid a situation where infringement proceedings (which may concern the validity of specific claims in the patent) are before the High Court while revocation proceedings (which concern the validity of the entire patent) are before the Registrar, as well as the attendant risks of inconsistent decisions arising from such a bifurcation. It would generally also help to streamline proceedings within a single forum, and possibly reduce the resources expended in resolving the dispute. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I am fortified in this view by numerous examples of cases where revocation proceedings have been brought by way of a counterclaim and dealt with by the High Court. The examples cited by Ms Leow include <span class="font-italic">Main-Line Corporate Holdings Ltd v DBS Bank Ltd </span>[2012] 4 SLR 147, <span class="font-italic">Dextra</span><span class="font-italic"> Asia Co Ltd and another v Mariwu Industrial Co (S) Pte Ltd and another suit </span>[2006] 2 SLR(R) 154 and <span class="font-italic">V-Pile Technology (Luxembourg) SA and others v Peck Brothers Construction Pte Ltd </span>[1997] 3 SLR(R) 981. It has also been observed in <span class="font-italic">A Guide to Patent Law in Singapore</span> (Alban Kang gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2nd Ed, 2009) at paragraph 8.2.2, that “more often than not, issues relating to the revocation of a patent are heard in the courts rather than before the Registrar”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 As such, I find that the Defendants are entitled to put the Unasserted Claims in issue under s 82(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the Patents Act, by way of a counterclaim brought before the High Court for revocation of the Patent.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For completeness, I should also address the concern expressed in <span class="font-italic">Ranbaxy </span>about a party “sidestepping” the statutory restriction in s 82(2) of the Patents Act by seeking a declaration as to invalidity along with revocation (see [38] above). The court made no clear finding on this issue, and its eventual decision was arrived at on the basis that the defendant had run afoul of s 82(2) of the Patents Act by putting the validity of unasserted claims in issue on a basis falling <span class="font-italic">outside </span>the grounds enumerated in s 82(1) of the Patents Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In my view, when a party brings revocation proceedings, s 82(2) of the Patents Act does not preclude him from concurrently seeking a declaration as to invalidity of the patent in question. This is because he is not instituting proceedings seeking <span class="font-italic">only </span>a declaration as to invalidity – on the contrary, he is in fact seeking a declaration <span class="font-italic">together with </span>a revocation<span class="font-italic"> </span>claim, the latter itself plainly falling within the scope of s 82(1) of the Patents Act. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 One may then query as to why s 82(2) of the Patents Act precludes a party from instituting standalone proceedings for declarations of invalidity of a patent, while allowing the party to “sidestep” this preclusion simply by concurrently bringing a claim for revocation of the same patent – after all, in both situations, <span class="font-italic">all </span>of the claims in the patent are put in issue. In this regard, it should be noted that there is a distinction between a declaration as to invalidity and a revocation of a patent – the latter is executory in nature and is an additional step beyond the former. The purpose of s 82(2) of the Patents Act in precluding standalone proceedings for declarations as to invalidity is, in fact, precisely to ensure that invalid patents are not merely declared to be invalid, but are in fact revoked: see <span class="font-italic">Terrell on the Law of Patents </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 18th Ed, 2017) at para 23-78 (commenting on s 74(2) of the UK Patents Act 1977, which is <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">n pari materia </span>with s 82(2) of the Patents Act). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Based on my findings at [20], [30] and [46] above, I decline to strike out the paragraphs in the Defence and Counterclaim and the Particulars of Objection.
