<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The year 2008 saw the world economy mired in
                    what has been described as the worst financial crisis since the great depression
                    of the 1930s and its aftershocks are still being felt today. Singaporean banks
                    and financial institutions have been more fortunate than those in many other
                    countries, but not all Singaporeans were untouched by the chaos that raged
                    through the financial markets. Fears over the solvency of large and
                    once-reputable banks, declining credit availability and damaged investor
                    confidence caused the failure or acquisition of several major banking and
                    finance institutions; Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc (“Lehman”) was
                    one of these. On 15 September 2008, Lehman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
                    protection in the US. The filing marked the largest bankruptcy in US history; in
                    Singapore, it caused many individuals who had invested in Lehman-linked
                    structured investment instruments to lose their money.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This action concerns one such Lehman-linked
                    instrument. It was brought by 21 plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and 194
                    other individuals who had invested in a series of callable basket credit-linked
                    notes known as “DBS High Notes 5” (“the HN5”). These
                    were issued by the defendant under a US$3,000,000,000 structured note programme.
                    The plaintiffs in this originating summons seek a declaration that the HN5 were
                    void at the time of their issuance, and an order that the defendant
                    (a) repay each of the plaintiffs the principal amounts they invested in the
                    HN5 (less any interest they received under the same), and (b) bear the cost
                    of these proceedings. The defendant denies that the HN5 were void and apply, in
                    summons no 4834 of 2009 (“Summons 4834”), to rectify the
                    conditions that were attached to the HN5. The originating summons and Summons
                    4834 were heard together and I now give my decision in respect of both
                    matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The HN5 were launched on 30 March 2007 and
                    were intended to last a period of 5.5 years until 2012. Initially, the offering
                    was open only to existing customers of the defendant on an “invitation
                    only” basis. On 2 April 2007, the offering was made open to the
                    public.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       At the time of the offering, information
                    concerning the HN5 was available from two documents. The first was the base
                    prospectus (“Base Prospectus”) – a term I shall use
                    collectively to refer to the original prospectus dated 22 December 2005,
                    the supplementary base prospectus dated 5 April 2006 which amended the
                    original prospectus and a final version registered with the Monetary Authority
                    of Singapore (“MAS”) on 27 December 2007. This Base
                    Prospectus applied generally to govern the entire series of DBS High Note
                    Programmes – from series 1 to 5. The HN5 was, as its name suggests, the
                    fifth in the series. The second document was the pricing statement dated
                    29 March 2007 (“Pricing Statement”), which contained the
                    specific terms and conditions relating to the HN5. During the launch, interested
                    individuals were furnished with copies of the Base Prospectus, Pricing
                    Statement, and an application form (“Application Form”). The
                    Application Form was to be signed (in two places) and returned prior to 4.30pm
                    on 30 April 2007 – the closing date and time of the HN5
                    offering.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       A total of 1,127 persons invested in the HN5,
                    and these were issued to them by the defendant on 16 May 2007. Between
                    16 August 2007 and 18 August 2008, investors (including the
                    plaintiffs) received five quarterly payments of accrued interest in respect of
                    their investment in the HN5. Depending on the amount of their respective
                    investment, each of the plaintiffs received payments that ranged between
                    S$1,568.50 and S$25,096.00, and US$2,894.31 and US$12,404.22.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The structure of the HN5</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       A description of the HN5 was provided in the
                    Pricing Statement issued by the defendant:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<sup></sup>
<b>DBS High Notes 5</b> of the
                            <b>Notes</b> are 5.5-year structured credit notes
                        designed for investors seeking enhanced yield by providing exposure to a
                        first-to-default basket of geographically diversified investment grade
                            credits.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Buyers of the HN5 were promised high returns on their investment
                    – a quarterly interest rate of either 5.00% or 6.50% per annum, depending
                    on whether the investor had subscribed to the Singapore Dollar
                    (“SGD”) or United States Dollar (“USD”) Tranche
                    – until the specified maturity date in 2012. On the maturity date, they
                    would also receive 100% of the principal amount they had invested, unless prior
                    to that date, either:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a) a Credit Event occurs in relation to any one of the Reference Entities
                        under the Reference Notes; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b) a Constellation Event occurs in relation to Constellation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       In order to explain what a credit event and
                    constellation event consisted of, it is necessary to go into the details of the
                    structure underlying the HN5. The funds raised from the sale of the HN5 were
                    used to purchase another set of structured notes (“Reference
                    Notes”) issued by Constellation Investment Limited
                    (“Constellation”). The defendant was the holder of the Reference
                    Notes. Constellation was a special purpose trust company established by the
                    defendant in 2003 and incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Its
                    primary objective was the issuing of various credit-linked and other structured
                    notes to both retail and institutional investors. The defendant had previously
                    used Constellation as a vehicle to issue 70 different structured notes to retail
                    investors in Hong Kong between 2003 and 2007. The HN5 was part of a similar
                    series issued in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Constellation used the funds it raised from the
                    issue of the Reference Notes to invest in structured securities comprising of
                    collateral debt obligations (“CDOs”) issued by a Cayman
                    Islands-incorporated company, Zenesis SPC. These secured its obligations under
                    the Reference Notes and generated monetary returns, which were used to pay the
                    interest due to the investors in the HN5. As a result, the performance of the
                    HN5 (<em>ie</em> their interest yield) was directly linked
                    to the performance of the Reference Notes. In return, investors were exposed to
                    the risk of Constellation’s own bankruptcy and the risk of any of the
                    securities purchased by Constellation losing all their value. Both of these
                    risks – were they to materialise – would amount to a Constellation
                    Event. Such an event would trigger early redemption of the Reference Notes and
                    this would, in turn, trigger the termination of the HN5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       In addition to the above, however, the Reference
                    Notes were also notionally linked to the credit performance of eight reference
                    entities. The nature of this link was a “first-to-default” basis:
                        <em>ie</em>, in the event that one of these reference
                    entities failed to honour a specific financial obligation (“Reference
                    Obligation”) that was identified in the Reference Notes, the Reference
                    Notes would be redeemed, unwound and terminated. The HN5 would also suffer the
                    same fate. It is this “default” by a reference entity that
                    constitutes a credit event referred to in <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>
                    above and it is an event that is entirely independent of Constellation’s
                    own creditworthiness or even the value of the securities purchased by
                    Constellation. In effect, buyers of the HN5 were risking their money on the
                    following eventualities: that the defendant would remain solvent; that
                    Constellation would remain solvent; that none of the securities that
                    Constellation had bought with their money (the CDOs) would turn out to be
                    worthless; and that none of the eight reference entities within the
                    “first-to-default” basket would default in the 5.5-year life of
                    the HN5. As it turned out, Lehman was one of the eight reference entities. At
                    the time the Pricing Statement was issued, Lehman’s issuer credit ratings
                    by Standard &amp; Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch stood at the
                    confidence-inducing and secure-sounding levels of A+, A1 and A+
                        respectively<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> –
                    ratings that, with hindsight, can only be described as astounding in the light
                    of events that transpired.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Termination</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The trouble in the global financial markets
                    began on 3 August 2007, when, as Lehman’s own former global head
                    of quantitative equity strategies Matthew Rothman put it, “events that
                    models only predicted would happen once in 10,000 years happened every day for
                    three days.”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>
                    Investors suffered a crisis of confidence in financial instruments underpinned
                    by “sub-prime” debts and mortgages; the value of these and other
                    investment instruments crashed; and the financial markets were thrown into
                    complete turmoil. These events are too fresh and too deeply imprinted in the
                    memory of most people to require further adumbration. Just over a year later, on
                    15 September 2008, Lehman filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the US
                    Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court. This constituted an act of
                    “default” by Lehman on one of the Reference Obligations – a
                    US$1.23b subordinated note issued by Lehman and due for redemption in 2017 (the
                    “Lehman Note”) – under the Reference Notes. The Reference
                    Notes were terminated by Constellation and under the HN5 structure this in turn
                    resulted in the termination of the HN5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 19 September 2008, the defendant wrote
                    to the HN5 investors enclosing the relevant notices of credit event (which were
                    themselves dated 17 September 2008). The letters also notified investors of
                    the consequences of Lehman’s Chapter 11 petition, namely that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The HN5 had been
                    terminated.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        defendant would, as the issuer of the HN5, be redeeming the investors’
                        investments in the HN5 at the credit event redemption amount
                        (“CERA”) on the credit event redemption
                    date.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     The investors
                        would be informed of the CERA as soon as the information became
                        available.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     The
                        HN5 would have ceased to bear any interest from 16 August
                    2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 28 October 2008, the defendant wrote
                    again to the investors. The letters informed them that the CERA for the HN5 had
                    been calculated at zero. Thus, no amount would be due and payable to them on the
                    credit event redemption date (which had been fixed on 3 November 2008).
                    Each letter enclosed a Notice of CERA dated 27 October 2008 that explained
                    how the CERA was calculated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The upshot of the matter was this: over 1,000
                    investors in the HN5 who had sunk in some S$103m saw their investments (and for
                    many, their life savings) rendered worthless. According to an update on the
                    resolution of conflicts relating to Lehman-linked structured investment
                    instruments provided by MAS on 16 January 2009, approximately 200 investors
                    who complained to the defendant about the HN5 received offers of full or partial

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The descriptions of CERA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The primary issue in these proceedings
                    pertains to the calculation of CERA – the amount that investors in the HN5
                    were to receive upon the occurrence of a credit event. According to the
                    plaintiffs, the Pricing Statement they received from the defendant contained
                    four definitions of CERA. These are:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [CERA] under the Reference Notes will be based on the prevailing
                        market value of the defaulted Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The [CERA] is in summary the amount equal to the nominal value of the

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Parties’ Submissions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Having identified four definitions of CERA in
                    the Pricing Statement, the plaintiffs submit that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     The amount which the plaintiffs
                        would receive in the event of an early termination of the HN5 (<em>ie</em> the CERA) is a material term of the contract
                        between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     This amount cannot be calculated based on the four definitions of
                        CERA set out above as each of these are inconsistent with the
                    other.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     This
                        uncertainty as to a material term of the contract underlying the HN5 thereby
                        renders it void for uncertainty.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The defendant’s rebuttal to the above is
                    made on several levels. Firstly, the defendant argues that the allegedly
                    inconsistent CERA descriptions do not form part of the HN5 contract at all.
                    Secondly, even if the four descriptions do form part of the HN5 contract, there
                    can be no uncertainty about the calculation of the CERA, as:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Third CERA Description is
                        expressly designated in the Pricing Statement as the prevailing
                    one.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     The four CERA
                        descriptions were never meant to be identical descriptions of the CERA and
                        each serves a different purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     The four CERA descriptions were, in any event, accurate,
                        consistent and reconcilable (save for an obvious clerical error in the
                        Fourth CERA Description).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thirdly, the defendant claims
                    that the plaintiffs are estopped from relying on the inconsistency as ground for
                    voiding the HN5 contract; and its fourth and final point is that voiding a
                    contract (let alone one that is fully performed) for uncertainty is a measure of
                    last resort and one the court should not take if there are other devices it may
                    deploy to save the contract.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Based on the parties’ submissions, the
                    crucial issues in this case are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the HN5 contract between the
                        plaintiffs and defendant consists of the whole of, or only a part of, the
                        Base Prospectus and Pricing Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the four definitions of CERA provided in the HN5
                        contract are inconsistent with one another.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_17-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether that inconsistency necessitates the HN5
                        contract being declared void for uncertainty.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Analysis</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Identifying the contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The first issue is the identification of the
                    HN5 contract and its terms. It is the plaintiffs’ case that the entirety
                    of the Base Prospectus and Pricing Statement collectively form the contractual
                    documents of the HN5. Thus, everything found in the two documents (in particular
                    the four alleged definitions of CERA) make up contract’s terms and
                    conditions. In contrast, the defendant claims that only parts of the Base
                    Prospectus and Pricing Statement make up the HN5 contract. If the defendant is
                    right, then the outcome of its submission is that the four alleged definitions
                    of CERA will not be found within the contract at all. The question, therefore,
                    is what terms were the HN5 contracts made and agreed upon?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     In order to give an answer to that question, I
                    must consider what constituted the relevant offer and acceptance in this case.
                    Although the launch of the HN5 was billed as an
                        “offering”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> by
                    the defendant and the period between 30 March 2007 and 30 April 2007
                    termed the “Offer Period”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>this does not, of itself, render the launch (and the documents
                    handed out during that launch) an “offer” at law. Clause 7 of
                    appendix A (terms and conditions and procedures for application, acceptance and
                    cancellation) to the Pricing Statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> (“Appendix A”) grants
                    the defendant the “right to reject or to accept” any application
                    without the need to give reasons. The launch of the HN5 was, therefore, an
                    invitation to treat and it was the individual investor who, by completing,
                    signing and submitting the Application Form, made the offer to the defendant to
                    buy into the HN5. The contract came into being with the defendant’s
                    acceptance of such offer. Thus, one must look to the terms in the Application
                    Form to determine whether the Base Prospectus and Pricing Statement were
                    incorporated in part or in their entirety as part of the terms of the HN5
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The Application Form contains five sections on
                    its front and a set of terms and conditions on the reverse side. Those five
                    sections are entitled:</p>

                    which is titled “Terms and Conditions and Procedures for Application,
                    Acceptance and Cancellation.” The following statement is found in the
                    section “Terms and Conditions of the Notes” in the Pricing
                    Statement:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The plaintiffs’ position is that the
                    phrase “Terms and Conditions set out in DBS High Notes 5 Pricing
                    Statement in particular Appendix A” should be construed as incorporating
                    the entire Pricing Statement into the terms and conditions of the HN5 contract.
                    This is because there is nothing in the phrase to indicate that only those
                    sections of the Pricing Statement with the words “Terms and
                    Conditions” in their title are so incorporated – the phrase may
                    just as plausibly mean that the terms and conditions of the HN5 contract are
                    “set out” by the entire Pricing Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The parties’ dispute, therefore,
                    concerns the interpretation of the phrase “Terms and Conditions set out
                    in DBS High Notes 5 Pricing Statement”. In <em>Zurich
                        Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction
                        Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<em>Zurich Insurance</em>”) the Court of Appeal endorsed, at
                    [114], the contextual approach set out by Lord Hoffmann in <em>Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building
                        Society</em> [1998] 1 WLR 896 (“<em>Investors</em> Compensation”) at 912-913, (see also [56] of
                        <em>Zurich Insurance</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning
                            which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the
                            background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the
                            parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the
                            contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The background … includes absolutely
                            anything which would have affected the way in which the language of the
                            document would have been understood by a reasonable man.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The law excludes from the admissible background
                            the previous negotiations of the parties and their declarations of
                            subjective intent. They are admissible only in an action for
                            rectification. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    The meaning which a document ... would convey to a
                            reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The
                            meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning
                            of the document is what the parties using those words against the
                            relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean. The
                            background may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between
                            the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but even (as
                            occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties
                            must, for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax
                            ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    The “rule” that words should be
                            given their “natural and ordinary meaning" reflects the common
                            sense proposition that we do not easily accept that people have made
                            linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents. On the other
                            hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background that
                            something must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not
                            require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they
                            plainly could not have had. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Pursuant to this approach, ambiguity is not a
                    pre-requisite for admission of relevant extrinsic material showing the context
                    of the contract to determine if the language takes on another meaning instead of
                    the plain meaning of the words (<em>Zurich Insurance</em>,
                        <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> <em>supra</em> at [130]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... ambiguity is no longer a prerequisite for the court's consideration of
                        extrinsic material … thus, neither is absurdity or the existence of
                        an alternative technical meaning. Instead, the court will <em>first</em> take into account the plain language of the contract
                        together with relevant extrinsic material which is evidence of its context.
                            <em>Then, if, in the light of this context</em>,
                        the plain language of the contract becomes ambiguous (<em>ie</em>, it takes on another plausible meaning) or absurd, the
                        court will be entitled to put on the contractual term in question an
                        interpretation which is different from that demanded by its plain language.
                        This is in fact merely making explicit the role of extrinsic evidence, which
                        was previously obfuscated under the traditional approach … [emphasis
                        in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Thus, in order to determine the meaning of the phrase “Terms
                    and Conditions set out in DBS High Notes 5 Pricing Statement”, the court
                    may have recourse to anything that would have formed part of the parties’
                    background knowledge at the time of the contract. Even if the words to be
                    interpreted do not, on their face, appear to be ambiguous, the background
                    context should be considered in order to determine the existence of any latent
                    ambiguity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The only documents put in evidence
                    constituting the background to the contract are the Base Prospectus, Pricing
                    Statement, and Application Form. It is clear that the Base Prospectus and the
                    Pricing Statement are documents “which would have affected the way in
                    which the language of the [HN5 contracts] would have been understood by a
                    reasonable man”: <em>Investors Compensation</em>,
                        <em>supra</em> at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>. Both documents were given to potential investors along
                    with the Application Form and they were clearly intended to be read in
                    conjunction with the latter; indeed, Section E of the Application Form requires
                    an investor to make the application “pursuant to the Pricing Statement
                    and Base Prospectus” and asks for explicit acknowledgement of the same.
                    The information found in the Base Prospectus and Pricing Statement, therefore,
                    clearly constitutes the background knowledge made available by the defendant to
                    the plaintiffs at the time of formation of the HN5 contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     While it is not difficult to say that the Base
                    Prospectus forms part of the relevant background knowledge to the HN5 contract,
                    I do face some difficulties deciding which version of the Base Prospectus to
                    rely on. As mentioned at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a> above, there
                    were three different documents issued under the label “Base
                    Prospectus”: the original base prospectus dated 22 December 2005;
                    the supplementary base prospectus dated 5 April 2006 amending the former;
                    and a final version registered with MAS on 27 December 2007. The defendant
                    relies on a paragraph from the Base Prospectus dated 22 December 2005 to
                    demonstrate that the HN5 contract does not embody the entire Base Prospectus and
                    Pricing Statement. This is found in the section entitled “Risk
                    Factors” and states that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The descriptions of the Programme and Notes included in this Base
                        Prospectus and the applicable Issue Document [defined as the Pricing
                        Statement in the Glossary<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>] are summaries only. The
                        full terms and conditions of Notes can be reviewed by reading together the
                        following: (i) the terms and conditions as set out in full in this Base
                        Prospectus in the section on “Terms and Conditions of the
                        Notes” which constitutes the basis of all Notes to be offered under
                        the Programme, and (ii) <em>the applicable Conditions
                            Supplement which is set out in the applicable Issue Document</em>

                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     However, a check of the final, updated base
                    prospectus of 27 December 2007 reveals a significant change in the wording
                    of the same paragraph:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The descriptions of the Programme and Notes included in this Base
                        Prospectus and the applicable Issue Document are summaries only. The full
                        terms and conditions of Notes can be reviewed by reading together the
                        following: (i) the terms and conditions as set out in full in this Base
                        Prospectus in the section on “Terms and Conditions of the
                        Notes” which (subject to the applicable Issue Document) constitutes
                        the basis of all Notes to be offered under the Programme, and
                            (ii) <em>the applicable Issue Document</em>
                            …<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_24" id="Ftn_24_1"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This second version of the paragraph appears to support the
                    plaintiffs’ interpretation of the “Terms and Conditions set out in
                    DBS High Notes 5 Pricing Statement” phrase from the Application
                    Form, since there can be no doubt that the paragraph implies that the
                    “full terms and conditions of [the HN5]” may be found by reading
                    the applicable Issue Document – namely, the (entire) Pricing
                    Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Unfortunately, it appears that neither party
                    to this case noticed the inconsistency between the two versions of the base
                    prospectus. As mentioned above, the defendant relies on the first prospectus
                    dated 22 December 2005; the plaintiffs, in contrast, have tendered to this
                    court the updated version of 27 December 2007. I was given no explanation
                    for the difference, nor any account of how or when it came about. The affidavit
                    of Mr Soon Kok Tiang filed on behalf of the plaintiffs does not mention
                    which base prospectus the investors received at the time of the launch of the
                    HN5; nor does it state which version they had in their possession when they
                    submitted their Application Forms. Instead, it merely asserts that the 2005 base
                    prospectus “as updated by the [2007 base prospectus]” sets out the
                    terms and conditions of the HN5<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_25" id="Ftn_25_1"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>. In
                    contrast, Ms Debbie Lam Thuan Meng’s (“Ms Lam”)
                    affidavit filed on behalf of the defendant implies that it was the 2005 version
                    of the base prospectus that was issued to investors in the period between
                    30 March 2007 and 30 April 2007. She did indicate, however, that this
                    2005 version had, even then, already been amended by virtue of the supplementary
                    base prospectus dated 5 April 2006<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_26" id="Ftn_26_1"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>. The information to be found in
                    the supplementary base prospectus was therefore, according to Ms Lam, part
                    of the basis upon which the HN5 was launched. Nevertheless, it is not clear when
                    the change giving rise to the inconsistency pointed out above (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above) took place. In other words, it is not
                    certain whether the 2007 version of the base prospectus merely consolidated the
                    2005 original base prospectus and any amendments the 2006 supplementary base
                    prospectus introduced or whether it had, itself, introduced changes that were
                    not to be found in the two.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Despite the paucity of information concerning
                    the history behind the different versions of the Base Prospectus, I am inclined
                    to place greater reliance on that version tendered by the plaintiffs. The fact
                    that the plaintiffs have (through Mr Soon) produced this particular version
                    of the base prospectus leads one to believe that this must have been the version
                    that they received and relied upon when applying for the HN5. They would not,
                    after all, have had free access to the different versions of the base
                    prospectus. What they possess, they would have obtained from the defendant,
                    whose lawyers were responsible for drafting the various documents. I accept,
                    therefore, that the relevant paragraph from the Base Prospectus would have told
                    investors that the terms and conditions of the HN5 could be found in the section
                    entitled “Terms and Conditions of the Notes” in the Base
                    Prospectus and in “the applicable Issue Document” – namely,
                    the entire Pricing Statement. This, therefore, formed part of the background
                    context against which the HN5 contract was concluded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     However, any reliance that I place on the
                    paragraph from the 2007 base prospectus (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above) must be weighed alongside any other conclusions that
                    I might draw from the general context provided by the three documents. Were it
                    not for the reasons stated at <a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>-<a href="#p1_35">[35]</a> below, looking at the documents as a whole I
                    would have been slow to find that everything in the Base Prospectus and Pricing
                    Statement amounts to a contractual term or condition. A quick glance at the
                    table of contents of the Base Prospectus<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_27" id="Ftn_27_1"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>shows that the first 48 pages are devoted to, amongst other
                    things, “References to Websites”, “Information on
                    Websites”, a “Description of Selected Transaction
                    Documents” and “Summary of the Programme”. Pages 48 to 119
                    purport to set out “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”, but the
                    last sections of the Base Prospectus merely supply “Information Relating
                    to [the defendant]” and “General and Statutory
                    Information”. Clearly, therefore, not all of the Base Prospectus is given
                    over to contractual terms; indeed, a significant portion of it is intended only
                    to summarise, describe and explain the HN5 to investors. The Pricing Statement
                    is no different. Its table of contents<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> refers to information, descriptions,
                    summaries and details on procedures and timetables. These are sections which are
                    far more likely to be found in the preamble or explanatory note to a contract
                    than amongst its actual terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I also note that the Pricing Statement
                    contains a section specifically entitled “Terms and Conditions of the
                    Notes”. The reference in the Application Form to “Terms and
                    Conditions set out in DBS High Notes 5 Pricing Statement” could,
                    therefore, be easily construed referring to the section that purports to contain
                    the terms and conditions and indeed, this is the argument that the defendant
                    makes. It is, after all, no stretch of the English language to say that the
                    section is one “set out” in the Pricing Statement. Thus, there is
                    room to conclude that the phrase does not necessarily incorporate the entire
                    Pricing Statement into the terms of the HN5 contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     Despite these considerations, I nevertheless
                    conclude that while the words “set out” do not necessarily
                    incorporate the whole of the Pricing Statement into the HN5 contract, when they
                    are followed by the words “in particular”, they do have this
                    result. The plaintiffs point out that the section entitled “Terms and
                    Conditions of the Notes” in the Pricing Statement makes no reference at
                    all to Appendix A<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. Yet, the
                    Application Form appears to assume that it has been incorporated: the words
                    “in particular” then single it out for the reader’s
                    particular attention. There is no need to refer to something “in
                    particular” unless it has been previously identified as part of a
                    collective. In my view, this is a strong argument. The starting point for any
                    attempt to interpret or construe a contract must be the wording of the contract
                    itself. This does not mean that a court should only give effect to the literal
                    meaning of a contract. Instead, it means that in order to persuade the court
                    that the words of the HN5 contract bear another meaning from what they appear
                    to, the defendant must show that the background context to the HN5 contract
                    clearly and obviously indicates a different interpretation from that suggested
                    by the plain language. As Lord Hoffmann put it in <em>Investors
                        Compensation</em> (<em>supra</em> at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>) when he set out the general principles by
                    which contractual documents should be construed at 913:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    The “rule” that words should be
                            given their “natural and ordinary meaning” reflects the
                            common sense proposition that <em>we do not easily accept
                                that people have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal
                                documents</em> ... [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This, therefore, is the threshold requirement spelt out by the
                    Court of Appeal in <em>Zurich Insurance</em> (<em>supra</em> at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>) at
                    [129]. While ambiguity is no longer a pre-requisite for the court’s
                    consideration of extrinsic material in construing a contractual document, the
                    context behind a contract must be clear and obvious and render the language of
                    the contract ambiguous or absurd before the court will be entitled to give the
                    contractual term in question an interpretation that is different from that which
                    the plain language demands: <em>Zurich Insurance</em>
                        (<em>supra</em> at <a href="#p1_25">[25]</a>), at [130].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In my view, the defendant in this case has not
                    overcome the threshold requirement. The plain language of the contract found in
                    the Application Form supports the plaintiff’s reading of the contract: the
                    use of the words “set out” followed by “in
                    particular” do appear, by virtue of common syntax and linguistic use, to
                    lead to the conclusion that the entire Pricing Statement (of which Appendix A is
                    a part of) was incorporated into the terms and conditions of the HN5 contract.
                    And it is not clearly and obviously indicated by the context of the contract
                    that a different interpretation from that suggested by the plain language of the
                    contract should be applied. Indeed, as my analysis in the preceding paragraphs
                    above demonstrates, the context behind the HN5 contract is unclear: a glance at
                    the documents overall may give the impression that not all of their contents
                    constitute the terms and conditions of the HN5 contract; yet the paragraph from
                    the section entitled “Risk Factors” found in the 2007 base
                    prospectus (see <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> above) conveys –
                    in express words – the impression that the entire Pricing Statement is
                    incorporated as part of the HN5 contract terms. In fact, by describing the
                    context as unclear, I am giving the defendant the benefit of the doubt. I am
                    actually inclined to give great weight to the express words of the 2007 base
                    prospectus. Those who invested in the HN5 (and this includes the plaintiffs)
                    were not, after all, lawyers. It is unfair to expect them to know that those
                    parts of the Base Prospectus and Pricing Statement which summarise and describe
                    the HN5 to investors were not part of the terms and conditions of the contract
                    – let alone that the very existence of such sections could indicate by
                    implication that the contract did not consist of the documents in their
                    entirety.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     To conclude this portion of my judgment,
                    therefore: the phrase “the Terms and Conditions set out in DBS High
                    Notes 5 Pricing Statement in particular [Appendix A]” should be
                    given its natural and ordinary meaning, especially once it is read in light of
                    the express incorporation of the “Issue Document” (or Pricing
                    Statement) in the 2007 base prospectus. The background context in this case
                    (limited as it is only to the three sets of documents handed to the HN5
                    investors with no other extrinsic facts) is equivocal at best. To my mind,
                    however, the context really comes down in favour of the plaintiffs. It does not
                    clearly or obviously support any other interpretation – let alone the
                    interpretation propounded by the defendant. As such, I conclude that the HN5
                    contract consists of the terms and conditions set out on the reverse side of the
                    Application Form and the entirety of the HN5 Pricing Statement, including but
                    not limited to the section of the Pricing Statement entitled “Terms and
                    Conditions of the Notes” and Appendix A.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Are there inconsistent definitions of CERA?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     It follows from my conclusion on the
                    constituent terms and conditions of the HN5 contract above that all four
                    descriptions (or definitions) of CERA set out at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above fall within the terms of the contract. I turn to
                    consider the plaintiffs’ contention that these four descriptions are
                    inconsistent with one another.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It should be noted at the outset that the
                    Fourth CERA Description is grossly different from the first three descriptions.
                    It is actually the inverse of the losses suffered by the Lehman Note and
                    produces a curious result for an instrument whose value is supposed to depend on
                    the value of the Lehman Note: namely, that the greater the loss suffered on the
                    Lehman Note, the smaller the loss suffered on the HN5. Conversely, if the Lehman
                    Note does not suffer a loss in price, the value of the HN5 plunges to zero. The
                    defendant does not dispute that this is the result of the fourth CERA
                    Description, but contends that this was an obvious clerical mistake that may and
                    ought to be corrected either by construction or rectification. I deal with this
                    latter submissions at <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>
                below.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The plaintiff’s position in relation to
                    the first three CERA Descriptions is as follows. It is evident from the above
                    that all three formulae require the deduction of the CAAA and HC. Nevertheless,
                    the three are inconsistent because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     The First and Second CERA
                        Descriptions can only be consistent if the prevailing market price of the
                        Lehman Note is always equal to the nominal value of the Reference Notes less
                        the loss suffered on the Lehman Note. However, this is not necessarily
                        always the case as CERA would be zero under the First CERA Description if
                        the market value of the Lehman Note were zero, but not necessarily zero in
                        the Second CERA Description as the Lehman Note was only one of eight
                        Reference Notes that the HN5 were linked to.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     The Third CERA Description materially differs on
                        its face from the First and Second CERA Descriptions as the component
                        factors it uses are completely different from the latter. It also requires
                        the aggregate principal amount (“APA” or face value) of the
                        Reference Note to be multiplied by the price of the Lehman Note expressed as
                        a percentage. Yet it fails to say what the price of the Lehman Note should
                        be expressed as a percentage of – effectively rendering the Third CERA
                        Description unworkable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The defendant’s rebuttal of the
                    plaintiffs’ submissions is made on several levels. Firstly, it argues that
                    the First, Second and Third CERA Descriptions are entirely consistent as they
                    clearly convey that the CERA is:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_a"></a>(a)     Directly related to the market value
                        of the defaulting reference entity’s Reference Obligation (in this
                        case, the Lehman Note).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_41-p2_b"></a>(b)     Inversely related to the shortfall in market value of the
                        CAAA and HC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Secondly, the defendant argues that the
                    three descriptions relied on by the plaintiffs were never intended to be
                    comprehensive formulae. In the event of any uncertainty or inconsistency, the
                    Pricing Statement provides a clear mechanism for its resolution: the Third CERA
                    Description is expressly designated the prevailing one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     I agree with the defendant’s position
                    for the following reasons. The plaintiff’s reasoning flows from their
                    having reduced the First and Second CERA Descriptions, both expressed in the
                    form of words, into the precise mathematical formulae reproduced in the table at
                        <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> above. However, a proper
                    construction of the First CERA Description does not convey that level of
                    precision. The First CERA Description is found on the second page of the Pricing
                    Statement, and it is useful to see it in the context of the paragraph in which
                    it appears (with the First CERA Description emphasised):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If a Credit Event ... in relation to a Reference Entity occurs under the
                        Reference Notes, the Reference Notes will terminate. Consequentially, the
                        Notes will also terminate and investors in the Notes will receive a SGD
                        amount ... or USD amount ... equivalent to what the Issuer will receive as
                        the [CERA] under the Reference Notes. <em>The [CERA] under
                            the Reference Notes will be based on the prevailing market value of the
                            defaulted Reference Entity’s Reference Obligation, less [CAAA] and
                            less [HC]</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The words “based on” do not normally mean “equal
                    to” and the First CERA Description, in the context of the paragraph in
                    which it appears does not in fact convey that meaning. What it simply means is
                    that the “prevailing market value of the defaulted Reference
                    Entity’s Reference Obligation” will be an important factor in the
                    computation of CERA: it does not specify the exact mathematical relationship
                    between the two.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The same reasoning applies in the case of the
                    Second CERA Description. This is found on the fourth page of the Pricing
                    Statement, in the context of the following paragraph (with the Second CERA
                    Description emphasised):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For illustrative purposes only, the process adopted upon the occurrence of
                        a Credit Event under the Reference Notes is outlined below. This is to
                        illustrate how the Notes work and should be treated as an illustration
                        only.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Step 1 ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Step 4    Following Step 3 above, the Calculation Agent
                            in respect of the Reference Notes will determine the [CERA] payable to
                            the Issuer, as the holder of the Reference Notes. <em>The
                                CERA is in summary the amount equal to the nominal value of the
                                Reference Notes less the amount of loss suffered on the Reference
                                Obligation of the Defaulted Reference Entity less any depreciation
                                of the market value of the collateral, and less cost and expenses
                                associated with the termination of the hedging arrangements in
                                respect of the Reference Notes</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Step 5 ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Although the word “equal” is used in this case, this has
                    to be seen in the context of the entire paragraph, particularly the repeated
                    caveats in the two opening sentences that it is for “illustrative
                    purposes” or “illustration” only and the words “in
                    summary” used in the Second CERA Description itself. Furthermore, the
                    expressions “loss suffered”, “depreciation of the market
                    value of the collateral” and “costs and expenses” are not
                    defined at all. It is therefore not correct to reduce it to the second formula
                    in the table at <a href="#p1_38">[38]</a> as the plaintiffs have
                    done. As with the First CERA Description, it is no more than a general
                    description of the manner in which CERA will be determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The Third CERA Description appears under the
                    section “Summary of the Offering” and it is the only one of the
                    three descriptions that sets out an exact formula based on terms that are fully
                    defined. Further, in the section entitled “Glossary” at p 37
                    of the Pricing Statement, the following appears:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Terms used in the sections on “Summary of the Programme” and
                        “Summary of the Offering” in the Base Prospectus and the
                        Pricing Statement respectively, as the case may be, shall bear the same
                        meanings when used elsewhere in the Base Prospectus and this Pricing
                        Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The foregoing leads to the ineluctable
                    conclusion that the Third CERA Description is the operative one under the
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I turn now to the Fourth CERA Description. As
                    noted at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a> above, this is actually the
                    inverse of the Third CERA Description as well as the general scheme under the
                    First and Second CERA Descriptions. The defendant’s case is that this is
                    an obvious clerical mistake, which can and should be corrected by construction.
                    It submits as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Fourth CERA Description contains
                        a formula that is identical to the Third CERA Description except for one
                        thing: instead of stating that the APA should be multiplied by the
                        “Final Price”, it stated that the APA should be multiplied by
                        “(1 – Final Price)”. It is plain from the other CERA
                        descriptions in the Pricing Statement and the Application Form that the CERA
                        should directly correlate to the market value of the defaulted reference
                        entity’s Reference Obligation (<em>ie</em> the
                        Final Price). The additional “1 –” in the Fourth CERA
                        Description would result in a negative correlation between the CERA and the
                        Final Price. It is also patently apparent from the other parts of the
                        Pricing Statement that the CERA should be calculated by multiplying the APA
                        with the Final Price and not “(1 – Final Price)”:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_46-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       At p 9 of the Pricing
                            Statement, under the section entitled “Risk Factors”, the
                            Pricing Statement highlights that an HN5 investor would be subject to
                            the credit risk of the eight reference entities in the first-to-default
                            credit basket and goes on to elaborate that the value of the HN5
                            “may be affected by the activities undertaken by the Reference
                            Entities and any financial or economic difficulties the Reference
                            Entities may face”. It is clear that one of the risks faced by an
                            HN5 investor is that “any financial or economic difficulties the
                            Reference Entities may face” would have a negative effect on the
                            value of the HN5 (and, therefore, the CERA, if a credit event occurs);
                            and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_46-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The illustrations provided at p 8 of the Pricing Statement under
                            “Scenario Analyses” put the issue beyond doubt. It is
                            explained in Scenario 3 (Worst Case Scenario) that if a credit event
                            occurs under the Reference Notes, and if the market value of the
                            relevant Reference Obligation is zero, the HN5 will terminate
                            immediately and the investor will receive a zero payout. This can only
                            be true if the CERA is calculated by multiplying the APA with Final
                            Price (<em>ie</em>, the market value of the
                            relevant Reference Obligation which is zero) and not “(1 –
                            Final Price)”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_46-p2_b"></a>(b)     A literal reading of the formula contained in the Fourth
                        CERA Description would give rise to an absurdity. The CERA under the
                        Reference Notes (and therefore the CERA for the HN5) would have an inverse
                        correlation to the Final Price. As a result, the lower the prevailing market
                        value of the defaulted reference entity’s Reference Obligation, the
                        more the defendant would receive as the Reference Notes CERA and the higher
                        the amount each HN5 investor would receive upon the occurrence of a credit
                        event. This could not by any stretch of the imagination have been the
                        intention of the defendant or the HN5 investors when the HN5 contract was
                        entered into. In fact, the plaintiffs do not make any such suggestion. In
                        investing in HN5 and in return for the higher interest yield of the HN5, the
                        investor agreed to take on the risk, <em>inter
                            alia</em>, of any financial difficulties which the eight reference
                        entities in the first-to-default credit basket may face. If the HN5
                        investor’s returns increased with the depreciation of the market value
                        of the defaulted reference entity’s Reference Obligation, that would
                        completely turn the risk which was undertaken and accepted by the HN5
                        investor in the HN5 contract on its head.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     I agree with the defendant’s submission
                    regarding the Fourth CERA Description. There is no doubt in my mind that it is a
                    clerical mistake. The conditions for correcting an obvious clerical mistake by
                    the process of construction were laid down by Brightman LJ in <em>East v Pantiles (Plant Hire) Ltd</em> [1982] 2 EGLR 111, 112, as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Two conditions must be satisfied: first, there must be a clear
                        mistake on the face of the instrument; secondly, it must be clear what
                        correction ought to be made in order to cure the mistake. If those
                        conditions are satisfied, then the correction is made as a matter of
                        construction …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This was endorsed and applied by Belinda Ang J in <em>Ng Swee Hua v Auston International Group Ltd and another</em> [2008]
                    SGHC 241, at [33]-[35], and more recently by the House of Lords in
                        <em>Chartbrook Ltd and another v Persimmon Homes Ltd and
                        another</em> [2009] 1 AC 1101.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     I find that there is ample basis for
                    correcting the Fourth CERA Description by the removal of the “1
                    –” in the formula. To the extent that the Fourth CERA Description
                    contradicts the Third CERA Description, this would eliminate that
                    contradiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     The plaintiffs’ claim for a declaration
                    that the Notes issued under the HN5 contract are void is therefore dismissed. I
                    will hear parties on costs.</p>
