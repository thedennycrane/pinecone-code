There is an overlap between the act of bringing or causing to be brought into Singapore and the concepts of possession and knowledge. In order to establish that the accused has “brought or caused to be brought” a controlled drug into Singapore, the Prosecution is required to establish that the accused was in possession, and had knowledge of the nature of the drugs: see for example, the decision of Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 2 SLR 571 (“<span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen</span>”) where the court considered, in the context of a charge of importation, whether possession (at [34]–[48]) and knowledge of the nature of the drugs (at [49]) were made out. As illustrated by <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen</span>, such possession and knowledge may be established using the presumptions under ss 18(1) and 18(2) of the MDA. In the present case, the heart of the dispute between the Prosecution and the Defence was whether possession and knowledge were made out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 As noted by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort v Public Prosecutor </span>[2017] 1 SLR 633 (“<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort”</span>) at [34], s 18(1) of the MDA deals with secondary possession. Whether the presumption of possession is raised depends on: (a) whether a “thing in issue” exists, and (b) whether the accused had possession, control or custody of this “thing in issue”. In the context of s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, the “thing in issue” is the container holding the controlled drugs. Once it is established that the container exists and that the accused had possession, control or custody of it, s 18(1) of the MDA raises a presumption of fact that the accused also possessed the drugs which are contained within (<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort </span>at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 To rebut the presumption in s 18(1), the accused must prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not have the drug in his possession. This may be done by proving that the accused did not know that the container contained that which is shown to be the drug in question (<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort </span>at [35]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Once the accused is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession, he is then presumed to know the nature<span class="font-italic"> </span>of that drug under s 18(2) of the MDA– which refers to the nature of the specific controlled drug found in his possession (<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort </span>at [35], citing <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span><span class="font-italic"> a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] 4 SLR 1156 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>”) at [23]–[24]).

Thus, the issues which arose for consideration were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Was the accused in possession, control or custody of the Plastic Bag?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the accused was in possession of the Plastic Bag, had the accused rebutted the presumption of possession in s 18(1) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) If the accused had not rebutted the presumption of possession, had he rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA?</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision and reasons</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Factual findings</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Before I analyse the above issues, this is an appropriate juncture to set out my findings on two of the key factual disputes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The first factual dispute related to how it transpired that the accused took the seat behind the driver in the Taxi. This was a significant issue because an important part of the Prosecution’s case was the claim that the accused <span class="font-italic">deliberately chose</span> that particular seat because he knew that the drugs were hidden beneath the driver’s seat. Equally, it was an important part of the Defence’s case that the accused unknowingly and fortuitously ended up in that seat, and had no knowledge that the drugs were hidden beneath the driver’s seat. As mentioned, the accused’s evidence was that Ms Tan and Ms Chin had boarded the taxi first, and that he had simply taken the remaining vacant seat (see [20] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The Prosecution led oral evidence from Ms Tan who, as mentioned, was seated in the front passenger seat. The police also made attempts to locate Ms Chin, who was seated in the rear passenger seat beside the accused, and to procure her attendance at trial. However, it seems she was uncontactable.

Firstly, Ms Tan’s evidence was logical – the three passengers were strangers and her evidence was that, had the accused not already taken the rear passenger seat, she and Ms Chin would have naturally taken the rear seats given their common gender. I found that this was entirely in accord with the natural behaviour of the community they belong to. This is also corroborated by SSgt Roger’s evidence that it was precisely this anomalous situation that attracted his attention to the Taxi.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">41 </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Further, Ms Tan had no reason to lie about what had happened.

In seeking to demonstrate the accused’s knowledge and state of mind, the Prosecution pointed to evidence that the accused was seen to be nervous at the material time:

</div> SSSgt Samir also disagreed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Having considered the evidence, I was satisfied that it was the accused who had handed his passport to SSgt Roger. My reasons are as follows. First of all, the accused’s claim that it was not he who handed his passport to SSgt Roger was contradicted by his own investigative statement recorded on 1 August 2015. There he said that <span class="font-italic">he </span>gave his passport to the uniformed officer who asked him for his passport after the Taxi had cleared immigration.

</div> Secondly, it was contradicted by Mr Mohd Taib, who testified that on that day, he followed the “same procedure”, which was that after “[getting] the passport chop”, he would return the passports to the passengers <span class="font-italic">before </span>driving away from the immigration counter.

</div> Thirdly, it was contradicted by Ms Tan, who could not remember exactly what had happened on that particular day, but said that in general, the taxi driver would return the passengers their passports immediately after clearing immigration.

</div>
</div> Fourthly, such a practice is logical. There is no further need for a taxi driver in Mr Mohd Taib’s position to retain his passengers’ passports once the immigration check is over on the Singapore side. The passengers would be anxious to retrieve their passports from him as soon as possible and doing so before driving off after the passport check is consistent with common sense.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I also saw no reason to disbelieve SSgt Roger and SSSgt Samir’s evidence that the accused generally appeared nervous. In particular, it was the accused’s nervous demeanour that made SSgt Roger decide to send the Taxi to the 100% inspection pit.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the accused was in possession, control or custody of the Plastic Bag</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I turn now to address the first issue of whether the accused was in possession of the Plastic Bag. The concept of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA was elaborated on by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>where the court<span class="font-italic"> </span>noted that “possession” included concepts of both physical and legal possession (<span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen </span>at [32]). In both <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen </span>and an earlier decision cited in that judgment, <span class="font-italic">Van </span><span class="font-italic">Damme Johannes v Public Prosecutor </span>[1993] 3 SLR(R) 694 (“<span class="font-italic">Van </span><span class="font-italic">Damme</span>”), it was held that the accused persons were in “possession” of luggage or suitcases containing controlled drugs, notwithstanding the fact that they had lost physical possession when they checked in these pieces of luggage at airports. In both cases the court noted that the accused persons had received luggage tags which entitled them to access the luggage (see <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen </span>at [32] and <span class="font-italic">Van </span><span class="font-italic">Damme </span>at [8]). In <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen</span>, it was held that the accused had “legal possession” of the luggage “by virtue of her ability to reclaim it”, while in <span class="font-italic">Van </span><span class="font-italic">Damme </span>it was held that the accused had possession because with the baggage tag he had received he “could obtain access” to the bag in question. Thus, even where an item is not found on an accused’s person, it may still be within his possession if he has an “ability” to take possession of it or can “obtain access” to it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I also found instructive the English decision of <span class="font-italic">Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner </span>[1969] 2 AC 256 (“<span class="font-italic">Warner</span>”). The concept of possession set out in this case has been endorsed by our courts in several decisions (see for example, <span class="font-italic">Tan </span><span class="font-italic">Kiam Peng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 at [53] and <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen </span>at [31]). In <span class="font-italic">Warner</span>, Lord Wilberforce remarked as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Ideally a possessor of a thing has complete physical control over it; he has knowledge of its existence, its situation and its qualities: he has received it from a person who intends to confer possession of it and he has himself the intention to possess it exclusively of others. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Bearing the above principles in mind, I was satisfied that the accused had possession of the Plastic Bag. The accused chose to sit in the Taxi knowing that it contained an item which Kana wanted him to deliver. I had found that the accused deliberately chose to sit behind the driver where the Plastic Bag was placed. I noted that the accused never asked Mr Mohd Taib about any bag in the Taxi.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> This suggests that he knew where to find it. Taking these factors in the round, I concluded that the accused had chosen his seat because he knew just where the item from Kana was located. I would add that even if the accused had merely chanced upon the Plastic Bag, he had concluded that this was the item that Kana had placed in the taxi for him. The accused gave a contemporaneous statement to Staff Sergeant Rozaiman bin Abdul Rahman (SSgt Rozaiman) at 11.17pm, less than seven hours after the Plastic Bag was discovered by the ICA officers. He did not challenge the voluntariness or accuracy of this statement, which was given in a question and answer format. The responses to the following questions showed that he knew the Plastic Bag he was handling in the Taxi was the item from Kana:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Q2: What are these 03 bundles?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A2: Initially I do not know.

He said that there is a bag inside the taxi and he instructed me to bring the bag to Bugis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Q5: What exactly did he tell you and what time did he call you?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A5: He called me at about 4pm and told me that the taxi is already at Larkin. I am to go to Larkin to find and board the taxi. Along the way he kept calling for updates of my location and I updated him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Q7: What are you suppose (<span class="font-italic">sic</span>) to do once you reach Bugis?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A7: I am supposed to wait for a call from a Singaporean man to tell me the location to go to deliver the bag and its contents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Q11: Did Kanna tell you to collect any money from the Singaporean man?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A11: No. He only asked me to pass the plastic bag to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 It is clear from the foregoing that the accused had gone into the Taxi with the objective of locating the item which Kana had placed inside and which he would bring into Singapore to deliver to somebody in Bugis. He located the Plastic Bag which he concluded was the item from Kana. He actually examined its contents, after which he placed it back in the location he had found it, with the intention of delivering it to the intended recipient. The purpose of this exercise was to be able to collect payment from Kana for his work. It is clear from this chain of events that, once he concluded that the Plastic Bag was the item from Kana, the accused had taken physical possession of it. Even after placing it back in its original concealed position, he retained control over it as he was the only person who knew where it was and had the intention to retrieve it when the Taxi arrived at Bugis and deliver it to the person designated by Kana.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Accordingly, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had possession of the Plastic Bag.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 I should say at this point that the findings above also support the conclusion that the accused was in actual possession of the bundles within the Plastic Bag, without having to rely on the presumption under s 18(1) of the MDA. As the evidence points to the conclusion that the accused had located the Plastic Bag as well as the bundles therein, and had made an examination of the bundles before restoring the items in their original position with the intention to subsequently retrieve them, it is clear that the accused had actual possession of both the Plastic Bag and the bundles. The presumption in s 18(1) of MDA and in particular s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA, as evident from the cases of <span class="font-italic">Pham </span><span class="font-italic">Duyen Quyen </span>and <span class="font-italic">Van </span><span class="font-italic">Damme </span>cited above, are generally relied on in cases where the accused was found to be in possession of a bag or suitcase which in turn contained controlled drugs amongst other things. Whereas there is nothing to suggest that a plastic bag cannot be a ‘container’ within the meaning of s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the MDA (see <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ng Peng Chong and another </span>[2017] SGHC 99, which similarly involved a plastic bag containing bundles of drugs), to make a distinction in this case between the Plastic Bag as a container and the bundles of drugs contained within appears to me to be rather artificial, especially where there is nothing else in the Plastic Bag apart from the bundles of drugs themselves.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In any case, as the Prosecution and Defence have both made submissions relating to s 18(1) of the MDA, I shall discuss this briefly despite my finding that the accused was in actual possession of the bundles of drugs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the accused had rebutted the presumption of possession in s 18(1) of the MDA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Under s 18(1) of the MDA, the finding that the accused was in possession of the Plastic Bag gave rise to the presumption that he was in possession of the drugs contained within the Plastic Bag. The next question to consider was whether the accused had rebutted the presumption, by proving on a balance of probabilities that he did not have the drugs in his possession.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The most obvious way to rebut the presumption under s 18(1) of the MDA would be for the accused to show that he did not know that the Plastic Bag contained that which is shown to be the drug in question, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> by showing that the bundles were slipped into the Plastic Bag without his knowledge (<span class="font-italic">Obeng</span><span class="font-italic"> Comfort </span>at [35]). In this case, as the accused’s version of events was that he had actually seen and touched the bundles contained within the Plastic Bag, he has naturally not attempted to adduce any evidence to rebut the presumption in this manner. In any case, the existence of the accused’s DNA on the bundles within the Plastic Bag also showed that the accused had physically examined the contents of the Plastic Bag, even though it was by feeling it rather than viewing it. This is not a case where, for example, the Plastic Bag had contained various other items in addition to the bundles, and the accused could then seek to persuade this court that he was only aware of the existence of those other items but not the bundles of controlled drugs. As such, it is clear on the evidence that the presumption under s 18(1) MDA has not be rebutted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In seeking to rebut the presumption in s 18(1) of the MDA, the Defence had also made submissions pertaining to the accused’s alleged lack of knowledge that there were drugs inside the Plastic Bag.

</div> The Prosecution stopped short of using the term “wilful blindness” but the submissions certainly call that concept to mind. On the other hand, the accused’s claim was that he thought that he was carrying a bag of clothes. The accused denied that he knew or suspected that he was carrying some illicit item. The evidence had to be considered in light of these two competing narratives.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 On the arguments and evidence before me, I concluded that the accused had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge. My conclusion was based on the following three factors:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 First, the suspicious circumstances surrounding the transaction between Kana and the accused made it wholly unbelievable that the accused genuinely thought he was carrying a bag of clothes, as he claimed. As disclosed in his investigative statement recorded on 29 July 2015, the accused knew that Kana had been banned from entering Singapore.

</div> Kana had offered the accused a large sum of 2,000 Malaysian Ringgit to make the delivery. He had devised a highly elaborate scheme of planting the Plastic Bag inside a taxi bearing a certain number plate, instead of simply giving the Plastic Bag to the accused. According to the accused, Kana had not even told him whether the driver of the Taxi would know that the bag of clothes was inside the vehicle.

</div> The transaction was shrouded in a level of secrecy and surreptitiousness that would suggest to any person that the item in question could not have been an innocent bag of clothes. The suspicious nature of the transaction was reinforced by the fact that Kana had repeatedly called the accused several times throughout the journey from Larkin Central to Singapore, to ask for updates on his location (see [22] above). The accused had maintained that he was not even curious as to why Kana was calling repeatedly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61  Secondly, I found that the accused was not a credible witness and had shifted his position in several ways. First, the accused had taken shifting positions as to what he thought was contained in the Plastic Bag which Kana tasked him with delivering. In his contemporaneous statement, the accused did not mention that he believed that the Plastic Bag contained clothes. He simply stated that he had been instructed by Kana to deliver “a bag” or “a plastic bag” – see [48] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 There was similarly no mention in the cautioned statement that the accused believed that the Plastic Bag contained clothes. He simply stated that he had “nothing to say”.

As I have mentioned, I accepted SSgt Roger and SSSgt Samir’s testimony on this issue. The evidence that the accused was “shaking” as he handed his passport to SSgt Roger, and that he was sweating profusely, and was pale and visibly nervous to SSSgt Samir, supports the inference that he knew that he had been tasked with carrying an illegal item. He did not think he was merely transporting a bag of clothes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Considering the above factors, I found that the accused’s alleged belief that he was tasked with transporting a bag of clothes to be wholly unbelievable. I also found it difficult to believe that the accused would not have asked Mr Mohd Taib if there was a bag in the Taxi, and if so, where it was, if he had genuinely believed that Kana simply wanted him to deliver a bag of clothes. As such, I found that the accused had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 As the Prosecution had made out the elements of both possession and knowledge, I found that the offence in s 7 of the MDA was made out.
