<p class="Judg-Author">
        Steven Chong J (delivering the grounds of decision of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerned an interlocutory appeal
                    against a decision of the High Court that there be “no order” on a
                    summary judgment application filed by the appellant, Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd
                    (“the Appellant”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Previously, the statutory scheme under the
                    Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”)
                    was such that a party’s right of appeal from the High Court to the Court
                    of Appeal in respect of interlocutory applications rested on the dichotomy
                    between interlocutory and final orders. If an order was final, then an appeal
                    could be brought to the Court of Appeal as of right; if the order was
                    interlocutory in nature, then a party generally retained a right of appeal to
                    the Court of Appeal, subject to the requirement that an application be brought
                    within seven days for leave to present further arguments to the High Court
                    judge, and except where the old Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999
                    Rev Ed) expressly provided for particular orders to be non-appealable or
                    appealable only with leave (see <em>Dorsey James Michael v World
                        Sport Group Pte Ltd</em> [2013] 3 SLR 354 (“<em>Dorsey</em>”) at [26]). In <em>Wellmix Organics
                        (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</em> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 525 at [14],
                    this court held that the test of whether a given order was interlocutory or
                    final was whether the order finally disposed of the rights of the
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The significance of the dichotomy between
                    interlocutory and final orders diminished somewhat with the introduction of
                    fixed schedules governing the right of appeal from specific types of orders
                    pursuant to the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 2010 (Act 30 of
                    2010) (“the 2010 Amendments”). The 2010 Amendments introduced into
                    the SCJA the Fourth and Fifth Schedules, which expressly provided for certain
                    types of orders to be non-appealable or appealable only with leave respectively.
                    A “calibrated approach” was thereby established to streamline and
                    restrict appeals to the Court of Appeal, wherein interlocutory applications were
                    categorised based on their importance to the substantive outcome of the case
                    (see <em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates</em>, <em>Official Report</em> (18 October 2010) vol  87
                        (“<em>Parliamentary Debates</em>”) at
                    cols 1369–1370). The rationale behind such an approach was to ensure that
                    in general, a decision of a High Court judge in an interlocutory application is
                    not unnecessarily taken all the way to the Court of Appeal, leading to a waste
                    of judicial time (see <em>OpenNet Pte Ltd v Info-communications
                        Development Authority of Singapore</em> [2013] 2 SLR 880
                        (“<em>OpenNet</em>”) at
                [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Despite the 2010 Amendments, issues in relation
                    to a party’s right of appeal on interlocutory matters have continued to
                    arise in litigation. Recently, the cases of <em>Nim Minimaart
                        (suing as a firm) v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 1079 and
                        others</em> [2014] 1 SLR 108 and <em>Citiwall Safety
                        Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd</em> [2014] SGCA 61
                    dealt with the question of whether leave was required to appeal to the Court of
                    Appeal in different contexts. In the present appeal, a preliminary issue arose
                    as to whether the Appellant had a right of appeal to this court from the High
                    Court decision below and, accordingly, whether this court had the jurisdiction
                    under the SCJA to hear the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       At the end of the hearing, we concluded that we
                    did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, as the “no order”
                    made by the High Court below was, on a purposive interpretation, effectively one
                    that was caught by the Fourth Schedule of the SCJA. We now give the detailed
                    grounds for our decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Appellant was a company incorporated in Hong
                    Kong and was in the business of, <em>inter alia</em>,
                    marine supply and logistics. The first respondent, Nordic International Limited
                    (“the 1st Respondent”), was a company incorporated in
                    the British Virgin Islands and in the business of converting and equipping
                    ships. The second respondent, Morten Innhaug (“the
                    2nd Respondent”), was a Norwegian national habitually resident in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Appellant and the 2nd Respondent were
                    shareholders of the 1st Respondent, each holding 50% of the 1st
                    Respondent’s shares pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement dated 4
                    July 2007 (“the Agreement”). The Agreement sets out the terms of
                    the parties’ joint venture which involved the conversion of a fishing
                    trawler into a seismic survey vessel (“the Vessel”). The
                    1st Respondent was the joint venture vehicle and the owner of the Vessel.
                    The Agreement was initially concluded between the 2nd Respondent and a Singapore
                    company called Sinwa Limited. On 28 August 2007, Sinwa Limited’s
                    rights and obligations under the Agreement were novated to the
                Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Time Charter</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 8 June 2007, the 1st Respondent
                    entered into a time charter (“the Time Charter”) with a Singapore
                    company known as BGP Geoexplorer Pte Ltd (“BGP”). The Time Charter
                    was for a three-year period at a daily rate of US$37,000. Earlier in
                    December 2006, BGP had entered into an agreement with TGS-NOPEC Geophysical
                    Company SA (“TGS”) for the provision of seismic acquisition
                    services (“the Seismic Agreement”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       According to the Appellant, on 23 August
                    2008, BGP, TGS, and a company known as Nordic Maritime Pte Ltd
                    (“NMPL”) entered into a memorandum of agreement (“the
                    MOA”) wherein it was agreed that BGP would transfer and assign to NMPL
                    its rights and obligations in the Time Charter as well as in the Seismic
                    Agreement. On 22 September 2008, a notice of assignment of the Time Charter
                    was signed between BGP and a company known as Nordic Geo Services Limited
                    (“NGS”). The Appellant claimed that NGS was a wholly-owned
                    subsidiary of NMPL, which in turn was owned and/or controlled by the 2nd
                    Respondent. The Appellant’s position was that the assignment of the Time
                    Charter was null and void as it had been done without any prior notice or
                    consent from the directors of the 1st Respondent appointed by the
                    Appellant. Alternatively, the Appellant maintained that regardless of the
                    validity of the assignment, BGP remained responsible to the 1st Respondent
                    for due performance of the Time Charter under its terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 7 April 2009, the Appellant, on behalf
                    of the 1st Respondent, instructed its solicitors to send a letter of demand
                    to BGP for the outstanding charter hire fees due to the 1st Respondent.
                    BGP’s solicitors responded on 22 April 2009 maintaining that its
                    rights and obligations under the Time Charter had already been transferred and
                    assigned to NMPL and consequently it owed no obligations to the
                    1st Respondent under the Time Charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Arbitration proceedings against BGP and other related
                proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Subsequently, on 18 November 2009, the
                    Appellant, on behalf of the 1st Respondent, commenced arbitration
                    proceedings against BGP for the recovery of the outstanding charter hire fees
                    due under the Time Charter (“the BGP Arbitration”). The 2nd
                    Respondent opposed the BGP Arbitration proceedings, and on 7 January 2010,
                    applied to the High Court <em>vide</em> Originating
                    Summons No 22 of 2010 (“OS 22/2010”) to effectively restrain
                    the BGP Arbitration. In OS 22/2010, the 2nd Respondent sought a number of
                    reliefs including a declaration that on a proper interpretation of the
                    Agreement, the directors of the 1st Respondent appointed by the 2nd
                    Respondent had the sole discretion to grant consent on behalf of the
                    1st Respondent to assign the Time Charter from BGP to NGS, as well as to
                    decide whether or not to commence arbitration against BGP in respect of any
                    purported breaches of the Time Charter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     OS 22/2010 was dismissed by Lai Siu
                    Chiu J. In her judgment issued on 24 January 2011, Lai J held that
                    under the Agreement, the parties were obliged to come to a unanimous decision on
                    the issue of the assignment of the Time Charter as well as the appointment of
                    lawyers to pursue the 1st Respondent’s claim against BGP (see
                        <em>Morten Innhaug v Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd and
                        others</em> [2011] SGHC 20 at [44]). If the parties could not agree,
                    they were obliged to proceed to arbitration as provided for in the
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 1 August 2011, BGP applied to the High
                    Court <em>vide</em> Originating Summons No 650 of 2011
                    (“OS 650/2011”) for an order that the appointed arbitrator in the
                    BGP Arbitration did not have jurisdiction as the Appellant did not have the
                    requisite authority to commence the arbitration proceedings on behalf of the
                    1st Respondent. On 2 August 2012, the High Court decided
                    OS 650/2011 in favour of BGP, holding that the appointed arbitrator did not
                    have jurisdiction over the BGP Arbitration. Consequently, the BGP Arbitration
                    was discontinued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Meanwhile, on 24 October 2011, a board
                    meeting of the 1st Respondent was convened to discuss possible proceedings
                    against BGP. No resolutions were passed at the meeting, which ended in a
                    deadlock. As such, on 9 January 2012, the 2nd Respondent commenced
                    arbitration proceedings against the Appellant (in accordance with the Singapore
                    International Arbitration Centre Rules) (“the SIAC Arbitration”),
                    seeking to resolve this deadlock as provided for under the terms of the
                    Agreement. Directions were given for the SIAC Arbitration to proceed in two
                    stages: Stage 1 was to determine whether there was a deadlock within the
                    meaning of the Agreement, and if so, Stage 2 was to determine the price at which
                    the 2nd Respondent was to buy out the Appellant’s share in the
                    1st Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 1 October 2013, a partial award was
                    made in the SIAC Arbitration (“the Partial Award”). The arbitrator
                    found that a deadlock had arisen, and that the Appellant was to sell its shares
                    to the 2nd Respondent at a price to be assessed (in Stage 2 of the SIAC
                    Arbitration). We noted that there was no suggestion before us that the Partial
                    Award was improperly made or that it should be set aside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">OS 960/2009 and Suit 875/2010</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Apart from the proceedings concerning BGP, we
                    noted that there were also ongoing proceedings in the High Court between the
                    1st Respondent and the 2nd Respondent relating to an alleged breach of
                    director’s duties. On 25 August 2009, the Appellant applied to the
                    High Court <em>vide</em> Originating Summons No 960 of
                    2009 (“OS 960/2009”) for leave to bring an action on behalf of the
                    1st Respondent against the 2nd Respondent for breaches of director’s
                    duties relating to the assignment of the Time Charter from BGP to NGS. Leave was
                    initially denied (see <em>Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd v Morten
                        Innhaug</em> [2010] 4 SLR 1) but was granted on appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Thereafter, in November 2010, the Appellant
                    commenced Suit No 875 of 2010 (“Suit 875/2010”) on
                    behalf of the 1st Respondent against the 2nd Respondent, seeking
                        <em>inter alia</em> a declaration that the 2nd
                    Respondent had breached his director’s duties to the 1st Respondent
                    by procuring the assignment of the Time Charter from BGP to a company owned and
                    controlled by him (<em>ie</em>, NGS). Suit 875/2010 is
                    still pending in the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The lead up to the present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 21 November 2013, the Appellant through its
                    solicitors sent the 2nd Respondent a notice of intention to apply for leave of
                    court to commence arbitration proceedings against BGP. In that notice, the
                    Appellant requested that the 2nd Respondent consent and/or cause a Board of
                    Directors’ resolution to be passed for arbitration proceedings to be
                    commenced by the 1st Respondent against BGP, failing which the Appellant
                    would seek the court’s leave to commence the arbitration
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     As the Appellant did not receive a favourable
                    response from the 2nd Respondent, it commenced
                    Suit No 1166 of 2013 (“Suit 1166/2013”)
                    against the 1st Respondent, the 2nd Respondent, and BGP on 20 December
                    2013, seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, an order that the
                    Appellant be at liberty to commence arbitration proceedings and/or any other
                    proceedings on behalf of the 1st Respondent against BGP for breaches of the
                    Time Charter. On 26 March 2014, the Appellant filed Summons No 1544 of 2014
                    (“SUM 1544/2014”) for summary judgment to be entered in its favour
                    against the 1st Respondent and the 2nd Respondent. (It should be noted
                    that on 16 April 2014, BGP ceased to be a party to Suit 1166/2013 upon
                    its application in Summons No 697 of 2014.) SUM 1544/2014 was the
                    application from which the present appeal arose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     SUM 1544/2014 was heard before a High
                    Court judge (“the Judge”) on 11 June 2014. Having heard the
                    parties, the Judge made no order as to SUM 1544/2014, without prejudice to
                    a fresh application being made by the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     In his grounds of decision issued on
                    9 July 2014 (see <em>Sinwa SS (HK) Co Ltd v Nordic
                        International Ltd and others</em> [2014] SGHC 132 (“the
                    GD”)), the Judge explained that his decision was based on the fact that
                    the Partial Award had already been made in the SIAC Arbitration and the
                    Appellant was soon to sell its stake in the 1st Respondent. At [10] of the
                    GD, the Judge stated that “[b]arring a breakdown in the ongoing
                    arbitration proceedings between [the Appellant] and [the 2nd Respondent], [the
                    Appellant] would soon likely have neither any legal interest nor standing to
                    pursue proceedings against [BGP] on behalf of [the 1st Respondent]”.
                    The Judge noted that Stage 2 of the SIAC Arbitration was already somewhat
                    underway, as the valuation process for the Appellant’s share in the
                    1st Respondent was to be completed by 31 July 2014. Notwithstanding
                    this, the Judge gave the Appellant liberty to apply should it later have better
                    evidence and arguments than those it produced before him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Dissatisfied, the Appellant filed an appeal to
                    this court against the part of the Judge’s decision that there be no order
                    as to the Appellant’s application <em>vide</em>
                    SUM 1544/2014. The Appellant also made an application <em>vide</em> Summons No 4987 of 2014
                    (“SUM 4987/2014”) for leave to adduce further evidence in
                    this appeal. As the 2nd Respondent had consented to the further evidence being
                    adduced, we granted an order in terms for SUM 4987/2014.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues before this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     This appeal raised two main issues of law,
                    namely:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_a"></a>(a)     Can a court hearing an application
                        for summary judgment make “no order” on the
                        application?</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_23-p2_b"></a>(b)     If
                        so, does a party have the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal against
                        such an order?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The first issue arose out of the
                    Appellant’s submission that under the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014
                    Rev Ed) (“Rules of Court”), the “no order” made by
                    the Judge was not an order that could be made at the hearing of a summary
                    judgment application. The Appellant submitted that pursuant to O 14 r 3 of
                    the Rules of Court, the court may either grant summary judgment to the
                    plaintiff, grant the defendant unconditional or conditional leave to defend the
                    action, or dismiss the application; no other orders could be made by the court
                    in a summary judgment application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As for the second issue, it was specifically
                    raised by this court for the parties’ consideration as it concerned the
                    court’s jurisdiction to entertain such an appeal. The Appellant submitted
                    that since the Judge’s order of “no order” did not
                    explicitly fall within the Fourth and Fifth Schedules of the SCJA, it was
                    therefore appealable as of right pursuant to s 29A(1) of the SCJA. Although
                    counsel for the 2nd Respondent did not seem to contest this assertion, we had
                    our doubts as to whether it was correct and therefore invited the parties to
                    address us during the hearing on whether the Judge’s order of “no
                    order” should be treated as equivalent to an order giving leave to defend
                    and therefore falling within the Fourth Schedule of the SCJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether a court hearing a summary judgment application can make
                “no order” on the application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     At the outset, it is useful to reiterate that
                    a purposive approach to statutory interpretation is to be adopted in Singapore.
                    This is mandated by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed),
                    which provides that “an interpretation that would promote the purpose or
                    object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly
                    stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that
                    would not promote that purpose or object”. It is well-established in our
                    case law that this purposive approach is paramount and must take precedence over
                    any other common law principles of statutory interpretation (<em>Dorsey</em> (cited at [2] above) at [18]). It is also clear that
                    under the purposive approach mandated by s 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act,
                    reference may be made to extrinsic materials such as parliamentary debates even
                    if the words of the statutory provision are unambiguous or do not produce
                    unreasonable or absurd results (<em>Dorsey</em> at
                    [19]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In the present case, we were of the view that,
                    contrary to the Appellant’s submissions, it was indeed possible for a
                    court hearing a summary judgment application to make “no order” on
                    the application. Order 14 r 3 of the Rules of Court, which reads as
                    follows, does not purport to lay down an exhaustive list of the possible
                    outcomes of a summary judgment application:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1">
<b>Judgment for plaintiff (O. 14,
                            r. 3)</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>3.—(1</b>)    Unless on
                            the hearing of an application under Rule 1 either the Court dismisses
                            the application or the defendant satisfies the Court with respect to the
                            claim, or part of a claim, to which the application relates that there
                            is an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried or that there
                            ought for some other reason to be a trial of that claim or part, the
                            Court may give such judgment for the plaintiff against that defendant on
                            that claim or part as may be just having regard to the nature of the
                            remedy or relief claimed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    The Court may by order, and subject to such
                            conditions, if any, as may be just, stay execution of any judgment given
                            against a defendant under this Rule until after the trial of any
                            counterclaim made or raised by the defendant in the
                        action.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     In particular, O 14 r 3(1) of the Rules
                    of Court only stipulates that the court “<em>may</em>” give summary judgment for the plaintiff unless
                    either the court dismisses the application or the defendant satisfies the court
                    that there is a triable issue. It does not dictate that the possible outcomes of
                    a summary judgment application are necessarily ternary in nature (<em>ie</em>, (a) the plaintiff obtains summary judgment; (b) the
                    defendant obtains unconditional or conditional leave to defend; or (c) the
                    application is dismissed). Neither does it preclude the court hearing a summary
                    judgment application from making no order on the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Indeed, the courts have found it appropriate
                    to make “no order” pursuant to summary judgment applications on
                    several occasions, although such occasions are admittedly not common. In
                        <em>Woh Hup (Pte) Ltd and another v Turner (East Asia) Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1985–1986] SLR(R) 503, the plaintiffs had applied for
                    summary judgment against the defendant, whereas the defendant opposed the
                    summary judgment application and sought a stay of proceedings on the ground that
                    the parties had agreed to refer the dispute to arbitration. The applications
                    were heard by a Senior Assistant Registrar, who granted a conditional stay of
                    proceedings and therefore made no order on the summary judgment application. On
                    appeal to the High Court, the Registrar’s orders were set aside, but not
                    on the basis that “no order” was not a permissible order to make
                    in respect of a summary judgment application. A number of other cases have
                    concerned similar facts where a stay of proceedings pending arbitration was
                    granted and “no order” was made on a party’s summary
                    judgment application (see <em>Brightside Mechanical &amp;
                        Electrical Services Group Ltd and another v Hyundai Engineering &amp;
                        Construction Co Ltd</em> [1988] 1 SLR(R) 1, <em>Aurum Building Services (Pte) Ltd v Greatearth Construction Pte
                        Ltd</em> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 805, and <em>Coop
                        International Pte Ltd v Ebel SA</em> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 615). Yet
                    another example would be the decision in <em>Shunmugam Jayakumar
                        and others v Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and others</em> [1996]
                    2 SLR(R) 658 where the plaintiffs had applied to the court for summary
                    judgment and alternatively, for judgment on admission of facts under O 27 r
                    3 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1990 Ed). The Senior
                    Assistant Registrar who heard the application granted interlocutory judgment
                    under O 27 r 3 and consequently made no order on the summary judgment
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In the present case, the Judge was entitled to
                    make “no order” as regards the Appellant’s summary judgment
                    application. Without delving into the merits of the appeal, it seemed to us that
                    the decision by the Judge to make “no order” with liberty to apply
                    was eminently sensible and fair in the circumstances. Given that the Appellant
                    was to sell its shares in the 1st Respondent to the 2nd Respondent at a
                    price to be assessed pursuant to the Partial Award issued in the SIAC
                    Arbitration, and there was no suggestion that the Partial Award could be
                    impugned, the Judge’s decision to make “no order” on the
                    Appellant’s summary judgment application was understandable. “No
                    order” was made by the Judge not on account of his finding that the
                    application lacked merits but rather because the Partial Award had a material
                    bearing on the Appellant’s capacity to commence the arbitration against
                    BGP on behalf of the 1st Respondent. In fact, by making “no
                    order” without prejudice to a fresh application and giving the Appellant
                    liberty to apply, the Judge did not foreclose the Appellant’s rights. The
                    significance and utility of this liberty granted by the Judge will become
                    apparent in light of the proposal made by counsel for the 2nd Respondent at the
                    close of the hearing before us. This is explained in the concluding remarks
                    below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether a party has the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal
                against an order of “no order” made in respect of a summary judgment
                application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Having answered the first question in the
                    affirmative, we now turn to the second question of whether a party has the right
                    to appeal to the Court of Appeal against an order of “no order”
                    made in respect of a summary judgment application. As stated above, this was an
                    important question as it concerned the jurisdiction of this court to hear the
                    appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     In the first place, it is important to have
                    regard to the provisions of the SCJA. It is an oft-cited principle that as the
                    Court of Appeal is a creature of statute, it is only seised of the jurisdiction
                    conferred upon it by the statute which creates it (<em>Blenwel
                        Agencies Pte Ltd v Tan Lee King</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 529 at [23]). The
                    starting point for the civil jurisdiction of this court is s 29A(1) of the
                    SCJA, which provides that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction over
                    “appeals from any judgment or order of the High Court in any civil cause
                    or matter”, “subject nevertheless to the provisions of [the SCJA]
                    or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such
                    appeals may be brought”. As was observed in <em>Dorsey</em> at [11], the effect of s 29A(1) of the SCJA is that
                    any judgment or order of the High Court is ordinarily appealable as of right,
                    subject to any contrary provisions in the SCJA or any other written law. In this
                    regard, reference may be made to s 34(1) of the SCJA which sets out the
                    matters that are non-appealable to the Court of Appeal, as well as s 34(2)
                    of the SCJA which sets out matters which are appealable only with leave. For
                    present purposes, we need only be concerned with s 34(1)(<em>a</em>) and s 34(2)(<em>d</em>) of the
                    SCJA, which make reference to the Fourth and Fifth Schedules
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The Fifth Schedule of the SCJA lists the
                    orders made by a judge that are appealable to the Court of Appeal only with
                    leave. Paragraph (<em>e</em>)(i) of the Fifth Schedule of
                    the SCJA excludes orders made at an application for summary judgment and reads
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">ORDERS MADE BY JUDGE THAT ARE APPEALABLE ONLY WITH LEAVE</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The net effect of these provisions as regards
                    an application for summary judgment was succinctly summarised by this court in
                        <em>OpenNet</em> at [19] as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Paragraph (<em>e</em>) of the Fifth
                        Schedule of the SCJA is a catch-all provision imposing a blanket
                        requirement for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal for any
                        “interlocutory application”, and para (<em>e</em>)(i) specifically lists an order made at the hearing of an
                        application for summary judgment to be exempted from this blanket
                        requirement for leave. Where an application for summary judgment is refused
                        and leave to defend the proceedings has been given, s 34(1)(<em>a</em>) and paras (<em>a</em>)
                        and (<em>b</em>) of the Fourth Schedule of
                        the SCJA provide that no appeal to the Court of Appeal shall be
                        allowed. The net result of these provisions is that where summary judgment
                        has been ordered, which has the effect of finally disposing the substantive
                        rights of the parties, leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal is not
                        required. On the other hand, where leave to defend is granted in an
                        application for summary judgment, and as such the order does not finally
                        dispose of the substantive rights of the parties, no appeal may be made
                        against that order. <em>The effect of such an order is that
                            the rights of neither party are affected as the matter will just go for
                            trial, where both parties will have ample opportunity to canvas their
                            respective positions. No appeal is allowed because it would serve no
                            useful purpose in prolonging such interim litigation.</em>
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The position as regards a party’s right
                    of appeal from a “no order” made in respect of a summary judgment
                    application is one which is not specifically provided for either in the Fourth
                    Schedule or the Fifth Schedule of the SCJA. Thus, on a plain reading, it may
                    appear to be arguable, as the Appellant believed, that if the High Court makes
                    “no order” on a summary judgment application, such an order is
                    appealable as of right under s 29A(1) of the SCJA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     However, having regard to the statutory
                    context as well as the legislative intent underlying the SCJA, we were of the
                    view that para (<em>a</em>) of the Fourth Schedule should
                    be read in a purposive manner so as to encompass an order of “no
                    order” made in respect of a summary judgment application. The legislative
                    intention behind the 2010 Amendments and the Fourth and Fifth Schedules of the
                    SCJA was to streamline and restrict appeals to the Court of Appeal on
                    interlocutory matters. As the Senior Minister of State for Law, Associate
                    Professor Ho Peng Kee (“the Minister”) stated at the Second
                    Reading of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Bill 2010 (Bill
                    No 25/2010) (“SCJA Amendment Bill”) (see <em>Parliamentary Debates</em> at col 1369):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Given that interlocutory applications involve procedural points that
                        usually do not affect the substantive rights of the parties and are not
                        likely to involve novel points of law, it is an unproductive use of
                        resources for all such applications to go up to the Court of Appeal,
                        especially when the High Court already serves as one level of appeal against
                        the Registrar who first hears the application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     In light of the above policy, it must have
                    been intended that no appeal should be allowed from an order of “no
                    order” made in respect of a summary judgment application, which is in
                    substance similar to an order giving leave to defend. As in the situation where
                    leave to defend is granted, an order of “no order” means that the
                    court has declined to grant the application. It therefore does not finally
                    dispose of or affect the substantive rights of the parties as the matter will
                    still proceed to trial. In <em>Tohru Motobayashi v Official
                        Receiver and another</em> [2000] 3 SLR(R) 435 (“<em>Tohru Motobayashi</em>”) at [15], this court stated
                    that the effect of an order of “no order” made by the Judicial
                    Commissioner below was that he had declined to grant the declaration sought; in
                    other words, he had essentially disallowed the application. In this vein, we
                    also note with approval the following passage from the High Court decision of
                        <em>Ho Kian Cheong v Ho Kian Guan and others</em>
                    [2004] SGHC 104 at [7]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As for the second scenario of an order of “no order”, the
                        applicant has also not succeeded in his application. In such a scenario, the
                        Court has considered the matter and decided against granting the order. The
                        difference between this and that of an order to dismiss turns only on the
                        cost implications. Where an order of “no order” is made, costs
                        need not normally be ordered against the applicant. The Court can thus use
                        the order of “no order” to tailor its order to suit the
                        justice of the case such as where, for whatever reason, the applicant does
                        not deserve to succeed in his application, but the circumstances do not
                        justify him being penalised in costs. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     It would indeed be incongruous if a party such
                    as the Appellant was allowed to appeal as of right against an order of
                    “no order” made in respect of a summary judgment application,
                    whereas no right of appeal at all would lie from an order giving unconditional
                    or conditional leave to defend when the effect is essentially the same. Had the
                    Judge below dismissed the Appellant’s summary judgment application and
                    granted the 2nd Respondent leave to defend the action, this would have been
                    non-appealable under the Fourth Schedule of the SCJA. There was no reason why
                    the Appellant should be in a better position than if its summary judgment
                    application had been dismissed outright by the Judge, given that it had
                    similarly failed in its application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     At this juncture, we would make two final
                    observations. First, there was no merit in the Appellant’s argument raised
                    during the hearing before us that its summary judgment application had not been
                    heard in the first instance before an Assistant Registrar and it had therefore
                    lost its right of appeal to the High Court. To understand this objection, it is
                    useful to refer to the following statement by the Minister at the Second Reading
                    of the SCJA Amendment Bill (see <em>Parliamentary
                        Debates</em> at col 1369):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Between the time when a party files a civil case in court and
                        when the case is heard, lawyers may file what are known as
                        “interlocutory applications” in court. These applications deal
                        with procedural matters that prepare the case for the hearing; for example,
                        requesting the court to order the other party to furnish information or
                        documents that are relevant to the hearing. Currently, for a case heard in
                        the High Court, these interlocutory applications are usually heard by a High
                        Court Registrar. A party can appeal to the High Court against the
                        Registrar’s decision. The High Court Judge would then re-hear the
                        application afresh. Orders made by the High Court, in most instances, can be
                        further appealed to the Court of Appeal. Hence, interlocutory applications
                        may go through three tiers of hearing, effectively becoming a two-tier
                        appeal system. This is more than what the substantive action in the civil
                        suit will enjoy, that is, only one tier of appeal as of right.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The Appellant’s point seemed to be that since a party was
                        <em>normally</em> entitled to one tier of appeal from a
                    High Court Registrar to a High Court Judge in respect of interlocutory
                    applications, it should be entitled to appeal to the Court of Appeal in the
                    present case since its summary judgment application had only been heard once by
                    the Judge below. However, as we pointed out during the hearing, the suggestion
                    that the right to appeal to the High Court against a Registrar’s decision
                    could be exchanged for a right to appeal to the Court of Appeal was without
                    legal basis. While it is true that a party can appeal to the High Court against
                    the decision of a Registrar who usually hears the interlocutory application in
                    the first instance, this is not an immutable rule. There is certainly no rule of
                    law that a party should always be entitled to one tier of appeal as of right for
                    interlocutory applications. Moreover, neither the Appellant nor the 2nd
                    Respondent had recorded any objection to the Appellant’s summary judgment
                    application being heard at first instance before the Judge in chambers. It
                    therefore did not lie in the Appellant’s mouth to now protest that it had
                    lost one tier of appeal as a result.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Second, we respectfully disagree with the
                    Judge’s statement that there was no order from which the Appellant could
                    appeal (at [10] of the GD). The Judge’s decision to make no order on the
                    Appellant’s application for summary judgment itself constituted an
                    “order” from which the Appellant could appeal. In the same way
                    that an order of “no order” had legal effect from the date it was
                    made, it must equally be capable of being the subject matter of an appeal
                    provided that the right of appeal is available. This point was dealt with in
                        <em>Tohru Motobayashi</em> at [15] where this court
                    held that the effect of “no order” made by the Judicial
                    Commissioner below was that he had disallowed the application and there was no
                    reason why an appeal did not lie from this part of the order. There is no right
                    of appeal from the Judge’s decision in making “no order” in
                    respect of the Appellant’s summary judgment application, not because there
                    is no order from which to appeal, but because such an order, on a purposive
                    interpretation, is caught by s 34(1)(<em>a</em>) and
                    para (<em>a</em>) of the Fourth Schedule to the SCJA, which
                    provides that certain orders made are non-appealable to the Court of
                    Appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     For the reasons above, we concluded that we
                    had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and accordingly dismissed it.
                    Nevertheless, we made a note that during the hearing before us, counsel for the
                    2nd Respondent confirmed that his client, the 2nd Respondent, would be agreeable
                    to the Appellant pursuing the claim against BGP under the Time Charter in the
                    name of the 1st Respondent so long as the costs of pursuing that claim were
                    borne by the Appellant, subject to its right to be indemnified for those costs
                    out of any sums it successfully recovers for the first respondent from BGP, and
                    subject further to this agreement not in any way affecting or prejudicing the
                    deadlock that has already been found to exist by the arbitrator in the SIAC
                    Arbitration. We noted this so that the Appellant may, if it wishes, go back
                    before the Judge to get a consent order in those terms. We should add that this
                    liberty to return to the Judge to obtain such a consent order was precisely the
                    effect of the Judge’s order below, which was that there would be
                    “no order” on the Appellant’s summary judgment application
                    with liberty to apply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     As for costs, we fixed the costs at $20,000
                    inclusive of disbursements to be paid by the Appellant to the 2nd Respondent,
                    with the usual consequential orders.</p>
