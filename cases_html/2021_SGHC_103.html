For cases outside of proving predicate offences, the court at [72] set out the following guidance:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the conviction must be clearly relevant to an issue in the case; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the court should consider whether the probative value of the conviction outweighs the prejudicial value. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In the present case, subsection (3) is relevant, as it states that unless the contrary is proven, the person convicted of the offence would be taken to have committed the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> and <span class="font-italic">mens rea</span> of the offence. In Shanti and Zainudin’s case, their act of trafficking would have rested on the premise of an unbroken chain of custody of the Drugs from Shanti onwards. The finding was <span class="font-italic">a </span><span class="font-italic">necessary step</span> in the court’s conclusion that Shanti and Zainudin had committed the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> of their offences. Therefore, because subsection (3) provides that the <span class="font-italic">actus reus</span> for either’s acts of trafficking be taken to be proved, the chain of custody must as a matter of logic also be taken to be proved, unless the contrary is proved. In the present case, the contrary has not been proved. Further, applying the criteria in <span class="font-italic">Chua Boon Chye</span>, the convictions are relevant to this case, as they necessarily concern the same issue of the chain of custody. Moreover their probative value outweighs any prejudicial value. This is sufficient for me to find that there is no unbroken chain of custody in the Drugs from Shanti to the point of HSA analysis. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other supporting evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In addition, there were several sources of primary evidence adduced by the Prosecution: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) seven statements given by Zainudin to CNB during investigations (collectively “Zainudin’s statements”) – the Prosecution sought to admit these statements under s 32(1)(<span class="font-italic">j</span>)(i) of the EA;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) evidence led during trial, and statements from the CNB officers who were involved in the recovery of the heroin; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) evidence from an analyst with the HSA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 These sources give a thorough account of the custody of the Drugs from the time they were in Shanti’s possession, up to the point of the HSA analysis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Zainudin’s statements on receiving, unpacking and disposing of the Drugs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The admissibility of Zainudin’s statements was not challenged by the Defence.

A key part of the evidence before the court was a collection of statements made by Shanti in May 2014. The Prosecution sought to show that these statements were consistent with her testimony at trial, and that she had consistently identified the accused since an early stage in the investigation. After judgment was reserved, the Prosecution discovered that a page had been inadvertently left out of Shanti’s statements when they were admitted at trial. This was disclosed, and further written submissions were thereafter tendered by both sides. This page, as I explain below, is crucial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The case before the disclosure of the missing page</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Shanti’s account of the first three transactions was recorded in her statement dated 24 May 2014 at about 3.17pm.

First, the dates are linked to the corroborating ICA evidence, as those are the specific dates where both Shanti and the accused were in Singapore at the same time. These inconsistencies raise the distinct possibility that the accused was <span class="font-italic">not </span>the person who handed Shanti the drugs during the first, and even the second transaction. If either of the first two transactions took place between 1 to 7 May 2014 (the dates assumed by Defence and Prosecution as “the first week of May”), they could not have involved the accused as it was not disputed that Shanti and the accused were not present in Singapore at the same time between 1–7 May 2014.

</div> Second, Shanti’s evidence on the first three transactions forms a key plank of the Prosecution’s case: that there were four occasions where Shanti was involved in the receipt and delivery of drugs, and that <span class="font-italic">on all four occasions</span>, the accused was the one who provided her with the drugs.

</div> This was used to explain the reliability of her identification of the accused. Once there is reasonable doubt as to the accused being her source of supply on the previous occasions, it weakens the credibility of Shanti’s assertion that the accused was the provider of the drugs for the 16 May 2014 transaction. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Shanti’s testimony was not her independent recall</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In this context, I consider the Defence’s assertion, on the other hand, that Shanti’s testimony did not arise from her own independent recall. Rather, she had been moulding her testimony to match the documentary evidence placed before her. The evidence surrounding the missing page supports the Defence’s assertion. This was not the only instance. A concerning feature of Shanti’s testimony was that she could only testify when reminded from ICA or telephone records. For example, the Prosecution put phone records in front of her regarding a phone call to “Abang”. When asked about the contents of the conversation with “Abang”, she stated that she “<span class="font-italic">must have</span> asked him where [she] was supposed to go” [emphasis added].

Because of the accused’s and Shanti’s employment, they were both constantly in and out of Singapore. Their presence in Singapore at the same time would not be unusual. The ICA records showed, for example, that in the month of March 2014, before Shanti decided to transport drugs for Boy, there were 6 occasions where Shanti and the accused were concurrently in Singapore at the same time.

At the highest, the calls show that Shanti and the accused knew each other, despite the accused’s protestations. While the accused’s cross-examination casts doubt on his credibility, it could not, on the other hand, prove the Prosecution’s case. More importantly, these calls on 16 May were not for the purpose of the delivery of drugs. There was no modus operandi of calls between the accused and Shanti as established by the three prior occasions and consistent with the fourth. Shanti operated by contacting “Boy”, who gave her the necessary instructions and details in each case. The fact that the accused called Shanti or Shanti called the accused is not in any way conclusive of the accused being the person who had handed the Drugs to Shanti. The Prosecution argued in their written submissions that an “analysis of all of Shanti’s phone records after she arrived in Singapore on 16 May 2014 confirms that [the accused] was the <span class="font-italic">most likely</span> person who passed her the drugs” [emphasis added].

</div> Nevertheless, even this last response reflected an assumption rather than an independent recollection. Thus, I did not find that the phone records showing calls with “Boy” and “Abang” on 30 April, 13 May and 14 May, supported the Prosecution’s case. There were too many other calls outside of those dates, and at the same time, there was no independent evidence to verify the content of the calls on the various dates.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 Viewed in context, therefore, the ICA and telephone records are equivocal. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Remaining Prosecution arguments </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I deal with the remaining Prosecution arguments, which rely upon the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) that a large volume of phone calls between the accused and an unknown Malaysian number on 16 May 2014;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) that the ICA records reflect JJX1568 as the license plate number when JJA5556 departed from Singapore;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the accused’s change in movement patterns after 16 May 2014; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) the accused’s attempts at distancing himself from the 16 May transaction during investigations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I deal with these in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Large volume of phone calls from the accused to an unknown number </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The Prosecution has alleged that the large volume of phone calls between the accused and the number +60 167759861 is suspicious. After Shanti was arrested, there were 13 calls and two messages between the accused and this number in the span of two hours. From this, the Prosecution draws the inference that this number belonged to someone who was involved in drugs and was the accused’s handler. Whilst the accused claimed he did not know who the number belonged to and that he could not remember the contents of any of the calls, the Prosecution argues that this is difficult to believe considering the large volume of calls. Thus, their submission is that the proper inference to draw is that the calls were related to the drug transaction on 16 May 2014.

</div> Furthermore, the absence of Tahmilselvan during the said period as evidenced by the ICA records meant that this alleged attempt at implicating Tahmilselvan was futile. In other words, not only was Tahmilselvan not in Singapore on 16 May 2014, he had not been in Singapore during any of the four transactions mentioned by Shanti.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Notwithstanding, it was not clear what effect the Prosecution intended by these submissions.

The Prosecution noted that the accused under cross-examination did admit that he would top up the SIM card as well. Further, the Prosecution argues that the accused’s claim of leaving a phone with a SIM card registered to his name specifically is far-fetched.

</div> On one hand, the explanation does smack of a too-convenient excuse. It is not natural for a person to simply leave behind a mobile telephone with a number registered to their name. On the other hand, the low value of the phone and use of a prepaid card meant that this explanation was not implausible.

Nevertheless, they do not assist the Prosecution in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the accused who passed the drugs to Shanti on 16 May 2014, nor do they corroborate the accused’s guilt. While the Prosecution has raised various reasons for suspicion, there was not sufficient material to meet the burden of proof. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 It is plain that the accused’s case was tenuous; further the width of the accused’s inability to recall in answer to questions in court and at the point of arrest to the police showed an inclination to be less than forthcoming. An example was his inability to explain why his telephone listed Shanti’s telephone number despite his inability to recollect who she was. The Prosecution characterised his defence as a bare denial.

</div> Nevertheless, the Prosecution’s burden of proof remained theirs to fulfil on the specific charge particularised for 16 May 2014. As the Court of Appeal noted in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter</span> [2020] 1 SLR 486 at [149](f)], “[o]nce the court has identified the flaw internal to the Prosecution’s case, weaknesses in the Defence’s case cannot ordinarily shore up what is lacking in the Prosecution’s case to begin with, because the Prosecution has simply not been able to discharge its overall legal burden”. Thus, “it [is] not at all sufficient for the Prosecution to merely point to the inadequacies of the [accused’s] testimony”: <span class="font-italic">Sahadevan s/o Gundan v Public Prosecutor</span> [2003] 1 SLR(R) 145 at [35].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In the present case, the only evidence that the accused supplied the Drugs to Shanti on 16 May 2014 was Shanti’s testimony. Shanti was not able, however, to recall the various events of the transactions well. Her testimony in court also deviated from her statements of 20 May and 24 May, which were taken four and eight days after the offence respectively. This deviation is material because ICA evidence supported the dates she referred to in court and not those referred to in her statements. The available telephone records are equivocal and the surrounding circumstances do not, on the facts of the case, provide independent corroboration of her evidence.
