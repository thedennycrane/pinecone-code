The 1st to 3rd defendants in turn commenced third party proceedings against Mr Ron Sim Chye Hock (“Ron Sim”) for an indemnity or contribution (“the third party claim”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 I granted Ron Sim’s application to strike out the third party claim against him, pursuant to O 18 r 19(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the Rules”), on the ground that the third party statement of claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The 1st to 3rd defendants have appealed against my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At all material times, the 1st defendant, Sunbreeze Group Investments Limited (“Sunbreeze”), was the majority shareholder of Wellness, with a shareholding of 80.62%. EQ Capital held 7.55%. The remaining 11.83% was held by two private equity funds. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At all material times, the 2nd defendant, Mr Manoj Mohan Murjani (“Manoj”), and his wife, the 3rd defendant, Ms Kanchan Manoj Murjani (“Kanchan”), were directors of Wellness and shareholders and directors of Sunbreeze. Manoj was also the chief executive officer (“CEO”) of Sunbreeze. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Wellness was established for the purposes of wholesale and/or retail of lifestyle and/or wellness related products. In October 2007, TWG Tea Company Pte Ltd (“TWG Tea”) took over Wellness’ tea division. In October 2010, EQ Capital acquired a 7.55% stake in Wellness. EQ Capital is an investment holding company and Ron Sim was at all material times its ultimate sole beneficial owner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 In early 2011, Manoj (on behalf of TWG Tea) started discussions with Ron Sim in relation to an investment by OSIM International Ltd (“OSIM”) into TWG Tea (“the OSIM Negotiations”). The shareholders of TWG Tea then were Wellness and Paris Investment Pte Ltd (“Paris”). OSIM was then a public company that was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange and Ron Sim was the CEO, a director and the Chairman of OSIM. During the OSIM Negotiations, Manoj presented profit projections which showed that TWG Tea would achieve profit before tax and minority interests (“PBT”) of $29m for the financial year ending 31 March 2013 (“FY2013”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 On 18 March 2011, OSIM, Wellness and Paris signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“the SPA”) and Wellness, OSIM, Paris and TWG Tea signed a Shareholders’ Agreement (“the SHA”). Pursuant to the SPA, OSIM became a 35% shareholder of TWG Tea; the other two shareholders were Paris (10.3%) and Wellness (54.7%). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The SHA envisaged that joint ventures between TWG Tea and OSIM would be set up in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. It was contemplated that OSIM would hold 60% and TWG Tea would hold 40% of the shares in each joint venture. On 1 June 2011, OSIM and TWG Tea incorporated the first joint venture, OSIM-TWG Tea (North Asia) Pte Ltd (“the JV Co”). OSIM held 60% and TWG Tea held 40% of the shares in the JV Co.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Subsequently, a disagreement arose between Manoj and Ron Sim over the price that TWG Tea was to charge the JV Co for its products (“the Transfer Pricing Issue”). Manoj wanted to charge the JV Co the same price that TWG Tea charged its franchisees (“the Franchise Price”) whereas Ron Sim’s position was that the JV Co should be charged at cost since TWG Tea held a 40% stake in the JV Co. Eventually, the TWG Tea board agreed on a transfer price of cost plus a mark-up of 20%.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Soon after the JV Co opened its store in Hong Kong, Ron Sim discovered that TWG Tea did not have all the necessary trade mark registrations to open stores in North Asia, including Hong Kong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In July 2011, Manoj said that he wanted to update the profit projections. A revised set of TWG Tea projections which was prepared in October 2011 showed that TWG Tea’s projected PBT for FY2013 would only be around $11m.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 In December 2011, Ron Sim called for a TWG Tea board meeting to review the suitability of Manoj continuing as CEO and if thought appropriate to remove him as CEO. Manoj was then the CEO and a director of TWG Tea. For various reasons, the board meeting was not held although Manoj and Ron Sim had email exchanges on the matter.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 14 August 2012, Manoj resigned as CEO of TWG Tea with effect from 15 September 2012. On 28 September 2012, Manoj also resigned as a director of TWG Tea. Wellness had a right under the SHA to representation on the board of TWG Tea. However, Wellness did not appoint anyone else to replace Manoj on the board of TWG Tea until October 2016 when it nominated Manoj. Manoj’s nomination as director was not accepted by OSIM, Paris and the TWG Tea board. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Clause 4.5 of the SPA (“the Profit Swing Clause”) provided for the combined shareholding of Wellness and Paris to be diluted (by up to 10% of TWG Tea shares) in favour of OSIM if TWG Tea’s audited PBT for FY2013 fell below $17m, or for the shareholding of OSIM to be diluted (by up to 10% of TWG Tea shares) in favour of Wellness and Paris if the audited PBT for FY 2013 exceeded $27m. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 TWG Tea’s audited PBT for FY2013, which was signed off by its auditors on 11 June 2013, was just above $5m. Pursuant to the Profit Swing Clause, the combined shareholding of Wellness and Paris in TWG Tea was diluted by 10% in favour of OSIM (“the Profit Swing Clause Transaction”). The result was that OSIM’s shareholding increased to 45% while Wellness’ shareholding decreased from 54.7% to 46.3%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 On 18 October 2013, OSIM purchased all the shares in Paris. The shareholding structure of TWG Tea then became as follows: OSIM and Paris (53.7%) and Wellness (46.3%).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In November 2013, TWG Tea proposed a rights issue to raise capital (“the Rights Issue”). Wellness did not subscribe to the Rights Issue. Consequently, OSIM and Paris together subscribed for the entire Rights Issue and the combined shareholding of OSIM and Paris in TWG Tea increased to from 53.7% to 69.9% while Wellness’ shareholding was diluted from 46.3% to 30.1%. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Suit 187 of 2014</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In February 2014, Wellness and Manoj commenced Suit 187 of 2014 against OSIM, Paris and the directors of TWG Tea (“S187/2014”). Wellness’ claim was for minority oppression, conspiracy to injure and breach of contract whilst Manoj’s claim was for conspiracy to injure. Wellness and Manoj alleged as follows: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That OSIM, Ron Sim and two other directors of TWG Tea, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Khor Peng Soon (“Peng Soon”) and Lee Hwai Kiat (“Peter Lee”), acted to damage the profitability of TWG Tea by, among other things, acting in concert to procure TWG Tea to supply products to the JV Co at a price lower than that allegedly agreed.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) That OSIM, Ron Sim and the directors of OSIM, Paris and TWG Tea acted wrongfully to enable OSIM to take control of TWG Tea through the following acts, among others:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) OSIM’s exercise of its rights under the Profit Swing Clause to obtain an additional 10% of TWG Tea shares from Wellness and Paris;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) Ron Sim’s actions to remove Manoj as CEO of TWG Tea;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) Ron Sim’s proposal and OSIM’s and Paris’ approval of the TWG Tea Rights Issue, which was, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, not for commercial reasons and intended to dilute Wellness’ shareholding.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 On 22 April 2016, I dismissed the claims in S187/2014 – see <span class="font-italic">The Wellness Group Pte Ltd and another v OSIM International Ltd and others</span> [2016] 3 SLR 729. Among other things, I found as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Ron Sim’s negotiations over the Transfer Pricing Issue were for commercial reasons and not aimed at damaging TWG Tea’s profits.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) OSIM, Ron Sim, Peng Soon and Peter Lee did not act to damage the profitability of TWG Tea. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) OSIM did not cause TWG Tea’s failure to meet the performance target in the Profit Swing Clause and OSIM was entitled to exercise its rights under that clause.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) OSIM and Ron Sim encountered several issues which caused concerns about the future of TWG Tea and Manoj’s management of the same.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Ron Sim had genuine and reasonable grounds for wanting to remove Manoj as CEO.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) The Rights Issue was undertaken <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> and for good commercial reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Wellness’ appeal in CA/CA 64 of 2016 (“CA64/2016”) was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 25 October 2016.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The present action and the third party claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 On 10 January 2017, EQ Capital filed the present action, claiming minority oppression. On 6 February 2017, Sunbreeze, Manoj and Kanchan issued a third party notice against Ron Sim, claiming to be indemnified against any liability in respect of EQ Capital’s claim, or contribution. For ease of reference, I shall refer to Sunbreeze, Manoj and Kanchan, together, as “the 3 Defendants”. The fourth defendant, Wellness, is a nominal defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 On 24 March 2017, Ron Sim applied to strike out the third party notice and statement of claim. On 5 May 2017, I granted Ron Sim’s application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">EQ Capital’s claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 EQ Capital’s claim for minority oppression was based on the following matters:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Manoj and Kanchan caused Wellness not to convene any annual general meeting (“AGM”), file annual returns and prepare, file and provide EQ Capital with the audited accounts of Wellness for FY2011 to date. Consequently, EQ Capital has been and continues to be deprived of its rights to attend and participate at AGMs and to review the audited accounts of Wellness.

Instead, Ron Sim submitted that the third party claim should be struck out because (a) the statement of claim did not disclose any cause of action for any indemnity or contribution against him, and (b) it was redundant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I will deal with the redundancy ground first.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the third party claim was redundant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 A third party claim will be struck out if it is redundant: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure 2017</span> vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at para 16/6/1. A third party claim is redundant if it is based on allegations which if proved, would defeat the plaintiff’s claim (in which event there would be no need for the third party claim), and if not proved, would mean that the third party claim fails anyway. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 <span class="font-italic">Yong Kheng Leong and another v Panweld Trading Pte Ltd </span>[2013] 1 SLR 173 (“<span class="font-italic">Panweld</span>”) is authority for, and provides a good illustration of, the redundancy principle. In that case, the plaintiff company sued the first defendant, who was its director (and 20% shareholder), for breach of fiduciary duty in having placed his wife, the second defendant, on the company’s payroll and paid her salaries for over 17 years even though she was never an employee of the plaintiff. The defence was that the second defendant was an employee of the plaintiff, alternatively that the payments had been made with the approval of the only other shareholder, Loh. The first defendant brought a third party claim against Loh, and argued that he would be entitled to an indemnity or contribution from the third party because the payments had been made with Loh’s approval. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court’s dismissal of the third party claim against Loh because if Loh had agreed to the salary payments, then the first defendant would not be liable in the first place. On the other hand, if Loh had not agreed to the payments, then there would be no basis for seeking any indemnity or contribution from Loh (at [84]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Ron Sim submitted that the third party claim was redundant because both the defence and the third party statement of claim alleged that the matters complained of by EQ Capital were caused by Ron Sim / OSIM and not by the 3 Defendants. Thus, if the 3 Defendants proved this allegation, EQ Capital’s claim would fail and no question of a third party claim would arise. On the other hand, if the 3 Defendants could not prove this allegation, then the third party claim must fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The 3 Defendants did not dispute the redundancy principle but sought to distinguish <span class="font-italic">Panweld</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>on the ground that the third party claim in that case was dismissed on the merits and not in the context of a striking out application. In my view, the fact that <span class="font-italic">Panweld</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>did not involve an application to strike out the third party claim did not in any way diminish the redundancy principle. It is unarguable that if a third party claim is shown to be in fact redundant, then it ought to be struck out since there could be no reason to still allow it to proceed to trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The 3 Defendants next referred to <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span><span class="font-italic"> (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Kao Chai-Chau Linda and another suit</span> [2014] 2 SLR 673 (“<span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span>”). In that case, Airtrust sued Linda for breaches of director’s duties. Linda’s defence was that the transactions complained of were carried out on the instructions of one Peter who was then a shareholder and the chairman of Airtrust. Linda’s third party claim against the estate of Peter was based on the same allegation. The High Court decided that Linda’s third party claim against Peter should proceed to trial because it could not be said to be redundant at that stage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I agreed with the 3 Defendants’ submission that reliance on the same facts in the third party claim and the defence did not necessarily mean that the third party claim was redundant. Clearly, however, each case must depend on its own facts. In <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span>, the court was of the view that (a) even if Peter was the controlling mind of Airtrust, it did not follow that as a matter of law, Peter was free to do as he wished (at [54]), and (b) even though a director could avoid liability for breach by making a full disclosure and obtaining unanimous approval from all shareholders for that transaction, it did not appear that Peter and Linda owned all the shares in Airtrust at the relevant times and there was therefore a possibility that not all the shareholders would have necessarily agreed with all the transactions in issue (at [58]). The court therefore concluded that the fact that Linda acted on Peter’s instructions would “not necessarily, as a matter of law, absolve Linda from liability <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>[Airtrust]” (at [49]). Accordingly, the court refused to strike out the third party claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The question in the present case remained whether the third party claim  against Ron Sim was redundant as a result of the overlap between the third party claim and the defence such that regardless of whether the defence succeeded or failed, the third party claim would either not arise or would fail. The answer depended on an analysis of the pleadings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">AGMs and audited accounts of Wellness</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In its statement of claim EQ Capital claimed that Manoj and Kanchan caused Wellness to breach its obligations under the SHA, its Memorandum and Articles of Association and the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) by causing Wellness not to convene any AGM, file annual returns and prepare, file and provide EQ Capital with the audited accounts of Wellness for FY2011 to date.

It was clear that if the 3 Defendants succeeded in proving that the above matters were caused by Ron Sim / OSIM, that had to mean that EQ Capital would have failed to prove its case (with respect to these matters) against the 3 Defendants and the question of a third party claim would not arise. Conversely, if the 3 Defendants failed to prove that the above matters were caused or brought about by Ron Sim / OSIM, that had to mean that the 3 Defendants would also have failed to prove their case in their third party claim. In my view, the inescapable conclusion was that the third party claim (with respect to the above matters) was redundant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 As for EQ Capital’s claim with respect to the bringing of S187/2014 and CA64/2016, as noted earlier (at [55] above), even though the third party claim did not mirror the defence, it was based on the same allegation that the Profit Swing Clause Transaction and the Rights Issue were brought about by Ron Sim / OSIM. Again, if the 3 Defendants succeeded in proving that the Profit Swing Clause Transaction and the Rights Issue were caused by Ron Sim / OSIM, then EQ Capital’s claim would fail since then it could not be said that S187/2014 and CA64/2016 had no merit. However, if the 3 Defendants failed to prove that the Profit Swing Clause Transaction and the Rights Issue were caused by Ron Sim / OSIM, then the third party claim had to fail. In my view, therefore, the third party claim with respect to S187/2014 and CA64/2016 was also redundant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The 3 Defendants relied on <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span> and submitted that the third party claim should not be struck out because it was conceivable that the 3 Defendants might not be absolved from liability even if they proved that Ron Sim / OSIM caused the losses suffered by Wellness. In that event, the court would still have to decide whether Ron Sim was liable to indemnify or provide contribution.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In my view, it was not sufficient for the 3 Defendants to simply assert that this was conceivable. It was incumbent upon them to make out an arguable case by explaining why or how the 3 Defendants might still be liable to EQ Capital even if they proved that the matters complained of by EQ Capital had been caused by Ron Sim / OSIM and not by them. The 3 Defendants were not able to do so. In contrast, in <span class="font-italic">Airtrust</span>, the court clearly explained why it was arguable that Linda’s reliance on Peter’s instructions may not absolve her from liability <span class="font-italic">vis-</span><span class="font-italic">à-vis</span> the company (see [36] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In my judgment, on the facts as pleaded in this case, the 3 Defendants simply had no arguable case that they might still be liable to EQ Capital even if they proved that the matters complained about had been caused by Ron Sim / OSIM and not by them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 The 3 Defendants also argued that in their third party claim, they had pleaded that Ron Sim acted in bad faith and/or in an unconscionable manner and/or in an abuse of the court’s process in bringing or causing EQ Capital to bring this action against them. In my view, the averments of bad faith, unconscionability and abuse of process did not make the third party claim any less redundant. First, these same averments were also made in the defence. Second, and more importantly, the averments of bad faith, unconscionability and abuse of process were all based on the same allegation that the matters complained of by EQ Capital were caused or brought about by Ron Sim / OSIM. This much was plain from the third party statement of claim.

The third party statement of claim did not plead any express or implied contract or any statute pursuant to which Ron Sim was liable to indemnify the 3 Defendants.

A right to contribution usually arises as between joint debtors, or joint contractors, or joint trustees, or joint sureties, or joint wrongdoers, and it may be created by statute. The entitlement to contribution has been extended by s 15 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) which provides that, subject to the provisions of that section, “any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover contribution from any other person liable in respect of the same damage (whether jointly with him or otherwise)”. Section 15 of the CLA involves a three stage test: (a) what damage was suffered by the plaintiff, (b) whether the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in respect of that damage and (c) whether the person from whom contribution is sought is also liable to the plaintiff in respect of that very “same damage” or some of it.

As explained earlier, if the 3 Defendants prove this, then their defence succeeds and they would not be liable to EQ Capital. If the 3 Defendants cannot prove this, they would also fail in their third party claim.

</div> However, as discussed earlier, this meant that the third party claim was redundant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 The 3 Defendants next submitted that Ron Sim could not be allowed to use EQ Capital as his personal vehicle to make a claim against the 3 Defendants after having personally benefited from the dilution of Wellness’ shareholding in TWG Tea in that the dilution of Wellness’ shareholding resulted in a corresponding increase in OSIM’s shareholding in TWG Tea and Ron Sim was also the alter ego of OSIM. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 The 3 Defendants referred me to <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter and others and other appeals</span> [2013] 1 SLR 374 (“<span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club</span>”). In that case, the plaintiff (“RTC”) sued its former directors for breach of directors’ duties relating to (a) acceptance of membership applications for which RTC had in earlier separate proceedings been found liable to pay damages, (b) payment of management fees, (c) payment of directors’ and other fees, (d) transfer of a loan to a subsidiary company. The former directors commenced third party proceedings against the former directors <span class="font-italic">inter se</span> and against the current directors, seeking indemnity and contribution. The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court’s decision dismissing RTC’s claims but found that the current directors, who were also the current sole shareholders, had committed an actionable conspiracy in tort against the former directors by causing RTC to commence the action against the former directors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The Court of Appeal found (at [57]) that</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the current shareholders/directors had acquired the RTC shares at prices which had taken into account the four matters complained of in the action;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) as purchasers, the current shareholders/directors therefore had no claim arising from the sale of the shares to them;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if they were allowed to use RTC to claim damages against the former directors, and if RTC were to succeed, the current shareholders/directors would benefit personally as shareholders of RTC;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) this would be an unfair and unjust outcome and there was no reason why the separate legal personality of RTC should be allowed to unjustly enrich them in such a manner. The current directors were using RTC as a nominee to claim against the former directors for breaches of duties which the former directors as shareholders of RTC had already accepted or ratified over many years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 In my view, <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club</span> did not assist the 3 Defendants. In <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club</span>, the Court of Appeal found that the current shareholders/directors had acted unconscionably because they were using RTC to make a claim which they (as purchasers) could not and for breaches which had been ratified over many years. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In the present case, the 3 Defendants submitted that </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the dilution of Wellness’s shareholding in TWG Tea (arising from the Profit Swing Clause Transaction and the Rights Issue) resulted in an increase in OSIM’s shareholding in TWG Tea;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) as the alter ego of OSIM, Ron Sim therefore benefited from the dilution; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) EQ Capital’s claim was for Manoj and Kanchan to pay Wellness the loss in value which Wellness suffered by reason of the dilution of its shareholding in TWG Tea;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) if EQ Capital succeeded in its claim, it would benefit EQ Capital and in turn Ron Sim (as the alter ego of EQ Capital); and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) it was therefore unconscionable for Ron Sim to enrich himself by using EQ Capital to claim damages for Wellness’ losses caused by the same dilution which had benefited OSIM.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 In my view, the 3 Defendants’ submissions were flawed. Ron Sim could not benefit through EQ Capital in this action unless Manoj and Kanchan were found liable for causing the dilution of Wellness’ shareholding in TWG Tea. However, if Manoj and Kanchan were liable for causing the dilution, there was clearly nothing unconscionable in respect of (a) Ron Sim’s conduct or (b) OSIM’s increased shareholding in TWG Tea as a result of the Profit Swing Clause Transaction or the Rights Issue or (c) any benefit to EQ Capital as a result of Manoj and Kanchan being ordered to pay damages to Wellness for causing the dilution suffered by Wellness. On the contrary, it would be unconscionable to allow the 3 Defendants to escape having to compensate Wellness for the loss caused by them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether there were common issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Finally, the 3 Defendants submitted that the third party claim should not be struck out because there were common issues arising in EQ Capital’s claim and in the third party claim. The 3 Defendants submitted that the common issues included</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether Ron Sim was the alter ego and/or controlling mind and will of EQ Capital and OSIM; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) whether Ron Sim’s actions (personally or through OSIM) had caused the matters on which EQ Capital was claiming against the 3 Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Order 16 r 1(1)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Rules allows a defendant to issue a third party notice where he “requires that any question or issue relating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the action should be determined not only as between the plaintiff and the defendant but also as between either or both of them and a person not already a party to the action”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 I disagreed with the 3 Defendants. In my view, there was no reason for the alleged common issues to be determined as between either EQ Capital or the 3 Defendants and Ron Sim. For reasons set out earlier, the determination of these issues as between EQ Capital and the 3 Defendants (regardless of whether these issues are decided in favour of EQ Capital or the 3 Defendants) would render it unnecessary to determine these issues as between either EQ Capital or the 3 Defendants and Ron Sim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I agreed with Ron Sim that any way that one looked at the third party claim, it simply could not succeed. I therefore struck out the third party claim. I also ordered the 3 Defendants to pay costs to Ron Sim fixed at $16,000 inclusive of disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yeo Khirn Hai Alvin, SC, Koh Swee Yen, Lin Chunlong, Mak Shin Yi (Wong Partnership LLP) for the first to third defendants;<br/>Davinder Singh s/o Amar Singh, SC, Jaikanth Shankar, Tan Ruo Yu and Charlene Wong Su-Yi (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the third party.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
