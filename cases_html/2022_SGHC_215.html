HQH relied on the rule in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> (1843) 3 Hare 100 (“the <span class="font-italic">Henderson </span>rule”) and its application in <span class="font-italic">Venkatraman </span><span class="font-italic">Kalyanaraman v Nithya Kalyani and others</span> [2016] 4 SLR 1365 (“<span class="font-italic">Venkatraman</span>”) to argue that Ms Chen could no longer bring forth contentions pertaining to the circumstances under which the Principal and Supplementary Agreements were entered into.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As explained in <span class="font-italic">Venkatraman</span> (at [25]), the <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> rule, also known as the extended doctrine of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, “operates to preclude litigants in later proceedings from raising points not previously decided because they were not raised in the earlier proceedings, even though they <span class="font-italic">could</span> <span class="font-italic">and</span> <span class="font-italic">should</span> have been raised in those proceedings”. Hoo Sheau Peng JC (as she then was) went on to explain (at [33]) that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… it is evident that the <span class="font-italic">Henderson </span>rule may be engaged when the earlier proceedings concluded amicably, be it by way of a consent judgment or order issued by the court … or where the settlement agreement was entered into privately, without being embodied in a court judgment or order …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Applying the <span class="font-italic">Henderson </span>rule and <span class="font-italic">Venkatraman</span>, Ms Chen’s concerns about the enforceability and validity of the Principal and Supplementary Agreements were matters which should have been litigated at trial. Since the effect of the two Tomlin Orders was that proceedings had since been stayed, if Ms Chen truly intended to pursue her complaints vis-à-vis the Principal and Supplementary Agreements, she should have made an application for the stay to be lifted so that these matters could be heard at trial. Given that she had opted to settle the dispute, it was not for her to now reopen these matters before this court in relation to an application for final judgment on the Revised Tomlin Order.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1: Validity of the Revised Tomlin Order</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Nature and effect of Tomlin Orders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">A Tomlin Order is a consent order where a court action is stayed, on agreed-upon terms which are included in a schedule to the order.

In that case, Justice Tomlin held that when an order was made by consent staying an action on terms set out in a schedule to the order, the terms in the schedule were not an order of the court which ought directly to be enforced via proceedings for contempt.

In fact, the judge is not really concerned about approving or disapproving the terms of the settlement in these circumstances … It has been held that the terms agreed upon may extend beyond the ambit of the original action so that a term which could not have been enforced in respect of the original cause of action may be given legal effect as part of the settlement … What the order does is to impose a stay of further proceedings which is operative as long as the terms in the schedule are observed. If any breach is committed, the other party may apply to the court pursuant to the qualification in the order: ‘except for the purpose of carrying such terms into effect’. The court may then make the appropriate order requiring the party in breach to comply with the terms of the agreement.

The </span>High Court allowed the application (at [8]). On appeal, the appellants contended that the consent order in question was <span class="font-italic">not </span>a Tomlin Order and the original cause of action had been compromised and superseded by the parties’ agreement (at [19]). The CA noted that it was unclear what the appellant’s counsel’s point was in stating that the consent order was not a Tomlin Order, and that the respondents had <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">not suggested that it was one (at [20]).

It did not contain the essential characteristic of that order. The position here was that the terms of the settlement between the Appellant and the Relevant Respondents were in fact <span class="font-italic">incorporated</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>into the Consent Order, unlike what is usually countenanced under a Tomlin Order … – a separate schedule to the order, furnishing the precise terms that parties have agreed to.

In <span class="font-italic">Zenith Logistics Services (UK) Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">and others v Keates and others; UUU v BBB </span>[2020] 1 WLR 2982 (“<span class="font-italic">Zenith Logistics</span>”), the court noted that the Tomlin Order had “long been recognised as a useful form of order” (at [48]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It allows the parties to incorporate terms which the court could not order; and it cuts out the need for separate proceedings on the compromise agreement, if either party alleges that the terms have been broken.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 The court held that to ask whether the schedule is part of the court order at hand “is to set up a false dichotomy, and risks semantic confusion” (at [59]). On one hand, the schedule is part of a court order in that it is an integral part of a document approved, sealed and issued by the court in the exercise of the state’s judicial power. However, when one departs from the question of material form and instead considers the abstract question of what the court is doing, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, whether the schedule contains or records a direction or imperative issued by the court in the exercise of its judicial function, then the terms of settlement cannot be said to be part of the <span class="font-italic">immediately enforceable</span> court order (at [59]–[60]). Rather, the terms recorded in the schedule to a Tomlin Order amount to a contract between the parties which can only be enforced by means of a subsequent application (at [61]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In <span class="font-italic">Zenith Logistics</span>, the court considered the question of whether a <span class="font-italic">confidential</span> schedule to a Tomlin Order is permissible. The court noted that when parties submit an order in the classic form of a Tomlin Order, they are not seeking to engage the court’s coercive powers, but merely seeking the exercise of case management powers following a compromise of the claim (at [65]). The principle of open justice does not require parties to make their settlement agreements public, and as a rule, the court should not demand to see a settlement agreement which the parties have designated as confidential. The court hence held that a Tomlin Order does not represent endorsement or approval of the terms in the schedule or a conclusion that they are enforceable. The court normally has no business inspecting these terms unless and until an issue is raised on an application to enforce (at [66]–[67]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In <span class="font-italic">Community Care </span><span class="font-italic">North East (a partnership) v Durham County Council </span>[2012] 1 WLR 338 (“<span class="font-italic">Community Care North East</span>”), the court refused the defendant’s application to vary the terms of the schedule to a Tomlin Order. The court explained that unlike terms incorporated as part of a consent order, the schedule to a Tomlin order sets out an agreement between the parties. The terms of the schedule are not ordered by the court. Frequently, the terms of the agreement in the schedule are detailed and contain matters going beyond the scope of the original dispute in the proceedings. The court held that once parties have entered into an agreement, the ability to set aside or vary that agreement depends on there being a remedy in relation to that contract. Otherwise, the court is only concerned with the meaning of the agreement in that schedule (at [24]–[26]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 From the authorities cited, it can be seen that the operative order in a Tomlin Order is a stay of proceedings, with the court reserving the power, despite such stay, to make such orders as are necessary to enforce the terms of the schedule. The Tomlin Order does not mandate the performance of any term in the schedule, which operates merely as a <span class="font-italic">record </span>of the terms of the parties’ <span class="font-italic">contractual </span>agreement. It is only when the parties are deadlocked in relation to the performance of the terms in the schedule that the court may, upon application of any party and in exercise of the powers reserved to the court, make orders to enforce compliance of those terms.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sub-issue 1: Whether the first Tomlin Order curtailed the court’s power to lift the stay</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Counsel for Ms Chen took the position that Justice Wei, after issuing the first Tomlin Order, was <span class="font-italic">functus officio</span> when he granted the Revised Tomlin Order, save as to the power to enforce the terms of the Schedule or to clarify or correct the terms of its orders.

</div>
</div> At the hearing, counsel for Ms Chen further posited that the issuance of the first Tomlin Order curtailed the court’s powers to lift the stay for the purposes of granting the Revised Tomlin Order. The crux of counsel’s <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">submission was that</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> insofar as the first Tomlin Order had allowed for proceedings to be stayed, this meant that the original proceedings had come to an end. The only way parties could have moved forward was either to apply to court for enforcement of the first Tomlin Order or to apply for the first Tomlin Order to be expressly set aside.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 With the greatest respect to counsel for Ms Chen, I did not agree with this submission. The power of the court to stay proceedings is made under O 3 r 2(2) of the Rules of Court 2021, which provides that the court may do whatever it considers necessary on the facts of the case before it to ensure that justice is done or to prevent an abuse of process. A stay order means that further proceedings in the action are not allowed unless and until the stay is lifted. It follows that that the court has the power to lift the stay. The first Tomlin Order does not state, nor is it a necessary implication from its terms, that the court has no power to lift the stay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 There is simply no basis to suggest that the stay imposed under a Tomlin Order should carry with it a finality that is not found in a conventional stay of proceedings. Such a suggestion would have the absurd effect of nullifying the meaning of a stay by making it no different from the discontinuance or dismissal of proceedings.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Plaintiff’s Further Authority on Tomlin Orders.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> the English Court of Appeal held that the consent order in that case was not a Tomlin Order (at [47]). While the consent order in that case was expressed in similar terms to a Tomlin Order and purported to stay the proceedings, there were in fact no continuing proceedings as Vanden already had a court order which it could enforce for the payment of its claim. If one had regard to “what the [consent order] does rather than what it says”, the consent order in fact amounted to a final order in respect of Vanden’s claims (at [48]–[49]). In other words, the very nature of a stay is that it puts proceedings on temporary hold with the possibility of resumption. A Tomlin Order, being an order characterised by the stay it places on proceedings, simply cannot be painted as an order which puts proceedings to their final rest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I hence found that the court’s power to lift the stay of proceedings imposed by the first Tomlin Order was not curtailed. The next question was whether this stay had been lifted such that the Revised Tomlin Order could be granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Sub-issue 2: Whether the stay had been lifted when parties appeared before Justice Wei to seek the Revised Tomlin Order</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Counsel for Ms Chen submitted that an express application to lift the stay imposed by the first Tomlin Order was required. In response, counsel for HQH forwarded two alternative lines of argument. Firstly, counsel for HQH submitted that there was no need for the court to lift this stay before the Revised Tomlin Order could be imposed as it merely entailed a <span class="font-italic">revision</span> of the Schedule to the first Tomlin Order and not any change to the <span class="font-italic">substance of the order</span>. I was of the view that this was one possible interpretation of the effect of the Revised Tomlin Order. The first Tomlin Order was purely consensual and the result of an agreement of the parties to resolve their dispute in that manner. There was no reason in law or policy why the parties could not have arrived at a subsequent agreement to substitute a new arrangement in place of the old one to settle the matter. In <span class="font-italic">Community Care </span><span class="font-italic">North East </span>(at [31] above), the English High Court stated at [24] that generally, “once the parties have entered into an agreement the ability to set aside or vary that agreement depends on there being a remedy in relation to that contract”. I understood this to refer to the situation in which one party wishes to set aside or vary the agreement against the wishes of the other side. It cannot refer to the situation where all parties consent to the variation.

If there was no connection between the Schedule to the Revised Tomlin Order and these subsequent agreements in the first place, then it would not have been necessary for this court to examine whether she had given valid consent to the subsequent agreements or not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As such, it was important to consider the contents of the Deed of Agreement and the Addendum. As mentioned above (at [12]), cl 1 of the Deed of Agreement stated that HQH would withhold entering judgment on the Tomlin Order and the enforcement of outstanding payment against Ms Chen if Innovative would warrant to pay HQH the outstanding sum and if Ms Chen would procure 15% of Innovative’s share capital to be transferred to HQH for the consideration of $1. Clause 5 stated that if the two conditions in cl 1 were fulfilled, HQH would apply to discontinue this suit.

Counsel for Ms Chen appeared to suggest that the Deed of Agreement and Addendum were intertwined with the Revised Tomlin Order as they had made reference to the Revised Tomlin Order, such that one could not enforce the Revised Tomlin Order without reference to the Deed of Agreement and the Addendum. However, even though the Deed of Agreement and Addendum had <span class="font-italic">made reference</span> to the Revised Tomlin Order, the real question was whether the Revised Tomlin Order and/or the Schedule to it had been <span class="font-italic">modified</span> in any binding way by such subsequent agreements entered into between HQH and Ms Chen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Insofar as cl 5 made provisions for the discontinuance of this suit, it was the most probable clause that Ms Chen could rely on to suggest that the Deed of Agreement had modified the terms recorded in the Schedule to the Revised Tomlin Order. However, cl 5 required HQH to file a Notice of Discontinuance for this suit “within seven days of [Ms Chen] having fulfilled the conditions set out in 1(i) and l(ii) of this Agreement”. It was not disputed by Ms Chen that these conditions in cl 1 of the Deed of Agreement had not been fulfilled. As such, cl 5 did not come into play and was not relevant to this court’s consideration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 With respect to the Addendum, it did appear that cl 1.1 obliged HQH to refrain from enforcing the Revised Tomlin Order in return for a time premium cost. However, Ms Chen did not take the position in her affidavit that the Addendum was a binding agreement. Rather, she stated that it was signed by Mr Ang for and on behalf of HQH and that his designation in HQH was not specified.

</div> In oral submissions, counsel for Ms Chen also made the point that Ms Chen did not know the capacity in which Mr Ang had signed the Addendum. I then queried counsel on whether Ms Chen was seeking to disclaim liability under this agreement by saying that Mr Ang had not been authorised to sign the agreement on HQH’s behalf. Counsel for Ms Chen, however, declined to take a firm position on whether the Addendum was a valid agreement, despite having stated in the written submissions that the Deed of Agreement and the Addendum were “unenforceable, void or voidable”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As counsel for HQH rightly highlighted, Ms Chen had adopted a shifting position on the validity of the agreements subsequent to the Revised Tomlin Order. The lack of a firm position by Ms Chen as to the status of the Addendum meant that it was unnecessary – and in fact impossible – for the court to arrive at a conclusion as to the effect of cl 1.1 of the Addendum on the Revised Tomlin Order. If it was Ms Chen’s case that the Addendum was an invalid agreement, then it could not lie in her mouth to suggest that the Revised Tomlin Order had been modified by the Addendum. If it was Ms Chen’s case, however, that the Addendum was a valid agreement, then the argument that the Revised Tomlin Order had been modified by the Addendum would have remained open to her – but she would then also be bound by the obligation under cl 1.1 to pay a time premium cost of $1,600,000 to HQH. It was unsurprising that Ms Chen did not take the position that she was bound to make this payment. In light of her refusal to take a position on the validity of the Addendum (and to bite the bullet with respect to the trade-offs that either position would entail), there was no basis for the court to proceed on the basis that the Addendum was a valid agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 As such, I did not find that the subsequent agreements to the Revised Tomlin Order had modified the Revised Tomlin Order. Clause 5 of the Deed of Agreement was not activated as Ms Chen had not met her obligations under cl 1 of the same Deed of Agreement. Further, Ms Chen had not taken the position that the Addendum was valid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In light of the foregoing reasons, it was not necessary for me to make a determination on whether Ms Chen had entered the Addendum and Deed of Agreement without proper legal representation and without mother-tongue interpretation. However, I briefly noted that in any event, there did not appear to be sufficient evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that she had been unrepresented or had not understood the Deed of Agreement and the Addendum. Clause 8 of the Deed of Agreement in fact stated that the respective parties had been advised to seek independent legal advice on the agreement.

</div> I noted that at times, counsel’s written submissions on this point conflated arguments about the Schedule to the Revised Tomlin Order and arguments about the Principal and Supplementary Agreements; as mentioned above at [21]–[23], arguments on the latter are not relevant to the present application. I also noted that barring the irrelevant portions of the submissions, little had been done by counsel to establish how the Schedules to either the first Tomlin Order or the Revised Tomlin Order were void or voidable in the law of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Nonetheless, I proceeded to consider the terms recorded in the Schedule to the Revised Tomlin Order. On the evidence available, I did not see any reason to suggest that Ms Chen had entered into the settlement agreement under illegitimate pressure. In her affidavit, Ms Chen’s evidence was that she had been “financially crippled by the Mareva Injunction and under tremendous economic and psychological pressure with the threat of imprisonment if [she] breached the [i]njunction orders” and hence consented to the two Tomlin Orders.
