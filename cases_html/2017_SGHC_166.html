On 23 April 2014, the plaintiff’s board of directors passed a resolution to take appropriate legal action to protect its rights given GMayer’s failure to cooperate and comply with the audit requirements.

With the amendments, the plaintiff had lost the ability to do so, and so the amendments had effectively and substantially decreased the plaintiff’s control of GMayer. Moreover the amended Articles 41 and 61 now required general meetings of shareholders to be held in GMayer’s office in China, and proxy votes would no longer be counted for the purposes of passing special resolutions. This consolidated the power of GMayer in China and made it more difficult for the plaintiff to be involved in its business on a shareholder level. Finally, the amended Articles 92.viii.b and 92.viii.c vested more power in GMayer’s directors to deliberate and approve investments and related transactions. With the plaintiff’s power to control the appointment and removal of GMayer’s directors removed, GMayer’s directors had given themselves control over GMayer to the exclusion and detriment of the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">12 </span>Lo signed the First Resolution as the plaintiff’s representative.

The proposed amendments were to Articles 41, 61, 66, 92.viii.b and 92.viii.c of the Articles (as at [10] above). Wu wanted the amendments to be passed at the First GM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">19 </span>However, Wu was worried that he could not attend the First GM due to ill health. Hence, he asked Lo to attend the meeting as his proxy and to vote in favour of passing the proposed First Resolution. To this end, Wu instructed Lo to prepare a letter of authorisation (“the Authorisation Letter”) to authorise Lo as his proxy at the First GM. Lo claimed that although it was Wu’s idea to amend GMayer’s Articles in the manner stated in the First Resolution, Lo agreed with Wu as it was Lo’s duty to protect GMayer from being stolen by “outsiders” through unscrupulous means. Hence, Lo was determined to assist Wu to protect Mayer Taiwan’s investment in GMayer by “keeping the status quo”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">20 </span>Lo asked Shen to prepare the Authorisation Letter and go to Taiwan to obtain Wu’s signature on that letter.

The Second GM thus took place at GMayer’s premises without Wu, and the Second Resolution was passed and signed by all the attending shareholders.

Lo’s employment with Mayer HK was not relevant to my findings on whether Lo had breached his duties to the plaintiff.  Lo ceased to be Mayer HK’s director in 2012. Hence the Employment Agreement no longer applied, as the material events relating to this dispute occurred from late 2013.  Even if Lo, as Mayer HK’s director, had an obligation to protect Mayer Taiwan’s interest as he claimed, it was clear from the Employment Agreement that he was also obliged to protect the plaintiff’s interest.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">28 </span>Third, I found that Lo was not the plaintiff’s representative on GMayer’s board of directors at the material time, namely from late 2013.

This was despite that Wu would be authorising Lo to act on his behalf to support the draft amendments. Shen did not testify. Additionally, Yung saw Shen bringing only the Authorisation Letters for Wu.

He claimed that it was Wu’s idea to amend GMayer’s Articles in the specified manner, yet it transpired otherwise. His account was riddled with inconsistencies and there were several instances where he changed his testimony on the stand. He claimed that Wu had informed him that Mayer Taiwan wanted to take active steps to protect its investments in GMayer (as a result of Mayer HK’s shares being transferred to Bumper and Aspial and the ensuing lawsuits (see [17] above)) which resulted in Lo following Wu’s instructions to do so. However, he later stated that it was neither Mayer Taiwan nor its board of directors who wished to protect GMayer’s interest but only Wu.

He was, after all, concerned to protect GMayer’s interest from outsiders and it would have been in his interest to satisfy himself that the draft amendments would achieve his goal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">35 </span>I therefore rejected Lo’s attempt in creating the impression that he merely played a supporting role and did Wu’s bidding, and that it was Wu who had instructed Lo on the specific amendments to the Articles. Even if Wu had suggested to Lo to keep GMayer’s interest status quo, I found that Lo had been the primary actor in respect of preparing the draft amendments to the Articles and the First Resolution. He actively procured the draft amendments to the Articles, as he claimed to have instructed Zhang (an independent director of GMayer and his good friend) to come up with the proposed amendments. He examined the draft amendments to ensure that they met his requirements and he readily acted as Wu’s proxy in the First GM. Lo has been the chairman of GMayer since its incorporation; it was inconceivable that he was merely doing Wu’s bidding in relation to GMayer’s affairs. Additionally, it must be borne in mind that at the material time, Wu was in a frail condition, did not subsequently attend the First GM and passed on about a year later. His involvement in this whole matter would have been minimal at best. As such, I found that, more likely than not, Lo was actually making the decisions on how to protect GMayer’s interest independently and without much input from Wu. For instance, a proposal to delay cooperating with Mayer HK’s request for an audit of GMayer was only added during the First GM itself

Lo admitted that the amended Article 41 achieved the effect that he intended. Hence, it was beside the point for him to claim that shareholder meetings had always been held in GMayer’s office and he merely wanted to institutionalise this practice.

</div> Indeed Lo confirmed that in the past, the plaintiff (which held 81.4% of the shares in GMayer) would have been able to appoint and dismiss a director on its own, but that it could no longer do so as the amended Articles now required a minimum 85% of the votes of shareholders, who must also be present at the meeting for their votes to be counted as valid, before a director can be elected to or dismissed from the post.

</div> He also claimed that the amendment was not necessary to preserve GMayer’s status quo, which I did not accept. It was clear that Article 92 as amended would vest more power in GMayer’s directors to deliberate and approve investments and related transactions. Coupled with other amendments to the Articles which reduced the plaintiff’s power to control the appointment and removal of GMayer’s directors, the directors of GMayer had effectively vested more power in themselves and secured their own positions, while correspondingly reducing the degree of oversight that the plaintiff originally had. Indeed, Lo agreed that the effect of the articles amended via the First Resolution was to entrench his position as chairman of GMayer.

The fact remained that, with the amendments to the Articles, the plaintiff’s power and ability to control the composition of GMayer’s board and have oversight over the board’s management of the company were already diminished.

</div> At the time when Wu purportedly made the suggestion, the board’s term was not due to expire until end 2016. There was also no explanation as to why the term needed to be changed from three to five years, when the board of directors could be reappointed after the expiry of their three-year term. It was more likely that Lo had initiated the proposal to extend the board’s term as an agenda of the Second Resolution; Lo in fact admitted as such in his own testimony.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">46 </span>Second, Lo stated that <span class="font-italic">he</span> had discussed with GMayer’s directors and came up with the amendments to the Articles.

</div> He then clarified that he discussed with the other directors specifically regarding the amendment to lengthen the term of the board of directors, and invited them to make other amendments to the Articles to prevent Bumper and Aspial from interfering with GMayer’s business. Yet, there was no evidence from Lo or the other directors as to what proposals were eventually suggested by the latter. Going by Lo’s testimony, he clearly played an active role in procuring amendments to the Articles to protect GMayer’s interest. Lo had also read through the draft amendments and admitted that he understood the contents and was satisfied that it accorded with what he intended to achieve for GMayer.

</div> Second, Lo claimed that did not know whether a notice was sent to all the shareholders regarding the convening of the First and Second GMs, although the board of directors had an obligation to issue that notice pursuant to Article 45. In fact, there was no evidence that any notice was actually sent to the plaintiff and of what the notice contained.

</div>. According to Yung, the Authorisation Letter was signed around 14 March 2014, which <span class="font-italic">pre-dated</span> the notification to the shareholders of the First GM that GMayer prepared. If so, there would have been no agenda or proposed resolution for the First GM on which the Authorisation Letter was purportedly to address. Fourth, and surprisingly, despite Article 61 being amended (at the First GM) just six months before the Second GM, the result of which was that shareholders must be present for their votes to be considered and voting by proxy was no longer allowed, the Second Resolution was brought to Wu’s home in Taiwan (at Lo’s instructions) for him to approve (as the plaintiff’s representative) after the Second GM had concluded! Lo could not say that he did not know of the requirement in the amended Article 61, having read it and procured the amendment to that article.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">51 </span>Lo’s reply to all these was essentially that he was not in charge of the procedural matters and left them to his staff.

</div> He even asserted that signing a resolution after a general meeting was over “was allowed in China because [Wu] was sick”. It was clear that he was feigning ignorance of the procedural requirements set out in the Articles relating to shareholders’ meetings and trying to deflect responsibility.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">52 </span>The above reinforced my view that Lo wanted to move the Second GM and Resolution along, ignoring the proper process for doing so, in order to achieve his primary purpose of keeping away outsiders’ influence in GMayer. The “outsiders” in this case would have included the plaintiff, for by this time, the shares in Mayer HK (which owned the plaintiff) were now owned by Bumper and Aspial. The above also fortified my view that Lo played the key role in preparing the agenda for the passing of the Second Resolution as well as for the First Resolution. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Second Resolution passed was in the plaintiff’s best interest</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">53 </span>I found that the Second Resolution, passed at the Second GM, effectively sought to vest more power in GMayer’s board of directors and reduced the plaintiff’s power to control the appointment and removal of GMayer’s board. First, the amended Article 20 of the Articles now allowed the board of directors to approve the provision of financial assistance to a purchaser or potential purchaser of GMayer’s shares, when such financial assistance was previously prohibited under GMayer’s Articles. I agreed with the plaintiff that if such financial assistance was extended, it could potentially reduce the amount of working capital available to GMayer, and thus may not be in the interest of the plaintiff as the majority shareholder of GMayer.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">54 </span>Further the resolution to extend the term of the board of GMayer from three to five years, coupled with the amended Articles 61 and 66 (made at the First GM), was clearly to GMayer’s board’s advantage and was calculated to reduce the plaintiff’s influence in GMayer. Lo agreed that with the amended Articles 61 and 66, the plaintiff could no longer dismiss a director of GMayer on its own. In addition, given that GMayer would still require the plaintiff’s cooperation in electing a new board when the present term of the directors expired (as the plaintiff controlled 81.4% of GMayer’s shares), the extension of the term of a director from three to five years would enable Lo to keep the plaintiff from having a say over the composition of the board for an additional two years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">55 </span>As for the plaintiff’s claim that the transfer of Jiangsu 2 and Suzhou’s shares was the subject of a right of pre-emption as set out in the GMayer Metal JV Contract, I found that this was not the case. The GMayer Metal JV Contract was superceded by the GMayer Agreement, and the latter did not contain a clause conferring a right of pre-emption.

</div> Nevertheless this did not affect my overall findings, that the Second Resolution, as with the First Resolution, was clearly intended to protect GMayer’s interest by removing as much control of GMayer from the plaintiff’s interference.

So it was hard to believe that he was looking after Mayer Taiwan’s interest, even if he remained a minority shareholder of Mayer Taiwan. If Wu and Lo were indeed desirous of protecting Mayer Taiwan’s interest in GMayer, they would have consulted Mayer Taiwan’s board when GMayer intended to amend its Articles or to hold the First and Second GMs. There was no evidence that they did so. Lo in fact claimed that it was only Wu, and not Mayer Taiwan or its board, who was desirous of protecting GMayer’s interest. Moreover, at the material time, Mayer Taiwan was not even a majority shareholder (albeit indirectly) of GMayer. In fact, Lo would have known, with the on-going lawsuits regarding Bumper and Aspial, that once the shares in Mayer HK were transferred to them, Mayer Taiwan would no longer hold any shares in, and would no longer have any control of, GMayer. This was the case by 19 August 2014, which was before the Second GM

</div>.  By then Mayer Taiwan no longer had any interest in GMayer to protect. I found that, essentially, Lo was trying to consolidate his own position in GMayer by protecting it from outside interference.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Lo’s duties as a director of the plaintiff </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">58 </span>A director owes duties to his company under statute and common law. Section 157 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) states that a director shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office.<span style="color: rgba(0,112,192,1)"> </span>The duty to act honestly is the statutory equivalent of the duty under common law to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interest of the company (<span class="font-italic">Townsing Henry George v Jenton Overseas Investment Pte Ltd (in liquidation)</span> [2007] 2 SLR(R) 597 (“<span class="font-italic">Townsing</span>”) at [59]). An important facet of this duty of honesty (or duty to act in good faith) is, in turn, a director’s duty of loyalty to his company (<span class="font-italic">Townsing</span> at [60]). This entails a duty for the director to safeguard the company’s interest and not to put himself in a position of conflict.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">59 </span>Where a director of a company is also a director of other companies within a group, each company in the group is a separate legal entity and the director is not entitled to sacrifice the interest of one company in the group for that of another. The proper test for whether a director has breached his duty to the company concerned is whether an intelligent and honest man in his position could, in the whole of the existing circumstances, have reasonably believed that the transactions were for the benefit of the company – <span class="font-italic">Charterbridge Corporation Ltd v Lloyds Bank Ltd</span> [1970] Ch 62, cited in <span class="font-italic">Intraco Ltd v Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd</span> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064 at [28] and in <span class="font-italic">Golden Village Multiplex Pte Ltd v Phoon Chiong Kit</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 307 at [36] (“<span class="font-italic">Golden Village Multiplex</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew</span> [1998] Ch 1, cited in <span class="font-italic">Townsing</span> at [64], Millett LJ dealt with the “no conflict rule”, and divided the rule in sub-categories which he called “the double employment rule”, “the duty of good faith”, “the no inhibition principle” and “the actual conflict rule” (at 18-19):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A fiduciary who acts for two principals with potentially conflicting interests without the informed consent of both is in breach of the obligation of undivided loyalty; he puts himself in a position where his duty to one principal <span class="font-italic">may</span> conflict with his duty to the other: see <span class="font-italic">Clark Boyce v Mouat</span> [1994] 1 AC 428 and the cases there cited. This is sometimes described as “the double employment rule”. Breach of the rule automatically constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">That, of course, is not the end of the matter. Even if a fiduciary is properly acting for two principals with potentially conflicting interests he must act in good faith in the interests of each and must not act with the intention of furthering the interests of one principal to the prejudice of those of the other … I shall call this “the duty of good faith”. But it goes further than this. He must not allow the performance of his obligations to one principal to be influenced by his relationship with the other. He must serve each as faithfully and loyally as if he were his only principal.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... [T]he principle which is in play is that the fiduciary must not be inhibited by the existence of his other employment from serving the interests of his principal as faithfully and effectively as if he were the only employer. I shall call this “the no inhibition principle”. Unless the fiduciary is inhibited or believes (whether rightly or wrongly) that he is inhibited in the performance of his duties to one principal by reason of his employment by the other his failure to act is not attributable to the double employment.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Finally, the fiduciary must take care not to find himself in a position where there is an <span class="font-italic">actual</span> conflict of duty so that he cannot fulfil his obligations to one principal without failing in his obligations to the other: see <span class="font-italic">Moody v Cox and Hatt</span> [1917] 2 Ch 71; <span class="font-italic">Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Smith</span> (1991) 102 ALR 453. If he does, he may have no alternative but to cease to act for at least one and preferably both. The fact that he cannot fulfil his obligations to one principal without being in breach of his obligations to the other will not absolve him from liability. I shall call this “the actual conflict rule”.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">60 </span>In the present case, there was no question of Lo breaching the double employment rule because the plaintiff was aware of his appointment as a director on GMayer’s board at the material time and would have acquiesced to it. However, Lo had breached the duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interest of the plaintiff and the duty of good faith. He did not served the plaintiff faithfully and loyally as if the plaintiff was his only principal and had clearly subordinated the plaintiff’s interest to that of GMayer and his. It was clear from his own conduct that he played a major role in the preparation of the amendments to GMayer’s Articles, in convening the First and Second GMs, and in procuring the passing of the Resolutions during those meetings. Lo had acted as Wu’s proxy in the First GM. There was also no evidence that the plaintiff, through Wu as its legal representative in GMayer or otherwise, was made aware of the contents of the First Resolution before it was passed. The plaintiff was clearly unaware of the contents of the Second Resolution before it was passed, as Wu signed the Second Resolution only after the Second GM was over. Further it was Lo who ensured that the Second Resolution was handed to Wu for his approval (as the plaintiff’s representative on GMayer). By engineering the passing of the Resolutions which Lo knew were to the plaintiff’s detriment, he had favoured the interest of GMayer and his at the expense of the plaintiff and had put himself in a position of actual conflict. Clearly, Lo was not even concerned with the interest of the plaintiff (which he maintained was merely a shell company), and had categorically maintained that his interest was in protecting GMayer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">61 </span>In <span class="font-italic">Golden Village Multiplex</span>, the defendant was a director of the plaintiff, Golden Village Multiplex Pte Ltd (“GVM”), as well as of Golden Harvest Films Distribution (Pte) Ltd (“GHFD”). GVM sued GHFD for breach of an agreement, and the defendant, from his attendance at board meetings of GVM and his access to GVM’s correspondence, gained confidential information that could be used by GHFD against GVM in relation to the lawsuit. The court held that he was prohibited from using those information for the benefit of GHFD and to the detriment of GVM, as to do so would be in breach of his fiduciary duties owed to GVM. It found that the defendant was openly siding with GHFD in relation to the lawsuit, and so had clearly acted in conflict of his duties as GVM’s director. The defendant could not subordinate the interests of GVM to those of GHFD in a situation where their interests were in obvious conflict and he should have adopted a “remain above the fray” stance and refrained from acting for or against the interests of either GVM or GHFD (see<span class="font-italic"> Golden Village Multiplex </span>at [48]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">62 </span>In the present case, it was clear that Lo, who was then the plaintiff’s director, did not remain above the fray but was deeply embroiled in it. He was obviously favouring GMayer’s interest over that, and to the detriment, of the plaintiff. He had thus also breached his duty of loyalty to the plaintiff. It did not make a difference that when Lo committed the acts complained of, he was acting in his capacity as GMayer’s director and not as the plaintiff’s director, as a rigid compartmentalisation of a director’s conduct vis-à-vis a subsidiary and its parent company is to be eschewed (<span class="font-italic">Townsing</span> at [62], see also <span class="font-italic">Gardner v Parker</span> [2004] 1 BCLC 417 at [16]–[23]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">63 </span>In addition, having possessed information, acquired in the course of his duties as a director of GMayer, that resolutions may be passed by the shareholders of GMayer which would be detrimental to the plaintiff’s interest, Lo had a duty to disclose this information to the plaintiff. In <span class="font-italic">Item Software (UK) Ltd v Fassihi and others</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 1244 (“<span class="font-italic">Item </span><span class="font-italic">Software</span>”), the Court of Appeal held (at [41]) that while a director does not owe a <span class="font-italic">separate and independent duty</span> to disclose to the company information of relevance and concern to it, his fundamental duty to act in what he in good faith considers to be the best interests of the company requires him to make such disclosures. This was essentially the application of the duty of loyalty (<span class="font-italic">Item Software</span> at [41] and [67]). In that case, the defendant, Fassihi, was the sales and marketing director of the claimant company. While a director of the claimant, and without informing the claimant, Fassihi set up his own company to attempt to take over a distribution contract (with another company) that another director of the claimant was trying to secure for the claimant. The court held that Fassihi had a duty to inform the claimant that he was also vying for the contract. In <span class="font-italic">British Midland Tool Ltd v Midland International Tooling Ltd and others</span> [2003] BCLC 523 (“<span class="font-italic">British Midland</span>”), Hart J held (at [89]) that a director's duty to act so as to promote the best interests of his company <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> includes a duty to inform the company of any activity, actual or threatened, which damages those interests. In that case, three directors of the company who stood by and did nothing when they found out that a fourth director was planning to set up a competing business and was trying to poach members of the company’s workforce, were held to have breached their duty to the company. They had a duty to take active steps to avert the process by alerting their fellow directors to what was going on. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">64 </span>The duty of a director to inform the company of information he possesses that he in good faith considers is in the interest of the company to know, extends to disclosures of the director’s own breaches of duty or misconduct. In <span class="font-italic">Bell v Lever Bros L</span><span class="font-italic">td</span> [1931] ALL ER Rep 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Bell v Lever Bros</span>”), the appellants had been employed by the respondents to act as the chairman and vice-chairman respectively of one of their subsidiaries. Subsequently, an agreement was entered into between the appellants and the respondents to terminate the appellants’ contracts of service in return for a substantial sum. After they had paid the sums to the appellants, the respondents learnt that the appellants had, while in their employment, engaged in secret dealings which involved the diversion of trading opportunities which properly belonged to the subsidiaries. The respondents thus claimed for repayment of the sums, contending that they would not have entered into the agreements to compensate the appellants if they had known that they were entitled to dismiss them summarily. The majority of the House of Lords held that the appellants owed no duty to disclose their prior misconduct and that the agreements accordingly could not be set aside on the ground of its non-disclosure. Importantly, however, the appellants in <span class="font-italic">Bell v Lever Bros</span> were not directors but mere employees of the respondents, although Lord Thankerton stated (at 231 of the judgment), in <span class="font-italic">orbiter dicta</span>, that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In the absence of fraud … I am of opinion that neither a servant nor a director of a company is legally bound forthwith to disclose any breach of the obligations arising out of the relationship so as to give the master or the company the opportunity of dismissal …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">65 </span>The above <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> by Lord Thankerton, that a director is not legally bound to disclose to the company any breach of his own obligations as a director, has not been followed in subsequent decisions. In <span class="font-italic">Item Software</span> (discussed at [63] above), the Court of Appeal, in holding the defendant director liable, noted (at [34]) that the duties of a director are in general higher than those imposed by law on an employee, because a director is not simply a senior manager of a company, but is a fiduciary. Likewise, in <span class="font-italic">British Midland</span> (also discussed at [63] above), Hart J held that the fact that any one of the three directors in that case was himself in breach of duty did not absolve him from his duty to report breaches by the others. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">66 </span>Thus, in the present case, Lo had a duty, arising from his fundamental duty to act in what he in good faith considers to be the best interest of the plaintiff, to inform the plaintiff of the proposed amendments to the Articles to be passed at the First and Second GMs, which he knew would be against the plaintiff’s interest. He did not do so. In fact, although Lo was the chairman of GMayer’s board and the Articles required the board to send notices of general meetings to the shareholders (see [49] above), there was no evidence that GMayer had actually sent a notice to the plaintiff regarding the convening of the First and Second GMs nor had the plaintiff actually seen a copy of the proposed First and Second Resolutions before the First and Second GMs were held. This is even if Wu was the plaintiff’s representative on GMayer. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">67 </span>Finally, although Lo maintained that the plaintiff was merely a shell company for Mayer Taiwan’s investment in GMayer, this did not assist his case. Each company is a separate legal entity and a director of a particular company is not entitled to sacrifice the interest of that company for the interest of another company. Moreover, this “shell” company held an 81.4% share in GMayer which had real manufacturing assets and was in active trade.<span style="color: rgba(112,48,160,1)"> </span>In any event, even if, as Lo maintained, he only owed a duty to serve the interest of Mayer Taiwan and not of the plaintiff, I had found that Lo was not desirous of protecting Mayer Taiwan’s interest (see [56]–[57] above). Indeed, around 19 August 2014, Bumper and Aspial had become substantial shareholders of the plaintiff and it ill behoves the defence to say that there was no harm done to the plaintiff since its control over GMayer was illusory or non-existent to begin with.

</div>), which Lo already knew, before the First GM, was in a state of tussle. Lo was in essence protecting GMayer’s and his interest from all outsiders’ control and interference, including from the plaintiff itself. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">68 </span>In conclusion, I found that Lo, as a director of the plaintiff, had acted in breach of his duties to the plaintiff. He had breached the duty to act <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> in the interest of the plaintiff and the duty of good faith. He had placed himself in a position of conflict with the plaintiff, consciously preferred his own interest over that of the plaintiff, and, where the plaintiff’s and GMayer’s interest were in direct conflict, preferred GMayer’s interest over that of the plaintiff. As such, I granted the plaintiff’s claim for a declaratory relief that Lo had acted in breach of his duties to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Costs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">69 </span>Costs should normally follow the event, except when it appears to the court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Ho Kon Kim v Lim Gek Kim Betsy and others and another appeal</span> [2001] 3 SLR(R) 253 at [12]. Generally, a successful party who has not raised issues or made allegations improperly or unreasonably should not be deprived of his costs: <span class="font-italic">Tullio Planeta v Maoro Andrea G</span> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 501 at [24]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">70 </span>Defence counsel submitted, however, that the costs of the trial should nonetheless be reserved to after the assessment of damages hearing had taken place, as it could well be that the plaintiff may only obtain nominal damages. He cited the cases of An<span class="font-italic">glo-Cyprian Trade Agencies</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v Paphos Wine Industries Ltd</span> [1951] 1 All ER 873 (“<span class="font-italic">Anglo-Cyprian</span>”) and <span class="font-italic">Alltrans Express</span><span class="font-italic"> Ltd v CVA Holdings Ltd </span>[1984] 1WLR 394 (“<span class="font-italic">Alltrans Express Ltd</span>”) for the principle that a plaintiff who gets only nominal damages should not be regarded as successful at trial and hence the court should in such cases award costs to the defendant as if the defendant had succeeded in his defence. This principle has been adopted locally in the case of <span class="font-italic">Mahtani and others v K</span><span class="font-italic">iaw Aik Hang Land Pte Ltd</span> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 996 (“<span class="font-italic">Mahtani</span>”). As the court explained in <span class="font-italic">Mahtani</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(at [57]), the policy behind the principle is to discourage frivolous litigation, since not every breach of contract will actually cause loss to the innocent party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">71 </span>In my view, the principle was inapplicable here. In <span class="font-italic">Anglo-Cyprian</span>, the plaintiff initially claimed over £2,000 in damages for defects in wines bought under a sale of goods agreement. By amendment at the trial they pleaded in the alternative that they were entitled to £52, which was granted by the court. In <span class="font-italic">Alltrans Express Ltd</span>, the plaintiff claimed £82,500 for breach of a warranty given by the defendants in an agreement for sale of a company’s shares, but the court found that such damages could not be proved and only awarded the plaintiff nominal damages of £2. Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Mahtani</span>, the court awarded nominal damages of only $10 for the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant for breach of contract to construct a flat in a good and workmanlike manner. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">72 </span>In the three cases cited, the relief sought by the plaintiffs were monetary damages. Thus, having only been awarded nominal or trivial damages, they could not be said to have really succeeded in their claim and the successful party was in fact the defendants: see <span class="font-italic">Alltrans Express Ltd </span>at 401 and <span class="font-italic">Anglo-Cyprian</span> at 875. Consequently, in <span class="font-italic">Alltrans Express Ltd</span> and <span class="font-italic">Anglo-Cyprian</span>, it was the defendants which were entitled to costs. In <span class="font-italic">Mahtani</span>, the court awarded the plaintiffs costs of the action up to the commencement of trial. Apart from the claim for breach of contract to construct the flat in a good and workmanlike manner, the plaintiff had another claim based on a shortfall in the floor area of the flat (for which the court eventually awarded the full damages sought), and it was not until the start of the trial that the defendants conceded the shortfall claim and dropped a point challenging the plaintiff’s right to sue. As for the costs incurred at the trial itself, the defendants were awarded only 50% of the costs even though the plaintiff only obtained nominal damages for the claim for breach of contract to construct the flat in a good and workmanlike manner. This was because the trial was unduly prolonged by the defendants’ insistence that they had not breached their duty to construct the flat in a good and workmanlike manner, and the court was of the view that the defence was an academic defence which had little chance of success.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">73 </span>In contrast, in the present proceedings, the plaintiff’s main claim was for a declaratory relief that Lo had acted in breach of his duty as a director of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had informed defence counsel, since the start of the trial (which had been bifurcated), that it might not proceed to the next phase on assessment of damages, as its primary claim was for a declaration that Lo was in breach of his duties as its director. The claim was nevertheless defended vigorously by Lo. The plaintiff had not brought the litigation frivolously and had not conducted the litigation improperly or unreasonably. It was also not a case in which the plaintiff had little chance of success on its claim for a declaratory relief. As the plaintiff had succeeded in its claim, costs should follow the event. I therefore awarded the plaintiff costs of $93,500 with reasonable disbursements, which was well within the costs guidelines as set out in Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions. If the plaintiff proceeds to assess damages and only succeeds in obtaining nominal damages, the court hearing the assessment may take that into account in determining the costs of the assessment.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Audrey Lim<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Gan Theng Chong and Yik Shu Ying (Lee &amp; Lee) for the plaintiff;<br/>Woo Tchi Chu and Lim Rui Cong Roy (Robert Wang &amp; Woo LLP) for the first defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="HN-CaseName text-center font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
