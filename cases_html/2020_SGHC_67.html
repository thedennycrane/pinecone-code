Anthony was the executive director and CEO of Aussino USA, but he had no shareholding in Aussino USA. Anthony owned 100,000 shares in the Company, for which he paid $100,000. Afterwards, on the introduction of her husband (“Ben”), the first defendant (“Gao”) joined Anthony as his business partner in running the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Company wanted to rent a unit at Harbourfront, but the landlord required the Company to have a minimum paid-up capital of $200,000. At Ben’s proposal, Anthony transferred 50,000 shares to Gao, so that each of them held 50,000 shares in the Company as at 24 October 2017. On the same day, Gao was appointed a director of the Company. On 26 October 2017, a further 50,000 shares were issued to Anthony and Gao each, so that each of them held 100,000 shares in the Company. The purchase price of the 100,000 newly-issued shares was set-off against a loan of $100,000 that Anthony had previously made to the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 After some time, the working relationship between Anthony and Gao deteriorated. Parties negotiated for Anthony’s exit from the Company. Anthony proposed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”), under which the Company would be granted a three-year license to use the Mark from Aussino USA. Gao, however, wanted the license to be “indefinite”. Negotiations broke down. Anthony resigned as director on 11 May 2018, while remaining a 50% shareholder of the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 After Anthony’s resignation as director, he used another company he owned, Aussino Fashion Pte Ltd (“Aussino Asia”), to set up operations selling products branded with the Mark. Gao, in turn, proceeded to issue 2,400,000 shares to herself at the nominal price of $1 on 21 May 2018. This resulted in a dilution of Anthony’s shares in the Company from 50% to about 4%. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 Anthony brought the following claims against Gao and the Company:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Against Gao, two claims for $50,000 each, for money that Anthony paid to obtain the shares in the Company for Gao; and another claim under s 216 Companies Act (Cap 60, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”); and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Against the Company, a claim for $450,000, being repayment of the loans that he had made to the Company.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Gao bought two counterclaims against Anthony:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) A claim for $450,000, being the recovery of her loans to the Company, based on misrepresentations which she said Anthony had made to induce her to invest in the Company; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) A claim for $700,000, for breach of an agreement that the Company would be able to use the Mark exclusively in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Company also brought counterclaims against Anthony for breaches of director’s duties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 I will address the claims and counterclaims in turn.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Anthony’s claims</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">$50,000 from Gao for the 50,000 shares transferred to her</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 It was not disputed that parties had entered into an agreement on 20 October 2017 (“the October Agreement”), which set out the structure of their shareholding in the Company. Under the October Agreement, Gao was to pay Anthony $50,000 for the latter to transfer her 50,000 shares in the Company; and they would each pay an equal amount to the Company for the issuance of new shares. It is also undisputed that Gao has not paid Anthony the $50,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Gao claimed she was induced to enter into the October Agreement because of the following misrepresentations from Anthony:

</div> This was a mere six days after the October Agreement was entered into.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 As for the alleged representation that Aussino USA – a company controlled by Anthony – owned the Mark, Gao’s case on this issue did not make sense.  It was not disputed that Aussino USA <span class="font-italic">is</span> the owner of the Mark – so any representation by Anthony to this effect would not be false.  As to whether Anthony <span class="font-italic">misrepresented </span><span class="font-italic">that he</span> <span class="font-italic">controlled </span><span class="font-italic">Aussino USA</span>, in the first place there was no documentary or other objective evidence of Anthony making such a representation.  However, even if Anthony had represented that he controlled Aussino USA, the Defendants themselves clearly accept such a representation would be true.  In fact, the Defendants themselves pleaded in their Defence and Counterclaim that Anthony “effectively has control over Aussino USA”.

On the evidence before me, the Company was in fact entitled to use the Mark, having been granted a license from Aussino USA. It did not matter that the license was later revoked. This is also consistent with Anthony’s case that the Company was entitled to use the Mark as long as he remained involved in managing the Company.

She alleged that Anthony made two further representations: First, Anthony was said to have represented to her on 24 October 2017 that the Company had $130,000 in the UOB Account to her; and second, Anthony was said to have represented to Ben on the phone around 25 or 26 October 2017 that there was only about $10,000 in the UOB Account. These representations were not mentioned in her pleadings or AEIC, and I am not persuaded that they were made. Indeed, regrettably, I formed the distinct impression that Gao was inventing this new evidence on the stand in an attempt to bolster her case.

First, Ben’s email dated 20 October 2017, which contained the proposal for the terms of the October Agreement, made no mention of the money in the UOB Account. Second, Gao claimed that she entered into the October Agreement to “equalise [her] contributions”

Anthony claimed that he had two legitimate expectations pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, which were breached: that his shareholding in the Company would not be diluted without his consent, and that he would be entitled to the final say in important matters. In response, Gao claimed that her dilution of Anthony’s shareholdings was a legitimate response to Anthony’s attempts at sabotaging the Company’s business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 A claim in minority oppression can be established if there has been a departure from a complainant’s legitimate expectations to the extent that it has become unfair: <span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah v Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Boh Yong </span>[2015] 5 SLR 307 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah</span>”) at [103]. The complainant’s legitimate expectations can be gleaned from formal legal agreements such as the company’s constitution and any supplemental shareholders’ agreements (see Margaret Chew, <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) at para 4.031); or, where equitable considerations apply, even from informal and undocumented understandings (<span class="font-italic">Lim Kok Wah </span>at [103]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 I find in favour of Anthony on his claim of oppression arising from Gao’s dilution of his shares through the unilateral issuance of 2,400,000 shares to herself. The Shareholders Agreement made it crystal clear in cl 5 that </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…[The] issuance of new shares and the request to increase paid-up capital must be <span class="font-weight-bold font-underline">mutually agreed</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[by Anthony] and [Gao].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Therefore, Anthony had a legitimate expectation that his shares in the Company would not be varied without his consent. Gao’s unilateral issuance of shares to herself – which diluted Anthony’s shareholding from 50% to a mere 3.96% – was thus a departure from Anthony’s legitimate expectations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I am of the view that this departure from Anthony’s legitimate expectations was unfair. The dilution of Anthony’s shares meant that Gao now had near-complete ownership of the Company without actually having had to spend any money to buy out Anthony’s shares. As a corollary, Anthony’s investment in the Company lost nearly all its value overnight, as he went from being an equal shareholder to having a shareholding of less than 4% – in spite of the provisions in cl 5 of the Shareholders Agreement. This amounted to commercial unfairness which engaged s 216 CA.  In this connection, it is well-established that a single act can amount to minority oppression so long as it passes the test of being a “visible departure from the standards of fair dealing and a violation of the conditions of fair play which a shareholder is entitled to expect” (see <span class="font-italic">Over &amp; Over Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Bonvests Holdings Ltd and another</span> [2010] 2 SLR 776 at [74]–[77]) – which on the evidence before me, is what Gao’s act of diluting Anthony’s shareholding amounted to.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 I do not accept Gao’s claim that the dilution of Anthony’s shares was necessary to protect the Company from Anthony’s attempts at sabotage. The claim by Gao of Anthony’s “attempts” at sabotage did not carry any real merit, as I will explain (see [42] below).  Tellingly, Gao herself has conceded in the amended Defence and Counterclaim that she is agreeable to the allotment of the 2,400,000 shares being set aside

Anthony failed to explain how Gao’s refusal in this respect amounted to a departure from his legitimate expectation that he was entitled to the final say on the management of the Company. At least in the period prior to Gao’s dilution of his shareholding on 21 May 2018, it was open to Anthony to override a decision by Gao not to negotiate a licence agreement.  There is no evidence that he tried to do so.  In fact, on his own evidence, he was the one who voluntarily resigned his directorship on 11 May 2018 and – in his own words – “washed [his] hands of the management” of the Company.

</div> Nor was it a right arising from a contractual license, since there was no evidence of a license agreement subsisting between the Company and Aussino USA at the time the Shareholders Agreement was entered into. On the evidence available, the irresistible inference was that the Company’s right to use the Mark came from a bare licence, which was revocable at will. This inference is consistent with Anthony’s position that he could “procure permission to use the [Mark] in Singapore for the immediate future.”

</div> At this time, Anthony was no longer a director of the Company, meaning that he no longer owed any duties to the Company (except the fiduciary duty not to misappropriate the Company’s assets – see [58] below).

These business opportunities were said to be leases that the Company was negotiating for units at Parkway Parade, Plaza Singapura, IMM, and Westgate malls (collectively, “Malls”). According to the Company, Yen approached the landlord of the Malls to request that the lease be granted to Aussino Asia instead of the Company.

The pertinent principles are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2. A requirement to avoid a conflict of duty and self-interest means that a director is precluded from obtaining for himself, either secretly or without the informed approval of the company, any property or business advantage either belonging to the company or for which it has been negotiating, especially where the director or officer is a participant in the negotiations.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4. A fiduciary relationship does not continue after the determination of the relationship which gives rise to it. After the relationship is determined the director is in general not under the continuing obligations which are the feature of the fiduciary relationship.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">7. A director is however precluded from acting in breach of the requirement at 2 above, even after his resignation where the resignation may fairly be said to have been prompted or influenced by a wish to acquire for himself any maturing business opportunities sought by the company and where it was his position with the company rather than a fresh initiative that led him to the opportunity which he later acquired.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">8. In considering whether an act of a director breaches the preceding principle the factors to take into account will include the factor of position or office held, the nature of the corporate opportunity, its ripeness, its specificness and the director’s relation to it, the amount of knowledge possessed, the circumstances in which it was obtained and whether it was special or indeed even private, the factor of time in the continuation of the fiduciary duty where the alleged breach occurs after termination of the relationship with the company and the circumstances under which the breach was terminated, that is whether by retirement or resignation or discharge.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">9. The underlying basis of the liability of a director who exploits after his resignation a maturing business opportunity of the company is that the opportunity is to be treated as if it were the property of the company in relation to which the director had fiduciary duties. By seeking the exploit the opportunity after resignation he is appropriating to himself that property. He is just as accountable as a trustee who retires without properly accounting for trust property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10. It follows that a director will not be in breach of the principle set out as point 7 above where either the company’s hope of obtaining the contract was not a ‘maturing business opportunity’ and it was not pursuing further business orders nor where the director’s resignation was not itself prompted or influenced by a wish to acquire the business for himself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Applying the principles espoused by Rix LJ, I find no evidence that Anthony breached his fiduciary duties in relation to the leases. First, these leases could not have been said to be “maturing” business opportunities. Gao admitted on the stand that the Company did not want the lease with Parkway Parade.

</div>
</div> Therefore, after Anthony’s departure from the Company, the Company would no longer have wanted this lease. There was also no evidence that the Company continued to negotiate for the leases with Plaza Singapura, IMM and Westgate after Anthony’s and Yen’s departure. Second, Anthony has not actually “obtained” any business opportunities, since he stopped negotiations for the leases pending the resolution of this dispute. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The closure of the UOB Account</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I come next to the closure of the UOB Account.  Anthony admitted that he closed the UOB Account, of which he was the only signatory, and withdrew the remaining sum of $12,036.27. He justified this on the basis that he was repaying to himself the loans he made to the Company before Gao joined it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 It is not disputed that Anthony had resigned shortly before he closed the account on 31 May 2018 and withdrew the funds remaining in it.  At the same time, both sides are agreed that the term “director” in s 4 CA “includes the position of director of a corporation by whatever name called”.  Both sides are agreed that a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director – that is, someone who is in substance a director, though not formally appointed as such – would owe the same fiduciary duties and be held to the same standards as a director.  These fiduciary duties would obviously include the duty not to misappropriate the company’s assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Anthony says he was not a <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> director at the time he closed the UOB account on 31 May 2018; the Company says he was.  On balance, taking into consideration the available evidence, I find that he was.  The test of <span class="font-italic">de facto</span> directorship is an objective one: what matters is that Anthony undertook functions in relation to the company which could properly be discharged only by a director: <span class="font-italic">Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd v Lim </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Hock Peter and others</span> [2010] SGHC 163 at [58].  There is no dispute that the UOB Account was a corporate account.  Nor can there be any dispute that the operation of the UOB Account, and in particular decisions as to what to do with the funds in the account, constitute a key area of decision-making within the Company.   It also cannot be disputed that Anthony’s ability to operate the UOB Account depended on his being a director of the Company.  In deciding to close the UOB Account and to withdraw the funds in it, Anthony clearly chose to assume the status and functions of a company director despite his having tendered his resignation on 11 May 2018.  He was subject to a director’s fiduciary duty not to misappropriate the company’s assets, and I find him in breach of such duty in paying the $12,036.27 to himself.  The fact that he had previously made loans to the Company is a separate matter.  He should have pursued the necessary demand for repayment with the Company instead of unilaterally deciding to close the UOB account and to pay himself the money in that account.         </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Anthony’s failure to file the Company’s financial statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Next, the Company accused Anthony of failing to file the Company’s financial statement for the financial year ending 30 June 2017, as well as withholding company documents and records from the Company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 In respect of the alleged failure to file the Company’s financial statement for the financial year ending 30 June 2017, given that the last written resolution of the sole shareholder of the Company at the time (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>Anthony) in lieu of AGM was passed on 1 December 2016,

The accusation of breach by Anthony in this respect is therefore unsustainable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Reliefs</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Having regard to the findings set out above, I make the following orders for reliefs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I order Gao to pay Anthony $100,000, and the Company to pay Anthony $450,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 I order Anthony to pay the Company $12,036.27, which was the amount he unilaterally withdrew from the UOB Account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 As for the oppression claim under s 216 CA, I set aside Gao’s issuance of the additional 2,400,000 shares to herself on 21 May 2018.  I also order Gao to buy Anthony’s shares in the Company without discount. If there is no mutual agreement between Anthony and Gao on the price to be paid for Anthony’s shares, the price will be valued by an independent valuer, to be appointed by mutual agreement between Anthony and Gao. Failing any mutual agreement on the appointment of the independent valuer, either party has liberty to apply to this Court for further directions.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The costs of any independent valuer shall be borne by Gao.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Anthony submitted that the date of valuation should be before 10 May 2018, which was the point when Gao refused to enter into the license agreement with Aussino USA. I disagree. As I mentioned earlier, it was open to Anthony to override Gao’s decision, as provided for under the Shareholders Agreement. Nor was there any legitimate expectation on Anthony’s part that Gao <span class="font-italic">must</span> negotiate for the license with Aussino USA. Accordingly, the date of valuation should be 20 May 2018, before Anthony’s shareholding was diluted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 I will hear counsel’s submissions on costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">[<span class="font-weight-bold">Postscript: After taking into account the fact that Anthony had succeeded on most of his claims, that Gao had failed on all her counter-claim, and that the Company had succeeded on one counter-claim for a sum much less than the claims on which Anthony had succeeded, the costs of this action were awarded to Anthony and fixed at a total of $45,000 (Gao and the Company to be jointly and severally liable for these costs).
