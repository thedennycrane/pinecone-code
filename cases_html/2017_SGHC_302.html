</div> that the Accused admitted to was 92.49 grams.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 However, the Accused’s evidence on the number of packets and the quantity of methamphetamine he agreed to carry cannot be accepted. On the evidence, I find that he had agreed to carry methamphetamine to Singapore, and that he and Dianey hid the three packets of drugs in the washing powder box. I also find that he was not told of the weight of the ice; and if he was told, he did not rely on it when he committed the offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the circumstances, I find the Accused guilty on the charge he faced and convicted him.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Dianey’s alleged marriage to the Accused</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In the course of the trial, it was contended by the defence that Dianey was married to the Accused at the time of the offence and consequently s 124 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the Evidence Act”) came into play. Section 124 states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">No person who is or has been married shall be compelled to disclose any <span class="font-italic">communication made to him</span> during marriage by any person to whom he is or has been married; nor shall he permitted to disclose any <span class="font-italic">such communication</span> unless the person who made it or his representative in interest consents, except in suits between married persons or proceedings in which one married person is prosecuted for any crime committed against the other.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">According to defence counsel, s 124 restricted the evidence that could be led from Dianey.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The issue took up a considerable amount of time, but was ultimately irrelevant and without factual basis. Section 124 applies to <span class="font-italic">communications</span> made to a person by his or her spouse. Dianey’s evidence touched on her <span class="font-italic">activities</span> with the Accused during the disputed marriage, and did not go into what he told her. She recounted that they bought the Daia box to hide the drugs in, and that he found the cling wrap that she used to wrap the packets. As this evidence did not pertain to spousal communications, the marriage issue had no legal relevance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 More fundamentally, the defence did not prove that there was a marriage. From the time of their arrest and throughout the investigations, the Accused referred to Dianey as his girlfriend, and Dianey referred to him as her boyfriend.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The marriage issue came up in a most unusual way. It came out for first time during the cross-examination of the Accused’s mother, Normalah, when she tendered a document that purported to be a certified marriage certificate.

</div> Normalah’s evidence was that she received it in the post. She remembered that it was posted from Johor Bahru, but could not remember when she received it and whether the document came with an accompanying note; and she did not know if the sender’s identity was disclosed on the envelope which she had thrown away. Essentially, she did not know why the unknown sender had sent the certificate to her without her request. Although the certificate was in Jawi, she understood that it was a marriage certificate of the Accused and Dianey. (An English translation of the document was produced at the trial).

Dianey’s recollection was that they were married in a mosque in Kelantan, not in Pattani, Thailand. They only asserted that they were married after the curious certificate came to light through Normalah.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 In view of the unorthodox manner in which the certificate surfaced, some investigations was clearly necessary. The defence, while relying on the marriage certificate produced by Normalah as proof of the marriage, did not take the initiative to verify the authenticity of the document. It was the prosecution which did that. A letter was sent to the Royal Thai Embassy in Singapore, forwarding a copy of the certificate and seeking confirmation if it was genuine and issued in Thailand and recognised under Thai law.
