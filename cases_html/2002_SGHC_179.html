Cur Adv Vult</em></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">1.        This was a petition by MRI

Worldwide Ltd to wind up the respondent company, Management Recruiters International

(Asia) Pte Ltd under s 254(2)(a) of the Companies Act, Ch 50. The basis of the petition

was that the company is insolvent and unable to pay its debts amounting to 62,366.32.</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.        The petitioner is an

international management recruitment company that sells franchises of its name and

operations to franchisees all over the world. The respondent is one such franchisee,

having signed two franchise agreements, namely, the Singapore Franchise Agreement and the

Malaysia Franchise Agreement. The respondent also signed two other agreements known as the

International Master Franchise Agreement and the Umbrella Agreement with the petitioner.

By these agreements, the respondent was permitted to grant sub-franchises to other parties

upon payment of requisite royalty fees and commissions to the petitioner. The fee and

commission structures are not important for the proceedings before me. The contractual

obligations that are relevant are the terms requiring the respondent to report monthly

sales and gross revenues, and to pay promptly all fees due.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.        On 10 May 2002 the

petitioner terminated all the agreements it signed with the respondent on the ground of

"persistent defaults". The main ones being the failure to pay royalties and not

reporting of payments received from the sub-franchisees as required under the agreements.

Prior to that, on 14 December 2001, the parties agreed on a schedule for the payment of

monies due from the respondent to the petitioner. The matter was not resolved

satisfactorily and fresh negotiation began on 29 January 2002. More correspondence

followed. Even after the agreements were terminated the parties were still writing to each

other. The more significant letters were two letters dated 17 May 2002, one from the

respondent to the petitioner and the other a reply by the latter to the former; as well as

a letter from the respondent's solicitors to the petitioner dated 28 May 2002.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.        Mrs. Teh, counsel for the

petitioner submitted that the respondent owes a debt of 62,366.32, but even if the exact

amount is disputed, there is no dispute that there is a debt owed which exceeds the

statutory amount of $10,000 entitling the petitioner to petition for a winding up order

against the respondent. The respondent challenges the petition on three grounds. The first

of these grounds is that the petition was founded on an assertion of a debt referred to in

"<i>without prejudice</i>" correspondence. Secondly, Mr. Pillay, counsel for the

respondent, submitted that the petitioner attempted correct the defect by filing an

affidavit in which the deponent Mr. Steven Mills referred to other correspondence and

other amounts of purported debt. Thirdly, counsel submitted that the debt is disputed.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.        The petition was based on

s 254(1)(e) and s 254(2)(a) of the Companies Act, Ch 50. Section 254(1) provides:

"The Court may order the winding up if - (e) the company is unable to pay its

debts". Section 254(2) provides: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"A company shall be deemed to be unable to pay its debts if - (a)

  a creditor by assignment or otherwise to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding

  $10,000 then due has served on the company by leaving at his registered office a demand

  under his hand or under the hand of his agent thereunto lawfully authorised requiring the

  company to pay the sum so due, and the company for 3 weeks thereafter neglected to pay the

  sum or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor".</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">The relevant part of 5 of the petition states that "[the

respondent] is indebted to [the] petitioner in the sum of at least 62,366.32". The

particulars of this debt was set out in a letter dated 12 June 2002 from the petitioner's

solicitors to the respondent in which the sum of 62,366.32 was referred to in these

terms: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"In any event, our clients note that you have taken the position

  that you presently owe them the sum of 62,366.32 in royalty payments due to them under

  the said contracts. This is contained in your calculations stated in your letter to our

  clients, dated 17 May 2002. In the letter from your solicitors, Wong Partnership, dated 28

  May 2002, you have further agreed that you will make such payments that are

  required".</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.        The letter of 17 May 2002

relied upon was indeed marked "<i>without prejudice</i>" as Mr. Pillay said, but

Mrs. Teh argued that nonetheless, the statement of admission was a categorical admission

of a debt for 62,366.32. She referred to the authority of Lord Griffith in <i>Rush &amp;

Tomkins Ltd v Greater London Council</i> [1988] 3 All ER 737, 740 in who held that:

"There is also authority for the proposition that the admission of an

"independent fact" in no way connected with the merits of the case is admissible

even if made in the course of negotiations for a settlement". Lord Griffith gave as

an example, the admission that the document was in the handwriting of one of the parties,

as was the case in <i>Waldridge v Kennison</i> (1794) 1 Esp 143. But, more importantly, he

qualified his statement by saying that he regards this as "an exceptional case and it

should not be allowed to whittle down the protection given to the parties to speak freely

on all the issues in the litigation both factual and legal when seeking compromise".

The letter of 17 May when read in full shows exactly what it was - an attempt to speak

freely on the dispute between the parties. I would not extract a short sentence from the

lengthy letter and regard it as an "independent fact". It forms an integral part

of the negotiation. So far as the letter of 28 May is concerned, it has no direct

reference to any specific debt and was a letter written by solicitors regarding the choice

of forum and interim positions. In my view, therefore, there is no basis in the petition

upon which I can safely act on in finding a debt which the respondent was unable to pay.

On this ground alone I would dismiss the petition.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.        I proceed to Mr. Pillay's

second point, namely, that the affidavit of Mr. Mills should not be given any force. It is

well accepted that affidavits are not pleadings. The deponent may make all manner of

statements and even if they are serious and important, they would have been made in vain

because the court will have no regard for them however well made they may be unless they

are relevant. Relevancy is a relative term. It must relate to the primary action and that

can only be the original cause papers, be it the statement of claim of a winding up

petition. In this regard, I accept Mr. Pillay’s submission that the affidavit of Mr.

Mills had ventured well beyond the focal point of  5 of the petition. As such, little

weight, if any, is to be given to it.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.        Lastly, in respect of the

issue as to whether there is a disputable debt, I shall preface my decision with a

statement of settled law that a judge sitting in a companies' winding up court is not well

placed to adjudicate on the merits of a commercial dispute. The debt on which the petition

is founded must be unambiguous and obviously above the statutory sum. Mrs. Teh relied

substantially and repeatedly on the judgment of LP Thean J in <i>Re People's Park

Development Pte Ltd</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=5876&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1992] 1 SLR 413</a>, 416 for the proposition that the petitioner had

a right to present the petition if the court found as a fact that <i>some</i> amount was

owing by the company. So too, in <i>Re Claybridge Shipping Co SA</i> [1996] 1 BC LC 572,

575 Lord Denning held that "a person is a 'creditor' so long as he has a good

arguable case that a debt of sufficient amount is owing to him. In the Companies Court it

appears that a rule of practice has been adopted to the effect that the debt should be

undisputed. I do not think that is correct. It certainly is not so in regard to the amount

of the debt." The same point was emphasized by Plowman J in <i>Re Tweed Garages Ltd</i>

[1962] Ch 406. These cases, however, merely cautioned against accepting a mere assertion

that the debt is disputed. In that regard, the principle is clear and sensible. What it

all means is that the court must be satisfied that the dispute of debt is genuine and

plausible. In some cases, it may be plain that although the debt is disputed generally,

there is an undisputed amount that exceeds $10,000, but where it is not so obvious, the

court ought to dismiss the petition. In the present proceedings, if the 'without

prejudice' correspondence is admitted (on which I have made my point above) it would

appear that some debt may be due, but the amount is still questionable without a full

inquiry or trial. Moreover, in this case, the company alleges that it has a counterclaim

based on a wrongful termination of contract as well as damages for defamation. The dispute

over the termination of contract was based, among others, on the determination of the term

'persistent breaches' of the agreements. The libel issue came about because the petitioner

had sent out various letters to various third parties alleging that the company was guilty

of "systematic under reporting of cash-in" and other comments including,

"We are concerned that there may be fiscal irregularities which could be doing damage

to our brand and possibly a criminal offence". Whether the allegations and fears are

true, the consequence is plainly serious, with the possibility of substantial damages

either way. Mr. Pillay had sufficiently drawn my attention to evidence that indicates

that, at the very least, a genuine fight between the parties is at hand. But, as I have

said, the winding up court is not the appropriate arena. I end with the reminder that a

winding up order is the death knell for a legal entity. It should only be rung in the

clearest circumstances. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.        In some cases the court

may exercise its discretion and stay the winding up proceedings pending the resolution of

the dispute. That would be so where there is already pending litigation in the courts or

by way of arbitration. However, in this case, I have determined that the petition itself

was bad in that it had recited a debt based upon an inadmissible document, and there being

nothing else to support the petition, I would in this case dismiss the petition rather

than have it stayed. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.        Whether costs should be

on a standard or indemnity basis is a slightly more difficult question in this case. Mr.

Pillay submitted that the company ought to be awarded costs on an indemnity basis on the

ground that the petition was commenced unnecessarily and was founded on an inadmissible

document. Furthermore, he submitted, the alleged debt was disputed on legitimate grounds.

If it were based on a straightforward reliance on an inadmissible document I might have

leaned in favour of awarding indemnity costs. In this case, it seems to me that the

petitioner took the view that there was an undisputed debt notwithstanding the reliance in

question. Whether it was reasonable or not for it to have done so is, in my view, too fine

a distinction to draw in the circumstances. I, therefore, hesitate to make an order of

costs on an indemnity basis.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.        For the above reasons,

the petition is dismissed with costs to be taxed on the standard basis, if not agreed.</p>
