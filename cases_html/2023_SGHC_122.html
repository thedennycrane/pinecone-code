In any event, its standing was not disputed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Company is a financial technology company which offers products which aggregate global banking application interfaces to corporate finance and treasury offices. Point72, as one of its investors, was entitled to a seat on the board of the Company and is a creditor (or at least a contingent creditor) and shareholder of the Company. Mr Peter Selig Klein (“<span class="font-weight-bold">PSK</span>”) and his brother, Mr Phillip Ashley Klein (“<span class="font-weight-bold">PAK</span>”), the founders and directors of the Company (“<span class="font-weight-bold">the Founders</span>”), are the non-parties in this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The board of the Company (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Board</span>”) comprised PSK, PAK, Mr Stephen Moore Ellis (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Mr</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Ellis</span>”) and Mr Richard Wayne Shriner III (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Mr</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Shriner</span>”). Mr Ellis and Mr Shriner were nominees of Nyca Co-Invest Fund III (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Nyca</span>”), another investor, and Point72 respectively (pursuant to the arrangement explained at [8] below).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Background to the dispute</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 Between the incorporation of the Company in 2015 and sometime in 2019, its sole shareholder and director was PSK. PAK initially consulted, and later joined the Company as a shareholder, director, and chief executive officer (“<span class="font-weight-bold">CEO</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The Company needed funding to expand its business. It therefore sought support from third-party investors, including Nyca and Point72. The Company raised a seed investment round in 2019 and a Series A investment round in 2021.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 18 December 2020, the Company, the Founders as well as some of the investors in the Company entered a Shareholder’s Deed, under which (a) Nyca Investment Fund III (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Nyca</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Investment</span>”) and Nyca, collectively; and (b) Point72, were each entitled to appoint a director to the Board. The parties did not dispute that the Founders had 1.5 votes each and the nominee directors had one vote each; accordingly, at all material times, the Founders had control of the Board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 Sometime in the third quarter of 2021, Point72 and Nyca, amongst other creditors, started to have concerns about the financial and operational performance of the Company – it had missed pipeline projections, key employees had left or been terminated, and the Company had a cash burn rate which outstripped its monthly revenue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Around April 2022, the Company entered several convertible promissory notes with (a) Point72; (b) Workday, Inc; (c) Nyca Investment; and (d) Nyca.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 In June 2022, PAK resigned as CEO. Mr Guido Schulz (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Mr</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">Schulz</span>”) was identified as a possible CEO of the Company. Thereafter, Point72 and Nyca proposed a series of rescue package options necessitated by the Company’s deteriorating cash position. These entailed the injection of fresh capital into the Company and conditioned on Mr Schulz’s appointment as CEO. However, the said options were not accepted by PSK and PAK and were thus not implemented.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 After further discussion, four options for the continuation of the business of the Company were proposed, which are summarised below (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Options</span>”):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Option 1A provided for the Company to enter into a severance agreement pursuant to which Nyca and/or Point72 would purchase or procure the purchase of US$2.4m worth of shares from each of the Founders; the Founders would receive a severance payment comprising 12 months’ salary, benefits and apartment rental reimbursement; Nyca and Point72 would contribute capital of US$5m; one of the Founders would resign as a director and the new Board would comprise one of the Founders, a director nominated by Nyca, a director nominated by Point72, a director nominated by Point72 or Nyca, and Mr Schulz; and Mr Schulz to be appointed CEO.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Option 1B provided for one or more affiliates of Nyca and such other investors reasonably acceptable to Nyca and the Company to provide investment of up to US$10m; the Founders to resign as directors in exchange for the right to receive severance payments comprising of six months’ salary, benefits and apartment rental reimbursement; the new Board to comprise a director nominated by Nyca, a director nominated by Point72, Mr Schulz, and two vacancies not controlled or filled by the Founders; and Mr Schulz to be appointed CEO.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Option 2 provided for the assets or shares of the Company to be sold; 25% of the total sale price to be distributed to the following key employees in the following shares: 85% to PAK, 10% to Mr Nuno Jonet and 5% to Mr Andrew Jasen; and the Company to enter into a bridge loan with Point72 and Nyca in order to cover the funds required for the Company’s operations for a period of three months.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Option 3 provided for the Company to apply to be wound up pursuant to s 125(1) IRDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 On 19 January 2023, Ms Evelyn Ang (“<span class="font-weight-bold">Ms</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> Ang</span>”) of Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP, a legal counsel to the Company, emailed the Board to request that they vote for one of the four Options. On 22 January 2023, Ms Ang emailed the Board to provide the result of the vote, which is reproduced below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The votes received from [Nyca] and Point72 were in favour of Option 1B, and the votes from the Founder[s] were for Option 2. As the Founder[s] have 1.5 votes each, the resolution for Option 2 is passed. However, we understand that the investors do not have an agreement on the bridge financing and the allocation of 25% of sale proceeds from a trade sale to management. Therefore, even if Option 2 resolutions are passed, it is not a viable option.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I will circulate board resolutions tomorrow for the appointment of a provisional liquidator and the convening of an EGM to commence voluntary liquidation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 In short, none of the Options 1A, 1B and 2, which were evidently proposed by the faction which voted in favour of them, could be implemented without the agreement of the other faction, which agreement was not, and would not be, forthcoming.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 On 23 January 2023, Ms Ang sent an email which attached a board resolution for convening an extraordinary general meeting (“<span class="font-weight-bold">EGM</span>”) for the purposes of winding up the Company, as well as the notice of the EGM. This was, according to the Founders, not done with their consent and therefore, without the authority of, the Board.

I saw no practical purpose in appointing one: there was, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, no evidence of any risk of dissipation of the Company’s assets pending the hearing of the JM Application, the Company appeared to have enough cash for its operations at least until May 2023, there was no management deadlock as far as its operations were concerned and there was a risk that the appointment of an interim judicial manager may cause the Company to be in breach of some of its existing contracts, which may in turn place it in a worse financial position. The more prudent option was therefore to maintain the status quo until the hearing of the JM Application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The JM Application, however, required that I examine the Company’s prospects in the longer term.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Point72’s case was that the Company should be placed under judicial management, and Mr Luke Anthony Furler and Ms Ellyn Tan Huixian of Quantuma (Singapore) Pte Ltd should be appointed judicial managers (“<span class="font-weight-bold">JMs</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 Point72 submitted that the Company was cash flow insolvent given that (a) by the Company’s own estimates, its cash would run out by June 2023, or potentially as early as March 2023; (b) it had ongoing short term liabilities; and (c) it owed US$9,499,920 arising from various convertible promissory notes (the “<span class="font-weight-bold">Notes Debt</span>”), or such sums would become due and payable if the Company was put into liquidation when it ran out of cash.

</div> They relied on the decision in <span class="font-italic">Baltic House Development Ltd v Cheung and another</span> [2018] EWHC 1525 (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Baltic</span>”), where the court held that there is no jurisdiction to make an administration order if a real prospect cannot be shown that the statutory purpose will be achieved (<span class="font-italic">Baltic</span> at [27]–[28]). A “real prospect” does not have to be established on the balance of probabilities (<span class="font-italic">Baltic</span> at [36]). Point72 does not have to show it is more likely than not that such a result will be achieved, but there must be some plan of substance and reality (<span class="font-italic">Baltic</span> at [36]). I make two observations:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Whether the “real prospect” test is met undoubtedly turns on the facts and circumstances of the case. In <span class="font-italic">Baltic</span>, the court found that the two letters of interest by potential investors produced by the applicant were neither cogent nor compelling – no details had been given of funding or resources, and no commitment had been made to move the matter forward. But that was a case where two creditors had already petitioned for the winding up of the applicant; and the court found that the benefits of administration over liquidation were marginal, and also that administration would be more expensive than winding up and therefore damaging to the creditors’ interests. This case presented very different circumstances, as I will elaborate below.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) I should also consider the relative merits of the alternative solutions to enable the Company to survive as a going concern. In <span class="font-italic">Baltic</span>, the creditors had wanted to wind-up the applicant and would have been worse off if an administration order had been made. The present case was different. All the parties agreed that the Company’s business is viable and wished to maintain the Company as a going concern.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I was urged by the Company to consider the recent decision of <span class="font-italic">Yap Sze Kam v Yang Kee Logistics Pte Ltd</span> (“<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Yap</span>”) [2023] SGHC 43. The Company and the Founders submitted that <span class="font-italic">Yap</span> was authority for the proposition that where a purported purpose of a JMO was only “a possible, speculative, hoped for [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] outcome, the likelihood of which … is low”, then there was no real prospect of the purposes of judicial management being met.

</div> At the hearing, the Company’s counsel further submitted that <span class="font-italic">Yap</span> stood for the proposition that the fact that the alternative to a JMO is liquidation should not by itself lead to the grant of a JMO.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I did not find <span class="font-italic">Yap</span> helpful to the Company. In <span class="font-italic">Yap</span>, the applicant applied for judicial management in the hope that judicial managers would secure a better and more “holistic” deal for the disposal of assets, compared to a deal entered into by the receiver and manager (appointed seven months prior to the application) for the sale of certain charged shares (<span class="font-italic">Yap</span> at [15]–[17]). The Court found that the receiver had acted professionally in securing the deal and that the sale would benefit the creditors generally; in contrast, the applicant presented no evidence that the appointment of the judicial managers would achieve a better outcome (<span class="font-italic">Yap</span> at [33]). The court there hence decided that there was no real prospect that the statutory purposes of judicial management would be achieved if a judicial management order was made (<span class="font-italic">Yap</span> at [37]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 On the facts before me, the avoidance of liquidation via a JMO was not a “possible, speculative, hoped for [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] outcome” (<span class="font-italic">Yap</span> at [28]). More importantly, here, liquidation was almost a certainty if a JMO was not made and that was a result none of the parties wanted nor argued was a better alternative to a JMO. Further, <span class="font-italic">Yap</span> supports the factors I have considered, namely, the relative merits of the proposals put before me and the importance of the views of the creditors.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Viable alternatives to a JMO</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Point72’s case for judicial management was not an overwhelming one. As the Company pointed out (at [25(c)] above), there had been no offers, or even expressions of interests, from prospective investors, or even a financing plan which the proposed judicial managers would be able to consider and implement. To improve the prospects of the application, Point72 and Nyca offered the Rescue Package, which had been premised on the JMs being appointed. But I agree with the Company that the Rescue Package offered very little, if anything at all:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) the first step was an initial loan of US$400,000, less what cash the Company had on the day of appointment of the JMs. The Company confirmed that it had about US$800,000, hence, no initial loan would be extended; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the second step was a further loan of US$400,000 which would be furnished by Point72, Nyca or any other participating creditors a month after the JMO was made. But this was not unconditional; instead, it would depend on the outcome of a review of the Company by the JMs and the JMs’ proposed plan of action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 However, even though the Company was facing imminent liquidation, the Company and its Founders offered no solution at all.

</div> Both the Company and the Founders argued that a solution could be found outside judicial management, but the primary (and in fact, only) solution they pointed to was a buy-out. I had no jurisdiction or power to facilitate such a solution. This was for the parties to agree on, and they (or some of them) were not prepared to do so. The Company and Founders argued that if the JM Application was dismissed, Point72 and the supporting creditors would have no option but to settle or find a solution acceptable to all the parties, given their desire for the Company to continue its business. I rejected that submission. The only issue before me was whether the appointment of judicial managers would advance the objectives set out in the IRDA – it was not my role to advance or improve the negotiating position of any of the parties. In any event, the appointment of JMs did not preclude the parties from agreeing an amicable solution. For the same reasons, I rejected the Company’s argument that a JMO should not be made because mediation was an alternative solution available to the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In short, there was no better, or indeed viable, alternative to judicial management.

Further, Point72 and the supporting creditors had significant resources and had expressed their commitment to working with the JMs to keep the Company alive.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Detrimental effect of a JMO</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 For the Company to remain viable, it must be able to continue its business and keep its customers. The Company highlighted that the appointment of JMs may have potentially fatal consequences for the Company, since it would entitle its customers to terminate their contracts with the Company, thereby placing it in greater financial peril. Point72, however, correctly pointed out that the Company’s insolvency, which was impending, would cause the same result.

</div> Further, the Company would have better prospects keeping its customers if it could stabilize its operations and offer a viable plan to continue servicing their contracts. A JMO would give the Company a better opportunity to deal constructively with its customers and offer some assurance that it would honour its commitments. I stress again that there was no viable alternative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Company also submitted that potential investors would likely be wary of investing in or financing the Company if it was under a JMO. I was unpersuaded by this argument because, given the cash flow position of the Company and the difficult relationship between the Founders and the current investors and within the Board, potential and current investors would have reason to be wary even without a JMO being made. I also rejected the Company’s argument that a JMO is detrimental to the Company since it would incur additional costs – the parties agreed that the Company had a viable business, accordingly, costs incurred for a JMO, which presented the only plausible way to preserve the Company, should not be a barrier to the JM Application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Relevant expertise</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Company submitted that the JMs will not be able to run the Company better than the Founders. I accepted that the JMs will not be as familiar with the Company as the Founders. Nonetheless, while I agreed that the Founders played important roles in the Company, the fact remained that it had been under their stewardship that the Company landed in such dire straits.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 I also agreed with Point72’s submission at the hearing that there was some prospect that the JMs would bring stability to the Company and access to funding through discussions with investors. This would be helpful to the Company, especially considering evidence that the Company had suffered resignations of key personnel in the months leading up to the JM Application.

</div> The stability that a JMO might afford was likely to be of benefit to the Company. Further, if the Founders genuinely want to keep the Company alive and sustain its business, they can co-operate with, and assist, the JMs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I note in passing that the Company offered somewhat contradictory arguments to its own case that the Founders’ expertise was invaluable and irreplaceable. The Company argued, in support of its case concerning Point72’s alleged collateral purpose (see below), that Point72 and/or Nyca wanted to set up a competing company and pull away customers and employees. This suggested that the Founders were not as intrinsic to the business of the Company as the Company argued.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A dispute between shareholders</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I also did not accept the Company and the Founders’ submission that the JM Application was wrongly commenced as a solution to a shareholder’s dispute. I make two comments: the Company’s reliance on the fact that the JM Application was commenced without any of the non-shareholder investors was misplaced, as there is no obligation for non-shareholder creditors to join a judicial management application to give it legitimacy; what is necessary is that an applicant has standing to do so. Further, the mere fact that Point72 was a shareholder of the Company did not mean that it could not properly bring the JM Application as a creditor or contingent creditor of the Company. In addition, the mere fact that the failure of the Options preceded the JM Application did not make this a “shareholder dispute”. The parties, as shareholders, were entitled to act in their own interests and reject any rescue option which they did not find suitable. But where that left the Company with no viable solution other than liquidation, the creditors of the Company were entitled to bring the JM Application to protect their investment in the Company.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Having considered all the above, it was evident that a JMO offers a real prospect of achieving the survival of the Company as a going concern. The JMs are likely to bring stability to the Company and thereby be in a better position in negotiating with potential investors to obtain funding - the Company has thus far tried and failed to secure new funding

Point72 and Nyca were substantial creditors and were entitled to protect their interests, and the Founders were not entitled to their unconditional support regardless of the circumstances. Further, given the circumstances, there was little else one would expect Point72 and Nyca to do. As stated above, the Founders and the Company had not offered any solution to the Company’s cash-flow problems and impending insolvency. They cannot have expected the creditors to sit back and do nothing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Second, the appointment of JMs would place the management of the Company in the hands of officers who are accountable to the court and are bound to discharge their duties fairly and properly to fulfil the purposes under the IRDA.

</div> Point72 denied any involvement in these discussions and pointed out that they involved employees of the Company and not its own officers or agents. Nonetheless, Mr Growney’s involvement raised some concerns given his association with Nyca.

</div> In support of this, they explained that both Point72 and Nyca had always been aware of the Company’s financial situation since they had nominee directors on the Board. I did not accept this argument. Point72’s knowledge of the Company’s cash burn did not amount to their “engineer[ing]” a situation where a JMO might be appropriate. It is not the Company’s case that Point72, Nyca or any other creditor had done anything to prejudice its business or attempts to secure financing, or that the Company’s current financial predicament was otherwise attributable to their conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The making of the JMO was the only viable solution to try and save what all the parties agreed was a viable and valuable business.
