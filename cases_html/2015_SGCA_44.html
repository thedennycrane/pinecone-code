        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the grounds of
                decision of the court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal against the decision of the
                    High Court judge (“the Judge”) reported as <em>Fairmacs Shipping &amp; Transport Services Pte Ltd v Harikutai
                        Engineering Pte Ltd and another</em> [2015] 1 SLR 904
                    (“the GD”). The case concerned a shipment of river sand that never
                    made its way to the intended buyer, Fairmacs Shipping &amp; Transport Services
                    Pte Ltd (“the Respondent”). The matter first went before the
                    Assistant Registrar (“the AR”) who assessed damages at US$62,950
                    with interest at 5.33% from the date of the Writ of Summons. The Respondent
                    appealed. After hearing parties, the Judge allowed the appeal, assessing damages
                    at US$141,226 (with the same order as to interest). Marco Polo Shipping Company
                    Pte Ltd (“the Appellant”), the second defendant at the time,
                    appealed to this court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Parties appeared before us on 8 July 2015.
                    After hearing their submissions, we allowed the appeal and restored the
                    AR’s award, issuing the following brief grounds (which are elaborated upon
                    in this judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Whilst we agree that it is not an essential requirement to have a market
                        index in order to determine the market value of the cargo in question, the
                        respondent has not adduced sufficient evidence of a relevant market for
                        river sand in Port Blair during the first week of October 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the circumstances, we allow the appeal and restore the assistant
                        registrar’s award of USD62,950, which reflects the sum that the
                        respondent has paid in respect of the cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Parties to the dispute</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The Respondent was a company incorporated in
                    India purportedly in the business of trading, importing and exporting
                    construction materials. By a contract of sale dated 18 August 2011, the
                    Respondent agreed to purchase river sand from Marine Alliance Group (Singapore)
                    Pte Ltd (“Marine Alliance”). The sand was to be shipped from
                    Myeik, Myanmar, to Port Blair, India, in three shipments. The shipment in
                    question – the second shipment – involved 4,300 metric tonnes
                    (“MT”) of river sand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Appellant was the owner of the vessels that
                    were used to transport the river sand. Harikutai Engineering Pte Ltd
                    (“Harikutai”), a party to the proceedings below, but not before
                    this court, was the contracting carrier.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Background to the dispute </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The second shipment of 4,300MT of river sand was
                    expected to reach Port Blair on 1 October 2011. It never did. On
                    3 October 2011, the commercial manager of the Respondent, Mr Sreenath
                    Rajendhranath (“Mr Rajendhranath”), telephoned Mr Danads
                    Wong (“Mr Wong”), a representative of the Appellant. In that
                    conversation, Mr Wong informed Mr Rajendhranath that the vessels were
                    on the last leg of their voyage and that the delay was caused by unfavourable
                    weather conditions. Mr Rajendhranath thereafter wrote an email to Mr Wong
                    to document their conversation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 18 October 2011, with no cargo in sight,
                    the Respondent’s solicitors from Legal Solutions LLC, who continued
                    to represent them in proceedings before the court, wrote to the Appellant and
                    Harikutai demanding: (a) information on the location of the vessels; and
                    (b) delivery up of the second shipment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       On 15 December 2011, the Respondent filed
                    its Writ of Summons. Its case was against both the Appellant (in the tort of
                    conversion) and Harikutai (for breach of the contract of carriage). From the
                    Appellant, the Respondent sought delivery up of the cargo or, alternatively,
                    US$201,455 in damages. This figure was derived by multiplying 4,300MT with the
                    alleged market price of the cargo at Port Blair at the relevant time, US$46.85
                    per MT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 28 December 2011, the Appellant applied
                    for security for costs. In its affidavit in support of its application, which
                    was filed that same day (<em>ie</em>, 28 December
                    2011) by Mr Azhari Bin Mohd Jadi (“Mr Azhari”), the
                    Operating Manager of the Appellant, the Appellant explained for the first time
                    what had happened to the cargo (see also the GD at [10]). Harikutai had
                    defaulted on the payment of the charterhire. In response, the Appellant had
                    withdrawn the vessels and sold the cargo on board, including the second shipment
                    of river sand, to mitigate its losses. Mr Azhari did not state the price at
                    which the river sand was sold save as to note “the Cargo is not valuable
                    and is easily replaceable”. In his subsequent affidavit dated
                    13 January 2012, Mr Azhari clarified that it was not the Appellant
                    that had sold the cargo but, possibly, MP Shipping Pte Ltd, a wholly owned
                    subsidiary of the Appellant (see also the GD at [10]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 20 February 2012, the Respondent applied
                    for summary judgment against both Harikutai and the Appellant. During the
                    hearing before the AR on 15 June 2012, all three parties were present.
                    Harikutai was represented by Haridass Ho &amp; Partners. The AR
                    granted interlocutory judgment against both the Appellant and Harikutai with
                    damages to be assessed, with interest at the rate of 5.33% from the date of the
                    Writ of Summons (<em>ie</em>, 15 December 2011) to the
                    date of payment. The Appellant appealed, but its appeal was dismissed by the
                    Judge on 3 August 2012.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     At the assessment of damages hearing, the
                    Respondent sought US$201,455 which, it argued, was reflective of the market
                    value of 4,300MT of river sand at Port Blair in the first week of October 2011
                    (the expected date of delivery was 3 October 2011). Harikutai was absent
                    from this hearing. From the onset, the amount of river sand converted was not in
                    dispute. Neither was the point of law that market value was the first port of
                    call in determining the value of the river sand converted. As such, the
                    Respondent’s main challenge (in making good its US$201,455 claim) was to
                    prove that the relevant market value (<em>ie</em>, the
                    market value of river sand at Port Blair in the first week of October 2011) was
                    indeed US$46.85 per MT. It sought to do so by relying on the evidence of
                    Mr Babuvenkatesh Loganathan (“Mr Loganathan”), General
                    Manager of Fairmacs Trading Company Pte Ltd (“FTPL”). FTPL was the
                    trading arm of the “Fairmacs group” of companies – a group
                    to which the Respondent belonged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In his affidavit, Mr Loganathan affirmed
                    that there were “no published indices in Port Blair, India setting out
                    the market pricing of river sand”. For that reason, he adduced in his
                    affidavit fourteen pages of invoices, delivery orders and receipts evidencing
                    the sale of river sand by FTPL in Port Blair during the first week of October
                    2011 in a bid to amass figures from which he could discern a “market
                    price”. He tabulated the figures as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The AR was not persuaded by this evidence. In
                    particular, he was concerned by three things: (a) the absence of a market
                    index for river sand at Port Blair; (b) the lack of a breakdown of the
                    proposed figure of US$46.85 per MT (in particular, how much of that figure
                    constituted FTPL’s profits); and (c) the fact that the rate of
                    US$46.85 per MT was reached by comparing low-volume sales of river sand at no
                    more than 7MT per sale (whereas, the AR’s concern was that high-volume
                    sales in the region of 4,300MT would likely fetch lower prices). Given his view
                    that there was a lack of credible evidence, the AR was therefore unable to
                    conclude that the market value of river sand was indeed US$46.85 per MT in Port
                    Blair in early October 2011. He opted to assess damages on the basis of the cost
                    that the Respondent had incurred for the river sand rather than market price. He
                    arrived at the figure of US$62,950, the amount that the Respondent had actually
                    paid for the river sand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Respondent appealed to the Judge in
                    Registrar’s Appeal No 290 of 2013.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Decision below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The Judge allowed the Respondent’s
                    appeal. However, she did not award it the entirety of the US$201,455 sought.
                    Rather, she assessed the damages at US$141,226 (plus 5.33% interest). She
                    arrived at this figure in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, she preferred US$39.82 per MT
                        (as opposed to the Respondent’s alleged US$46.85 per MT) as the
                        appropriate rate. Although she accepted the Respondent’s evidence that
                        US$46.85 per MT was the market value (see above at [11]), she effected a 15%
                        reduction to account for the customs (5%) and landing costs (10%) that the
                        Respondent would have had to pay had the cargo arrived at Port Blair (the GD
                        at [73] and [77]). Mathematically, this is represented as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       US$46.85 x 85% =
                            US$39.82.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_14-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       US$39.82 x 4,300 = US$171,226.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, she subtracted US$30,000
                        from the figure derived above to account for the freight that would have
                        been paid by the Respondent had the cargo been delivered. Mathematically,
                        this is represented as follows: US$171,226 – US$30,000 =
                        US$141,226.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Judge’s reasoning as to why she
                    allowed the appeal can be summarised in four main points. First, on the law, the
                    Judge was largely in agreement with the AR. Like the AR, she proceeded on the
                    basis that the value of goods should typically be determined by their market
                    value at the place and date of the conversion and, in the case of goods
                    converted at sea, the market value of the goods at the place and date of
                    expected delivery (see the GD at [36]). This might yield to some other basis of
                    valuation where, for instance, there was no market for the goods or where the
                    market value could not be determined (see the GD at [26]). In this case,
                    therefore, the value of the cargo should <em>prima
                        facie</em> be based upon the market value of the cargo at Port Blair
                    during the first week of October 2011 (see the GD at [37]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Secondly, and this is fundamentally where the
                    Judge disagreed with the AR’s analysis, the Judge found that
                    Mr Loganathan’s table supported the existence of a market for river
                    sand at Port Blair during the first week of October 2011 (see the GD at [39]).
                    The Judge defined a market as a state of affairs where there is a willing seller
                    and willing buyer after negotiations (see the GD at [40]). Having found as such,
                    she noted that the Appellant bore the evidential burden to show, as it had
                    asserted, the absence of a market (see the GD at [43]). To determine if it had
                    met this burden, she turned to the two arguments advanced by the Appellant. The
                    first was that there was no market price index in Port Blair. Although a market
                    price index was indicative of the existence of a market, she noted that the lack
                    of an index did not, on its own, prove the absence of a market (see the GD at
                    [46]). The second was that it would take a minimum of 20 to 25 days for any
                    seller of river sand to deliver the goods to Port Blair. This “20 to 25
                    days” figure came from Mr Loganathan’s own evidence during
                    cross-examination. In response, the Judge noted that immediate delivery was not
                    a necessary condition for establishing a market (see the GD at
                [53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Thirdly, the Judge found
                    Mr Loganathan’s evidence persuasive and that it supported the
                    proposition that the market value of river sand in Port Blair in the first week
                    of October 2011 was US$46.85 per MT (see the GD at [64]). The Appellant did not
                    adduce any countervailing evidence of its own. Its only attempt to do so through
                    its Technical Superintendent, Mr Lau Chung Hon, who alleged that the price
                    was between S$7 and S$7.50 per MT, was premised entirely on hearsay (see the GD
                    at [62]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Fourthly, the Judge dismissed the
                    Appellant’s rather belated argument that the Respondent should have
                    mitigated its loss by purchasing an equivalent volume of river sand after the
                    conversion. This was for two main reasons. First, the Respondent had been kept
                    in the dark about what had happened to the cargo, and was hence in no position
                    to make a decision about whether to, for instance, source for a replacement (see
                    the GD at [82]). Secondly, the Appellant’s “mitigation of
                    damages” defence had not been pleaded (see the GD at [81]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ cases on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The Appellant’s case before this court
                    was essentially a reprise of the arguments it had raised (successfully) before
                    the AR and (unsuccessfully) before the Judge. First, it argued there was no
                    market for river sand in Port Blair in the first week of October 2011. In doing
                    so, it implicitly accepted that the first port of call in assessing damages in
                    cases like this was the market value of the goods. It also agreed that the
                    market in question was that in Port Blair as at the first week of October 2011.
                    Its only point of contention was that, contrary to the Judge’s finding,
                    there was no such market in Port Blair during this period. At best, it argued,
                    there was an <em>oligopolistic</em> market, which did not
                    count as a market for the purpose of assessing the market value. The
                    oligopolistic nature of the market was evinced by the difficulty faced by the
                    Respondent in ascertaining the prices charged by its competitors as well as the
                    fact that goods had to be imported from overseas markets.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Secondly, the Appellant argued there was no
                    ascertainable market value. Mr Loganathan’s table was of no probative
                    value. In support of this assertion, the Appellant seemed to rely once again on
                    the arguments it made to rebut the existence of a market. In this respect, it
                    seemed that its second argument was not a distinct one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Thirdly, the Appellant argued that the
                    “general market rule” should in any case not be relied upon as to
                    do so would result in a windfall accruing to the Respondent. The Respondent was
                    essentially acting as a middleman in the transaction involving river sand and in
                    such cases, as was held in the Supreme Court of Victoria Appeal Division
                    decision of <em>Furness v Adrium Industries Pty Ltd</em>
                    [1996] 1 VR 668 (“<em>Furness</em>”),
                    the damages recoverable should be “assessed by calculating the cost of
                    replacing [the] stock at the date of conversion” (at 678). The difference
                    between US$62,950 (the AR’s award, which represented the “cost
                    price”) and US$141,226 (the Judge’s award) was a substantial amount
                        (<em>ie</em>, US$78,276). This likely represented the
                    amount of profits that FTPL would obtain in conducting <em>its</em> business. Implicitly, and necessarily, the Appellant was
                    arguing that these were profits that the Respondent would never have made in the
                    course of its (rather different) business.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     For completeness, the Appellant also raised a
                    further – and alternative – argument that if the court were to
                    assess damages on the basis of the market value, the currency should be in
                    Indian Rupees, not US Dollars, as this was the currency typically used in the
                    Respondent’s sale transactions. As we allowed the appeal, this argument
                    was irrelevant and we say no more about this.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Respondent’s case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In response to the Appellant’s main
                    arguments, the Respondent first argued that there was an available market for
                    river sand in Port Blair in the first week of October 2011. It defined
                    “market” as “a state of affairs where there are sufficient
                    traders who are in touch with [one another]”, citing <em>Benjamin’s Sale of Goods</em> (Michael G Bridge,
                    gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 8th Ed, 2010) at
                    para 16-066, and argued that the invoices adduced by FTPL (as represented
                    in Mr Loganathan’s table reproduced above at [11]) evinced such a
                    state of affairs. Further, it criticised the Appellant’s assertion that
                    the market was oligopolistic as: (a) unsupported by evidence; and
                    (b) premised on an incorrect understanding of the term
                    “oligopoly”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Secondly, the Respondent argued that the
                    market value at the material time was indeed US$46.85 per MT based on the
                    evidence of Mr Loganathan. Thirdly, the case of <em>Furness</em> involved different facts. <em>Furness</em> dealt with a claim by a company – Adrium
                    Industries – that manufactured and imported novelty items which it sold to
                    wholesalers. The appellant/defendant, Furness, was the owner of the factory in
                    which Adrium Industries operated. Adrium Industries left some of their
                    manufactured goods – the subject of their conversion claim – behind
                    in the factory after they left the premises. Furness sold those items. In
                        <em>Furness</em>, it was doubtful as to how many of the
                    novelty items could have been sold and Adrium Industries had failed to call in
                    any evidence which pointed to a higher cost at the date of the conversion to
                    replace the goods. Here, however, the Respondent argued, it had adduced evidence
                    to demonstrate what the market value was.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     There were two main issues before this court.
                    First, was the Judge correct in finding there was a market for the converted
                    river sand at Port Blair in the first week of October 2011
                    (“Issue 1”)? Secondly, was the Judge correct in finding that
                    the market value of the converted river sand was US$46.85 per MT
                    (“Issue 2”)?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Appellant’s argument centring on the
                    doctrine of mitigation of damages failed, in our view, at the threshold level
                    for the reasons highlighted by the Judge. Not only did the Appellant not plead
                    it as a defence, the argument itself lacked any factual basis. It was undisputed
                    that the Respondent had only learnt of the whereabouts of the cargo at the
                    eleventh hour – three months after the expected delivery of the cargo (see
                    above at [8]). It was therefore in no position to decide if it should purchase a
                    replacement shipment. Furthermore, it was not the case that the Respondent was
                    simply taking a backseat throughout the entire episode. Not only was it (through
                    Mr Rajendhranath) actively monitoring the progress of the voyage, it was in
                    constant contact with the supplier, Marine Alliance, throughout the first week
                    of October discussing how to proceed in relation to the missing
                cargo.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     After hearing arguments, we allowed the
                    appeal. Although we agreed in principle with the Judge’s view on the law
                        (<em>ie</em>, that the market value should be the first
                    port of call in assessing damages), we found that a clarification was necessary:
                    the market value in question must pertain to a <b><em>relevant</em></b> market, that is, a market in which the claimant is in
                    fact selling or intending to sell the goods. In this case, the Respondent was
                    involved in a <em>very different</em> market – one
                    further up the supply chain. There was no evidence adduced of this particular
                    market, let alone the value at which goods were sold if such a market existed.
                    To award the Respondent damages based on the prices typically charged by FTPL
                    would amount to conferring upon the Respondent a windfall. Given the dearth of
                    evidence of a <b><em>relevant</em></b> market, we found this an
                    appropriate case where the primary basis of assessing damages (market value)
                    should yield to the secondary basis (cost of replacement). We therefore restored
                    the AR’s award. We now proceed to give the detailed grounds for our
                    decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our grounds</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The applicable principles</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Before examining either of the issues set out
                    above (at [25]), we state briefly the applicable principles. First, at the
                    broadest level of abstraction, the object of an award of damages is to
                    compensate the plaintiff for the damage it has suffered (see the decision of
                    this court in <em>Chartered Electronics Industries Pte Ltd v
                        Comtech IT Pte Ltd</em> [1998] 2 SLR(R) 1010 (“<em>Chartered</em>”) at [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Turning more specifically to the issue at
                    hand, we note there is, understandably, no universal rule for the assessment of
                    damages (see the decision of this court in <em>The
                        “Pioneer Glory”</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 232
                        (“<em>The Pioneer Glory</em>”) at [47]).
                    The typical approach, however, is to equate the damages with the value of the
                    goods (see <em>Chartered</em> at [18]), <em>ie</em>, Damages = Value of the Goods. There may be cases where the
                    plaintiff is also allowed to recover consequential losses such as loss of
                    profits and losses incurred by being deprived of the use of the goods (<em>Chartered</em> at [19]), <em>ie</em>,
                    Damages = Value of the Goods + Consequential Losses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     How, then, is the value of the goods
                    determined? Typically, courts look to the market value (see <em>Chartered</em> at [18]). The most commonly cited justification for
                    the market value rule is that it is the best approximate of the loss suffered by
                    the plaintiff who has been deprived of his goods (see <em>Chartered</em> at [18]; Gary Chan Kok Yew and Lee Pey Woan, <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2011)
                        (“<em>The Law of Torts in
                    Singapore</em>”) at para 11.054; and Harvey McGregor,
                        <em>McGregor on Damages</em>
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2014) (“<em>McGregor on Damages</em>”) at para 36-006). The market
                    price is typically determined as at the date of conversion (see <em>The Law of Torts in Singapore</em> at para 11.055), or
                    as in the present case, where goods are converted in transit, at the date of
                    expected delivery (see the decision of the Privy Council (on appeal from the
                    Singapore Court of Appeal) in <em>The “Jag
                        Shakti”</em> [1985-1986] SLR(R) 448 at [13]). Needless to say,
                    to determine a market value, one must first ascertain if a market exists.
                    “Market” has been variously defined, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_a"></a>(a)     There is a market if there is a
                        willing seller and willing buyer after negotiations, notwithstanding that
                        the circle of buyers and sellers may be small and/or that goods may not be
                        immediately delivered (see the GD at [40] and [53]).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_b"></a>(b)     There must be a sufficient number of
                        traders who are in touch with each other. In other words, the availability
                        of buyers and sellers, and their ready capacity to supply or to absorb the
                        relevant goods is the basic concept of an “available market”.
                        There is no need to add to this the test of a price liable to fluctuations
                        in accordance with supply and demand, as occurs in official exchanges or
                        certain commodity markets (see <em>Benjamin’s Sale of
                            Goods</em> (Michael G Bridge, gen ed)
                        (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 9th Ed, 2014) at
                        para 16-066).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_30-p2_c"></a>(c)     There must be a reasonably available supply of goods and a reasonably
                        available source of demand for such goods (see <em>McGregor
                            on Damages</em> at para 23-007, citing the English High Court
                        decision of <em>M&amp;J Marine Engineering Services Co Ltd v
                            Shipshore Ltd</em> [2009] EWHC 2031 (Comm)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     We find that the gist across these definitions
                    is, to borrow the Judge’s words, that there is a <em>willing</em> seller and <em>willing</em> buyer
                        <em>after negotiations</em>. This rules out command
                    economies or monopolies in which there are no negotiations to speak of (although
                    it may well be the case that the price which is fixed in either of <em>these</em> two particular contexts would not only constitute
                    a “market” price of sorts but would also (and more importantly) be
                    the price which the court has recourse to as a measure of replacement cost).
                    However, that does not mean only completely free markets are relevant. It is
                    trite that completely free markets (wherein there is unrestricted competition
                    between sellers and buyers have perfect information) are almost non-existent in
                    reality. Market imperfections may be tolerated so long as the core factors
                    – willingness (of both buyer and seller) and the ability to negotiate
                    – are present. Oligopolies, for instance, typically constitute such
                    “imperfect markets”. That said, we would caution against a
                    preoccupation with labels. In the present case, for example, we note the
                    Appellant’s argument that the market was “oligopolistic” may
                    have been predicated on a misunderstanding of what an oligopolistic market in
                    fact is. The crux is not what label can be ascribed to the market but, rather,
                    whether the core factors referred to above are present.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     To this, we add a further point: the market
                    must be a <b><em>relevant</em></b> market. By this we mean that
                    the claimant must show that it is a participant of – typically a seller in
                    – that market. This is eminently sensible in the light of the compensatory
                    aim of awarding damages. That is to say, a claimant should never be allowed to
                    rely simply on “some other market out there” – typically
                    somewhere much further down the supply chain – wherein goods are traded at
                    a vastly more expensive rate. The simple reply to such an argument is that that
                    particular market is <em>irrelevant</em> as the claimant
                    would <em>never</em> be able to fetch that sort of price
                    were it to sell the goods in the course of its business. In most cases, the
                    dichotomy between successive “markets” within a supply chain would
                    be easy to envision as each step in the supply chain would involve some form of
                    “value adding” to the good which may manifest physically (such as
                    repackaging the good into a more convenient form). That is not to say that where
                    no physical change to the good takes place, the various markets collapse into
                    one another. Rather, a supply chain might still be necessitated by the goodwill
                    and networks of the various companies involved along the chain. For instance,
                    those further up the supply chain simply source for the goods in bulk and
                    transport them to those lower down the supply chain. The latter then leverage on
                    their extensive networks of clients – clients presumably located where the
                    goods are harder to come by – and sell to these clients at a significantly
                    marked-up price.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     Where the market price cannot be determined,
                    the value of the goods can be determined, instead, by the <em>cost of replacement</em>, which is typically the price at which the
                    goods were bought (see <em>Chartered</em> at [18]). Where
                    no market exists in which to replace the goods, their value is to be fixed at
                    what the plaintiff could get by sale to a solvent buyer (see <em>Chartered</em> at [18]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 1</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     We answered this issue in the affirmative. We
                    found, with respect, that the Judge had erred in finding that there was a market
                    for the converted river sand for two reasons. First, it was difficult to
                    conclude, from Mr Loganathan’s table alone (see above at [11]), that
                    there was any market for river sand in Port Blair in the first week of October
                    2011. Secondly, even if Mr Loganathan’s table sufficed, the market
                    evinced was an <em>irrelevant</em> market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Turning to the first point, we pause to
                    acknowledge that this was a case in which there were crucial pieces of evidence
                    missing. First, Mr Loganathan’s table (see above at [11]) was
                    incomplete in that it did not include sales of larger quantities of river sand
                        (<em>ie</em>, in the hundreds or thousands of MT). The
                    Judge did not appear perturbed by this as, she noted, Mr Loganathan
                    “had, in his testimony, at least attempted to explain the reasons why
                    there would be no significant pricing difference” between bulk purchases
                    and smaller purchases (see the GD at [71]). In support of that proposition, the
                    Judge referred (in a footnote) to a portion of the Notes of Evidence documenting
                    the re-examination of Mr Loganathan, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">My Learned Friend brought you --- asked you why
                            [FTPL] has not given the pricing of river sand from other sellers in
                            Port Blair. Can you explain why?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I cannot get details from other
                        competitors.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>The portion cited did not seem to stand for the proposition
                        that the Judge stated. Another portion of the transcript, which documents a
                        segment of the cross-examination of Mr Loganathan, however, did seem
                        relevant. It reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">You are talking about ex yard. My question is, if
                            someone were to buy 4300 MT ex ship at Port Blair, the price would be
                            significantly lower than the one you quoted?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">There would be a small difference.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">In other words, your price is for selling ex yard
                            in small parcels?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Retail sales. Some wholesale also, 100MT,
                            200MT.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Which you did not produce documents
                        on.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Those are credit sales. We want to only show cash
                            sale transactions to reflect the market rate.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On Mr Loganathan’s account, the
                    reason he did not provide figures for bulk sales was that they were credit
                    sales, which were presumably at a lower price, as can be inferred from his reply
                    “[t]here would be a small difference” to the question “the
                    price would be significantly lower …?”. However, this seemed at
                    odds with what he stated during re-examination. When asked why he did not
                    include documents on credit sales, Mr Loganathan responded that
                    “[p]rices for credit sale would be 2 or 3% more. Because those are credit
                    sales”. Not only had Mr Loganathan not explained why bulk purchases
                    were priced similarly to smaller purchases, his evidence was contradictory
                    – first indicating bulk purchases were cheaper yet later stating they were
                    “2 or 3%” more expensive. Furthermore, he did not clearly explain
                    why bulk purchases were more (or less) expensive (unless it was the case that
                        <em>all</em> bulk purchases were credit sales). Also,
                    if it was the case that he had access to further records of sales of a similar
                    volume to the converted river sand, notwithstanding that they were credit sales,
                    it was highly peculiar that he had chosen not to include them in his evidence.
                    Would it not have been far more convincing if he had included records of those
                    sales and <em>then</em> explained them away as
                    anomalies?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The second peculiar point about
                    Mr Loganathan’s table was that it only documented FTPL’s
                    transactions (wherein FTPL was the seller). The Judge found that the
                    Respondent’s (or FTPL’s) inability to obtain further figures from
                    other sellers was understandable given that “competitors would loathe
                    cooperating with [the Respondent] by revealing their pricing” (see the GD
                    at [71]). In support of this proposition, the Judge referred once again to the
                    same portion of the Notes of Evidence documenting the re-examination of
                    Mr Loganathan (see above at [35]). The closest Mr Loganathan came to
                    explaining his inability to obtain prices from other competitors was his
                    statement that “I cannot get details from other competitors” (see
                    above at [35]). We found it difficult to discern from this single statement any
                    indication that the industry was of such a competitive and secretive nature that
                    competitors’ prices were impossible to ascertain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     These two points mentioned thus far pertain to
                    the difficulties we had with the evidence that was before the court. That said,
                    we also had difficulty with evidence that was not before the court but, plainly,
                    should have been. This included the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_a"></a>(a)     The first difficulty pertained to
                        the price at which the Respondent disposed of the <em>first</em> shipment of river sand. It was clear that the 4,300MT
                        of river sand in question (which constituted the subject matter of the
                        present proceedings) was the <em>second</em> shipment.
                        No evidence was led to show whether the first shipment had been sold, and,
                        if sold, to whom and at what price. In fact, Mr Loganathan’s
                        evidence seemed to imply that the first shipment had been sold to FTPL.
                        However the price of this sale was not exhibited in
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        second difficulty pertained to the price at which the Respondent typically
                        sold river sand on to FTPL. As stated by Mr Loganathan, FTPL typically
                        bought river sand from the Respondent at Port Blair and would thereafter
                        sell it on. Not only was there no evidence as to the price at which the
                        Respondent sold river sand to FTPL, Mr Rajendhranath answered in the
                        negative during cross-examination when asked if he had provided any
                        documents to show the transactions between the Respondent and
                    FTPL.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_38-p2_c"></a>(c)     The third
                        difficulty pertained to the price at which the river sand was eventually
                        sold by the Appellant’s subsidiary. Not only was the Appellant’s
                        evidence rather confusing in that it first claimed it had sold off the sand
                        before it took the position that the sand was sold off by its subsidiary
                        (which bore a very similar name), it also failed to provide any information
                        on the terms of that sale, save as to state that “the Cargo is not
                        valuable and is easily replaceable” (see above at
                    [8]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id=""></a>In short, there were significant lapses
                        in the evidence adduced by both parties. These lapses not only went to the
                        burden of proof but also significantly compromised each side’s case
                        theory. Nevertheless, we return to the point at hand – was
                        Mr Loganathan’s table (see above at [11]) sufficient to establish
                        the presence of a market in Port Blair at the relevant time? For the reasons
                        set out above – both the difficulties we had with the table and the
                        meagre explanations proffered in relation to the lapses in evidence –
                        we found it was not. On this basis alone, we found ourselves compelled to
                        allow the appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Nevertheless, even if it could be said that
                    Mr Loganathan’s table constituted sufficient evidence of <em>a</em> market, there was a more important point to note
                    – it was, at best, evidence of an <b><em>irrelevant</em></b> market.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     There appeared to be at least three different
                    “markets” in the river sand industry in the context of the present
                    case, at least as depicted by the limited evidence presented before the AR (and,
                    by extension, before the Judge and this court). First, furthest up the supply
                    chain, there was the “wholesale market”. In this market, companies
                    such as the Respondent purchase river sand from companies such as Marine
                    Alliance. These sales occur in high quantities (hundreds or thousands of MT) at
                    relatively low prices (S$6.50 per MT, excluding port and freight charges).
                    Secondly, at the other end of the supply chain, there was the “retail
                    market”, whereby companies such as FTPL sell the river sand on to buyers
                    (the likes of Sankar Contractor &amp; Construction and Binu Kumar).
                    These sales occur at low quantities (few or several MT) but at relatively high
                    prices (US$46.85 per MT). Thirdly, there was the market that connected the
                    retailers to the wholesalers. For instance, the Respondent typically sold the
                    river sand it purchased (from parties such as Marine Alliance) to FTPL. The sale
                    would take place at Port Blair. However, as noted above, no prices were
                    disclosed in relation to such sales. The overall supply chain can be described
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Original seller – The Respondent – FTPL – Eventual
                        customer</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The relevant market in this case was the one
                    connecting those in the position of the Respondent to those in the position of
                    FTPL. Not only had no prices been disclosed in relation to transactions in
                        <em>this</em> particular market, there was no evidence
                    at all that such a market even existed. In fact, the Respondent’s sale of
                    sand to FTPL might just have been a practice unique to the Respondent and FTPL,
                    whereby the Respondent simply acted as a carrier of goods. Not only did this
                    seem apparent from the Respondent’s name, Fairmacs <em>Shipping and Transport</em> Services Pte Ltd (as contrasted with
                    FTPL’s name, Fairmacs <em>Trading</em> Company Pte
                    Ltd, and the latter’s role as the trading arm of the “Fairmacs
                    group” of companies, see above at [10]), Mr Rajendhranath seemed to
                    imply as much during cross-examination. The relevant portion of the transcript
                    reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Can you confirm that [the Respondent] has been
                            dealing in sand for many years before this shipment?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">No. [The Respondent] may have been dealing as a
                            carrier, not a buyer. [The Respondent] has been bringing sand from
                            mainland India for many years only as a carrier, not as a
                        buyer.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So [the Respondent] could have bought sand from
                            other sellers in Port Blair?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">[The Respondent]? No. [The Respondent] has not
                            bought sand previously. What I am trying to say, earlier shipment from
                            mainland India, [the Respondent] was only the carrier to bring the cargo
                            which may belong to other parties including [FTPL].</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The portion cited above hinted that the
                    Respondent was simply a carrier of the river sand (as opposed to being a part of
                    the supply chain). What was confusing about Mr Rajendhranath’s
                    evidence just quoted above was his seeming denial that the Respondent had ever
                    bought river sand (and that the river sand seemingly belonged – at all
                    times – to FTPL). Leaving this aside, the point we wish to make is that
                    the Respondent could <b><em>never</em></b> have sold the 4,300MT
                    of river sand converted at the price of US$46.85 per MT. This much was even
                    readily accepted by counsel for the Respondent during the oral hearing. Any
                    transaction involving the river sand in question may have constituted a
                    different stage of the supply chain or it may not even have been part of the
                    supply chain. The <em>burden of proof</em> was on <em>the Respondent</em> to establish a <b><em>relevant</em></b> market, and (in so doing) its role in the supply chain.
                    It failed to meet this burden. This was sufficient to dispose of the matter. But
                    to complete the picture, we observed further that the only evidence the
                    Respondent did place before the court cast doubt on its ability to sell the
                    river sand it procured to anyone other than FTPL. It appeared to be more of a
                    carrier for FTPL (and FTPL alone) than anything else. If this were the case, how
                    could it then be said that the damage it suffered should be compensated on the
                    basis of US$46.85 per MT? Such compensation, if awarded, would, in these
                    circumstances, surely have constituted a windfall.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     On the basis that the Respondent had failed to
                    prove the existence of a market on a balance of probabilities, we found that the
                    replacement cost was a viable alternative method to assess damages. It was
                    undisputed that US$62,950 was the amount the Respondent had actually paid for
                    the sand. This was also the amount the AR arrived at. We therefore restored the
                    AR’s award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issue 2</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     As we found there was no (<em>relevant</em>) market to begin with, there was, strictly speaking, no
                    need to consider this particular issue (<em>ie</em>, market
                    value). As mentioned above, in the light of the dearth of evidence adduced to
                    establish a market (let alone a market value), we preferred the cost of
                    replacement measure. On this note, and for completeness, we address the
                    parties’ reliance on <em>Furness</em> (see above at
                    [21] and [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     In <em>Furness</em>, the
                    victim’s damages were initially assessed on the basis of the
                    “wholesale price” of the converted goods. To recapitulate, the
                    plaintiff – Adrium Industries – was in the business of selling to
                    the wholesaler in a particular novelty goods industry (analogous to Marine
                    Alliance’s position in this case). On appeal, the Supreme Court of
                    Victoria Appeal Division found that the judge below had erred in adopting the
                    “wholesale price” and, instead, assessed the plaintiff’s
                    damages on the basis of the amount it paid for the goods, <em>ie</em>, the replacement cost. The reason for this was that
                    “the only evidence about the market [in] which the converted goods were
                    capable of being purchased by [Adrium Industries] was the market from which it
                    had originally purchased them[;] [t]here was no evidence which justified an
                    award of damages by reference to the wholesale price” (at
                675).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     As was the situation in <em>Furness</em>, no evidence was led as to the market in which the
                    Respondent was selling or intending to sell the converted goods. The court in
                        <em>Furness</em> appeared to arrive at its conclusion
                    by reasoning that “market value” could refer either to the market
                    into which the good was going to be sold by the victim (which seems to
                    correspond to market price) or the market from which the good was bought by the
                    victim (which corresponds to cost of replacement). In <em>Furness</em>, the court found the latter to be more appropriate in
                    the light of the dearth of evidence of the former.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Our determination of the second issue also led
                    to the conclusion that the cost of replacement was the appropriate measure of
                    damages to be adopted in this case. Further, as the purchase from Marine
                    Alliance was in US Dollars, it was appropriate for the damages to be awarded in
                    that currency.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For the reasons set out above, we allowed the
                    appeal and restored the AR’s award. We also awarded costs here and below
                    to the Appellant fixed at S$20,000, excluding reasonable
                disbursements.</p>
