He also admitted to six other similar offences and consented to having them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“the TIC charges”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The District Judge (“DJ”) sentenced him to a fine of $1m, in default eight months’ imprisonment, for each of the three charges. The aggregate sentence was therefore a fine of $3m, in default 24 months’ imprisonment. The DJ’s grounds of decision are set out in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Tan Teck Leong, Melvin (Chen </span><span class="font-italic">Deliang, Melvin)</span> [2022] SGDC 162 (“GD”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed by the DJ on the ground that it is manifestly inadequate.

As the sole proprietor of TL, the respondent was responsible for creating a consolidated packing list for each shipment. The Singapore importers or their suppliers would send the respondent a copy of their individual packing lists and invoices. The respondent would then create a consolidated packing list by collating the individual packing lists.

</div> The falsified consolidated packing lists were then provided to TL’s declaring agents. Relying on these falsified consolidated packing lists, the declaring agents under-declared to Singapore Customs (“Customs”) the value of the goods imported by TL. The respondent was aware that by declaring a lower value, he would pay less GST for the imported goods. The respondent prepaid the lower amounts of GST to his declaring agents who then paid the amounts to Customs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 After the imported goods were received in Singapore, the respondent sent the buyers separate invoices for sea freight charges and for GST reimbursements based on the actual higher value of the goods instead of the falsified lower value in the consolidated packing lists. The respondent pocketed the difference between the higher amount of GST that he received from the buyers and the lower amount of GST that he had prepaid to his declaring agents.

</div> The DJ concluded that a fine equivalent to five times the amount evaded was appropriate. As the amount evaded for each of the three charges was about $200,000, this worked out to be a fine of $1m for each charge, making a total fine of $3m.

The court then refers to the table above to determine the applicable multiplier. The multiplier values are applied cumulatively, similar to the method of calculation of income tax liability in Singapore.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-58c34128-2f25-4104-b9f7-4660b789e258" data-toggle="modal" type="button">22</button></sup>

</div> For instance, if the total amount evaded is $100,000, a multiplier of 20 would be applied to the first $250 and the next $250, while a multiplier of 10 would be applied to the remaining $99,500. The total indicative fine would therefore be (20 × $250) + (20 × $250) + (10 × $99,500) = $1,005,000. The ranges of indicative fines, calculated by applying the multiplier values cumulatively, are set out in the third column of the table above.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The multiplier values decrease as the amount of GST evaded increases.

First, we confine our analysis to offences under s 128D of the Customs Act involving the fraudulent evasion of GST on imported goods, where no harmful goods (such as tobacco products) are involved. While Ms Wong suggests that the sentencing framework adopted by this court could also apply to other offences under s 128D involving the fraudulent evasion of GST on harmful goods or the fraudulent evasion of customs or excise duties,

</div>
</div> these are not the offences before us in the present appeal. Further, we note that there are special punishment provisions for offences involving goods consisting wholly or partly of relevant tobacco products (see ss 128L(4), 128L(5) and 128L(5A)). We therefore prefer to leave the issue of a sentencing framework for these other offences to be considered in a future suitable case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34  Second, any sentencing framework adopted by this court must clearly be subject to the minimum fine of $5,000 or 10 times the amount evaded (whichever is lesser) and the maximum fine of $5,000 or 20 times the amount evaded (whichever is greater) as set out in s 128L(2) of the Customs Act. Therefore, while the frameworks proposed by the Prosecution and Ms Wong rely on multipliers ranging from one to 20 to derive the appropriate fine, the sentencing court must bear in mind the applicable minimum and maximum fines on the facts of the case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 We are not inclined to adopt the “two-step sentencing bands” framework proposed by Ms Wong for two reasons. First, as noted above, Ms Wong’s framework is premised on the notion that the amount of GST evaded should not take primacy in the sentencing analysis. Consequently, Ms Wong’s framework does not feature the amount of GST evaded as a separate offence-specific factor. Instead, it determines the applicable multiplier based on other offence-specific factors. However, s 128L(2) of the Customs Act provides that offences under s 128D are punishable by fine only and that the range of possible fines is determined as a multiple of the amount of GST evaded (subject to the relevant minimum or maximum fine of $5,000). This is a clear indication that Parliament intended that the amount of GST evaded should be the dominant, or at least a significant, consideration in the calibration of sentences for such offences. The sentencing framework must therefore reflect legislative intention by including the amount of GST evaded as one of the considerations at the very least.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The parties were largely in agreement that the offence under s 128D of the Customs Act has two aims. The first is the prevention of loss of revenue to the State. The second is that it is in the public interest to reduce the consumption of harmful goods by raising their cost to the user (see <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 3 SLR 180 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai</span>”) at [23]).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> It follows that where the facts of a case do not involve the importation of harmful goods, only the first aim of the prevention of the loss of revenue to the State is relevant. Clearly, the extent of revenue lost by the State will correspond to the amount of GST evaded. To borrow the language used in <span class="font-italic">Wong Kai </span><span class="font-italic">Chuen Philip v Public Prosecutor</span> [1990] 2 SLR(R) 361 at [18] in the context of other financial offences, all other things being equal, it is a matter of common sense that the larger the amount of GST evaded, the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court ought to be. The amount of GST evaded therefore must be a primary factor in the sentencing analysis. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 The second difficulty with Ms Wong’s framework is that it does not guard against the risk of disproportionately high fines when the amount of GST evaded is high. As the respondent observes, particularly serious cases involving a high amount of GST evaded would tend to involve a higher number of aggravating factors (such as the involvement of a syndicate, a high degree of premeditation or sophistication in the methodology of evasion).

</div>
</div>
</div> Under Ms Wong’s proposed framework, cases falling into the most severe category would attract a multiplier of 14 to 20. Therefore, if the amount evaded is high, this would almost always result in a potentially crushing fine. While the fine may be adjusted downwards on account of the totality principle, the Prosecution highlights that the overall utility of the sentencing framework would be limited if the sentencing court has to regularly make significant discretionary adjustments to the indicative sentence.

</div>
</div> We consider these to be valid concerns. In our view, the appropriate sentencing framework must be able to provide guidance on the indicative fines for offences under s 128D of the Customs Act, while ensuring that the fines meted out are not crushingly disproportionate when the amount of GST evaded is high.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 We now consider the Prosecution’s proposed framework. The Prosecution’s framework places the amount of GST evaded at the forefront of the analysis since the indicative fine is determined as a mathematical product of the amount of GST evaded. The Prosecution’s framework also incorporates a regressive multiplier where the applicable multiplier decreases as the amount of GST evaded increases. This helps to maintain a degree of proportionality in sentencing. We therefore consider the Prosecution’s framework to be a viable working model on which a sentencing framework for the offence under s 128D can be formulated.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 1: Deriving the indicative fine</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 At the first step, the court derives the indicative fine based on the amount of GST evaded. While the Prosecution’s framework divides the amount evaded into five possible brackets, we agree with the respondent that these brackets should be broken down into smaller bands. In our view, the Prosecution’s proposed brackets on the amount of GST evaded do not distinguish sufficiently between cases of varying severity. For instance, the same multiplier values apply regardless of whether the amount evaded is the relatively small amount of $501 or the much larger amount of $100,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 We think the framework set out below will provide a good working guide for the court when sentencing offenders who have fraudulently evaded the payment of GST: </div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(218,238,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amount of GST evaded</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(218,238,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Multiplier applied to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">each </span><span class="font-weight-bold">bracket</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(218,238,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Range of indicative fine</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$1 to $250</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 12</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$12 to $3,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$251 to $1,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 10</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$3,010 to $10,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$1,001 to $10,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 8</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$10,508 to $82,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$10,001 to $100,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 6</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$82,506 to $622,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$100,001 to $500,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 4</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$622,504 to $2,222,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$500,001 to $1m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 3</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$2,222,503 to $3,722,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">&gt;$1m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 2</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">&gt; $3,722,500</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Similar to the Prosecution’s framework, the multiplier values set out at each level are to be applied cumulatively, in the same way that income tax is computed in Singapore. The obvious difference between the multipliers here and the tax rate for income tax is that the multiplier here decreases as the amount of GST evaded increases, while the income tax rate increases as the amount of income increases. The decreasing rate in the multiplier guards against the risk of disproportionately high fines as the amount of GST evaded increases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 We give an illustration of how the above framework is to function. In a case where the amount of GST evaded is $10,000, the indicative fine would be (12 × $250) + (10 × $750) + (8 × $9,000) = $82,500. The cumulative method of computation prevents an offender from getting a more lenient sentence simply because he crosses over fortuitously into the next higher level on the scale. If the amount of fine is not computed cumulatively but a single multiplier is applied to the entire amount of GST evaded, an offender who evades $250 in GST would be subject to a multiplier of 12 (resulting in a fine of $3,000). However, an offender who evades $251 would be subject to a multiplier of 10 (resulting in a fine of $2,510). This would result in a perverse outcome where the fine is lower for the second offender although the amount of GST that he evaded is higher, even if only marginally. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In deriving the ranges set out above, we have also borne in mind that indicative sentences should utilise the full spectrum of possible sentences but generally should stop short of the statutory maximum sentence as maximum sentences are usually reserved for the “worst type of cases falling within the prohibition”: <span class="font-italic">Vasentha</span><span class="font-italic"> d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor</span> [2015] 5 SLR 122 at [45]–[46]. We therefore leave the range of multipliers from 13 to the maximum of 20 for cases where aggravating factors make it necessary for the sentencing court to apply a higher multiplier than that indicated in the above framework. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Where the lower end of the multiplier range is concerned, we have stopped at a multiplier of two because a multiplier of one would effectively leave the offender unpunished for his evasion of GST beyond that level, in that he would merely be paying as a fine the amount of GST that he evaded paying. Further, while the multipliers have been indicated as integers in the framework, we see no objection if the sentencing court should decide that the appropriate multiplier in the case before it should also include a fraction, for example, 4.5 times the amount of GST evaded, if a multiplier of four is considered too low and a multiplier of five too high in the circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The above framework is intended to apply to first-time offenders who plead guilty<span class="font-italic"> </span>at the earliest available opportunity. This would be consistent with the sentencing frameworks that have been laid down for similar offences (see for instance, <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai </span>at [40]) and for offences under various statutes. For repeat offenders, s 128L(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) provides that such offenders shall be liable to the fine set out in s 128L(2) or to imprisonment for up to two years or to both. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 While the Prosecution proposes that the indicative fine should be calculated based on the total<span class="font-italic"> </span>amount of GST evaded in all the charges proceeded on, we are of the view that the framework should apply to the amount evaded in each charge. In the present appeal, the three amalgamated charges in issue each covers a span of a different year. The charges were framed in this manner to comply with s 124(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CPC which states that two or more alleged incidents of the commission of an offence, taken together, may amount to a course of conduct if all of the alleged incidents occurred within a defined period that does not exceed 12 months (see [15] above). To proceed as suggested by the Prosecution and calculate the indicative fine based on the total amount of GST evaded in all three charges would be tantamount to treating all three charges as if they were a single amalgamated<span class="font-italic"> </span>charge. This would appear to circumvent the restriction set out in s 124(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CPC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 We pause at this juncture to note that a consequence of our analysis above is that the indicative sentence faced by an offender may differ depending on whether the charges against him are framed as multiple charges or as a single amalgamated charge. To illustrate, because the ranges in the framework apply to individual charges, an offender convicted on ten charges of evading $250 in GST would be subject to a multiplier of 12 on each charge. The total indicative fine for the 10 charges would be $250 × 12 × 10 = $30,000. In comparison, an offender who is convicted on a single amalgamated charge of evading $2,500 in GST would be subject to a multiplier of 12 on the first $250 evaded, a multiplier of 10 on the next $750 evaded and a multiplier of 8 on the remaining $1,500 evaded. The indicative fine would therefore be (12 × $250) + (10 × $750) + (8 × $1,500) = $22,500. While the framing of charges is ultimately a matter of prosecutorial discretion, we make this observation to underscore that the Prosecution should be mindful of the potentially different outcomes if individual charges are preferred against an offender instead of an amalgamated charge in cases where s 124 of the CPC permits the charges to be amalgamated. In any case, in the context of the sentencing framework discussed further below, the sentencing court will have the discretion to make adjustments to the eventual fine to be imposed to ameliorate any aberration that may be occasioned by the Prosecution’s decision to proceed on individual charges instead of amalgamated charges. In our view, this would be part of the application of the totality principle, which serves to ensure that the overall sentence is proportionate to and appropriate for the facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 2: Adjustments for aggravating/mitigating factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 At the second step, the court identifies the aggravating and mitigating factors present in the case.

</div> For instance, given that the offence in question is the fraudulent evasion of GST on imported<span class="font-italic"> </span>goods, the fact that the offender obtains goods from another country or has suppliers located in another country should not be considered as separate aggravating factors since they are features inherent in the offence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Third, the framework is based on a timely guilty plea on the basis that this would reflect a willingness to cooperate and this is a sign of real remorse. If there is no remorse reflected in an unduly late guilty plea or no guilty plea or if there is otherwise reason to conclude that there is an absence of remorse, then this may be taken into account against the accused.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Based on the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors identified, the court then adjusts the indicative fine upwards or downwards accordingly. The court may do so by making a lump sum adjustment to the indicative fine or by modifying the applicable multiplier, which, as we have indicated earlier, may include fractions when these are considered to be appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 3: Totality principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 At the final step, the court considers whether further adjustments should be made on account of the totality principle. It is well established that the totality principle requires the court to take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances of the case and assess whether the sentence looks wrong: <span class="font-italic">Mohamed </span><span class="font-italic">Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 2 SLR 998 at [58]. In the context of the present offence, where a fine is the only prescribed punishment and in a case where there are multiple charges, it may be relevant to consider whether the overall fine quantum is just and appropriate, especially if the offender is of limited financial means. As observed in <span class="font-italic">Chia Kah Boon v Public Prosecutor</span> [1999] 2 SLR(R) 1163 at [15], a court must take into account the competing considerations of ensuring that on one hand, the fine imposed is sufficiently high to achieve the objectives of deterrence and retribution but, on the other hand, that the fine is of an amount that the offender can reasonably pay given his financial means. Similarly, the totality principle is equally capable of having a boosting effect on individual sentences where they would otherwise result in a manifestly inadequate overall sentence: <span class="font-italic">Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 4 SLR 838 at [20]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the sentencing framework for fraudulent evasion of GST under s 128D of the Customs Act</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 To summarise:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) In cases where:</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) the offender is convicted of the offence under s 128D of the Customs Act of fraudulently evading GST on imported goods;</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(ii) the offences do not involve harmful goods such as tobacco products or liquor; and</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(iii) the offender is a first-time offender who pleads guilty at the earliest available opportunity;</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">the court should derive the indicative fine for each charge based on the multipliers in the framework set out above. The multipliers are to apply cumulatively for each level, similar to the method of calculating income tax in Singapore. The court should also bear in mind the applicable minimum and maximum fines set out in s 128L(2) of the Customs Act.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Having computed the indicative fine, the court should then identify the aggravating and mitigating factors present on the facts of the case and adjust the indicative sentence accordingly. It can do this by adjusting the amount of the fine or by modifying the multiplier, which may include fractions if appropriate.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court considers if any further adjustments should be made on account of the totality principle, especially in cases involving multiple charges.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We make one final observation on the framework. The framework we have set out above does not take into account the increased punishment provided for amalgamated charges in s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC. As noted earlier, s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) provides that where an offender is convicted of a charge amalgamated under s 124(4) of the CPC, the court may sentence him to two times the amount of punishment that he would otherwise have been liable for, had he been convicted for any one incident of the offence. In cases such as the present where an offender is convicted of an amalgamated charge under s 128D of the Customs Act, the full sentencing range would therefore be twice the amount of fines stated in s 128L(2) of the Customs Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 At the hearing before us, the Prosecution acknowledged candidly that it had not taken this into account in its submissions.

</div> Nevertheless, the Prosecution suggested that there may not ordinarily be a need to invoke s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC for amalgamated offences under s 128D of the Customs Act, as the usual punishment ranges take into account already the totality of the accused person’s offending.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In our view, this argument has some force. By augmenting the available sentencing range, s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC serves to ensure that an offender convicted of an amalgamated offence does not receive a discount in sentencing. In a public consultation conducted by the Ministry of Law prior to the enactment of ss 124(4) and 124(8) of the CPC, the proposed legislative changes were explained as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">Allowing amalgamation of charges in more circumstances</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In addition to these changes, it is proposed to create a new general provision permitting the amalgamation of <span class="font-italic">any</span> offence where multiple instances of the same offence constitute a course of conduct, having regard to the time, place or purpose of commission. To avoid amalgamation resulting in sentencing discounts for multiple offending, charges amalgamated under this general provision will have their maximum sentences doubled. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">(See Ministry of Law, “Public Consultation on Proposed Amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code and Evidence Act” (24 July 2017) at Annex B pp 18–19 &lt;<span class="font-underline" style="color: rgba(0,0,255,1)">https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/news/public-consultations/public-consultation-on-proposed-amendments-to-the-criminal-proce</span>&gt;).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the context of the offence under s 128D of the Customs Act, since the maximum fine is determined by a multiplier of the amount of GST evaded, it follows that an offender who evades a larger amount consolidated from several incidents of evasion will be subject to a higher maximum fine anyway. The issue of an offender receiving a “discount” because he was convicted on an amalgamated charge therefore would not arise. Accordingly, we take the provisional view that it should not be necessary to have recourse to the enhanced sentencing powers provided for in s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC in most cases involving amalgamated charges under s 128D of the Customs Act. In any case, in this appeal, the Prosecution is not asking the court to exercise its powers under s 124(8)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(ii) of the CPC. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The framework for default imprisonment terms under s 128L(2) of the Customs Act</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Three preliminary observations</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 The next issue that arises for our consideration is the appropriate framework for default imprisonment terms under s 128L(2) of the Customs Act. We begin by making three preliminary observations.-</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 First, the purpose of a default imprisonment term is to prevent evasion of the fine imposed. It is not to serve as a proxy for the punishment imposed for the original offence: <span class="font-italic">Yap Ah Lai </span>at [18].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Second, default imprisonment terms under the Customs Act are capped at a maximum of six years pursuant to s 119 of the Customs Act. The question that arises is whether the statutory cap applies to the default imprisonment term imposed for each charge or to the total default imprisonment term imposed in respect of all the charges. A plain reading of s 119 suggests that the former interpretation is to be preferred and the Prosecution appears to have adopted this interpretation as well.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 This is an interesting question regarding the proper interpretation of s 119 of the Customs Act which may require determination in a future case where the global default imprisonment term exceeds six years. For the present appeal, the individual and collective default imprisonment terms ordered by the DJ and those that we will be ordering do not come up to the statutory maximum of six years. We therefore do not propose to rule in this judgment on the proper interpretation of s 119 regarding the maximum default imprisonment term in cases involving multiple charges.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The third observation relates to whether the framework for default imprisonment terms should make a distinction between harmful and non-harmful imported goods. In this case, there is no dispute that no harmful goods were imported by the respondent. The respondent submits that a distinction should be drawn between the indicative default imprisonment terms for cases involving tobacco products and those that do not. The respondent relies on the fact that the maximum default imprisonment term under s 119 of the Customs Act was increased from three to six years in 1996 as part of the amendments to the Customs Act to combat cigarette smuggling: <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(12 July 1996) vol 66 at col 427 (Koo Tsai Kee, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance).

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 However, there is nothing in the wording of s 119 of the Customs Act to suggest that default imprisonment terms for the evasion of GST involving tobacco products should be higher than those involving non-harmful products. The relevant parliamentary debates also do not support the respondent’s contention. In the circumstances, we do not see any reason why the framework on default imprisonment terms should not apply also to offences under s 128D involving the importation of harmful goods or to other specified offences punishable under s 128L(2) of the Customs Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 We now turn to consider the frameworks proposed by the parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 1: Deriving the indicative default imprisonment term</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As noted earlier, the Prosecution and Ms Wong have both proposed that the sentencing court should first determine the indicative default imprisonment term based on the quantum of fine imposed. The main difference in their approaches is that the Prosecution’s proposed framework sets out the total indicative default imprisonment term for all the charges while Ms Wong’s framework sets out the indicative default imprisonment term for each charge. In our judgment, it would not be appropriate as a matter of principle to determine the default imprisonment term based on the total fine imposed for all the charges as this would have the effect of treating the three amalgamated charges as a single amalgamated charge, thereby circumventing the 12-month restriction in s 124(5)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CPC. We therefore think the proper approach should be to calibrate the default imprisonment term based on the fine imposed for each charge.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Bearing in mind that s 119 of the Customs Act provides that any default term of imprisonment “shall be such period as in the opinion of the court will satisfy the justice of the case”, we consider that the appropriate indicative default imprisonment terms should be worked out in the following manner:</div><table class="table table-sm table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(218,238,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Fine quantum imposed per charge</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(218,238,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Indicative default sentence</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Up to $500,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Up to 6 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$500,000 to $1m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">6 to 12 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$1m to $2m </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">12 to 24 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$2m to $3m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">24 to 36 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$3m to $5m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">36 to 48 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$5m to $10m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">48 to 72 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$10m and above</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">72 months (statutory maximum)</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Step 2: Totality principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Having determined the indicative default imprisonment term for each charge, the sentencing court in cases involving multiple charges should then consider whether the aggregate<span class="font-italic"> </span>default imprisonment term offends the totality principle.

The court there observed that judicial pronouncements are, by default, retroactive<span class="font-italic"> </span>in nature. Appellate courts, however, have the discretion to restrict the retroactive effect of their pronouncements in exceptional<span class="font-italic"> </span>circumstances. The exercise of this discretion is to be guided by four factors, namely: (a) the extent to which the law or legal principle concerned is entrenched; (b) the extent of change to the law; (c) the extent to which the change to the law is foreseeable; and (d) the extent of reliance on the law or legal principle concerned. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In <span class="font-italic">Adri Anton </span><span class="font-italic">Kalangie v Public Prosecutor</span> [2018] 2 SLR 557, the Court of Appeal stated that given the exceptionality of the doctrine of prospective overruling, it should only be invoked in circumstances where a departure from the ordinary retroactivity of a judgment is necessary to avoid “serious and demonstrable injustice to the parties or to the administration of justice” (at [40]). One such instance where the doctrine was invoked was <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 4 SLR 892 (“<span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Kiat</span>”), where the High Court set out new sentencing frameworks for vice and other offences under ss 140 and 146 of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed). The court in <span class="font-italic">Poh</span><span class="font-italic"> Boon Kiat </span>observed that (a) the previous sentencing precedents had entrenched the starting point for first-time offenders without any aggravating factors as a fine; (b) the shift in the sentencing starting point constituted a fundamental and unforeseeable change in the law from the offender’s perspective; and (c) the new sentencing frameworks were influenced by the shift in the sentencing starting point (at [113]).

</div>
</div> In any event, we do not consider that the frameworks that we have set out in this judgment constitute a fundamental and unforeseeable change in the law. In our view, these frameworks merely provide coherence to the sentencing practice and do not represent an abandonment of or radical departure from past precedents. In the circumstances, it is difficult to see what “serious and demonstrable injustice” would be occasioned by the retroactive application of the frameworks that we have set out. We therefore do not regard the present case as being sufficiently exceptional to warrant invoking the doctrine of prospective overruling.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 We now evaluate the sentences imposed on the respondent in the light of the frameworks that we have set out. The respondent was convicted on three charges of evading $182,000, $219,000 and $201,000 (rounded up for simplicity in computation) respectively. Based on the applicable multipliers in the framework set out earlier at [40], the indicative fines in respect of these charges are $950,500, $1,098,500 and $1,026,500. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As for the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, we do not see any reason to disagree with the DJ’s analysis. The respondent profited from his offending, the offences took place over several years (2016 to 2019) and he had six similar charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (one of the TIC charges involved evasion of GST payment in January 2020). The DJ considered the respondent’s voluntary partial restitution of $50,000 to be significant, considering that his average annual income for 2019 and 2020 was only some $30,400. We would only make a passing comment on the respondent’s stated income. We note that the average was derived from his stated income for only two years ($40,990 for 2019 and $19,989 for 2020). 2020 was the year that COVID-19 became a full-blown pandemic that affected commerce adversely and it was only natural that the respondent’s income from his business that year decreased. However, for the three charges in issue here which covered 2016, 2017 and 2019, the respondent pocketed an average of $200,000 in evaded GST for each of the three years.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 In any case, the fines of $1m for each charge imposed by the DJ are close to the indicative fines set out in [73] above ($950,500, $1,098,500 and $1,026,500). Taken together with all the factors highlighted by the DJ in arriving at his decision, the fines imposed cannot be said to be manifestly inadequate. We would add that the aggregate sentence of $3m also does not offend the totality principle bearing in mind that the respondent benefited from the evasion of GST by more than $600,000. We therefore agree with the individual and collective fines imposed by the DJ and we affirm his decision on the fines.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Turning to the respondent’s default imprisonment term, it follows from the framework we have set out that the indicative default imprisonment term should be 12 months for each charge, adding up to 36 months for the three charges. We think that such a default imprisonment term, individually and collectively, accords with the respondent’s overall criminality and satisfies the justice of this case. We consider the total default imprisonment term of 24 months imposed by the DJ to be manifestly inadequate. Accordingly, we order the default imprisonment term to be 12 months for each of the three charges. The respondent will therefore have to serve a total of 36 months’ imprisonment in default of paying the aggregate fine of $3m.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 For the reasons set out above, we allow the Prosecution’s appeal in part. The fine of $1m for each charge imposed by the DJ is to stand. However, the respondent is to serve 12 months’ imprisonment (instead of eight months) in default of payment for each charge or 36 months’ imprisonment in total.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 We thank Ms Wong for her able assistance in this appeal.

He was responsible for creating a consolidated packing list for each shipment.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">2 Between 2016 and 2019, the respondent falsified various consolidated packing lists by lowering the value of the goods in the consolidated packing lists at random. The falsified consolidated packing lists were then provided to TL’s declaring agents. Relying on these falsified consolidated packing lists, the declaring agents under-declared to Singapore Customs (“Customs”) the value of the goods imported by TL. The respondent knew that by declaring a lower value, he would pay less GST for the imported goods. The respondent prepaid the lower amounts of GST to his declaring agents who then paid the amounts to Customs. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">3 After the imported goods were received in Singapore, the respondent charged his buyers GST based on the actual higher value of the goods instead of the falsified lower value in the consolidated packing lists. The respondent pocketed the difference between the higher amount of GST that he received from his buyers and the lower amount of GST that he had prepaid to his declaring agents. He committed the offences for his own personal gain as he was deep in debt from various loans that he had obtained from banks and from his family in Singapore and in China.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">4 The respondent pleaded guilty in the District Court to three charges of fraudulently evading GST under s 128D and punishable under s 128L(2) of the Customs Act. The charges were amalgamated charges under s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) and were framed to reflect the amounts of GST evaded in the years 2016, 2017 and 2019 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, approximately $182,000, $219,000 and $201,000 respectively). The total amount of GST evaded by the respondent (in relation to the three charges proceeded on) was thus around $600,000.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">5 The respondent admitted to six other similar offences and consented to having them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“the TIC charges”). The TIC charges were also amalgamated charges for the fraudulent evasion of GST under s 128D of the Customs Act and covered the period from October 2016 to January 2020.</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">6 The District Judge (“DJ”) sentenced the respondent to a fine of $1m (in default eight months’ imprisonment) for each of the three charges. The aggregate sentence was therefore a fine of $3m (in default 24 months’ imprisonment).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">7 The Prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed by the DJ on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate. The Prosecution proposed a sentencing framework for the offence under s 128D of the Customs Act, as well as for default imprisonment terms for fines imposed under s 128L(2) of the Customs Act. Applying these frameworks to the present case, the Prosecution submitted that the respondent should be sentenced to a total fine of $3.5m to $4m (in default 39 to 42 months’ imprisonment).</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">8 The respondent supported the adoption of sentencing frameworks but urged the court to apply any sentencing framework prospectively and not to the present appeal. The respondent contended that the sentence imposed by the DJ was not manifestly inadequate and therefore should not be disturbed.</div><div class="txt-body text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision</span></div><div class="txt-body text-left"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The sentencing framework for fraudulent evasion of GST under s 128D of the Customs Act</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">9 The court considered the Prosecution’s proposed framework to be a viable working model on which a sentencing framework for the offence under s 128D could be formulated. The court adopted the following three-step framework. At the first step, the court derives the indicative fine based on the amount of GST evaded, using the following framework (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">40</span>]):</div><table class="table table-sm d-flex justify-content-center table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(217,226,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Amount of GST evaded</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,226,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Multiplier applied to </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">each </span><span class="font-weight-bold">bracket</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,226,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Range of indicative fine</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$1 to $250</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 12</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$12 to $3,000</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$251 to $1,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 10</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$3,010 to $10,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$1,001 to $10,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 8</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$10,508 to $82,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$10,001 to $100,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 6</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$82,506 to $622,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$100,001 to $500,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 4</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$622,504 to $2,222,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$500,001 to $1m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 3</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$2,222,503 to $3,722,500</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">&gt;$1m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">× 2</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">&gt; $3,722,500</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">10 The multiplier values set out at each level of the framework would apply cumulatively, in the same way that income tax was computed in Singapore. For instance, where the amount of GST evaded was $10,000, the indicative fine would be (12 × $250) + (10 × $750) + (8 × $9,000) = $82,500. The cumulative method of computation would prevent an offender from getting a more lenient sentence simply because he crossed over into the next higher level on the scale. The decreasing rate in the multiplier would guard against the risk of disproportionately high fines as the amount of GST evaded increased: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">41</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">42</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">11 The framework above applies to first-time offenders who plead guilty at the earliest available opportunity and should be used to calculate the indicative fine based on the amount of GST evaded per charge, rather than the total amount of GST evaded across all the charges proceeded on: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">45</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">46</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">12 The second step is for the court to identify the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors before adjusting the indicative fine upwards or downwards accordingly. The court set out the following non-exhaustive list of factors (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">48</span>]):</div><table class="table table-sm d-flex justify-content-center table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(217,226,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Aggravating factors</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(a) Involvement of a syndicate</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(b) Involvement of a transnational element</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(c) Degree of planning and premeditation</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(d) Sophistication of the methods used to evade GST or to avoid detection</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(e) Evidence of a sustained period of offending</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(f) Offender’s role</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(g) Abuse of position and breach of trust (including a breach of professional responsibilities)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(h) Evidence of offender making a personal monetary gain</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(i) Offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(j) Relevant antecedents</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(k) Lack of remorse</div></td></tr><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(217,226,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Mitigating factors</span></div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(a) Voluntary restitution </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">(b) Cooperation with authorities</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">13 The court could adjust the indicative fine by making a lump sum adjustment or by modifying the applicable multiplier, which could include fractions (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, 4.5 times) if appropriate: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">52</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">14 The third and final step is for the court to consider whether further adjustments should be made on account of the totality principle. Especially where the offender is of limited financial means, it might be relevant to consider whether the overall fine quantum is just and appropriate: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">53</span>]. </div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The framework for default imprisonment terms under s 128L(2) of the Customs Act</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">15 The appropriate framework calibrates the default imprisonment term based on the fine imposed for each charge, rather than the total fine imposed for all the charges proceeded on. The latter approach would have the effect of treating multiple proceeded charges as a single amalgamated charge, thereby circumventing the provisions in the CPC on the amalgamation of charges: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">66</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">16 The court adopted the following framework for indicative default imprisonment terms (at [<span class="font-weight-bold">67</span>]):</div><table class="table table-sm d-flex justify-content-center table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(217,226,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Fine quantum imposed per charge</span></div></td><td style="background-color: rgb(217,226,243)"><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold">Indicative default sentence</span></div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Up to $500,000</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">Up to 6 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$500,000 to $1m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">6 to 12 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$1m to $2m </div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">12 to 24 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$2m to $3m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">24 to 36 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$3m to $5m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">36 to 48 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$5m to $10m</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">48 to 72 months</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">$10m and above</div></td><td><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 justify-content-center">72 months (statutory maximum)</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">17 Having determined the indicative default imprisonment term for each charge, the sentencing court in cases involving multiple charges should then consider whether the aggregate default imprisonment term offends the totality principle, bearing in mind that s 319(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)(v) of the CPC mandates that default imprisonment terms must run consecutively: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">68</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The present appeal</span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">18 The present case was not sufficiently exceptional to warrant invoking the doctrine of prospective overruling. It was not the respondent’s position that there was an entrenched starting point or sentencing norm in relation to offences under s 128D of the Customs Act or the corresponding default imprisonment terms. The sentencing frameworks adopted by the court did not constitute a fundamental and unforeseeable change in the law. There was therefore no serious and demonstrable injustice occasioned by applying the frameworks to the present appeal: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">72</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">19 Applying the frameworks set out to the present appeal, the fines imposed by the DJ were not manifestly inadequate. There was also no reason to disagree with the DJ’s analysis of the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. The court therefore affirmed the DJ’s decision on the fines imposed: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">74</span>] and [<span class="font-weight-bold">75</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">20 As for the default imprisonment term, it followed from the framework set out by the court that the indicative default imprisonment term was 12 months for each charge, or 36 months for the three charges. The total default imprisonment term of 24 months imposed by the DJ was therefore manifestly inadequate: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">76</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center">21 The High Court allowed the Prosecution’s appeal in part. The court ordered the fine of $1m for each charge imposed by the DJ to stand but increased the default imprisonment term to 12 months per charge (instead of eight months) or 36 months’ imprisonment in total: at [<span class="font-weight-bold">77</span>].</div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span class="font-italic">This summary is provided to assist in the understanding of the Court’s grounds of decision.
