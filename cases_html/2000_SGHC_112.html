<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The parties</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">1. The plaintiffs STL Machinery Pte Ltd

are the owners of 2 units of crawler cranes and 8 units of tower cranes which they wanted

to ship to Manila, Philippines to a company known as Singapino Corporation.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">2. The defendants Hai Leck Marine

Contractor Pte Ltd are a shipping company which arranges the shipment of cargo for their

customers.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">3. The plaintiffs enquired with several

shipping companies on the shipment of the cranes before narrowing their negotiations to

the defendants. Eventually a contract was entered between them on 29 July 1999.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">4. The terms of the agreement on which the

action turns relate to the terms on the cargo and freight. The former was described as

"2 x 35 ton Crawler Crane &amp; 8 x Tower Crane (as per your Packing List –

approx.1700 m<sup>3</sup>)." The latter was stated as "Lumpsum US$51,000/- Liner

Term (Door/Port)."</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The difficulties arising</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5. The cranes were transported from the

plaintiffs’ yard to the port by 3 August 1999. The plaintiffs prepared a packing list

dated 2 August for their internal records, giving the measurement of the cranes as

2,261.14 cubic metres.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6. The cranes were loaded on the vessel MV

Royal Progress on 6 August, upon which a bill of lading was issued naming Singapino

Corporation as the consignee.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7. After the vessel arrived at Manila on

14 August the defendants failed to release the cranes to the consignee because of a

dispute over the measurement of the cranes, and the defendants’ non-payment of the

freight to the shipowners.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8. The defendants had declared the

measurement of the cranes as 1400 cubic metres, whereas the master found it to be about

4000 cubic metres. The shipowners ceased discharging the cargo on 15 August and exercised

their lien on the approximately one-third of the cargo that was still on the vessel.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9. To resolve the impasse and to get

possession of the cranes, the consignee negotiated directly with the shipowners and

secured the release upon a payment of US$37,596.75. Subsequently they made a claim on the

plaintiffs for</font></p>

<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></i> 

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><i><font face="Times New Roman">The dispute over measurement</font></i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10. The defendants claimed that the

plaintiffs misrepresented the total volume of the cranes to be about 1400 cubic metres,

and that the volume was stated as 1700 cubic metres in the contract to give the plaintiffs

a margin of safety.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11. When they made their own measurement

before loading on 4 August they found the total volume to be approximately 3077 cubic

metres.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12. The defendants also relied on the

report of a survey carried out by surveyors appointed by the consignee in Manila, which

showed the volume as 3,323.23 cubic metres. The plaintiffs denied that they were guilty of

misrepresentation, and contended that freight was agreed on a lumpsum basis.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The dispute over the disclosure of the

consignee and the lease</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13. The plaintiffs asserted that they had

informed the defendants that the cranes were being leased to Singapino Corporation. The

defendants, on the other hand, alleged that they were not informed of the lease or the

identity of the consignee before the commencement of the legal proceedings.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14. The documents exhibited by the

plaintiffs contradicted the defendants’ denial of knowledge of the consignee. The

bill of lading for the shipment named Singapino Corporation as the consignee and a letter

from the plaintiffs to the defendants dated 19 August specifically referred to Singapino

Corporation as the consignee.</font></p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The plaintiffs’ claims</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15. The plaintiffs asserted that they had

paid the consignee the sums in items (ii), (iii) and (iv) in paragraph 9 and that they

were in the process of making payment of the sum under item (i). They also added a further

item for $3,258.78 which they claimed they had incurred on their own as administrative,

travelling and accommodation expenses arising out of the delayed release of the cranes.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16. They claimed against the defendants

(i) a declaration that they were entitled to be indemnified by the defendants against

their liability to the consignee, (ii) an indemnity in the sum of $301,476.43 (the full

amount claimed by the consignee), (iii) damages in the sum of $3,258.78, or alternatively

damages to be assessed, (iv) interest and (v) costs.</font></p>

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The Assistant Registrar’s decision</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17. The plaintiffs applied for summary

judgment on their action. This came on for hearing before an Assistant Registrar. After

hearing counsel the Assistant Registrar gave judgment to the plaintiffs in terms of

prayers (i) to (v) of the plaintiffs’ claims without specifying whether the damages

were fixed at $3,258.78 or were to be assessed.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18. The defendants appealed against the

whole of the Assistant Registrar’s judgment.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The issues raised before me</font></p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">19. In the appeal counsel for the

defendants submitted that</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Defendants’ case is that (i) <i>Plaintiffs

  misrepresented the volume of cargo</i> to the Defendants prior to the execution of the

  contract, and that relying on the volume as represented by Plaintiffs, Defendants informed

  the carrier/shipowner of that volume. Upon discharge, (ii) <i>the carrier</i> discovered

  that the true volume was much greater than that told to them and <i>exercised a lien on

  the cargo</i>. (iii) <i>The Plaintiffs were also</i> <i>late in their payment of freight</i>.

  (Emphasis and numbering added)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">Examination of the issues raised</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">20. There were three issues raised –

misrepresentation, lien and late payment of freight.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">21. On the issue of misrepresentation, the

defendants claim to have discovered the misrepresentation before the cranes were loaded.

They did not rescind the contract, and continued with it. In these circumstances, even if

there was a misrepresentation, the contract continued to subsist and the defendants were

bound by their covenant to discharge the cranes to the consignee.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">22. On the lien issue, the shipowner had

exercised its lien because no freight payments were made to them. The defendants had

misstated that the lien was exercised for non-payment of the excess freight payable on the

excess volume. The defendants’ reliance on the lien was unfounded because it was

their duty to pay freight to he shipowner. While the lien resulted in their inability to

release the cranes to the consignee, it did not displace their obligation to release the

cranes or excuse the non-compliance.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">23. On the late payment of freight, while

it was not disputed that the plaintiffs were late when they tendered the freight payment

to the defendants, the defendants loaded and shipped the cranes and accepted the late

payment. In these circumstances, the late payment did not justify their failure to release

the cranes.</font></p>
<p xmlns=""><i> </i></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">My decision</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">24. The defences raised did not excuse the

defendants from their obligation to deliver the cargo to the consignee, and the plaintiffs

are entitled to redress.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">25. The plaintiffs are entitled to the

indemnity they sought. What they can recover under the indemnity, however, must be proved.

Similarly, while the plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages for losses incurred by

them, the losses must be proved. I therefore varied the Assistant Registrar’s orders

so that the amount recoverable under the indemnity and the damages recoverable are to be

assessed, and I also made it clear that the orders shall not prevent the defendants from

taking out a separate action against the plaintiffs on the alleged misrepresentation on

the measurement of the cargo, or for additional freight.</font></p>
