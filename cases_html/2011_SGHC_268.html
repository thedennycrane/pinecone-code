        Yeong Zee Kin, Senior Assistant Registrar:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is Main-Line Corporate Holdings
                    Limited (Main-Line) who is the registered proprietor of Singapore Patent No
                    86037, entitled “Dynamic Currency Conversion for Card Payment
                    Systems”. This patent covers the method and system for automatic
                    detection of the country of issue of a credit card, charge card or debit card
                    (hereinafter referred to collectively as “credit card”),
                    converting the value of a credit card transaction from the currency of the
                    country where the point of sale (POS) system is located (the “local
                    currency”) to the currency of the credit card’s country of issue
                    (the “home currency”) and presenting both values at the POS to the
                    card holder for his selection of the currency in which he wishes to make payment
                    for the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first defendant, United Overseas Bank
                    Limited (UOB) is a major local bank which provided a system similar to
                    Main-Line’s system to merchants in its credit card network. The system
                    provided by UOB was obtained from the second defendant, First Currency Choice
                    Pte Ltd (FCC), which was in the business of providing similar dynamic currency
                    conversion payment services.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Procedural history</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Since its commencement in 2004, this case has
                    generated a string of decisions as it meandered through the court system. The
                    decisions marked significant steps in the procedural history of this case and a
                    summary of these decisions is necessary to provide the factual backdrop for the
                    current set of interlocutory applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       
          <em>Main-Line Corporate Holdings
                        Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd and another (First Currency Choice Pte Ltd,
                        third party)</em> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 1021;
                    [2006] SGHC 233 is the decision of Tay Yong Kwang J after the trial on
                    liability. The defendants’ challenge to the validity of the
                    Main-Line’s software patent failed. UOB was found to have infringed
                    Main-Line’s software patent when it used the dynamic currency conversion
                    system provided by FCC and offered FCC’s system to the merchants in its
                    credit card network. FCC was found liable for using its infringing system and
                    offering it to UOB. Having found liability, Tay J ordered that an
                    assessment of damages or an account of profit should be conducted after
                    Main-Line has made its election on which of these remedies it wished to pursue
                    against the defendants. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld Tay J’s
                    decision: <em>First Currency Choice Pte Ltd v Main-Line Corporate
                        Holdings Ltd and another appeal</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 335;
                    [2007] SGCA 50.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Having succeeded in establishing liability,
                    Main-Line sought discovery of documents from the defendants in order to make its
                    election: <em>Main-Line Corporate Holdings Ltd v United Overseas
                        Bank Ltd and Another</em> [2008] SGHC 55. After reviewing
                    the documents disclosed, Main-Line elected different remedies against each of
                    the defendants: against UOB, it elected to proceed for an account of profits,
                    while it elected for an assessment of damages against FCC. The defendants
                    challenged Main-Line’s election of different remedies against each
                    defendant. This challenge failed. Belinda Ang J held that the remedies which
                    Main-Line was entitled to were cumulative as each of the defendants were liable
                    for different acts of infringement: <em>Main-Line Corporate
                        Holdings Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd and another (First Currency Choice
                        Pte Ltd, third party)</em> [2010] 1 SLR 189;
                    [2009] SGHC 232. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld Belinda Ang
                    J’s decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       Main-Line then proceeded with an application for
                    interim payment against UOB. An order for interim payment into court was made by
                    the assistant registrar. This order was set aside on appeal on the basis that it
                    was not clear that the quantum sought for interim payment was an amount below
                    which an account of profit would not go: <em>Main-Line Corporate
                        Holdings Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd and Another</em>
                    [2009] SGHC 212. On further appeal to the Court of Appeal, Chao Hick
                    Tin JA felt that it would unduly prejudice Main-Line if interim payment was not
                    ordered solely because UOB was not able to ascertain its costs incurred in
                    earning its commission. UOB had disclosed that it earned commissions amounting
                    to $3.1 million. Although it did not keep track of the actual costs incurred in
                    earning this commission, it was able to provide an estimate of the profits at
                    $1.9 million using income/expense ratios during the discovery application in
                    order to enable Main-Line to make its election. Chao JA felt that the burden
                    laid with UOB to offer an alternative basis of determining the quantum for
                    interim payment if it did not agree with the use of the income/expense ratios.
                    Since it was not able to do so, interim payment of $1.9 million was ordered to
                    be paid to Main-Line: <em>Main-Line Corporate Holdings Ltd v
                        United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR 986;
                    [2010] SGCA 9.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       During the course of 2009 and 2010, Main-Line
                    and the defendants commenced discovery for the post-liability stage of the
                    proceedings. Multiple discovery and interrogatory applications were fought.
                    However, as the pleadings filed by parties for the trial on liability contained
                    scant particulars in relation to the post-liability stage of the proceedings
                    – there were simply bare claims for assessment of damages or an account of
                    profits, and equally bald denials – parties had difficulties ascertaining
                    the scope of discovery and interrogatories. This no doubt contributed to the
                    multiple attempts by Main-Line for further discovery and interrogatories.
                    Eventually, parties were directed to file pleadings for this post-liability
                    stage of the proceedings in order to ascertain each party’s position in
                    relation to the remedies sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Parties’ positions crystallised
                    sufficiently after pleadings for the post-liability stage of the proceedings had
                    been filed. Thereafter, the following applications were filed:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_a"></a>(a)     Summons No 978 of 2011 is FCC’s
                        application to strike out certain paragraphs of Main-Line’s statement
                        of case against FCC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_b"></a>(b)     Summons No 1232 of 2011 is UOB’s application to strike out
                        certain paragraphs of Main-Line’s statement of case against
                        UOB;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_c"></a>(c)     Summons No
                        1679 of 2011 is Main-Line’s application for further and better
                        particulars on certain paragraphs of FCC’s statement of defence;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_8-p2_d"></a>(d)     Summons No
                        1680 of 2011 is Main-Line’s application for further and better
                        particulars on certain paragraphs of UOB’s statement of
                        defence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Before me, submissions also encompassed two
                    earlier applications which had been filed before pleadings for this
                    post-liability stage of the proceedings had been ordered:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_a"></a>(a)     Summons No 3805 of 2010, which was
                        UOB’s application for determination of preliminary issue of what
                        amounts to “profits”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_9-p2_b"></a>(b)     Summons No 3879 of 2010, which was
                        Mainline’s application under Order 43 of the Rules of Court for an
                        account to be drawn up by UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     In the course of arguments, it was agreed that
                    the applications in Summons No 1679 and 1680 of 2011 for further and better
                    particulars be deferred until after the more fundamental issues (as against UOB)
                    of what is accountable as profits is resolved and (as against FCC) the heads of
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues arising from the account of profits against UOB</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In this part of these grounds, I deal with
                    issues that relate to the account of profits claimed against UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The flow of funds in cross-border multi-currency credit card
                transactions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The workings of the software patent that is
                    central in this matter has been detailed in prior decisions. The flow of funds
                    in a cross-border multi-currency credit card transaction, however, has to be
                    understood in order to proceed with an account of any profits derived from the
                    infringing acts. There is no dispute between parties about how a cross-border
                    multi-currency credit card transaction is carried out, although different labels
                    and characterisation of the economic effects of the flow of funds were employed
                    by parties. It is therefore possible to provide a summary of a typical
                    cross-border multi-currency credit card transaction as follows. First, the
                    following roles are typically involved:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_a"></a>(a)     The local
                    merchant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_b"></a>(b)     The
                        acquiring bank (in our case, UOB);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_c"></a>(c)     The card scheme (without going into details, this is the
                        umbrella global organisation that, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        assists in the settlement of cross-border multi-currency credit card
                        transactions);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_e"></a>(e)     The issuing bank; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_12-p2_f"></a>(f)     The foreign credit card holder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In order to understand how funds flow, we must
                    start first with a traditional cross-border credit card transaction. The foreign
                    credit card holder presents his credit card to the local merchant. The
                    transaction details are in Singapore currency. Once approved, this transaction
                    is submitted by the local merchant to the acquiring bank, eg UOB. The acquiring
                    bank will settle with the local merchant by paying it an amount that is
                    calculated by deducting the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) of 1.2% from the
                    transaction amount. This is settled in Singapore currency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The acquiring bank than submits the full
                    transaction value to the card scheme. The card scheme will settle the
                    transaction with the issuing bank in the home currency of the foreign credit
                    card. In this settlement, a 3% Uplift is applied to the transaction value in the
                    home currency of the foreign credit card. This is the amount that the foreign
                    card holder will have to pay to the issuing bank after he reaches
                home.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     With the acquiring bank (eg UOB), the card
                    scheme will settle in Singapore currency. The acquiring bank will be paid an
                    amount that is calculated by deducting the Interchange Reimbursement Rate (IRF)
                    of 0.8% from the transaction amount. As can be seen, all settlements in
                    Singapore are in the local currency, and the acquiring bank (eg UOB) earns 0.4%
                    from the transaction, being the difference between the IRF and
                MDR.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">How the FCC system works in cross-border multi-currency credit card
                transactions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The FCC system introduces another party to the
                    mix. Hence, for the FCC system, the following roles are involved:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>The local merchant;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     UOB, as acquiring bank;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_c"></a>(c)     FCC;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_d"></a>(d)     The card scheme;</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The issuing bank;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The foreign credit card holder.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     When the foreign credit card holder presents
                    his credit card in order to make payment, the POS system at the local merchant
                    will offer him a choice of paying in either the local (ie Singapore) currency or
                    in his home currency. In automatically detecting the home currency based on the
                    credit card presented at the POS sytem, and presenting the transaction value in
                    both local and home currencies, the FCC system was found to have infringed
                    Mainline’s software patent. If the foreign card holder chooses to make
                    payment in the local currency, the transaction will proceed in the usual manner
                    (as described in the preceding paragraphs).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     If the foreign credit card holder chooses to
                    make payment in the home currency of the foreign credit card (we will refer to
                    this as “a converted transaction”), the following takes place. The
                    transaction is denominated in the home currency of the foreign credit card when
                    it is submitted to UOB. The Uplift of 3% to the transaction value is applied and
                    the uplifted amount in the home currency of the foreign credit card is presented
                    to the foreign credit card holder at the POS system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     UOB will submit this uplifted amount, again in
                    the home currency of the foreign credit card, to both the card scheme and FCC.
                    FCC will convert the original transaction amount (ie less the Uplift) into the
                    local (ie Singapore) currency and deduct the MDR of 1.2%, and it will then
                    inform UOB what this value is in local (ie Singapore) currency. UOB will pay
                    this amount to the merchant in local (ie Singapore) currency.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The card scheme will settle with UOB by paying
                    it the uplifted amount, less IRF of 0.8% calculated based on the uplifted
                    amount. This is settled in the home currency of the foreign credit card. UOB
                    then tops up the IRF and pays the uplifted transaction value to FCC in the home
                    currency of the foreign credit card. In return, FCC converts the original
                    transaction value into local (ie Singapore) currency and pays this to
                    UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Hence, UOB continues to earn its 0.4% (being
                    the difference between the MDR and IRF), albeit that it would have topped up the
                    IRF in a home currency of the foreign credit card. Apart from this, UOB also
                    earns a commission of about 0.45–0.65% in accordance with the scale of
                    commission set out in the Multicurrency Exchange Agreement between UOB and
                    FCC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In summary, the FCC system essentially
                    converts a credit card transaction made in Singapore into one made in the home
                    currency of the foreign credit card. In doing so, the Uplift in a converted
                    transaction is effectively shifted to Singapore and earned by FCC, instead of
                    the usual case where the Uplift is earned in the home country of the foreign
                    credit card by the issuing bank. Further, the FCC system also shifts the foreign
                    exchange risks to FCC. FCC earns the Uplift and in return, UOB earns a
                    commission. UOB continues to keep its traditional share of the difference
                    between the MDR and IRF.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">What is accountable as profits?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Mainline seeks for an account of profits
                    against UOB. From a survey of the cases placed before me, it appears to me that
                    the approach of the courts in taking an account of profits is abundantly clear.
                    In an account of profits, the courts are concerned with the profits actually
                    made by the infringer which is derived from the infringement. The premise of
                    this remedy is the disgorgement of benefits which the infringer ought not
                    retain: see <em>Dart Industries Inc v Decor Corp Pty Ltd and
                        Another</em> 116 ALR 385, at p 387 –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">An account of profits was a form of relief granted by equity whereas
                        damages were originally a purely common law remedy. ... [E]ven now, an
                        account of profits retains its equitable characteristics in that a defendant
                        is made to account for, and is then stripped of, profits which it has
                        dishonestly made by the infringement and which it would be unconscionable
                        for it to retain. An account of profits is confined to profits actually
                        made, its purpose being not to punish the defendant but to prevent its
                        unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Hence, “the maximum payment which can
                    be ordered is the total profit made by the defendant”: <em>per</em> Laddie J in <em>Celanese International Corp v
                        BP Chemicals Ltd</em> [1999] RPC 203, at [36]. It has also been observed (albeit in the context of a
                    contractual right to an account of profits) that an order for an account of
                    profits will not be made where it appears that no profits have been made:
                        <em>Friss &amp; Anor v Casetech Trading Pte Ltd &amp;
                        Ors</em> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 511, at [39].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The amount accountable as profits may be
                    reduced in two ways. First, deductions of costs and expenses (ie outgoings) from
                    receipts (or revenue) are allowed in arriving at the quantum accountable as
                    profits. This approach was adopted by the Court of Appeal in its decision on
                    interim payment where it took into account the apportioned indirect costs (in
                    the form of income/expense ratios) in arriving at its decision of the quantum of
                    interim payment to be made: see <em>Main-Line Corporate Holdings
                        Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR 986;
                    [2010] SGCA 9, at [22]
                    –</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it could not be disputed that revenue, in the form of
                        commissions, was earned by UOB from the operation of the FCC System. The
                        uncertainty related to the expenses which ought to be deducted from that
                        revenue for the purposes of ascertaining the net profit made by UOB.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Outgoings may take the form of direct costs
                    and expenses or they may take the form of indirect costs and expenses (eg
                    overheads). For indirect costs and expenses, the court will have to determine
                    which of such items are attributable to the infringing acts and the proportion
                    which ought to be allowed: see <em>Dart Industries Inc v Decor
                        Corporation Pty Ltd and Another</em>. For example, in the Court of
                    Appeal’s decision in this case on interim payment, it took into account
                    attributable indirect costs and expenses in the form of income/expense ratios
                    provided by UOB: see <em>Main-Line Corporate Holdings Ltd v
                        United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> [2010] 2 SLR 986;
                    [2010] SGCA 9, at [24] &amp;
                        [26].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The second way in which the quantum
                    accountable as profits may be reduced is by an apportionment of profits. Where
                    profits are generated by a chain of activities and the infringing acts occupy a
                    part this chain, the patent owner is not entitled to the entire profits but only
                    to a portion of the profits attributable to the infringement. “Hence,
                    once it is conceded or proved that an apportionment is appropriate, the course
                        [<em>sic</em>] must do its best to split the profits
                    between infringing and non-infringing parts”: <em>per</em> Laddie J in <em>Celanese International Corp v
                        BP Chemicals Ltd</em> [1999] RPC 203, at [48].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The question that arises then is what are the
                    receipts and outgoings in the FCC system. In order to answer this question, I
                    found it useful to look at the flow of funds from the perspective of UOB, the
                    party from whom an account is required. For a converted transaction, the
                    receipts would be as the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     From the card scheme, the uplifted
                        value less IRF in the home currency of the foreign credit
                    card;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     From
                        FCC,</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       The transaction value in
                            the local (ie Singapore) currency; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_28-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       The commission of in accordance to
                            the Multicurrency Exchange Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The outgoings would be the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     To the merchant, the transaction
                        value less MDR in the local (ie Singapore) currency;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     To FCC, the uplifted amount in the
                        home currency of the foreign credit card;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     Direct costs and expenses which UOB incurred in
                        using the FCC system; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_d"></a>(d)     Indirect costs and expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     It is therefore possible for me to deal with
                    the related summonses in Summons 3805 and 3876 of 2010, and Summons 1232 of 2011
                    together. Summons 3805 of 2010 was filed before pleadings were ordered and it
                    sought to determine the preliminary issue of the scope of profits which is
                    accountable. After pleadings were filed, Summons 1232 of 2011 was filed which
                    basically re-cast the same issues in the framework of a striking out
                    application. Summons 3876 of 2010 is an application seeking directions for the
                    drawing up of a set of accounts from which the quantum accountable as profits
                    may be determined.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     During submissions, it was argued by UOB that
                    the only accountable profit was the commission. Attempts were made to show that
                    the rest of the flow of funds was accounted for. As noted in the summary of how
                    the FCC system works, the flow of funds took place in different currencies,
                    unlike a typical cross-border transaction which did not make use of the FCC
                    system (which I shall refer to as an unconverted transaction). In an unconverted
                    transaction, the receipts and outgoings were all settled in the local (ie
                    Singapore) currency. This made it possible to net off matching receipts and
                    outgoing flows of funds.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     For converted transactions, I do not think
                    that this is possible for various reasons. First, receipts and outgoings were
                    made in different currencies. Second, receipts and outgoings took place on
                    different days. To my mind, I do not think that it is possible to ignore the
                    daily fluctuations of exchange rates, especially given the potentially large
                    amounts involved. No expert evidence had been proffered at this stage to provide
                    a basis to support the argument that it is acceptable accounting practice to net
                    off matching receipts and outgoings <em>notwithstanding that they
                        are in different currencies and they take place at different
                        times</em>. However, I would not at this point make any firm
                    determination that netting off of matching receipts and outgoings cannot be made
                    in this case. If UOB is able to provide a method of netting off matching
                    receipts and outgoings, taking into account the differences in time, currencies
                    and foreign currency exchange rates, and which accords with acceptable
                    accounting practice, I am prepared to entertain submissions. This can be dealt
                    with when they draw up the accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I turn now to the specifics of the striking
                    out application. There were three main heads of claim for accounting that UOB
                    applied to strike out: (a) Uplift, (b) variance and (c) MDR from new and
                    retained merchants attributable to the FCC system. For the Uplift, I think that
                    the position is clear based on the reasons set out in the preceding paragraphs.
                    The portions of the statement of case are to stand as the Uplift is accountable
                    as part of the receipts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     There was also a claim for variance which is
                    one of the subject matter of the striking out application. UOB had proffered the
                    explanation that this head of claim probably arose from Mainline’s
                    mis-reading of certain passages in affidavits filed by UOB. After clarification
                    of the facts, Mainline had, in oral arguments, all but abandoned this head of
                    claim for accounting. Hence, I ordered that this head of claim for accounting be
                    struck off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Finally, Mainline had also made a claim for
                    profits arising from MDR earned from new merchants and existing merchants who
                    were retained by virtue of the multicurrency exchange facility provided through
                    the FCC system. This head of claim should be allowed to stand. However, the
                    ambit is restricted to an accounting of the profits which are derived from
                    infringement. In other words, MDR that were earned from unconverted transactions
                    cannot be claimed. Further, the mere offer of the FCC system for use would not,
                    to my mind, result in any profits. Even if new merchants were recruited or
                    existing merchants retained, no profits, <em>which are
                        accountable by reason of infringement</em>, will arise until the
                    merchant uses the FCC system. Offering for use may be an infringing activity
                    giving rise to damages, but we are now concerned with ascertaining what profits
                    were derived from the activity. The position may be different had damages been
                    sought from UOB. Be that as it may, this head of claim is allowed to stand as it
                    falls within the scope of accounting that has been ordered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     I now turn to summons 3876 of 2010. This is
                    Mainline’s application for an account to be drawn up by UOB. The overall
                    scope of the account must fall within the scope of liability established in Tay
                    Yong Kwang J’s judgment on liability as upheld in the Court of Appeal.
                    Hence, only converted transactions will come within the scope of the accounts to
                    be drawn up by UOB. The time period is from the date on which UOB had knowledge
                    of the infringement until the date when UOB stopped using the FCC system. The
                    ambit of receipts and outgoings which should be drawn up have been set out in
                    paragraphs 28 and 29 above, subject to confirmation as to whether it is
                    acceptable accounting practice to net off matching receipts and outgoings which
                    take place in different currencies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Lastly, an issue was raised as to whether the
                    accountable profits may be apportioned. The argument was that since only a
                    certain part of FCC’s system is infringing, not all profits from converted
                    transactions are accountable. Hence, counsel for defendants wished to reserve
                    the right to make submissions on this point at the accounting of profits
                    hearing. I had noted that apportionment is one of two ways in which the quantum
                    accountable as profits may be reduced. As the issue of apportionment was not
                    fully argued before me, this reservation was duly noted. At the accounting of
                    profits hearing, submissions may be made on whether there can be apportionment
                    and, if possible, the appropriate basis for apportionment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     UOB was directed to lodge its account once it
                    has been drawn up in accordance to the order made above; and the account has to
                    be duly verified by affidavit. Mainline and FCC will thereafter file notices of
                    objections to specific items in the accounts or omissions from the accounts.
                    These will be duly supported by affidavits. Thereafter, further directions will
                    be given for the accounting of profits hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Infringing use outside jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In this final part, I deal with issues
                    relating to the claim for damages against FCC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Mainline’s claim against FCC is for
                    damages arising from the infringement, and not for an account of profits. FCC
                    had applied to strike out Mainline’s claim for infringing use of the FCC
                    system outside Singapore. After considering further submissions, I allowed the
                    application and ordered that this head of damage be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Mainline’s attempt to expand the scope
                    of the judgment on liability is mischievous. I adopt fully the submissions made
                    by counsel for defendants. In essence, the ambit of damages to be assessed in
                    this post-liability stage of the proceedings is determined by the scope of
                    infringement determined during the trial on liability. The trial judge cannot at
                    law give judgment for matters not pleaded. Claims for infringing use outside
                    jurisdiction, in particular by a bank in Thailand, is nowhere to be found in
                    Mainline’s pleadings for the trial on liability. Neither the issue of use
                    by foreign banks nor the offer for use by FCC to foreign banks was raised at the
                    trial on liability. Based on the evidence adduced at the trial, liability (as
                    against FCC) that was established is limited to the use by FCC and offer for use
                    by FCC to UOB.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There is also the doctrine of merger under
                    which FCC’s cause of action has merged with the judgment on liability. At
                    this post-liability stage of the proceedings, I cannot exceed the four corners
                    of the order on liability made by the trial court. Hence, I ordered that this
                    head of damage be struck out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Aggravated or exemplary damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Finally, FCC also applied to strike out the
                    head of claim for aggravated or exemplary damages. For the purpose of deciding
                    this interlocutory application, I do not think that I need to recite in detail
                    the arguments put forth by both sides. I summarise the gist of the arguments
                    that each side has put forward.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Mainline’s claim for aggravated or
                    exemplary damages – as pleaded in its Statement of Case against FCC
                    – is based on the nature, gravity, mode and extent of FCC’s
                    infringing conduct. The strongest basis for Mainline’s claim, as I see it,
                    appears to be based on a passage from <em>Terrell on the Law of
                        Patents</em> (17<sup>th</sup> Edition), where it was
                    noted, at 19–58, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t has been held that a claim for exemplary damages is not
                        available to a claimant. However this decision may no longer be good law
                        having regard to the subsequent decision of the House of Lords in <em>Kuddas v Chief Constable of Leicsetershire</em> [2002]
                        2 AC 122 (overruling <em>AB v South West Water
                            Services</em> [1993] QB 507). Thus exemplary damages may
                        be available in a patent infringement action where the case falls within one
                        of the three categories referred to by Lord Devlin in <em>Rookes v Barnard</em>, namely: (1) Oppressive, arbitrary or
                        unconstitutional actions by the servants of government, (2) <em>Where the defendant’s conduct has been calculated by him
                            to make a profit for himself which may well exceed the compensation
                            payable to the plaintiff</em>, or (3) Where a statute expressly
                        authorises the same. [Emphasis mine.]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Mainline had sought an account of profits from
                    UOB and damages from UOB. From the preceding account of how the FCC system
                    works, it is evident that the larger share of the profits may well reside with
                    FCC, and not UOB. Hence, the quantum of damages which Mainline may eventually
                    recover may not be as significant as it had originally envisaged, when it made
                    the election of remedies. It is therefore not inconceivable that Mainline is now
                    seeking to make out the argument that falls within the second category
                    identified in <em>Terrell</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     FCC, argues against this on the basis of
                        <em>Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd (No
                        2)</em> [1983] FSR 512, which is the same case cited by the authors of
                        <em>Terrell</em> to have held that claims for exemplary
                    damages were not available to claimants in patent actions. FCC argues that since
                        <em>Catnic</em> was decided after the 1964 case of
                        <em>Rookes v Barnard</em> – on which the authors
                    of <em>Terrell</em> depend for their classification of when
                    exemplary damages may be awarded – exemplary damages are not available for
                    patent infringement. Further, FCC argues that there is no room for a common law
                    right to exemplary damages under the Patent Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The authors of <em>Terrell</em> considered both <em>Catnic</em> and
                        <em>Kuddus</em> in the passage cited above. Without
                    expressing any views on this issue, I am not convinced that Mainline’s
                    claim for aggravated or exemplary should be struck out at this stage. On
                    balance, I see this to be a legal issue which ought properly to be ruled on at
                    the accounting of profits hearing, after the relevant facts have been
                    established and full arguments on the law. Therefore, I did not think that this
                    head of damage should be struck out and accordingly, I dismissed this
                    prayer.</p>
