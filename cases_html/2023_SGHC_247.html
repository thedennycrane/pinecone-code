Yet the issue of corruption was a straw man—parliamentary opposition members never complained about it. The primary problems were around conflicts of interest and possible breaches of the Code of Conduct for Ministers (Code). Among other conflicts, it has emerged that Teo Chee Hean, senior minister, was both the informed and investigating officer. He should have “recused himself from the [ministerial] review, much less lead it,” as Harpreet Singh, a senior counsel, argued in a Jom editorial last week. The potential breach of the Code involved Shanmugam, whose ministry oversees the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), the agency that rents out the properties.

Teo’s pithy reply: “...it is more important to observe the spirit rather than just the letter of the Codes.” Ownself check ownself wins again. In Parliament, Balakrishnan and Shanmugam cried about the sacrifices they made moving into apparently decrepit bungalows. Stories of termites and financial losses, respectively, merited a sandiwara soundtrack. The bare facts are shocking, including over S$1m of taxpayer money spent on renovation works. Balakrishnan’s bungalow is almost 9,000 sq ft gross floor area on a property of almost 100,000 sq ft, equivalent to well over a football field. He claimed he needed so much space to accommodate three generations of family—he must pity the many Singaporeans who do so in tiny flats. Shanmugam’s property is about 250,000 sq ft, larger than three football fields, with a monthly rental of S$26,500—just over 10 cents per square foot. SLA in May said that Shanmugam had bid above the “guide rent” but has since changed its story: Shanmugam, through his agent, apparently offered below the guide rent, and SLA counter-offered with the exact guide rent, not a cent more, suggesting that the Singaporean coffers are represented by the most inept housing agent in history.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 The false subject statement identified from the Renovation Material (the “Renovation Subject Statement”) reads:

In the post, Yeo, who’s currently seeking political asylum in the UK, had alluded to crony capitalism in Singapore. He said that Livspace, whose regional head is Ravindran Shanmugam, son of K Shanmugam, may have benefited from involvement in renovation works at 26 Ridout Road (where his father lives). This claim generated enough controversy, including on forums such as Reddit and Hardwarezone (owned by SPH Media), that the elder Shanmugam was forced to debunk it in Parliament last week. What’s curious is that the government has not issued any correction order, as it so often does, under The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (POFMA)—neither to Yeo nor to Kenneth Jeyaretnam, RP chief, who repeated the allegation on his blog. A correction order would have offered more transparency than a block, which is nefarious in its opacity. Instagram’s blocking notice said it “…complied with a legal request to restrict this content.” We don’t know if this request came from Shanmugam. What we do know is that Meta sometimes works hand-in-glove with autocratic governments in the region. “Meta reportedly maintains an internal list of Vietnamese Communist Party officials who should not be criticised on Facebook,” Alan Soon, co-founder of Splice Media, a consultancy, recently wrote, referencing a Washington Post article, which said the list was shaped by Vietnamese apparatchiks. “Posts criticising top officials have been taken down…” There’s no evidence that Meta has any similar arrangement with Singapore’s ruling People’s Action Party (PAP), whose leaders are regularly criticised on Facebook and Instagram. In response to a Jom query, Meta said that after careful review of a court order it received—in a similar process it conducts in every country—it determined it was legally required to restrict access to that bit of content. Still, this incident raises worrying questions about speech, censorship tools, and the rules of engagement in online discourse, particularly given inherent power dynamics (PAP politicians are far less likely to be penalised for potential falsehoods, as evidenced here). All this is particularly relevant ahead of a crucial general election, which must be called by 2025.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Second CD identified the following subject statement as false (the “Geo-block Subject Statement”): “[t]he Government caused Instagram to geo-block a post by Charles Yeo”.

The second step is set out in greater detail at (b) as it is of particular relevance to the present case.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court must ascertain the meaning the Minister intended to convey in the subject statement stated in the Part 3 Direction:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">TOC </span>at [118]–[133] and [163(a)].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the court should objectively determine whether the subject material actually makes or contains the subject statement as identified by the Minister, based on the Minister’s intended meaning from the first step. A fine-grained or overly technical analysis should be avoided. Instead, the court should consider whether, on an objective construction of the subject material, regardless of the subjective intention of the statement-maker, there would be at least an appreciable segment of the potential readership or audience of the subject material in Singapore or a particular class of potential readers sharing certain clearly identifiable characteristics such as socio-political beliefs or ideals who would construe the subject material as making or containing the subject statement, or regard the subject statement as a reasonable interpretation of the subject material. In this connection, the court must ensure that statements that will only be construed as false by an insignificant segment of the public or class of persons are not culled from public discourse. If the subject material did not make or contain the subject statement identified in the Part 3 Direction, the Direction could be set aside under s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POFMA:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">TOC</span> at [136], [150]–[152], [154], [156] and [163(b)].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, the court should objectively evaluate whether the identified subject statement falls under the definition of a “statement of fact” as per the POFMA:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">TOC</span> at [158] and [163(c)]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fourth, the court should determine, on an objective basis, whether the identified subject statement is “false” in the sense explained in s 2(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA:<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">TOC</span> at [159] and [163(d)].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Fifth, the court should consider whether the subject statement has been or is being communicated in Singapore, being accessible to at least one end-user in Singapore through the internet: <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> at [161] and [163(e)].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Further, the legal burden in appeals to set aside Part 3 Directions under ss 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and/or 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the POFMA lay from the outset on the recipient of the Direction being challenged. The recipient of the Direction had to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>case of reasonable suspicion that one or more of the grounds for setting aside the Direction under ss 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and/or 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) was satisfied by putting forward some material which might, on further consideration, turn out to be an arguable case in favour of setting aside. If the recipient of the Direction could not establish this, its application would fail at the threshold stage. Conversely, if this threshold was crossed, the evidential burden would then shift to the Minister to show that none of the grounds for setting aside under ss 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and/or 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) were made out. The final determination would be made by the court based on the totality of the evidence adduced by the parties, applying the standard of proof on the balance of probabilities: <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> at [180]–[184].</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Arguments and issues in the appeals</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 It is common ground that the five stages of the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> framework apply, and the parties do not dispute the Ministers’ intended meanings as set out in the three subject statements.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The AG argues that there is no requirement for the Minister to positively identify a particular segment or class of potential readers of the publication. This was made clear by the Court of Appeal’s approach at [211] of <span class="font-italic">TOC</span>, where the sentence “local PMET retrenchment has been increasing” was interpreted from the perspective of the “ordinary reasonable reader”. The AG’s position is that ordinary individuals with no particular inclination would have thought that the three subject statements were reasonable interpretations of the relevant parts of the article. The AG also submits that if there is to be a particular class of potential readers with “clearly identifiable characteristics” such as “socio-political beliefs or ideals” (as envisaged by <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> at [136]), the class should be defined as those with similar political inclinations as <span class="font-italic">Jom</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, possessing a critical attitude towards the Singapore Government. This is because the other <span class="font-italic">Jom</span> articles exhibited are somewhat critical of the Singapore Government.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 For ease of reference, I set out [136] of <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> in full: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">For the reasons that we develop below, as in the case of ascertaining the Minister’s intended meaning in respect of the subject statement identified in a Part 3 Direction, an objective approach to interpretation ought similarly to be adopted in determining whether the subject material makes or contains the identified subject statement. This is essentially because, as the AG has highlighted, the POFMA is primarily concerned with the <span class="font-italic">effect</span> that the subject material has <span class="font-italic">on the public</span>, and not with the meaning that the statement-maker subjectively intended to place on the subject material (referred to hereafter as “the statement-maker’s subjective intended meaning” where appropriate to the context). This is in line with the passages we have already cited from the legislative material. In undertaking this interpretive exercise, the court should eschew a fine-grained or unduly technical analysis and consider <span class="font-italic">whether, on an objective construction of the subject material regardless of the subjective intention of the statement-maker, there would be at least an appreciable segment of the potential readership or audience of the subject material in Singapore, or a particular class of potential readers sharing certain clearly identifiable characteristics such as socio-political beliefs or ideals (referred to hereafter as a “particular class”), who would construe the subject material as making or containing the subject statement, or regard the subject statement as a reasonable interpretation of the subject material.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Reading [136] in its entirety, the Court of Appeal was reiterating that the POFMA is primarily concerned with the effect of the subject material on the public. In elaborating an objective construction, the Court referred to two options. The first is a reading that would be adopted by “<span class="font-italic">at least</span>” an appreciable segment of the potential audience. The segment is referred to in the context of an objective standard of reasonableness, which is reflected in the accompanying guidance of the Court of Appeal that the interpretive exercise is an objective one undertaken by the court, and the subjective intention of the statement-maker is generally irrelevant. Framing a second option with a disjunctive “or”, the Court left open the alternative of defining a particular class of potential readers with clearly identifiable characteristics. The paragraph as a whole reflects that the two alternatives are nonetheless both elucidations of how the interpretive exercise is to be directed toward a reasonable interpretation held by a sufficiently large number of readers. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 This objective standard of reasonableness is reiterated at [156] of <span class="font-italic">TOC</span>, where the Court of Appeal drew a distinction between an interpretation that would be adopted by an appreciable segment of the article’s readership and material “which will <span class="font-italic">only</span> be construed in the false sense by an insignificant segment of the public or class of persons not culled from the public discourse” [emphasis in original]. The contrast of the two segments is a device to delineate an objective standard of reasonableness, which is emphasised again at [157] of <span class="font-italic">TOC</span>, where the Court of Appeal reiterated that the interpretive exercise is to be approached as a matter of impression and “the court should not engage in fine-grained legal interpretation or unduly technical analysis”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Further, in applying the second step of the analytical framework to determine if the impugned article posted by the Singapore Democratic Party (“SDP Article”) contained the subject statement in question (that “Local PMET retrenchment has been increasing”), the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> found that the ordinary reasonable reader would have understood the SDP Article to mean that there was a rising absolute number, as opposed to a rising proportion, of “Singapore PMETs” being retrenched. In so holding, the Court of Appeal did not require evidence, for example, of the number of retrenched PMETs, to be averred in affidavit, and neither did the Court of Appeal consider such evidence. Again, the Court of Appeal expressly stated that the SDP Article was to be interpreted “as a matter of impression rather than fine-grained or unduly technical analysis”: see <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> at [210]–[211].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the present case, therefore, I shall determine, on an objective basis, whether the subject statements are reasonable interpretations of the subject material. While, as I explained at [33], the Court of Appeal left open at [136] of <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>the option of defining a specific class of reader in making the objective assessment, this is not, in my view, necessary for these appeals, and I do not do so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The SM Teo Subject Statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I turn to the specific subject statements. There is no dispute over the intention and meaning of the SM Teo Subject Statement, which is that SM Teo did not respond to questions concerning the issue of actual or apparent conflicts of interest and a possible breach of the Code of Conduct for Ministers (“Code”) beyond replying that it was more important to observe the spirit rather than just the letter of the Code. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 TIPL submits that the SM Teo Subject Statement is not a reasonable interpretation of the subject material. The material does not hold itself out as describing exhaustively SM Teo’s response to all the issues raised in Parliament on conflicts of interest or the Code. It makes clear, with the use of an ellipsis, that it is a partial quote. The word “pithy” meant nothing more than its dictionary meaning: “full of concentrated meaning; conveying meaning forcibly through brevity of expression; concise, succinct; condensed in style”.

</div>
</div>
</div> The title of the Politics Article also did not lead to the SM Teo Subject Statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The AG agrees with TIPL’s definition of “pithy” but submits it is used in a sardonic sense and that the title and body of the material lead to the subject statement being made. Reading the subject material in context, the fact of the partial quote is not sufficient. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In ascertaining whether the Politics Article does contain the SM Teo Subject Statement, I look at the article in its entire context. Its title references two issues: a lack of corruption on the part of two Ministers and a lack of answers. The body begins with an explanation that “[a]s expected, the government found no corruption in the Ridout Road bungalow leases … Yet the issue of corruption was a straw man – parliamentary opposition members never complained about it.” Having thus set the stage, the article then moves on to the lack of answers to “the primary problems”. It then highlights specifically a conflict of interest on the part of SM Teo. It is with this premise that it calls SM Teo’s response “pithy”: this is a sarcastic reference to the understanding of concision. What makes the impression plain is the five-word explanatory sentence that follows immediately after: “Ownself check ownself wins again”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 As TIPL points out, the article does not state, literally, that SM Teo did not say anything apart from the partial quote. TIPL rightly approached the issue as one of reasonable interpretation with reference to the entire text. As an example, the Court of Appeal at [228] of <span class="font-italic">TOC </span>interpreted “local” in a graphical illustration in a December Facebook post to mean Singapore citizens because it read the article as a whole. In the same vein, I read the Politics Article as a whole: its tenor and import lead an objective reasonable reader to conclude that SM Teo had no other answer beyond the cryptic quote. While TIPL contends in passing that this was an opinion as there is no definitive set of questions to be answered, it is common ground that the first or third steps of the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> framework are not relevant for the purpose of these appeals. The Minister’s intended meaning was not disputed, nor was it disputed that the SM Teo Subject Statement was a statement of fact. Within the text of the subject material, the SM Teo Subject Statement was <span class="font-italic">not</span> expressed as the author’s opinion. It was an assertion of fact made by the author in order to support his opinion that because of the issue of conflicts of interest, many questions remained unanswered after the review that SM Teo (ought not to have) helmed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my judgment, therefore, the subject material does contain the SM Teo Subject Statement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Renovation Subject Statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 TIPL’s contention here is that the causal link intended by the Renovation Subject Statement – that the money was spent <span class="font-italic">because</span> the Ministers were to be tenants – was not made in the subject material. The phrase “the bare facts are shocking” simply refers to the three factual statements that follow: (i) $1m was spent on the renovation of the two houses; (ii) the properties were about 100,000 sq ft and 250,000 sq ft in sizes, respectively; and (iii) the square foot rent worked out to just over 10 cents psf for 26 Ridout Road. The facts are “shocking” because (i) the amount spent on renovation is very large, (ii) the size of the properties is very large, but (iii) the square foot rent for 26 Ridout Road is very low.

</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In the present case, the subject material is capable of multiple meanings, one of which, as TIPL submits, is to take “at face value” the three bare facts that would shock the reader. Presumably, this reaction would be linked to the author’s opinion that the Ministers lived very privileged lives. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Nevertheless, in my view, an objective and reasonable segment of the audience would read the article as a whole and not merely the three “facts”. Looking at the text of the material, the first half of the article is about conflicts of interest. Minister Shanmugam is specifically highlighted as the Minister in charge of the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”). The author makes clear that the conflicts of interest raised by Mr Harpreet Singh SC had not been answered by SM Teo, who was himself in a position of conflict. It is in the context of these conflicts of interest that the article then moves into identifying the two Ministers as privileged, highlighting the Ministers’ comments about the “apparently decrepit” – and yet huge – properties. The “bare facts” set out as “shocking” are that over $1m of “taxpayer money” had been spent on renovation and the vast size of the properties are comparable to football fields, ending with the punchline emphasised with dashed punctuation that the monthly rent was just over 10 cents per square foot. Regarding that monthly rent, SLA’s counter-offer was “the exact guide rent, not a cent more, suggesting that the Singaporean coffers are represented by the most inept housing agent in history”. The implied allusion to low rent (“10 cents per square foot”) is misleading. Gross floor area, referencing the liveable space, is the appropriate measure used in the market for black-and-white bungalows, as was explained by the Second Minister for Law at the same parliamentary sitting that the article referenced.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The flow of the text within the article and its conclusion is an assertion that conflicts of interest caused SLA to spend more than $1m in taxpayer money to renovate the large properties despite the low rental return. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Again, TIPL submits in the alternative that this was the author’s opinion but makes no argument that the causal link asserted in the Renovation Subject Statement was not a statement of fact. In my view, the causal link is the statement of fact to be read from the subject material. This statement of fact supplies the reason that SLA had acted in what is framed as a commercially inept manner. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Geo-block Subject Statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The title of the Society Article asks, “[d]id Instagram accede to a censorship request by the Rajah?” It is common ground that “the Rajah” in this context refers to Minister Shanmugam. TIPL submits that the question in the title is an open question, while the AG contends that the query is a rhetorical question that the article then answers in the affirmative. I agree with the AG that the Geo-block Subject Statement is contained within the article for the reasons that follow. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Society Article begins by referencing a post by Charles Yeo, which was “seemingly geo-blocked (only in Singapore)” by Instagram. It makes clear that Minister Shanmugam thought that the allegations in Charles Yeo’s post were serious, as he was “forced to debunk it in Parliament”. The Society Article then asserts that it is “curious” that the “[G]overnment has not issued any correction order, as it so often does” before claiming that a CD “would have offered more transparency than a block, which is nefarious in its opacity”, hinting that the Government chose one form of censorship over another. By contrasting a geo-block with a CD, the article intimates that the Government decided to geo-block Charles Yeo’s post because it wanted to avoid transparency. With the line, “[w]e don’t know if this request came from Shanmugam”, the article is implying it was indeed Minister Shanmugam, a member of the Government, who caused Instagram to geo-block Charles Yeo’s post. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Following the above, the Society Article states, “[w]hat we do know is that Meta [the company that operates Instagram] sometimes works hand-in-glove with autocratic governments in the region” and provides an example of how the Vietnamese government caused Meta to remove posts criticising top officials in Vietnam, while quoting a co-founder of a media consultancy as saying, “Meta reportedly maintains an internal list of Vietnamese Communist Party officials who should not be criticised on Facebook”. The assertion made is that Meta is compliant with government demands. While the Society Article then states that “[t]here’s no evidence that Meta has any similar arrangement with Singapore’s ruling People’s Action Party (PAP)”, that similar arrangement refers to “an internal list of Vietnamese Communist Party officials”, and this does not nullify the sting of the preceding assertion that Meta generally cooperates with governments. Instead, it leads on tantalisingly to the fact that Meta had received a court order. Its conclusion, “<span class="font-italic">S</span><span class="font-italic">till</span>, this incident raises worrying questions about speech, censorship tools, and the rules of engagement in online discourse, particularly given inherent power dynamics” [emphasis added], reiterates the insinuation at the beginning of the article, that Charles Yeo’s post was censored by the Government. The link to the general election to be called by 2025 in the final sentence then supplies a powerful motive (implying that this was in order to prevent the electorate from reading it) that makes clear the assertion that the Government did cause Instagram to block Charles Yeo’s post in order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 In my view, what the article does, by a series of speculative associations, is set out a case that the Government caused Instagram to geo-block Charles Yeo’s post.

Such situations may conceivably occur given that words are capable of bearing an outer range of reasonable meanings. While this issue did not arise for decision in these appeals, we observed to Mr Nair that in such a scenario, perhaps a viable way in which the statement-maker might be able to object to the Minister’s intended meaning in respect of the subject statement, and the issuance of a Part 3 Direction on the basis of that meaning, would be <span class="font-weight-bold">to disavow clearly and unequivocally to the target readership of the subject material in its original published form the Minister’s intended meaning and any association with it.</span> Such disavowal might, for instance, take the form of an addendum or a follow-up to the subject material, clarifying that the statement-maker <span class="font-italic">did not</span> intend to convey the particular meaning that the Minister had placed on the subject statement as the basis for issuing a Part 3 Direction. Such clear and public disavowal does not seem to us to be unduly onerous if, as Mr Nair submitted, the statement-maker insists that it was not making the subject statement that the Minister said was being made. In such circumstances, the statement-maker, in truth, would have no interest in allowing the misconception to persist, and would instead have every incentive to clarify to the public that the subject statement should not be read in the particular way that the Minister had done. This seems to us to <span class="font-weight-bold">strike a possible balance between an objective interpretation of the subject statement from the perspective of the potential readership or audience of the subject material in Singapore, and an interpretation based on the statement-maker’s subjective intended meaning.</span> However, we leave this as a provisional view for future consideration since, as we mentioned earlier, the point did not arise for decision in the present appeals.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 While TIPL agrees with the AG that the Court of Appeal’s observations are <span class="font-italic">obiter </span><span class="font-italic">dicta</span>, TIPL is of the view that the <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> is legally and conceptually sound and may be reconciled with s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POFMA such that the High Court is entitled to, and must, take into account post-issuance amendments up to the point when the Minister exercises his or her powers to cancel the CD under s 19 of the POFMA.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> at [177] instructs that in an appeal under s 17 of the POFMA, “the High Court must determine afresh the relevant facts pertaining to the ss 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) and 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) grounds for setting aside a Part 3 Direction, without deferring to the Minister’s determination of those facts or being constrained by the usual principles of appellate review”. This clearly means that an appeal is by way of rehearing and, accordingly, the High Court is entitled to consider a disavowal made after the issuance of the CD but before the Minister exercises his or her power under s 19 to cancel the CD. This must be so because the Minister’s decision to confirm the CD is one made with the benefit of considering the disavowal.

As regards s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the phrase “did not communicate” should be interpreted to mean that the appellant “had not communicated the subject statement at any time”. Accordingly, if an appellant (such as TIPL) had communicated certain subject statements at any time and CDs were issued pursuant to that communication, whether the appellant had subsequently stopped communicating the subject statements (because of an addendum) would be irrelevant.

A CD is an important tool for the Minister to debunk falsehoods that have already been published and may have already done significant damage that needs to be remedied. Further, being exposed to falsehoods over an extended duration can lead to a corrosive impact, necessitating a CD to correct the reader’s point of view.

Section 17(1) allows a person to whom a Part 3 Direction is issued to appeal to the High Court “against the Direction”. Section 17(2) then mandates that before he does so, he must apply to the Minister under s 19 to vary or cancel that Direction and the Minister must have refused the application in whole or in part. TIPL’s interpretation rests on s 17(2), that, chronologically, the High Court would consider the matter after the Minister has exercised discretion under s 19. As posited by TIPL, if the Direction was issued on Date A, the Minister considered the matter on Date A+3, and the Court then heard the appeal on Date A+3+X, it would seem that logically, the matters which the Minister considered when exercising his or her discretion would be relevant to the court on Date A+3+X. Turning to s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POFMA, the words “did not” are couched in simple past tense.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Nevertheless, as parties agreed at the hearing, what is now being challenged on an appeal under s 17 is not the Minister’s exercise of discretion under s 19. Further, the words of s 17(5) are restrictive in that the High Court “may only” set aside such a Direction if any of the three grounds in s 17(5) is satisfied. While the matter before the High Court is a rehearing, this rehearing relates to the three grounds specified in s 17(5). As the Court of Appeal explained in <span class="font-italic">TOC</span>, the appeal process is a statutory mechanism for the recipient of a Part 3 Direction to challenge the Minister’s decision to issue the Direction against it. It does not constitute an “appeal” in the conventional sense where a higher court reviews a decision from a lower court or tribunal. Instead, the High Court determines afresh the relevant facts pertaining to the three grounds for setting aside a Part 3 Direction: see [176]–[177] of <span class="font-italic">TOC</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In this context, s 17(2) of the POFMA reflects the well-established principle in administrative law that a person seeking judicial review of an executive decision must exhaust all alternative remedies before invoking the jurisdiction of the court: see, for example, <span class="font-italic">Borissik Svetlana v Urban Redevelopment Authority</span> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 92 at [25]. The argument could be made therefrom, as TIPL has, that it is natural for the court to take cognisance of actions after the act that is being judicially reviewed. Nevertheless, s 17 is not concerned with the general law on judicial review, and neither are the present appeals. Section 17 is a statutory mechanism that must, by definition, be delineated by its particular statutory prescription, context and intent. Referencing back to the Court of Appeal’s guidance in <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> at [176], it is the Minister’s decision to issue a Part 3 Direction under s 10 of the POFMA that is before the court. Section 10 of the POFMA makes the timeframe for the consideration of the subject statement clear. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 Section 10 of the POFMA reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conditions for issue of Part 3 Directions</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">10.—(1)  Any Minister may instruct the Competent Authority to issue a Part 3 Direction if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) a false statement of fact (called in this Part the subject statement) has been or is being communicated in Singapore;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) the Minister is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to issue the Direction.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2)  Any Minister may instruct the Competent Authority to issue a Part 3 Direction in relation to the subject statement even if it has been amended or has ceased to be communicated in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Section 10(1) of the POFMA, which sets out the conditions for the issuance of a CD, specifies a false statement of fact that “has been or is being communicated in Singapore”. This frame (“has been or is being communicated”) uses a different time period from the simple past tense of s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). The use of different tenses highlights that the time at which the Court is to consider whether the subject material “did not communicate” the subject statement is a time <span class="font-italic">prior to </span><span class="font-italic">or during the issuance of the CD</span>. The use of “has been” indicates the <span class="font-italic">time at which the </span><span class="font-italic">subject statement was first communicated</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Section 10(2) of the POFMA goes further. The sub-section allows the issue of a Part 3 Direction “in relation to the subject statement <span class="font-italic">even if it has been amended or has ceased to be communicated in Singapore</span>” [emphasis added]. Section 10(2) deals with the issuance of a CD after the material has ceased to be communicated, for example, when a disavowal has been made or the material has been taken down. The section is not strictly applicable to the present discussion, where the First and Second CDs were issued<span class="font-italic"> prior</span> to the amendment. But the point to note is that in a case where s 10(2) of the POFMA applies, where CDs may be issued after any false statement is no longer being made, the material would have been communicated at a point even <span class="font-italic">earlier </span>in time (than the point of time in question in these present appeals). Moreover, there is clear statutory language to indicate this time period. In other words, while s 10(1) deals with “has been”, s 10(2) makes clear the effect in the contingency of “has been but is no longer”. Section 10(2) reiterates s 10(1) that, under s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), the time for considering whether the person “did not communicate” the subject statement was the time at which the subject statement <span class="font-italic">was first communicated</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Section 19 of the POFMA reinforces this view. Under ss 19(1) and 19(2), the relevant Minister may give instructions to vary or cancel a CD, either on his or her own motion or on an application by the recipient of the CD. Where a CD has been varied, the varied CD amounts to a new issuance. By s 19(4), ss 14 to 17 of the POFMA apply in relation to the varied CD. The varied CD is served again and carries its appurtenant right of application to the Minister and appeal to the High Court. Crucially, the statutory focus is on the varied <span class="font-italic">CD</span>. There is nothing in s 19 that varies the application of s 10(2) of the POFMA in this scenario. Even where the subject material has been amended and instructions for a varied CD have been given, there is nothing in the section that disapplies s 10(2) of the POFMA: the subject statement that is the focus of the varied CD may be specified as that contained in the original subject material <span class="font-italic">or</span> the amended subject material. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 My interpretation, at [60]–[61], that the relevant time is the time <span class="font-italic">at which the subject material was first communicated</span>, is consistent with the statutory purpose of the POFMA, as set out in s 5(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), which is “to prevent the communication of false statements of fact in Singapore and to <span class="font-italic">enable measures to be taken</span> to counteract the <span class="font-italic">effects</span> of such communication” [emphasis added]. The intent of the POFMA is that <span class="font-italic">once</span> misinformation and falsehoods have been communicated, full information is required to be set out as a countermeasure. The legislative reach is intended to counter the effects of misinformation that was previously put out. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In my opinion, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> also did not intend for such a disavowal to be considered in the manner posited by TIPL. Reading the section as a whole, [155] comes at the end of the entire section on the second step of the <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> framework. The Court of Appeal had set out at [150] the objective approach, highlighting that there are “multiple reasonable ways in which the subject material may be interpreted”. After emphasising the importance of how the statement in question would be received by the public over the subject-maker’s subjective intention at [154], [155] was inserted to deal with a marginal situation, which “may conceivably occur <span class="font-italic">given that words are capable of bearing an outer range of reasonable meanings</span>”. The paragraph cannot be taken to detract from the main holding of the Court of Appeal that an objective approach is taken to reading the subject material. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Applying this construction to the present case, my views at [40]–[41], [45], and [47]–[49], would mean that I do not consider the subject statements to be within an “outer” range of meanings, but a valid conclusion that an objective, reasonable reader would draw.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 This interpretation does not, contrary to TIPL’s assumption, render the Court of Appeal’s <span class="font-italic">dicta</span> in [155] of <span class="font-italic">TOC</span> any less conceptually sound. In a case where the subject statement was within an outer range of meanings, an unequivocal addendum would make that clear and, as a practical matter, be considered by the Minister under s 19 of the POFMA, who can then vary or cancel the Part 3 Direction. Relevantly, sanctions in ss 32 and 33 of the POFMA only apply where there are “active” Directions; a cancelled Direction would not come within those sections. TIPL raises a further issue of whether an innocent party would be left without remedy if a Minister failed to cancel a CD in bad faith. In <span class="font-italic">TOC</span>, the Court of Appeal dealt with this issue at [104] when explaining that TOC’s concern that there were adequate safeguards was unfounded. In such a case the recipient of a Part 3 Direction may use s 17 of the POFMA, and judicial review on other aspects of the Minister’s decision remains available. Because of these considerations, the use of such addenda in the situation envisaged would still, contrary to TIPL’s suggestion, “strike a possible balance between an objective interpretation of the subject statement from the perspective of the potential readership or audience of the subject material in Singapore, and an interpretation based on the statement-maker's subjective intended meaning” as suggested by the Court of Appeal’s second last sentence in [155].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In my judgment, therefore, in determining these two appeals under s 17 of the POFMA, I am to consider whether the subject materials make or contain the subject statements at the time that they were communicated in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The addenda </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In view of my interpretation of s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the POFMA and <span class="font-italic">TOC</span>, I hold that the addenda are not relevant in determining whether the CDs should be set aside under s 17(5)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>). The present situation is not that specified at [155] of TOC, in which “an outer range of reasonable meanings” was engaged, where “the statement-maker, in truth, would have no interest in allowing the misperception to persist”. This is illustrated by the manner in which the specific addenda at hand do not amount to clear disavowals: they are bare denials. The AG submits that they are sardonic in nature. I do not find this a necessary conclusion, but I do find that they do not, when read in context, amount to unequivocal disavowals. The addenda do nothing to neutralise the slant of the subject material, where the subject statement is not literally made but set out as a logical conclusion for the reader. A reasonable reader, reading the subject material together with only the denials, would be left none the wiser but bemused, rather, by the anomaly between the import of the subject material and its accompanying addenda. Hence the AG’s contention that the addenda reflect sardonic humour. Whatever the case, it is the presence of the Correction Notice that supplies the answer to the logical query that has arisen.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The above is also relevant to TIPL’s contention that a disavowal serves the same purpose as a CD. The various addenda in this case and the CDs issued (see [7]–[10] and [14]–[16] above) highlight the difference between a disavowal and a CD. A CD allows the Minister to state all relevant facts and to highlight, through a hyperlink to another website, for example, the full facts for readers to come to an informed conclusion.

</div> A blanket disavowal of the Minister’s subject statement does not have the same effect of ensuring that full information is given to readers. As a practical matter, each piece has its own utility. The disavowal, as published, functions as the author’s response. In this sense, a balance is indeed struck, as the Court of Appeal points out in [155] of <span class="font-italic">TOC</span>, between an objective interpretation of the material and the statement-maker’s subjective intended meaning. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 For these reasons, I dismiss the appeals.
