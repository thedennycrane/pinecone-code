The Victim consumed alcoholic beverages and seemed to have lost consciousness as a result of intoxication. At about 4.00am that morning, the Accused drove the Victim to his residence at No 4 Hume Heights (“the Residence”), where the Accused had sexual intercourse with the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The Accused was charged with one count of rape under s 375(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) and one count of abduction <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> under s 362 of the same Act. The Prosecution’s case was that the Victim was unconscious at the material time of the alleged offences due to severe alcohol intoxication. As a result, she lacked the capacity to consent, and did not in fact consent, to being taken to the Residence or to sexual intercourse with the Accused.

Accordingly, I convicted the Accused on both charges and sentenced him to a global imprisonment term of 13 years and 6 months, and 12 strokes of the cane. I also granted a compensation order of $76, in default one day of imprisonment.

The Victim’s movement thereafter was also not clear: Kwok testified that they had gone to another part of the club, known as “Phuture”, before returning to the main table, while the Victim said that they had returned to the main table directly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 In any event, the Victim, Kwok and the Accused eventually returned to the main table, where the Victim consumed more alcohol.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Under the approach set out in <span class="font-italic">AOF</span>, the Court should not convict an accused unless it finds on a close scrutiny that the complainant’s evidence is unusually convincing, based on (a) the complainant’s demeanour in Court, (b) the internal consistency of his or her evidence, and (c) its external consistency when assessed against extrinsic evidence such as the evidence of other witnesses or documentary evidence or exhibits (see <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [115]). However, as I mentioned in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v BLV </span>[2017] SGHC 154 at [24], the modern judicial tendency appears to lean in favour of relying more heavily on the last two inquiries rather than an assessment of the complainant’s demeanour. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 If the complainant’s evidence is not unusually convincing, a conviction is unsafe unless there is adequate corroboration of the complainant’s account of the events (see <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>at [173]). Subsequent statements by the complainant himself or herself constitute corroboration so long as those statements implicating the accused were made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence (see <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Mardai</span> [1950] MLJ 33 at 33; <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> at [173]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It was not entirely clear that the unusually convincing standard applied to the present case. As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">AOF</span> explained (at [111]), that standard applied “in a case where no other evidence is available” apart from the testimonies of the complainant and the accused. In those situations, the unusually convincing standard is the cognitive aid that helps untie the “evidential Gordian knot… if proof is to be founded solely from the complainant’s testimony against the accused” (<span class="font-italic">XP v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at [31]; <span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals</span> [2016] 5 SLR 636 (“<span class="font-italic">Haliffie</span><span class="font-italic"> bin Mamat</span>”) at [29]). In practice, the unusually convincing standard usually applies in trials of sexual offences where the complainant and the accused each provides a diametrically opposite account of what had occurred and the Court has to weigh the complainant’s word against the accused’s word (see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">AOF</span>). However, that may not mean that the standard necessarily applies to all issues in all trials of sexual offences. The question is whether the conviction turns solely on the complainant’s testimony, not whether the charge is one involving a sexual offence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In the present case, the primary contested issue was whether the Victim had the capacity to consent to the events constituting the alleged offences at the material time. In this regard, there was such other evidence, in the form of the video evidence and the expert testimonies adduced by the Prosecution and the Defence. Therefore, at least in relation to this issue, the rationale for the unusually convincing standard did not appear to apply. This may be a point that needs to be addressed in a subsequent appropriate case. For present purposes, however, given the position taken jointly by the parties, and since the difference was not material insofar as I was of the view that the Victim’s evidence was in fact unusually convincing, I proceeded on the basis that the unusually convincing standard set out in <span class="font-italic">AOF </span>applied. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Capacity to consent </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 As mentioned, the first and primary point of contention was whether, at the material time of the offences, the Victim was intoxicated from alcohol to the extent that she lacked the capacity to consent to the events constituting the two charges. Section 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PC provides that consent is “not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code… if the consent is given by a person who, from… intoxication… is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The Prosecution’s case was that the Victim had been unconscious as a result of severe alcohol intoxication for the material period between about 4.04am and 6.30am on 24 July 2014. In support of its case, the Prosecution relied on the Victim’s evidence that there was a complete blank in her memory between the time that she passed out at Zouk (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, around 3.00am on 24 July 2014) and the time that she was woken up by [W] at the Residence (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, around 6.30am on 24 July 2014).

</div> Dr Guo considered the Victim’s BAC level at the time of her medical check-up at 12.45pm on 24 July 2014, which was 62mg% (also represented as 62mg/100ml), as well as the various statements given by the Victim, the Accused, and the witnesses. He noted that the Victim had started consuming alcohol when she was around 20 years old and would normally drink once in 2 to 3 months. Further, Dr Guo recorded in his report aspects of the Zouk outing on 24 July 2014 as recounted by the Victim during his interviews with her, including the Victim not being able to recall the actual amount of alcohol she had consumed, but being able to recall that she had consumed a variety of alcoholic drinks including beer, champagne, wine, and hard liquor. She had also recounted that after one of her female colleagues got drunk, she was persuaded by other friends to drink even more. She drank faster than usual. The Victim’s last memory was of a moment at around 3.00am on 24 July 2014, when she was holding a glass of wine and sending a message to her boyfriend. The next thing she could remember was her boyfriend shouting at her at the Residence. She was only able to recall “some fleeting memories” of her being taken into her boyfriend’s car, and her subsequent stay in the hospital and at her residence. She did not recall ever giving consent to the Accused for sexual intercourse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Amongst other things, Dr Guo drew the following conclusions in his first report:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Victim’s alcohol habits prior to the incident suggested that it was unlikely that she would have developed a high degree of tolerance to the effects of alcohol.

Dr Tan’s report referred to the Accused’s version of events, including the Victim having told the Accused to go to his house when he asked her which block and unit she stayed in. The Accused also told Dr Tan that the Victim “did not resist him” when they had sexual intercourse and that she was “calling his name when they were having sex”. Further, when [W] woke the Victim up, the Victim had a “surprised look”, which the Accused described as a “as if got caught” look. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3)  Assessment of the Expert Evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 I accepted Dr Guo’s opinion that the Victim had been unconscious at the material time of the alleged offences, between 4.00am and 6.00am on 24 July 2014, to the extent that she could not have given consent to any of the events constituting the two charges which would have satisfied s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PC (see [32] above). I was also satisfied that Dr Guo’s assessment of the Victim’s state at the material time was performed based on a proper and justified estimation of the Victim’s BAC level and clearance rate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It was undisputed that, based on the Victim’s toxicology report, her BAC level was 62mg% as at 12.45pm on 24 July 2014 (see [44(b)] above). The dispute was over how a retrospective estimation of the Victim’s BAC level during the material period from 4.00am to 6.30am earlier that morning should have been done. Dr Guo had arrived at his estimates by applying a BAC clearance rate of 22mg%/hr (see [44(b)] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Counsel for the Defence suggested that Dr Guo’s BAC assessment was inaccurate because the BAC clearance rate applied by Dr Guo was too high, and therefore the Victim’s estimated BAC level at the material time was also too high. Counsel pointed to the decision of <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Pram Nair </span>[2016] 4 SLR 880 (“<span class="font-italic">Pram Nair (HC)</span>”), which also involved a serious sexual offence and the issue of whether the victim had the capacity to consent to sexual intercourse at the material time. There, expert evidence on the victim’s estimated BAC at the material time was given using a BAC clearance rate of 15mg%/hr. Counsel submitted that if the same 15mg%/hr value had been used in the present case, instead of the 22mg%/hr value in fact used by Dr Guo, the Victim’s estimated BAC level at the material time would have been significantly lower. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 I did not accept this argument. First, a BAC clearance rate accepted in relation to an individual in one case may not necessarily apply to all other individuals in other cases. As Dr Guo and Dr Tan agreed, BAC clearance rates differ from person to person.

</div> As mentioned above (at [44(d)]), Dr Guo’s view was that the Victim was highly likely to be in a state of severe intoxication with significantly impaired consciousness, and highly unlikely to have been able to understand and follow any verbal instructions given to her, and therefore highly unlikely to have consented to the events constituting the two charges. In contrast, Dr Tan’s view was that it remained possible for the Victim to give consent to sexual intercourse, even though her consent would be the result of “impaired judgment”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I did not accept the evidence of Dr Tan on the Victim’s condition at the material time for three main reasons. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 First, Dr Tan’s opinion was not grounded on sufficient or relevant facts. I have summarised the respective resources that Dr Guo and Dr Tan had access to in the preparation of their reports above (see [46(a)] and [49]). Four important resources were regrettably not considered by Dr Tan: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One, he did not interview the Victim even though she was the subject of his psychiatric assessment. For instance, after observing that the Victim was aware of her circumstances but did not fully consider the consequences of her action (at [48(a)] above), Dr Tan responded to the Prosecution’s next question “Anything else?” with a curious remark that “I haven’t seen her so… I really---cannot really comment but certainly she didn’t use all her… faculties”.

Dr Tan’s sole basis for this view was that “she had drunk alcohol in the past”. However, as Dr Guo explained, past consumption did not mean that one would develop tolerance; tolerance depended on the frequency and amount of alcohol used.

In my judgment, Dr Tan’s evidence suggested that his assessment of the Victim’s capacity to consent at the material time was not consistent with the statutory conception of consent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In relation to Dr Guo’s opinion, I accepted his assessment that the Victim had been unconscious from 4.00am to 6.30am on 24 July 2014 such that she could not have given consent for any of the events constituting the two charges. Dr Guo’s written reports were well-reasoned, well-referenced, and based on far more complete and objective information. In particular, he had access to still images of the CCTV records at Zouk, and his evidence remained consistent even after he was shown the CCTV footage in Court. Further, Dr Guo’s opinion was externally consistent with the evidence of the Victim’s state prior and subsequent to the 4.00am to 6.30am period in question.

</div> The evidence by the Victim, her father, and [W] were credible and consistent in the material respects. The common thread was that the Victim had been in a severely intoxicated state in the morning of 24 July 2014 and was largely unresponsive. The Victim was only arousable by strong physical stimuli such as [W] shaking her firmly. However, even then, the Victim was not coherent or cogent in her speech or conduct, and would inevitably fall back quickly into her drunken stupor. The Victim was in such an extreme state that both [W] and her father had taken the view that she must have been drugged.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The Victim, her father, and [W]’s evidence was also corroborated by the evidence of Senior Investigation Officer Chng Wee Boon (“SIO Chng”).

</div> which was admitted without dispute, SIO Chng stated that when he reached the KKH ward at about 11.00am on 24 July 2014 to interview the Victim, the Victim was asleep on the bed. He tried to wake her up, but the Victim was “extremely drowsy and unable to even sit up”. Despite SIO Chng’s attempts to wake the Victim, she “was unable to respond… She would slip in and out of consciousness throughout the time.” In total, SIO Chng spent around 10 minutes trying to engage the Victim, but the Victim remained in no state to respond. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 In my view, SIO Chng’s evidence was material. As the Prosecution noted, SIO Chng was an objective and disinterested third party who had no reason to fabricate or exaggerate his evidence.

</div> Indeed, his evidence was not challenged by the Defence. His description of the Victim’s condition corroborated the Victim’s, her father’s, and [W]’s accounts in a material respect – that the Victim was not in a responsive or fully conscious state as at 11.00am on 24 July 2014. Further, insofar as SIO Chng’s evidence showed that the Victim’s condition had not significantly improved even around seven hours after she had left Zouk with the Accused, his evidence was consistent with Dr Guo’s opinion that, based on the BAC clearance rate of 22mg%/hr and the estimated BAC level of around 254mg% as at 4.00am, the Victim would take around eight to ten hours to recover and reset her psychomotor function (see [46(d)] above).

It was because she had walked in with him, and had kissed and hugged him, that the Accused thought that she was “okay already”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I did not accept the evidence of the Accused. First, it ran against the mass of evidence that established the Victim’s severe state of intoxication on the morning of 24 July 2014. The Victim could not have consented to the events constituting either charge. As I have explained, this was borne out not only by the observations of the witnesses, but also by experts’ assessment of her mental state at the material time, including that of the Accused’s own expert, and also the objective CCTV recordings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 Second, in my view, the Accused’s evidence was internally inconsistent. At around 4.00am, the Victim had difficulty standing up (based on the Accused’s account) and was entirely unconscious and unresponsive (based on the objective and undisputed CCTV recordings). She had to be lifted onto the backseat of the Accused’s car, even though the front seat was empty, and then guided into a horizontal position because she could not sit upright. Yet, shortly thereafter, she apparently could cogently process the Accused’s question about where she stayed, and provide a sensible response “Go to your place”. In fact, around 35 to 45 minutes later, she could even walk together with the Accused from his car to the Accused’s room. However, in another twist of events, the Victim then became so reliant that the Accused had to help the Victim take off her shoes, and subsequently the Victim could not even take off her own clothes or underwear whilst they were in the Accused’s room.

</div> Further, the Victim was apparently not in a state to wear her own boots and had to be lent slippers. On the other hand, the Victim could stick out her tongue cheekily at the Accused to signal feigned guilt at being caught red-handed. She could also walk unaided from the front door of the Residence to the gate. In my view, the Accused’s account of the events on the morning of 24 July 2014 was unbelievable, and he had been less than generous with the truth. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 I add that I did not find persuasive the Accused’s explanation for his change of position between the versions that he told the Victim’s father (and her brother and [W]) on 24 July 2014, and during his subsequent meeting with the father. According to the Accused, he did not tell the Victim’s father the truth on 24 July 2014 because there were three men confronting him angrily and he was afraid of being beaten up. However, it appeared that several of the things he said on 24 July 2014 would more likely have raised suspicions and anger amongst the Victim’s family and [W]. For instance, he initially told the Victim’s father that he had to drag the Victim into the Residence, even though he subsequently claimed that the truth was that the Victim had walked in together with him. Speaking the truth earlier would have helped the Accused avoid accusations from the Victim’s family, for instance, regarding why he had changed the Victim’s clothes. In my view, the Accused had hoped on 24 July 2014 to convince the Victim’s family that no sexual intercourse had taken place. Being confronted a second time by the Victim’s father a few days after 24 July 2014, he worried about the flimsiness of his initial account and decided to concede to having had sexual intercourse with the Victim, albeit claiming that it had been consensual.

Benjamin Lim’s evidence in Court was that when the Accused was standing at the front door of the Residence with [W], the Victim was already outside the Residence’s main gate which was some distance away.

</div> In any event, I would not have placed much reliance on his evidence given that he did not in fact see the Victim walk unaided. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 On the whole, the evidence as to the Victim’s mental and physical state immediately before, during and after the material time of the two alleged offences established that she was in no capacity to consent to sexual intercourse or to being moved by the Accused to the Residence. At the time she left Zouk around 4.00am on 24 July 2014, she was severely intoxicated and unresponsive. When she later left the Residence at around 6.30am, she was still unable even to execute basic functions such as walking or talking. In my judgment, the Victim was too intoxicated at the material time to understand the nature and consequence of giving consent, and she could not therefore have consented to the movement by force, or to the subsequent sexual intercourse with the Accused. Valid consent under s 90(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the PC was not given in respect of either offence. Insofar as the unusually convincing standard applied, I found that the Victim’s evidence was indeed unusually convincing, and was, in any event, corroborated by the evidence of Dr Guo and the Prosecution’s witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Factual consent </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Having decided that the Victim lacked the capacity to consent to the events constituting either of the charges at the material time, there was no strict need to consider the issue of whether, assuming she was not so intoxicated as to have lacked the capacity to do so, the Victim had in fact given consent. Indeed, there might be some conceptual difficulties for the trial Court to consider this issue in the alternative, since the Victim’s evidence was that she could not remember anything. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Nevertheless, an assessment could be made of the Defence’s argument that the Accused and the Victim had at the material time a secret romantic relationship and that, as an incident of the relationship, the Victim consented to sexual intercourse with the Accused.

Even if the issue of factual consent had arisen, and even taking the Defence’s case at the highest, a romantic relationship between the Victim and the Accused did not mean that the Victim had given consent to sexual intercourse with him on this occasion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In the circumstances, I was of the view that nothing said by the Accused sufficed to raise any question about the Victim’s evidence that she did not in fact give consent to any of the events that had occurred on the morning of 24 July 2014. The Victim’s evidence was internally and externally consistent. As mentioned, even if the Victim had been friendly with the Accused, and even if they had an amorphous and secretive romantic relationship, that did not amount to consent to the Accused moving the Victim to the Residence by force, and all the more did not amount to consent to sexual intercourse with the Accused. Further, under cross-examination, the Accused accepted that they had never engaged in sexual intercourse prior to 24 July 2014, even though there might have been “ample opportunity” to do so.

I also found the Accused’s account of the events, such as the Victim telling the Accused that she wanted to go to his place despite her intoxicated state (which even if not to the extent that negated her capacity to consent, was undeniably of a serious extent) to be unbelievable.

The Defence’s submission was that the term “compel” indicated that the person being compelled must have been forced or constrained to do something despite resisting to do so. Thus, if the Victim was unconscious at the material time when the Accused carried her out of Zouk and drove her to the Residence, the offence of abduction would not be made out.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 Having considered the submissions, I accepted the Prosecution’s argument that a charge of abduction could be made out even if the Victim was unconscious at the material time and thus could not and did not put up resistance. The requirement of resistance or consciousness had no basis in the statutory language of s 362 (or for the matter, s 363A). A plain and ordinary reading of the word “compel” did not exclude an unconscious victim from the scope of the provision and from being the subject of an abduction ordinarily so understood.

</div>
</div> Indeed, if s 362 was limited to conscious victims, an absurd outcome might result where movements forced and compelled upon an unconscious or sleeping person would be exempted from criminal liability however egregious the offence might have been and even though the victim would have been more helpless and in need of protection. That, in my view, left precisely the most vulnerable persons outside the scope of s 362. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The Prosecution submitted that the prohibition of abduction under s 362 read with s 363A reflected Parliament’s intention to protect personal liberty and autonomy, but it accepted that there was no direct evidence as to the legislative purpose of these provisions in the present context where an unconscious victim was concerned. In my view, while regard should be had to the purpose of a statutory enactment, such purpose must be ascertained with care. In the absence of a sufficiently clear statement of purpose in the relevant Parliamentary debate or other preparatory material, the Court should be careful not to ascribe an artificial purpose, as that may amount to judicial legislation. In the present case, I did not find that there was sufficient relevant material to indicate the purpose underlying ss 362 and 363A that would be relevant to its application on the facts. It was clear that the provisions aimed at the protection of liberty and movement and perhaps autonomy, but how these considerations were to apply in respect of an unconscious victim was not at all clear.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 I appreciated that this interpretation of s 362 may create a broad scope of criminal liability, insofar as the movement of a sleeping spouse, the assisting of a person in a wheelchair, or a Good Samaritan’s moving of an unconscious victim out of harm’s way would <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>constitute an offence. Nevertheless, there are general defences in the PC, as well as the discretion of the Public Prosecutor, that will limit any injustice that may be caused by this reading of s 362 of the PC. In addition, a different interpretation will be inconsistent with the plain and ordinary reading of the word “compel” as explained above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I add that even though submissions were made on the Indian position, that did not to my mind assist. First, unlike the position recently adopted in Singapore, the Penal Code (Act No 45 of 1860) (India) (“the Indian Penal Code”) did not recognise abduction <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> as an offence. Second, as the Fifth Indian Law Commission recognised, in relation to s 362 of the Indian Penal Code, it was “not clear as to whether the definition takes into its ambit the act of bodily lifting and carrying away a person when he is unconscious or asleep”.

First, he was aware of the Victim’s severe state of intoxication at the material time. As mentioned, the CCTV recordings showed that the Victim had completely passed out at around 4.00am on the morning of 24 July 2014. She could not even exit the premises of Zouk on her own with assistance, and the Accused had to carry her out over his shoulder by way of a fireman’s lift. Even by the Accused’s own evidence, the Victim was unstable on her feet and apparently could not remove her own dress or underwear immediately prior to the sexual intercourse.

</div> Second, insofar as the purported secret relationship and the allegation that the Victim and the Accused had kissed at Zouk in the early morning of 24 July 2014 were concerned, I did not consider that such relationship and conduct could give rise to a mistaken belief in good faith that the Victim had consented to sexual intercourse. Notably, as the Prosecution suggested, even taking the Accused’s case at its highest, there appeared to have been a far gap between the purported state of their relationship on 24 July 2014 and consensual sexual intercourse.

It severely violates the dignity and bodily integrity of the victim, often causing deep-seated trauma. In this light, I was of the view that the primary sentencing considerations were, as with other serious sexual offences, retribution and the need for deterrence of similar heinous acts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 At the same time, I was mindful of the need for consistency, certainty and proportionality in the meting out of the sentence. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 2 SLR 449 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span>”) set out a revised framework for the sentencing of rape offenders, which involves a two-step approach as follows (at [39]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, the court should identify under which band the offence in question falls within, having regard to the factors which relate to the manner and mode by which the <span class="font-italic">offence</span> was committed as well as the harm caused to the victim (we shall refer to these as “offence-specific” factors). Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may <span class="font-italic">usually</span> be imposed for a case with those offence-specific features, has been identified the court should then determine precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an “indicative starting point”, which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the <span class="font-italic">offending act</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are <span class="font-italic">personal to the offender</span> to calibrate the appropriate sentence for that offender. These “offender-specific” factors relate to the offender’s particular personal circumstances and, by definition, <span class="font-italic">cannot</span> be the factors which have already been taken into account in the categorisation of the offence. In exceptional circumstances, the court is entitled to move outside of the prescribed range for that band if, in its view, the case warrants such a departure.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 In relation to the first step of the sentencing framework, the offence-specific factors relevant to the case should be identified. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span> provided a non-exhaustive list of offence-specific factors including group rape, abuse of position and breach of trust, premeditation, violence, rape of a vulnerable victim, forcible rape of a victim below the age of 14, hate crime, severe harm to victim, and deliberate infliction of special trauma (at [44]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Once the offence-specific factors are identified, the case can be classified into one of three sentencing bands set out by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span> (at [47]). Band 1 is applicable to cases at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness where there are no offence-specific aggravating factors or where these factor(s) are present to a very limited extent. Band 2 comprises cases involving a higher level of seriousness where there are usually two or more offence-specific aggravating factors. Band 3 is applicable to extremely serious cases of rape by reason of the number and intensity of the aggravating factors. The sentencing range for each band were prescribed as follows (<span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span> at [47]): </div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) Band 1: 10 – 13 years’ imprisonment, 6 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) Band 2: 13 – 17 years’ imprisonment, 12 strokes of the cane. </div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) Band 3: 17 – 20 years’ imprisonment, 18 strokes of the cane.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 In relation to the second step of the sentencing framework, the Court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender. In other words, the offender-specific factors which relate to the offender’s personal circumstances are to be considered (<span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span> at [39(b)]). The Court should then determine the weight that should be placed on these factors and the effect of these factors on the sentence to be imposed. An adjustment beyond the sentencing range prescribed for the band identified in the first step is permissible, but clear and coherent reasons should be provided if this is done (<span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span> at [62]). Examples of offender-specific factors include: offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, the presence of relevant antecedents, display of evident remorse, youth, advanced age, and pleas of guilt (<span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span> at [64]–[71]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Subsequent to this two-step approach, in cases where an offender has been convicted of multiple charges, the Court may, if it thinks necessary, make further adjustments to the sentence to take into account the totality principle and to ensure that the global sentence is appropriate and not excessive (<span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span> at [72]–[73]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ positions </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 The Prosecution submitted that the applicable sentencing band for the present case was Band 2 based on the presence of four offence-specific aggravating factors: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) rape of a vulnerable victim;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) abuse of position and breach of trust;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) premeditation; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) severe harm to the victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 In the circumstances, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane was appropriate in respect of the rape charge.

The latter might also become targets because they are less able to fend off the offender’s sexual advances in the moment of the offence. … A victim with only a temporary disability or impairment may be less likely to be subjected to such a course of sexual assault, but it does not mean she is not vulnerable on the single occasion on which she is assaulted. The essential feature of this aggravating factor is that its existence makes it easier for the offender to commit the rape of the victim.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 I was unable to accept the Prosecution’s argument on abuse of position in the manner that it was framed. In <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>abuse of position as an offence-aggravating factor was explained as follows (at [44(b)]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Abuse of position and breach of trust</span>: This concerns cases where the offender is in a position of responsibility towards the victim (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, parents and their children, medical practitioners and patients, teachers and their pupils), or where the offender is a person in whom the victim has placed her trust by virtue of his office of employment (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a policeman or social worker).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Further, in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v NF </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 849 (“<span class="font-italic">NF</span>”), abuse of position was described as requiring the accused to be “related to the victim in a way that allows him to abuse his position of trust or authority” (at [25]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The cases made clear that it was only where the offender exploited his or her position of trust or responsibility that this offence-specific aggravating factor would be found to be present. Where the offender was in a position of responsibility towards the victim (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, parents and their children, medical practitioners and patients, teachers and their pupils) or where the offender was a person in whom the victim had placed trust by virtue of the offender’s office of employment (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, a policeman or social worker), such exploitation was evident by virtue of the very nature of the relationship between the offender and the victim. On the other hand, the exploitation or abuse of position would not be evident where there was merely a friendship or a collegial relationship between the offender and the victim. In such circumstances, I was of the view that an abuse of position could only be relied on as an aggravating factor in exceptional circumstances, such as where there was evidence that there had been a deliberate exploitation of the friendship or collegial relationship in the commission of the offence. Save in such exceptional circumstances, the requisite nexus between the relationship and the offence would not usually be satisfied.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 On the facts, in relation to the nature of the relationship between the Accused and the Victim, I found that they were merely close friends or colleagues. While the Accused may have dispensed informal advice to the Victim from time to time, that did not amount to the assumption of a position of responsibility equivalent to that between, for instance, parents and their children, medical practitioners and patients, and teachers and their pupils. Nor, in my view, did the Victim repose such trust in the Accused by virtue of the latter’s office of employment. On these premises, abuse of position could not be established on the basis of the parties’ relationship alone. It might have been material, for instance, if the Accused had exploited his position as a friend or colleague to induce the Victim to accompany him to Zouk and plied her with alcoholic drinks with an eye to exploiting her vulnerability thereafter. However, there was no evidence of any such attempt. The Victim had willingly gone to Zouk to celebrate Maria’s departure and there was no evidence that the Accused had plied her with alcoholic drinks in order to get her into a vulnerable state. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Exploitation of entrustment </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I turn now to a distinct but related offence-specific aggravating factor: the exploitation of entrustment by third parties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Abuse of position is an offence-specific aggravating factor for the following reason as explained in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span> (at [44(b)]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">When [an offender who is in a position of responsibility or position of trust] commits rape, there is a dual wrong: not only has he committed a serious crime, he has also violated the trust placed in him by society and by the victim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Although there was no abuse of position in the present case, I found that the Accused had exploited the entrustment to the Accused of the Victim’s safety by the other individuals at Zouk on the morning of 24 July 2014, including the friends and colleagues of the Victim, as well as the staff members of the club. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 While exploitation of entrustment by third parties was not expressly recognised by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>as an example of an offence-specific aggravating factor,<span class="font-italic"> </span>I was of the view that it would be appropriate to treat this factor as such. Where the safety or wellbeing of the victim is entrusted to an offender by third parties, the offender, although not in a position of trust or responsibility in the sense outlined in the previous section, nevertheless commits an analogous “dual wrong”: not only has he committed a serious crime, he has violated the trust placed in him by others to protect or at least refrain from causing harm to the victim. That would, to my mind, be sufficient to amount to an offence-specific aggravating factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 On the present facts, the Accused was given the opportunity to be alone with the Victim and to be in control of the Victim’s person and movement because the others had entrusted him with bringing her home and keeping her unharmed. In fact, the Accused had told the Victim’s friends, including Kwok, and the staff of Zouk that he would send the Victim home. However, the Accused violated such trust placed in him by the others; he exploited the situation and committed a heinous act on the Victim. In the circumstances, I found that the exploitation of the entrustment that the third parties had reposed in the Accused was an offence-specific aggravating factor in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(4) Premeditation </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The Prosecution submitted that the rape offence had been premediated because there was a significant period that transpired between the time that the Accused and the Victim left Zouk and the time that they arrived at the Residence.

</div> In addition, the Accused had brought the Victim to the Residence even though he had another place of residence that was closer to her residence purportedly because he had wanted to avoid being noticed by the public. The Residence, being a private property, was more secluded than his other place of residence which was in a public housing district.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 I did not accept the Prosecution’s submission that the rape offence in the present case had been premeditated. In <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span><span class="font-italic">,</span> the Court of Appeal explained that premeditation is an offence-specific aggravating factor because it reflects a “considered commitment towards law-breaking” and thus reflects greater criminality (at [44(c)]). Examples of premeditation include the use of drugs or soporifics to reduce the victim’s resistance, predatory behaviour, or the taking of deliberate steps towards the isolation of the victim (at [44(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The requirements for finding premeditation as an offence-aggravating factor for serious sexual offences were further clarified in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, where the Court of Appeal found that there had been no premeditation and explained as follows (at [136]–[138]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">136 … [I]n the circumstances of the present case, as we have mentioned, what happened appears to us to be a case of an offender seizing an opportunity rather than having acted in a calculated manner.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">137 This is all the more so when we compare the appellant’s behaviour with the kind of sexual offences that our courts have characterised as being premeditated. To take but a few recent examples:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) In <span class="font-italic">Ng Jun Xian v PP</span> [2017] 3 SLR 933 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Jun Xian</span>”), the victim wanted to return to the hostel she was staying at. The offender persuaded her to rest at a hotel and he reassured her that she would be left alone and allowed to sleep. After bringing the victim to the hotel room, he took the opportunity to sexually assault her. See Kee Oon JC observed that there was premeditation because the offender had ‘sought to set the stage by sending the victim to the hotel despite her initial reluctance and he took the opportunity when it presented itself to commit the sexual assault’ (at [42]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) In <span class="font-italic">PP v Lee Ah Choy</span> [2016] 4 SLR 1300, the offender observed the victim for a period of time and came to understand her morning routine. He took the victim to a HDB block and even brought along a paper-cutter which he used to threaten her. Hoo Sheau Peng JC observed that this ‘demonstrated his resolve to see his plan through to completion’ and that he did not commit the offence on the spur of the moment (at [51]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) In <span class="font-italic">PP v Sim Wei Liang Benjamin</span> [2015] SGHC 240, the accused had used the internet with the clear intention of ensnaring his victims and luring them to engage in sexual activities with him (at [30]). This court noted in <span class="font-italic">Terence Ng</span> ([117] supra) that the offender had acted in a ‘predatory manner’ (at [55]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">138 These examples show that the kind of premeditation which the law regards as aggravating an offence involves a significant degree of planning and orchestration. The appellant’s acts did not really involve any pre-planning. Before their meeting on that fateful day, they were strangers to each other. It appears to us that the appellant’s moves that night were hatched on the spur of the moment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 In <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, the offender had raped and sexually assaulted a heavily intoxicated victim. They had met at a party several hours prior to the offence. The Court of Appeal found that the offender had not deliberately offered drugs or soporifics to the victim and that his acts did not involve any pre-planning. It was a case of the offender seizing an opportunity rather than him having acted in a calculated manner (at [135]–[136]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 As was the case in <span class="font-italic">Pram Nair</span>, there was no evidence that the rape offence in the present case was premediated by the Accused. It was not proven that the Accused had deliberately chosen to bring the Victim to the Residence as opposed to his public housing residence for the reason that the former was more secluded and there would be fewer witnesses. Since the offence was carried out within the four walls of a bedroom rather than at a public location, it was not of material significance whether it took place in a bedroom in the Residence or a public housing residence. I also found that the Accused’s explanations for having driven the Victim to the Residence instead of his public housing residence, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he had himself been staying at the Residence, that it was nearer to his workplace, and that he desired to avoid road blocks en route to his public housing residence,

</div>
</div> The Defence did not make submissions in relation to the harm to the Victim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 I accepted that instances of rape, by their inherently violent and intrusive nature, often cause the victim to suffer significant psychological and physical harm. The suffering of victims usually justifies the sentencing consideration of retribution which in turn translates into heavy sentences passed down, being measured in years rather than months. Indeed, following the revised sentencing framework set out in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span>, sentences of less than a decade will be relatively rare for offenders convicted of rape.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 In the present case, it was clear from the Victim Impact Statement that the Victim was significantly and adversely affected by the criminal conduct of the Accused. On her unchallenged account, she had suffered insomnia, mood swings, suicidal thoughts, loneliness, loss of trust, and reduced productivity after the incident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 However, invidious though the process of comparison of trauma may be, and without discounting in any way what the Victim had undeniably suffered, there needs to be a relatively severe state of psychological or physical harm shown in order for the Court to find that there is an additional offence-specific aggravating factor bringing the case to a higher sentencing band. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 In <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>the Court of Appeal provided three examples of the serious physical or psychological effects on the victim which would aggravate the offence. These were pregnancy, the transmission of a serious disease, or a psychiatric illness. Further, in <span class="font-italic">NF</span>, the Court stated (at [53]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[B]efore a court considers the impact of a crime on a victim, it is necessary and crucial that there be a firm evidential basis for the determination of the extent of the damage that the crime has had on the victim. When such evidence is available the court should carefully assess the harm that has befallen the victim in arriving at a sentence that fairly and accurately represents the gravity of the offence … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156  In the present case, there was no evidence adduced to establish any of the situations identified in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span>, or that the Victim had suffered any other condition of equivalent or greater severity. I recognised that the psychological impact of the incident on the Victim was substantial, but it was not to the extent that would bring the case within Band 3 of the sentencing framework. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(6) The appropriate sentence </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 The Prosecution submitted that there were four offence-specific aggravating factors, bringing the case within Band 2 of the sentencing framework established in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 The Defence submitted that there was only one offence-specific aggravating factor, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the vulnerability of the Victim. Accordingly, this case fell within Band 1 of the sentencing framework as Band 2 cases involved offence-specific factors which were far more aggravating. In this respect, the Defence sought to distinguish the present case from cases cited in <span class="font-italic">Ng Kean Meng Terence </span>as examples that would fall within Band 2.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 As at the time of my decision, there was no relevant High Court or Court of Appeal sentencing precedent for abduction <span class="font-italic">simpliciter</span> under s 362 of the PC of a similar nature to the present case, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, of an unconscious victim. The closest precedent was the unreported District Court judgment in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Ng Siang Hai </span>DAC 942299/2016 (17 July 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Ng Siang Hai</span>”), in which eight months’ imprisonment was imposed for the abduction of an unconscious and intoxicated person. In that case, the victim had gone drinking with a friend and that same friend had sent the victim home to her apartment block. Seeing that the victim was lying unconscious and intoxicated on the ground of the lift lobby, the accused, who was a neighbour of the victim, abducted the victim from the lift lobby to his flat by carrying her into his flat. There was no issued grounds of decision for that case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 The other cases under s 362 of the PC highlighted by the Prosecution and the Defence differed significantly on the present facts, and were thus of little relevance. This included <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chong </span><span class="font-italic">Voon Keong Jeffrey and another</span> [2011] SGDC 210 (“<span class="font-italic">Jeffrey</span><span class="font-italic"> Chong</span>”), in which the two accused persons abducted the victim by compelling him into a motorcar and driving him to a cemetery where he was beaten up by a group of persons. The accused persons were each sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment for the abduction charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 There were sentencing precedents in relation to other abduction and kidnapping offences under the PC. In <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chee Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Hin Constance</span> [2006] 2 SLR(R) 707, the accused was charged under s 361 of the PC for kidnapping from lawful guardianship, punishable under s 363 of the PC. The High Court stated the following in relation to the relevant sentencing considerations for an offence under s 363 of the PC (at [24]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 … The duration of the act, the motive for the abduction and any harm caused to the victim are all relevant considerations. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25  In determining the appropriate sentence in this case, I am mindful that the <span class="font-italic">single transaction </span>and <span class="font-italic">totality </span>principles must not be overlooked … To that extent, I am conscious of that the accused’s subsequent act in causing [the victim] to fall from the Block should not figure as a sentencing consideration in this offence, as it has already been dealt with in the sentence for the culpable homicide offence. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis original] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 I was of the view that in determining the appropriate sentence in relation to an abduction charge under s 362 and punishable under s 363A, the duration of the abduction, the motive for the abduction, and any harm caused to the victim in the abduction are likewise relevant considerations. The vulnerability of the victim is also a relevant sentencing factor. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 In the present instance, the abduction charge was framed in relation to the compelled movement of the Victim from Zouk to the Residence. In this context, during the period of travel, there was no harm or injury inflicted on the Victim by the Accused. The Accused did not use violence to compel her to move. Nor did he assault the Victim at any time during the car ride. On this basis, the Defence submitted that the Accused should receive a sentence of less than eight months’ imprisonment because he was less culpable than the accused persons in <span class="font-italic">Jeffrey Chong</span> who had assaulted the victim during the abduction.

Other sentencing factors must be taken into account. In the present case, the Accused had abducted the Victim while she was in an exceptionally vulnerable state of unconsciousness and unresponsiveness, similar to what the accused had done in <span class="font-italic">Ng Siang Hai</span>. He had taken advantage of the Victim’s severe intoxication and the entrustment to him of the Victim by the Victim’s friends and the staff of Zouk. More importantly, the abduction had placed the Victim in a position of isolation and greater vulnerability, creating the opportunity for the separate offence of rape to be committed. Weighing the relatively short duration of the abduction and the lack of violence inflicted against the aggravating factors present, I was of the view that a sentence of eight months’ imprisonment was appropriate for the abduction charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Running of sentences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The Defence asked for the sentences to be run concurrently.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 Under s 359(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), the Court is required to consider whether or not to make a compensation order against an accused in favour of a victim who was injured in respect of his person, character or property. Section 359(1) of the CPC reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Order for payment of compensation</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">359.—(1) The court before which a person is convicted of any offence shall, after the conviction, consider whether or not to make an order for the payment by that person of a sum to be fixed by the court by way of compensation to the person injured, or his representative, in respect of his person, character or property by —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) the offence or offences for which the sentence is passed; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) any offence that has been taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing only.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">173 In addition, under s 359(2) of the CPC, the Court must make a compensation order if it is of the view that it is appropriate to do so:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) If the court is of the view that it is appropriate to make such an order referred to in subsection (1), it must do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The purpose of a compensation order has been well considered and articulated. In <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Meiyun v Public Prosecutor</span> [2014] 3 SLR 299 (“<span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Meiyun</span>”), the Court reiterated that “compensation orders are meant solely to provide redress to the victim and are not intended to punish the offender” (at [56]). Further, in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Donohue </span><span class="font-italic">Enilia</span> [2005] 1 SLR(R) 220 (“<span class="font-italic">Donohue </span><span class="font-italic">Enilia</span>”), the Court established that there must be a causal connection between the offence committed by the accused and the injury, loss, or damage suffered by the victim before a compensation order can be made (at [22]). Such injury, loss, or damage should also be readily ascertainable and not subject to significant dispute (<span class="font-italic">Donohue </span><span class="font-italic">Enilia</span> at [24]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">175 In assessing whether the compensation order sought by the Prosecution was appropriate in the present case, I was aware that compensation orders are most suitable and are usually ordered where the victim has grounds to commence a civil suit against the offender but faces practical difficulties such as the lack of expenses to do so (see <span class="font-italic">Soh</span><span class="font-italic"> Meiyun</span> at [56], <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v AOB</span> [2011] 2 SLR 793 at [23]–[24]; <span class="font-italic">Donohue </span><span class="font-italic">Enilia </span>at [19]). There was no suggestion that the Victim in the present case was unable to commence a civil suit due to impecuniosity. In addition, no precedents in which a compensation order was made in relation to a sexual offence were brought to my attention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">176 Nevertheless, on the facts of the present case, I was satisfied that the making of a compensation order was appropriate. First, the sum involved was such that it would not have been practicable for the Victim to seek civil redress from the Accused. Second, there was a clear direct link between the medical expenses for which compensation was sought, and the offences committed by the Accused. Third, the Accused did not dispute the monetary sum or the making of a compensation order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">177 In the circumstances, I was of the view that a compensation order of $76 would be appropriate and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose of such orders to provide redress to the victim rather than to punish the accused. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">178 Under s 360(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) of the CPC, the Court may direct that a person suffer imprisonment for a certain term in default of payment of the compensation sum. Section 360(1)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Provisions as to money payable as compensation</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">360.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this Code, where any person is, under this Code, for any reason whatsoever, ordered to pay any sum of money by way of compensation, the court making the order may at any time before that sum has been paid in full, in its discretion, do all or any of the following things:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) direct that in default of payment of the compensation sum, that person must suffer imprisonment for a certain term, which imprisonment must be consecutive with any other imprisonment to which he may be sentenced or to which he may be liable under a commutation of sentence; … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Accordingly, I ordered that one day’s imprisonment be imposed in default of payment of the compensation sum of $76. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Miscellaneous matters</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 At the end of his testimony in Court, the Victim’s father made certain remarks about the impact that the Accused’s conduct had caused to his daughter, [W], and the family.
