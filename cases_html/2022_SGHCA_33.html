The appellant appeals the decision of the Judge of the General Division of the High Court (the “Judge”) handed down orally in <span class="font-italic">Mah</span><span class="font-italic"> Sau Cheong v Ng Koon Yee Mickey</span> HC/S 506/2018 (28 April 2021)<span class="font-italic"> </span>(the “Judgment”).

As the proceedings progressed, Ng eventually conceded that he was liable for the Disbursed Sums, but claimed that his liability should be set off against a sum that Mah owed to him under the SPA (the Judgment at [2]–[3]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Under the SPA, Ng agreed to sell his then-5% shareholding in Enersave International (HK) Ltd (“Enersave International”) to Mah. Enersave International was the parent company of Xianda Holdings (HK) Ltd, which in turn owned Xianda (Tianjin Seawater Resources Development Co Ltd) (the “Xianda SPV”). These related companies were corporate vehicles used to carry out the Nangang Project, which concerned the production of desalinated seawater and other types of water products in Nangang (the “Nangang Project”) (the Judgment at [5]). The Nangang Project was initially founded by Ng and two other colleagues (the “Founding Members”).

Ng responded that Mah had no right to terminate the SPA as the Closing Date had in fact materialised. Even if Mah had such a right, the right had not been properly exercised as Mah did not give him a valid notice of termination. Further and alternatively, Mah had breached his duty to cooperate and was therefore precluded from terminating the SPA. He therefore denied that he was liable to repay the Tranche 1 and 2 Payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Ng further submitted that Mah’s obligation to make the Tranche 3 Payment had been triggered upon the signing of the Operational Agreement, and therefore counterclaimed against Ng for the Tranche 3 Payment, less any amounts he owed to Mah under the Agreements. In respect of set-off, Ng argued that the defence of legal set-off would operate by law to extinguish Mah’s claim. Alternatively, the court’s orders for Ng to pay the Disbursed Sums and for Mah to make the Tranche 3 Payment would be set off against each other as a matter of practicality. There was therefore no need to consider whether Mah’s claim would be extinguished by equitable set-off; but Ng claimed that he would have been able to show, in any event, that there was a close connection between the Disbursed Sums and the counterclaim such that it would be manifestly unjust for the sums not to be set off against each other. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Decision below </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Judge found that Mah had validly terminated the SPA and was thereby entitled to reclaim the Tranche 1 and 2 Payments.

The Judge rejected Ng’s contention that Article 4.7, in requiring the Closing Date to “materialise”, only meant that the signing of the Operational Agreement” had to be a “practical likelihood” by the Deadline (the Judgment at [18]–[19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Second, Mah had properly exercised his right to terminate the SPA. The Judge rejected Ng’s submission that Mah’s purported notice of termination by way of the 21 October Letter was ineffective because Mah’s right to terminate the SPA had not arisen at the time, and that Mah did not give notice to terminate thereafter. The Judge held that this case had not been pleaded by Ng. Assuming that Mah was required to give notice to Ng that he was terminating the SPA, the letter would be deemed to have reached Ng on 26 October 2016 pursuant to Article 4.5, which was after the Deadline (the Judgment at [22]–[23]). Article 4.5 provided that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Any notice</span>, direction or other instrument aforesaid, if delivered shall be deemed to have been given or made on the date on which it was delivered or [<span class="font-weight-bold">if] mailed shall be deemed to have been given or made on the third business day following the day on which it was mailed</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added by the Judge] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Third, the Judge found that Mah did not breach his duty to take reasonable steps to procure the signing of the Operational Agreement by the Deadline. Even though Mah had fixed the signing of the agreement on a date that was <span class="font-italic">after </span>the Deadline, the objective evidence did not show that Mah could reasonably have procured the signing on an earlier date (the Judgment at [26]–[30]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Given that Mah had validly terminated the SPA, it would follow that he was not liable for the Tranche 3 Payment. It would also follow that there was nothing against which Mah’s claim for the Disbursed Sums could be set off. The Judge therefore found that Ng was liable to repay Mah the Disbursed Sums under the Agreements, as well as the Tranche 1 and 2 Payments under the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Parties’ cases on appeal </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Notice of termination </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In respect of whether Mah had given Ng notice of termination, Ng submitted that Article 4.7 did not provide for automatic termination of the SPA but instead gave Mah a discretion to terminate it. In order to exercise this discretion, Mah had to specifically communicate to Ng his decision to terminate the SPA. However, the 21 October Letter did not constitute such valid communication for two reasons. First, the letter did not constitute a clear and unequivocal notice of termination, but was merely an expression of intent. Second, the letter had no effect as it was sent <span class="font-italic">before </span>the right to terminate the SPA had accrued. In this regard, Ng submitted that the deeming provision in Article 4.5 could not affect the substantive validity of a notice. He also disputed that the 21 October Letter was sent by registered mail, as there was no factual basis to support this finding. The Judge had also presumed that Mah’s notice of termination would take effect upon receipt by Ng, but this was not a foregone conclusion as Mah did not plead that the 21 October Letter took effect from 26 October 2016. Finally, if two identical notices are served through different modes, the receipt of the earlier notice would be taken as the date or time of service. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 In response, Mah argued that the Judge had rightly found that Article 4.7 gave him the right to terminate the SPA. According to Mah, it followed from such a right that he did not have to give notice of termination. There was also no provision in the SPA that required Mah to issue a notice. Even if, taking Ng’s case at its highest, Mah had to exercise his discretion to terminate the SPA, Mah had provided proper and valid notice of termination to Ng by way of his 21 October Letter.

First, Mah argued that the wording of the 21 October Letter itself made that clear, as it stated that the SPA <span class="font-italic">shall </span>be terminated upon the occurrence of a certain event, namely the Closing Date not materialising. Second, a notice would be invalid if issued prematurely only in cases where (i) there was an express provision in the contract that notice of termination must be given in the event of a default or (ii) a premature notice would cause prejudice to the defaulting party, such as causing him to have less time to remedy the breach. On the facts, there was no requirement for notice to be given under the SPA. Even if the notice had been issued prematurely, no prejudice had been caused to Ng in any event since termination was to be exercised at Mah’s sole discretion<span class="font-italic">.</span>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The prevention principle had been triggered as Mah had breached his duty to cooperate under the SPA, under which he was obliged to take steps to get the Operational Agreement signed by 24 October 2016. Ng cited the Judge’s finding that Mah was required to take reasonable steps to procure the signing of the agreement by 24 October, and submitted that this finding was consistent with the express term in Article 4.2 of the SPA and with case law. Mah had breached this duty as he had taken no steps to ensure the agreement would be signed by 24 October. Ng further argued that any doubt regarding whether the agreement could reasonably have been signed by 24 October should be resolved in favour of Ng, and that an adverse inference should be drawn against Mah as he had committed an egregious breach of discovery obligations. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Further or alternatively, Mah could not rely on the lapse of the Deadline to terminate the SPA, as it was his own action that caused the lapse. As it was Mah’s decision to have the signing of the Operational Agreement coincide with the visit of then-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak (“PM Najib”), which rendered the signing of the agreement by 24 October an impossibility, he could not derive any rights flowing from that impossibility which he unilaterally created. Mah’s act had therefore set time at large, such that he could not terminate the SPA before 3 November 2016. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Finally, Ng submitted that Mah’s right to terminate the SPA had not arisen, as the word “materialise” in Article 4.7, “as a matter of plain English”, should mean “to make material” or to “come into perceptible existence”. If the word had been so interpreted, the Closing Date would have materialised by 21 October 2016 at the latest, when PM Najib confirmed his arrival on 3 November 2016. As the word “materialise” had been inserted by Mah in a provision intended solely for his benefit, applying the <span class="font-italic">contra proferent</span><span class="font-italic">em </span>rule, any uncertainly in its meaning should be construed against Mah. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In response, Mah submitted that Article 4.2 did not expressly provide that he had a duty to cooperate and that, in any event, Ng’s pleaded case was that such a duty was implied. Even if he had a duty to cooperate, he did not breach such a duty. Mah submitted that he had invested a significant amount of money into the Nangang Project and, therefore, it would make no commercial sense for him to delay the project. Ng’s case that Mah had taken no steps to ensure that the Operational Agreement would be signed by 24 October 2016 was inconsistent with the evidence and the Judge’s findings of fact. Finally, Mah submitted that the word “materialise” in Article 4.7 should mean to “occur” or “take place”, as any other interpretation would be too uncertain and would not represent the parties’ intentions at the time the SPA was negotiated and executed. As such, the Closing Date did not materialise by the Deadline. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Set-off </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Ng argued that, if he succeeded in any of his arguments such that the SPA was not terminated, he would be entitled to the Tranche 3 Payment and the defence of set-off would apply.

Whether a contract would be automatically terminated upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specified event is dependent on the construction of the contract. For example, in <span class="font-italic">New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v Société des Ateliers et </span><span class="font-italic">Chantiers de France </span>[1919] AC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd</span>”), the builders entered into a contract to construct a steamer for a shipping company. The contract provided that should the builders be unable to deliver the steamer by a stipulated date, the contract would become void, and all moneys paid by the shipping company would be returned. Lord Finlay LC and Lord Atkinson<span class="font-italic"> </span>reasoned that, considering the plain wording and natural meaning of the clause, the contract would become void when the stipulated deadline was not met, subject to the principle that a party shall not take advantage of his own wrong (at 8–11). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 In contrast, Article 4.7 of the SPA gave Mah the sole <span class="font-italic">discretion</span> to terminate if the Closing Date did not materialise by the Deadline. On its plain wording, the SPA afforded Mah a <span class="font-italic">choice</span> as to whether to terminate the SPA upon the Closing Date not materialising. It would follow that this discretion had to be exercised and communicated to Ng. Nothing in the wording of the SPA suggested that the agreement would be terminated automatically should the Deadline not be met. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Mah relied on the 21 October Letter as his notice to Ng that he had terminated the SPA. Ng submitted that the letter was invalid because it was sent before Mah’s right to terminate the SPA had accrued. In our view, the substance of Ng’s submission was that Mah’s termination of the SPA on 21 October 2016 was invalid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 In <span class="font-italic">Afovos</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping v Pagnan </span>[1983] 1 WLR 195 (“<span class="font-italic">Afovos</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping</span>”), the plaintiff owners let a ship to the defendant charterers under a charterparty. Clause 5 of the charterparty stated that payment of the hire was to be made in accordance with stipulated conditions, “otherwise failing the punctual and regular payment of the hire … the owners shall be at liberty to withdraw the vessel from the service of the charterers”. Clause 31 further provided that “when hire is due and not received the owners before exercising the option of withdrawing the vessel from the charterparty will give charterers 48 hours notice, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded and will not withdraw the vessel if the hire is paid within these 48 hours”. On the last day of paying the instalment for the hire, the plaintiff owners purported to exercise their rights under Clause 31 by sending a notice through their agents to the defendant charterers as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Owners have instructed us that in case we do not receive the hire which is due today, to give charterers notice as per clause 31 of the charterparty for withdrawal of the vessel from their service. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The House of Lords held that the notice given was invalid as it had been issued before the charterers had breached their obligation to pay the hire. Lord Hailsham (with whom the rest of the House agreed) explained his reasoning as follows (at 199):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Both the grammatical meaning of clause 31 and the policy considerations underlying the contract require that the moment of time at which the 48 hours’ notice must be given did not arise until after the moment of time at which, apart from the clause, the right of withdrawal would have accrued. … The notice can only be given “when hire is due and not received,” which cannot arise before the time postulated by the answer given to the first question (ie, the time when the right of withdrawal would have arisen under the charter) (whatever that answer may be), and notice can only be given when there is (or apart from the clause 31 would be) already in existence, an “option” capable of exercise “withdrawing the vessel from the charterparty,” and that option can only be exercised after the arrival of the same point of time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The notice given by the plaintiff owners in <span class="font-italic">Afovos</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping</span> was similar to that given by Mah in the 21 October Letter, in that it indicated their intention to exercise the option under the contract (in <span class="font-italic">Afovos</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping</span>, to withdraw the vessel) if the stipulated condition (payment of the hire) remained unfulfilled at the point when the right to exercise such option arose. However, the House of Lords considered that the “grammatical wording” of the relevant clause, <span class="font-italic">as well as</span> the policy considerations surrounding the 48 hours’ notice, were such that notice could only be given after the right to withdraw the vessel had arisen. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In <span class="font-italic">Wardley v Datin Chong Mooi Lan</span><span class="font-italic"> and another (administratrix and administrator of the estate of Dato Tong Lee Hwa, deceased) </span>[1993] 1 SLR(R) 469 (“<span class="font-italic">Wardley</span>”), the appellant Wardley agreed to sell a property to one Dato Tong Lee Hwa or his agreed assignee. The court found that cl 29 of the Law Society’s Conditions of Sale 1981 (“Society’s Conditions”) applied to the sale of the property. Clause 29(2) of the Society’s Conditions provided that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">If the sale shall not be completed on the date fixed for completion either party may on that date or at any time thereafter (unless the contract shall first have been rescinded or become void) give to the other party notice in writing to complete the transaction in accordance with this condition</span> but such notice shall only be effective if the party giving the same at the time the notice is sent is either ready, able and willing to complete or is not so ready, able and willing by reason of the default or omission of the other party to the contract. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The court found that the notice served by Wardley was premature and ineffective, as Wardley served his notice to complete before the date fixed for completion had passed. Wardley served his notice on 8 December 1984, which was also the date fixed for completion. At that point, his right to serve the notice had not arisen and he was therefore not entitled to serve the notice to complete (at [14]). The court reasoned as follows (at [14]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… To our mind, <span class="font-italic">the provision of sub-cl (2) of cl 29 is very clear.</span> The commencement part of sub-cl (2) provides for a contingency, namely: if the sale shall not be completed on the date fixed for completion, and<span class="font-italic"> only on the occurrence of such contingency, does the right of either party (to the contract) to give to the other the notice to complete, which is contained in the ensuing part of that subclause, arise. </span><span class="font-italic">… </span>In our opinion, this is the proper construction of sub-cl (2). <span class="font-italic">The right of the appellants to serve the notice to complete under sub-cl (2) of cl 29 would only arise, if, as provided in sub</span><span class="font-italic">-cl (2), the sale is not completed on 8 December 1984. </span>At the time when the appellants served the notice to complete, the date fixed for completion had not passed and the event that the sale was not completed on the date fixed for completion had not occurred. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 The court in <span class="font-italic">Wardley </span>thus construed cl 29(2) of the conditions and found that the right to serve the notice to complete would arise only if the sale were not completed on the stipulated date. Prior to the passing of the date fixed for completion, any notice served would be ineffectual. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In <span class="font-italic">Maredelanto</span><span class="font-italic"> Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH, The Mihalis Angelos </span>[1971] 1 QB 164 (“<span class="font-italic">Maredelanto</span>”), a ship was chartered to proceed to Haiphong to load a cargo. Clause 11 of the charterparty provided that: “Should the vessel not be ready to load (whether in berth or not) on or before July 20, 1965, charterers have the option of cancelling this contract, such option to be declared, if demanded, at least 48 hours before vessel’s expected arrival at port of loading”. On 17 July, the charterers purported to cancel the charterparty on grounds of force majeure, though on appeal, they argued that they were entitled to do so under Clause 11. The majority of the Court of Appeal for England and Wales (“EWCA”) found that they were not entitled to cancel the charterparty on 17 July pursuant to Clause 11. The majority held that the charterers were given an option, for their benefit, and that this option would be exercisable only when the condition was fulfilled, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, if the vessel was not ready to load on 20 July. Megaw LJ (with whom Davies LJ agreed) reasoned as follows (at 208):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It might perhaps be permissible to give the charterers' construction to the words of the clause, though I think that it would properly be described as a bold construction, if so to do would make the clause a substantially more sensible instrument for carrying out the general purpose for which it was introduced. <span class="font-italic">But I think that counsel for the owners is right in his submission that the bold construction - the reading in of the words which are not there does not have that effect. It involves reading in also a thought which was not present to the minds of the parties and which in my view is not necessary to give the clause sensible legal and practical effect.</span> If the charterers are confident that the vessel is going to miss her cancelling date, and for some reason are minded to put an end to the charterparty before that date has arrived, there is nothing whatever to prevent them from asking the owners to agree that the charterparty should be cancelled. That does not require clause 11. … Without any forced construction of the clause, the charterers can, if they are confident of the non-arrival of the vessel by the cancelling date, go ahead and make whatever arrangements they wish in anticipation of exercising their option under the clause when the cancelling date arrives. Of course, if they prove wrong in their forecast of the vessel's arrival, and if the vessel in fact, after all, makes the cancelling date, the charterers will be in trouble if they have already made other arrangements. But that is not a good ground for giving a bold interpretation to the clause. … <span class="font-italic">No conceivable harm would have been done to them if they had waited until July 20, and then invoked the cancelling clause. The bold construction is called for by the charterers, not because the natural construction leads to practical difficulty, but in order to try to save themselves from the consequences of their own error</span><span class="font-italic"> …</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The above cases thus demonstrate two key points. First, in determining when a right to exercise an option arises, the court’s primary concern is with the construction of the contractual clauses in question. Based on the wording of the clauses in each of the above cases, such a right could only be exercised after the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain specific events. Any notice that was given prior to when such a right had accrued was deemed to be premature and invalid. This was the case even if the notice, like that in <span class="font-italic">Afovos</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping</span>, was conditional upon the non-occurrence of the specified event. Second, in construing the relevant clauses, the courts took into account the context of each contract. In <span class="font-italic">Afovos</span><span class="font-italic"> Shipping</span>, the House of Lords considered the policy considerations in relation to the 48 hours’ timeframe in deciding whether the notice given could constitute a valid notice of withdrawal. In <span class="font-italic">Ma</span><span class="font-italic">redelanto</span>, the court similarly considered whether the “natural construction” of the contract would lead to practical difficulty or result in “conceivable harm” to the charterers, if they were not allowed to cancel the charterparty prior to the stipulated date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In our judgment, the above cases are equally applicable to the question of whether Mah’s termination of the SPA was valid. It is apparent from the wording of Article 4.7 (as amended by the deadline extensions) that Mah’s right to terminate the SPA only arose <span class="font-italic">after </span>24 October 2016, if the Closing Date did not materialise by then. On the facts, Mah’s termination of the SPA on 21 October 2016 was invalid because the specified event (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the Operational Agreement not being signed by 24 October 2016) had not occurred. Therefore, Mah’s termination of the SPA on 21 October 2016 was invalid. Consequently, the 21 October Letter had no effect since it was nothing more than notice of an invalid termination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In any event, the 21 October Letter was premature. The notice of termination could be given only after a valid termination of the SPA. As stated above, Mah’s right to terminate the SPA only arose <span class="font-italic">after </span>24 October 2016. Consequently, Mah’s right to terminate the SPA arose only at that time, and any notice given prior to that was ineffectual. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 As for the context of the SPA, requiring Mah to give notice to Ng only after the Deadline would not cause any prejudice to him. In fact, the Judge had found (and we agree) that Mah was in the driver’s seat in the negotiations for the signing of the Operational Agreement. He was therefore the party to the SPA who had the requisite first-hand information in relation to the signing. Like the charterers in <span class="font-italic">Maredelanto</span>, there was nothing precluding Mah from getting Ng to agree to an earlier termination date, if Mah was certain that the Operational Agreement would not be signed by the Deadline. There is no reason to read Article 4.7 in a manner that would allow for early termination, in order to give it legal or practical effect. Further, given Mah’s role in the negotiations, it would have been reasonable for Ng to believe that Mah was still working towards the signing of the OA, and that the 21 October Letter merely evinced an intention to terminate which Mah might not necessarily follow through on. As such, with reference to the wording of Article 4.7 and the context of the SPA, we are of the view that the 21 October Letter, having been issued before 24 October 2016, was premature and invalid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The Judge was further of the view that pursuant to Article 4.5, Ng would be deemed to have received the 21 October Letter on 26 October 2016, which was after the Deadline had passed. In this regard, Article 4.5, which we have reproduced at [14] above but repeat here for convenience, provided that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Any notice, direction or other instrument aforesaid, if delivered shall be deemed to have been given or made on the date on which it was delivered or if mailed shall be deemed to have been given or made on the third business day following the day on which it was mailed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Ng argued that the Judge was not entitled to make the assumption that the 21 October Letter had been sent to him by registered mail, as this factual premise was unsupported by any evidence and rested only upon Mah’s bare assertion. This was relevant as the deeming provision in Article 4.5 only applied to a notice that had been mailed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 We agree with Ng that Mah had not proven that the 21 October Letter had been sent to him by registered mail. The evidence showed that, on 21 October, Ms Ayu emailed Ng, stating that:

Kindly acknowledge receipt by return email and the same would also be delivered to you via registered post. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Ms Ayu then enclosed the 21 October Letter in the said email. However, there is no evidence that the 21 October Letter was in fact mailed to Ng <span class="font-italic">via</span> registered post, and Ms Ayu had not been called as a witness. We also agree with Ng that the issue of whether Mah had mailed the 21 October Letter had not been put in issue, either in the pleadings, opening submissions or during the trial. Thus, in our view, the Judge was not entitled to assume that the letter had been sent to Ng <span class="font-italic">via</span> mail, and Article 4.5 therefore could not assist Mah. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Assuming, <span class="font-italic">ex </span><span class="font-italic">hypothesi</span>, that Article 4.5 had been applicable, its effect would have been that Ng would be deemed to have<span class="font-italic"> received</span> the mailed copy of the 21 October Letter on 26 October 2016. However, with respect, the deeming provision has no application where the 21 October Letter was invalid because Mah’s right to terminate the SPA had not accrued as of 21 October 2016. Article 4.5 deemed the 20 October Letter as notice given on 26 October 2016; however, the letter remained notice of an invalid termination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 For completeness, we note that Ng’s arguments focus on the validity of the notice of termination, but Ng also argues that there was merely an expression of intent at best. In substance, Ng contends that there was no decision to terminate and thus he has also challenged the termination decision itself. In our view, Ng has conflated the arguments on termination and notice of termination, which engage different considerations. Be that as it may, we have found that notice of termination was required in this case, and even if notice was not required, as we have explained above, the termination would still have been premature on the facts and thus invalid to begin with.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Putting aside the questions of whether the termination itself was premature and whether the notice to terminate was valid, we proceed further to determine the issue of whether Mah was entitled to terminate the SPA.

Further or alternatively, Mah could not rely on the lapse of the Deadline to terminate the SPA as it was his act of getting the signing to coincide with PM Najib’s visit that caused the lapse. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We begin by examining the applicable legal principles in relation to the prevention principle.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Prevention principle </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The general position in English law </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 As noted by Professors Goh Yihan SC, Lee Pey Woan and Tham Chee Ho in “Contract Law” (2020) 21 SAL Ann Rev 403 (“<span class="font-italic">Contract Law</span><span class="font-italic"> (SAL Ann Rev)</span>”), the prevention principle is generally applied in the construction context.

Such clauses were not, as is sometimes thought, designed to provide the contractor with excuses for delay, but rather to protect employers, by retaining their right both to a fixed (albeit extended) completion date and to deduct liquidated damages for any delay beyond that extended completion date.</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">North Midland Building </span>itself, the defendant employer and the claimant contractor entered into an agreement, which contained a clause providing that, where there was a delay caused by an event for which the contractor was <span class="font-italic">not</span> responsible, and such delay was concurrent with another delay for which the contractor <span class="font-italic">was</span> responsible, that delay would not be taken into account when calculating any extension of time to the completion date that would be given to the contractor (cl 2.25.1.3(b)). The court found that cl 2.25.1.3(b) was unambiguous and allocated the risk of concurrent delay to the contractor, to which the parties were entitled to agree. The clause therefore could not be struck down or rendered inoperable by the prevention principle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In <span class="font-italic">Trollope and Colls Ltd v North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board </span>[1973] 1 WLR 601 (“<span class="font-italic">Trollope</span>”), Lord Pearson (with whom Lord Diplock, Lord Guest and Lord Cross agreed) endorsed this section of Lord Denning MR’s decision in the Court of Appeal (at 607):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It is well settled that in building contracts — and in other contracts too — when there is a stipulation for work to be done in a limited time, if one party by his conduct — it may be quite legitimate conduct, such as ordering extra work — renders it impossible or impracticable for the other party to do his work within the stipulated time, then the one whose conduct caused the trouble can no longer insist upon strict adherence to the time stated. He cannot claim any penalties or liquidated damages for non-completion in that time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd v Honeywell Control Systems Ltd (No 2) </span>[2007] EWHC 447 (TCC), the High Court considered <span class="font-italic">Dodd v </span><span class="font-italic">Churton</span>, <span class="font-italic">Holme v Guppy</span>, <span class="font-italic">Trollope</span> as well as <span class="font-italic">Peak Construction (Liverpool) Ltd v McKinney Foundations Ltd </span>(1970) 69 LGR 1, and derived several propositions in relation to the prevention principle, including that “[a]ctions by the employer which are perfectly legitimate under a construction contract may still be characterised as prevention, if those actions cause delay beyond the contractual completion date” (at [56]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The prevention principle thus came to be developed in the context of construction disputes. Specifically, the principle was invoked in relation to the question of whether time would be set at large if the employer’s act of prevention had caused a delay, such that the employer could no longer insist on the contractually stipulated date for completion; and relatedly, whether the employer would still be entitled to claim liquidated damages. This position has also been helpfully summarised thus in <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>(Huge Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 34th Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span>”) (at para 39-115):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Construction contracts almost invariably stipulate a period or date for commencement and/or completion. The contractor must be afforded the opportunity to carry out the work within the stipulated period. Any act of prevention, such as the ordering of variations or late access to working areas, will release the contractor from the fixed period unless the contract provides machinery for adjustment of the time period. The major consequence of time becoming “at large” is that by operation of the so-called “prevention principle” the employer thereby loses its ability to rely upon any liquidated and ascertained damages clause in the contract. The prevention principle is based on the notion that a promisee cannot insist upon the performance of an obligation which he has prevented the promisor from performing. <span class="font-italic">In a building contract, acts of prevention (such as variation instructions) do not have to amount to breaches of contract in order to trigger the application of the prevention principle.

The commissioners sought to determine the contract on the basis of a contractual term that gave them the right to do so should the contractor fail to “exercise due diligence and make such due progress as would enable the works to be effectually and efficiently completed at the time stipulated”. The majority of the court found that the commissioners’ failure to issue instructions within a reasonable time to the contractor, such that the contractor was unable to begin his work, would amount to a breach of an implied term to do their part within a reasonable time. As the delay had been occasioned by their own breach, the commissioners could not determine the contract. It is “a principle very well established at common law, that no person can take advantage of the non-fulfilment of a condition the performance of which has been hindered by himself … and also that he cannot sue for a breach of contract occasioned by his own breach of contract, so that any damages he would otherwise have been entitled to for the breach of the contract to him would immediately be recoverable back as damages arising from his own breach of contract” (<span class="font-italic">Roberts</span> at 325–326). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 In <span class="font-italic">New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd</span>, the House of Lords upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal that the builders of a steamer were not precluded from alleging that the contract was void when the stipulated deadline for construction could not be met, as the builders were prevented by causes beyond their control from completing construction (see [34] above). Lord Finlay LC explained his decision as follows (at 8): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Questions of this sort have often arisen in case of provisions that a lease should be void on non-payment of rent or nonperformance of covenants by the lessee. It has always been held that the lessee could not take advantage of his own act or default to avoid the lease, and the expression generally employed has been that such proviso makes the lease voidable by the lessor, or void at the option of the lessor. The decisions on the point are uniform, and are really illustrations of the very old principle laid down by Lord Coke (Co. Litt. 206b) that a man shall not be allowed to take advantage of a condition which he himself brought about. In the present case the builder was in no way responsible for the non-completion within eighteen months, and there is no reason why clause 12 should not be interpreted according to the natural meaning of the words so as to render the contract void.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 In <span class="font-italic">Alghussein</span><span class="font-italic"> Establishment v Eton College </span>[1988] 1 WLR 587 (“<span class="font-italic">Alghussein</span>”), the House of Lords considered that it is “well established by a long line of authority that a contracting party will not in normal circumstances be entitled to take advantage of his own breach as against the other party” (at 591). This principle applied whether a party was seeking to take advantage of his own wrong to obtain a benefit under a continuing contract or to avoid a contract and thereby escape his obligations (at 594). On the facts in <span class="font-italic">Alghussein</span>, the respondent landlords entered into an agreement with the appellants’ predecessor in title, who later assigned their rights under the agreement to the appellants. The agreement was for the grant of a 99-year lease of land on which a development was to be erected. Under the agreement, the tenants were required to use their best endeavours to complete the development. However, cl 4 of the agreement provided that if the development remained incomplete by a specified date for any reason due to the wilful default of the tenants, the lease should forthwith be granted and completed. The House of Lords found that despite the wording of cl 4, there was no clear express provision in the agreement to exclude the presumption that it was not the intention of the parties that either should be entitled to rely on his own breach to obtain a benefit. Their Lordships upheld the decision of the court below that the tenants, who were in wilful default resulting in the development not being completed by the specified date, could not rely on cl 4 to insist on the grant of a lease to them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Citing <span class="font-italic">Roberts</span>, <span class="font-italic">New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd</span> and <span class="font-italic">Alghussein</span>, para 6-145 of <span class="font-italic">Keating on Construction Contracts </span>(Stephen Furst and Sir Vivian Ramsey gen eds) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11th Ed, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">Keating</span>”) states thus:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where one party has failed to perform a condition of the contract, the other party cannot rely on its non-performance if it was caused by its own wrongful acts. … To attract the principle that a party to a contract is not permitted to take advantage of its own breach of duty, the duty must be one that is owed to the other party under the contract. A duty, whether contractual or non-contractual, owed to a stranger to the contract does not suffice. The principle is probably a rule of construction and not an absolute rule of law.

This presumption applies only to acts or omissions which constitute a breach by that party of an express or implied contractual obligation, or (possibly) of a non-contractual duty, owed by them to the other party. Breach of a duty, whether contractual or non-contractual, owed to a stranger to the contract will not suffice. However, such a “principle of construction” appears to be somewhat different in nature from the principle that a document will be construed against the grantor.

She considered that an act of prevention is one which “operates to prevent, impede or otherwise make it more difficult for a contractor to complete the works by the date stipulated in the contract”, citing Chow Kok Fong, <span class="font-italic">Law</span> <span class="font-italic">and Practice of Construction Contracts </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia, 3rd Ed, 2004) (“<span class="font-italic">Chow on</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction Contracts</span>”) at p 401. The “legal consequence of an act of prevention is that the date for completion originally stipulated in the contract ceases to be the operating date for the completion of the works”. In addition, the “employer’s right to claim or deduct liquidated damages is lost since there is no longer a valid date for completion from which such damages can be calculated” (at [34]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 In that case,<span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>the plaintiff homeowner signed a memorandum of agreement (“MOA”) with the first defendant, a design and build contractor, for the latter to design and construct a semi-detached house. The plaintiff claimed that the completion was delayed, to which the first defendant argued that time had been set at large by virtue of the plaintiff’s acts of prevention. Prakash J found that the plaintiff homeowner’s actions prevented the works under the MOA from being completed by the stipulated date. The homeowner’s decision not to work with the recommended subcontractor and the amount of time taken to find a substitute was the main cause of the delay. Whilst the homeowner was entitled to find a substitute, he must have realised that his decision had timing implications.

Therefore, we are of the view that the prevention principle would potentially apply in this case. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 Having found thus, the question before us is whether Mah had committed a breach of the SPA and was the cause of the Operational Agreement not having been signed by the Deadline, such that he would be disentitled from relying on Article 4.7 to terminate the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether Mah had an implied duty to cooperate </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 In order for the prevention principle to operate, it would have to be shown, as stated in <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span>, that the contractual right or benefit that Mah was asserting or claiming was a direct result of his prior breach of contract. The relevant wrong which Ng seeks to rely on is the breach of an implied duty to cooperate.

In contrast, terms implied in law are implied as a “necessary incident of a definable category of contractual relationship” (see Lord Bridge in <span class="font-italic">Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board </span>[1992] 1 AC 294 at 307). The authors of <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts </span>note that “many such terms have become standardised for particular classes of contract, so that it is somewhat artificial to attribute them to the unexpressed intention of the parties to a particular contract in dispute” (at para 16-005). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 As noted in <span class="font-italic">The One Suites</span>, the implication of a duty to cooperate can be traced back to the case of <span class="font-italic">Mackay v Dick</span> (1881) 6 App Cas 251 (“<span class="font-italic">Mackay</span>”). In <span class="font-italic">Mackay</span>, Lord Blackburn reasoned that (at 263):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I think I may safely say, as a general rule, that where in a written contract it appears that both parties have agreed that something shall be done, which cannot effectually be done unless both concur in doing it, the construction of the contract is that each agrees to do all that is necessary to be done on his part for the carrying out of that thing, though there may be no express words to that effect. What is the part of each must depend on circumstances.<span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In our judgment, a duty to cooperate is a term that is implied in fact and not in law. Given the myriad factual situations in which a contract could be said to have a provision requiring both parties to “concur in doing” something to render the contract effectual, we do not think there is a “definable category of contractual relationship” in which such a term can be implied as a “necessary incident”. Further, whether a duty to cooperate should be implied is dependent on the obligations imposed on each party in each particular contract, the intentions of the parties at the point of entering into the contract, and whether such a duty had to be implied to give the contract efficacy. These principles have been consistently applied in precedent cases (see [95]–[104] below). The inquiry is therefore a fact-specific one, rather than one to be imposed in every contract in a particular class on the basis of wider policy considerations.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 We note that Lord Blackburn in <span class="font-italic">Mackay </span>appears to suggest that the duty to cooperate is a “general rule” that would apply to a class of contracts in which “both parties have agreed that something shall be done, which cannot effectually be done unless both concur in doing”. In a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in <span class="font-italic">Adaz</span><span class="font-italic"> Nominees Pty Ltd v Castleway Pty Ltd </span>[2020] VSCA 201 (“<span class="font-italic">Adaz</span>”), the court appeared to consider the duty as one to be implied in law (affirmed by the same court in <span class="font-italic">Bensons Property Group Pty Ltd v Key Infrastructure Australia Pty Ltd </span>[2021] VSCA 69 at [108]). However, the court reasoned that “‘[n]ecessity’ is the rationale for [its] existence and the circumstance which must be ‘demonstrated’ for [it] to be operative” (<span class="font-italic">Adaz</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [116]), and did not find that it should be a term implied in law on the basis of wider policy considerations. In contrast, Coomaraswamy J in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon and others v Tan Choo </span><span class="font-italic">Suan (in her personal capacity and as executrix of the estate of Tan Kiam Teon, deceased) and others and other matters </span>[2015] SGHC 306 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon</span>”) seemed to consider it as a term to be implied in fact, as he analysed whether it was necessary in the business sense to imply that term so as to give the contract efficacy, and that the parties would have affirmed the existence of this duty had it been suggested to them at the point of entering into the agreement (at [145]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 In our view, Lord Blackburn’s statement in <span class="font-italic">Mackay </span>only identifies the general features of a case where a duty to cooperate would be implied, without going so far as to set out a category of cases to which such a duty would operate by default. We agree with the commentary in Edwin Peel,<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Treitel on The Law of Contract </span>(Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2020) (at para 6-065):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As will be seen below, the defining feature of terms implied in law is that they are implied into all contracts of a particular type. By contrast, terms are implied in fact on the basis of the circumstances of individual contracts. Nevertheless, the same, or similar, circumstances may be repeated and it is on this basis that there is some value in noting some of the leading examples of terms which may be implied in fact, <span class="font-italic">bearing in mind that it does not follow that the courts will always imply the terms in question just because the case before them shares the same broad features.</span> Thus, the courts may imply a term that the parties will “co-operate” to ensure performance where they have agreed that “something shall be done which cannot effectively be done unless both concur in doing it”; similarly, that one party will not do anything “of his own motion” to put an end to any state of circumstances on which the performance of the contract depends. Where the contract confers rights on one party subject to the consent of other, the court may imply a term that such consent must not be withheld arbitrarily or unreasonably, and where a contract is subject to a condition precedent, a term may be implied that neither party must do anything to prevent the occurrence of the event, or that one party must use reasonable efforts to bring the event about. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 In reaching the conclusion that a duty to cooperate must be a term implied in fact, we also recognise the caution sounded by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Giap Hon</span> to imply “terms implied in law” with circumspection; as well as the observations made by the Court in <span class="font-italic">The One Suites </span>as to the uncertainties that still surround the application of this duty, including its interaction with the doctrine of good faith, which has, in the same case, been rejected as a term to be implied in law. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) When a duty to cooperate may be implied </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 As for when such a duty may be implied as well as the scope of such duty, the authors of <span class="font-italic">Chitty</span><span class="font-italic"> on Contracts</span> cited Lord Blackburn in <span class="font-italic">Mackay</span>, and stated that (at para 16-026-3):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the duty to co-operate and the degree of co-operation required is to be determined, not by what is reasonable, but by the obligations imposed – whether expressly or impliedly – upon each party by the agreement itself, and the surrounding circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 We agree with the observations above<span class="font-italic">. </span>First, the implication of a duty to cooperate must accord with the intention of the parties and the bargain struck between them. This is a fact-specific inquiry, dependent on factors such as the parties’ understanding of their contractual obligations at the point of entering into the contract, including those revealed by the contract’s express terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In <span class="font-italic">Mackay </span>itself, the parties entered into a sale and purchase contract for a digging machine, subject to a condition precedent that the seller demonstrate to the buyer via a test that the machine was functioning adequately. Lord Blackburn held that there was an implied duty that the buyer was to cooperate in enabling a fair test to be done. Having failed to cooperate, the buyer could no longer call upon the seller to remove the machine on the ground that the test had not been satisfied. He would therefore have to keep the machine and pay for it (at 264). Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Evergreat</span><span class="font-italic"> Construction</span>, the plaintiff was the main contractor for a construction project, while the defendant was the subcontractor appointed by the plaintiff. Disputes arose between the parties and they agreed to resolve their differences by engaging an independent assessor. Rajah J found that the plaintiff had an obligation to cooperate with the defendant in facilitating the assessment process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 In contrast, in <span class="font-italic">Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd v Cooper</span> [1941] AC 108, the court found that no duty to prevent the fulfilment of an agreement could be implied. In that case, the respondent Cooper introduced prospective purchasers to the appellants for the purchase of their properties. The contract between the parties provided that, if a party introduced by Cooper should buy the properties for at least a certain sum, each of the two appellants would pay a commission to Cooper on the completion of the sale. However, no such sale eventually took place. Cooper argued that, as the proposed purchasers were and remained willing and able to buy the properties for the minimum price, the appellants breached their implied duty to “do nothing to prevent the satisfactory completion of the transaction so as to deprive the respondent of the agreed commission” by declining to close the offer. The House of Lords rejected this argument and reasoned that the proposed implied term did not accord with the parties’ intentions and the express terms of the contract (at 117–118): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The matter may be tested in this way. If such an implied term must be assumed, then this amounts to saying that when the owner gives the agent the opportunity of earning commission on the express terms thus stated, the agent might have added, “From the moment that I produce a duly qualified offeror, you must give up all freedom of choice and carry through the bargain, if you reasonably can, with my nominee,” and the vendor must reply, “of course; that necessarily follows.” <span class="font-italic">But I am by no means satisfied that the vendor would acquiesce in regarding the matter in this light.</span> … The owner is offering to the agent a reward if the agent’s activity helps to bring about an actual sale, but that is no reason why the owner should not remain free to sell his property through other channels. The agent necessarily incurs certain risks, e.g., the risk that his nominee cannot find the purchase price or will not consent to terms reasonably proposed to be inserted in the contract of sale. <span class="font-italic">I think, upon the true construction of the express contract in this case, that the agent also takes the risk of the owner not being willing to conclude the bargain with the agent</span><span class="font-italic">’s nominee.</span> This last risk is ordinarily a slight one, for the owner's reason for approaching the agent is that he wants to sell. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Similarly, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Bee See &amp; Tay v Ong Hun </span><span class="font-italic">Seang and others (trustees of Zion Gospel Mission Ltd) and another appeal </span>[1997] 1 SLR(R) 469 (“<span class="font-italic">Bee See &amp; Tay</span>”) concluded that based on the parties’ understanding at the time of entering into the agreements, there was no basis to imply a duty to cooperate. In that case, the plaintiffs acted as trustees for and on behalf of a company in the purchase of properties from the first to fourth defendants (the “vendors”). The plaintiffs claimed the refund of deposits forfeited by the vendors for non-completion of the sale and purchase agreements, on the basis that there was an implied term that the vendors would cooperate with them to obtain planning approval for change of use, but the vendors had failed to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The court noted that the agreements were not conditional upon approval for change of use being obtained (<span class="font-italic">Bee See &amp; Tay </span>at [54]). The parties had entered into the agreements on the basis that the properties were sold as residential properties, and the vendors were entitled to require that the plaintiffs complete the purchases on that basis (at [57]). As such, the court could not imply any term that the vendors would cooperate with the plaintiffs to obtain planning approval. The court stated (at [58]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… There is simply no room to imply any term, whether in fact or in law, that the vendors would co-operate with the respondents in getting planning approval for change of use. Such a term would go against the very tenor of the contracts, which was that the properties were sold “as is”, and without any proviso or condition as to approval for change of use being obtained. … It is one thing to imply a term or condition for business efficacy, or as an incident of the contract. It is quite another to imply a term to the effect that the vendors would do something which they have bargained that they would not do. The facts in this case speak for themselves.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 Second, where a duty to cooperate is implied, the scope of such a duty is again dependent on the contractual terms and the context of the case. The principle in <span class="font-italic">Mackay </span>that a party would have to do “all that is necessary to be done” should be understood to be limited as such. The following cases illustrate the application of this principle.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 On the facts in <span class="font-italic">Tan Chin Hoon</span>, the parties reached an oral agreement to compromise their disputes (the “Compromise”). The Compromise was subject to a condition precedent that the Attorney-General (“AG”) must consent to the terms of the settlement; however, the AG declined to grant his consent and thus the condition was unfulfilled. The plaintiffs alleged that one of the defendants (“TCS”) had breached an implied duty to cooperate to obtain the AG’s consent to the Compromise. Coomaraswamy J found that a duty to cooperate could be readily implied into the Compromise between the parties, as it was required to give the agreement efficacy, and the parties would have affirmed the existence of such a duty if it had been suggested to them at the point of entering into the Compromise. The implied duty “entails each party doing no more than that which is reasonable in all the circumstances” (at [149]). On the facts, TCS did not breach the implied duty to cooperate, as the duty extended “only to her taking reasonable steps to provide to the AG relevant information which the AG, a neutral third party, required”, and did not require her to do all that was reasonably within her power to <span class="font-italic">persuade </span>the AG to give his consent (at [160]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 In <span class="font-italic">Mona Oil Equipment &amp; Supply Co Ltd v Rhodesia Railways Ltd </span>[1949] 2 All ER 1014, the court held that “in the ordinary business contract, and apart, of course, from express terms, the law can enforce co-operation only in a limited degree – <span class="font-italic">to the extent that is necessary to make the contract workable</span>” [emphasis added] (at 1018). On the facts, the relevant contract between the sellers and buyers contained a term providing that payment could be made against signed confirmation by the buyers’ shipping agents that the oil tanks being sold were at the disposal of the buyers. The buyers’ agents informed the sellers that they would not act until written instructions were received from the buyers; however, the sellers misunderstood that the agents were refusing to act at all and did not approach the agents thereafter. As the contract had not been performed, the sellers brought an action for damages against the buyers for breach of contract, alleging that they had breached an implied duty to “do nothing to prevent or obstruct the performance of the condition of payment”. The court found that there was an implied duty that the buyers had to instruct the agents, as the contract would otherwise be unworkable, and that this had been done. However, removing any misunderstanding between the sellers and the buyers’ agents would be “quite beyond the reach of implied contractual obligation”; and the court “cannot … exact a higher degree of co-operation than that which can be defined by reference to the necessities of the contract” (at 1018). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Although the precise scope of the implied duty is to be determined on the facts of each case, it can be observed from the cases that the scope of such duty would be limited by the express terms of the contract, as well as what is necessary to give the contract efficacy, and is not meant to impose an onerous obligation on the parties to the agreement. This conclusion accords with the Court of Appeal’s holding in <span class="font-italic">The One Suites </span>that where there is an implied term to use reasonable endeavours, the steps that must be taken to satisfy that obligation would depend on all the facts and circumstances of the case itself (at [29]). The Court of Appeal also reiterated that, where relevant, the Court is to have regard to the express terms of the contract itself to determine the scope of such an obligation (at [43]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Application to the facts </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Implication of duty to cooperate and scope of such duty </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 On the facts, we find that Mah did have an implied duty to cooperate.

This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 Applying the first step of the test in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>, there was a gap in the SPA in relation to the obligations of each party, and in particular that of Mah. At the material time, the parties would have assumed that they had the common goal of getting the Operational Agreement signed. According to Mah, he had insisted that the pre-conditions, being the signing of the Operational Agreement and the obtaining of the approval of the Feasibility Study Report, be included in the SPA because the Nangang Project “was not moving forward as expeditiously as [he] was told”, and that the shares in Enersave International were “effectively worth nothing” until the Nangang Project materialised. It would therefore make no “commercial sense for [him] to acquire the shares from [Ng] and/or for [Ng] to ‘walk away’ from the company as a shareholder and the Nangang Project before the said [p]roject kicked off”.

</div> As for Ng, he averred that he did not have any concerns about the signing of the Operational Agreement being made a pre-condition for the Tranche 3 Payment. To him, it was “almost a formality” as the agreement had to be executed before the Xianda SPV could operate the desalination facility and the salt-making plant that were being constructed under the Nangang Project. Thus, if the agreement were not signed, “Mah’s investment in building the Nangang Project would go to waste as he will not be able to reap the profits from the Nangang Project”. Further, Mah thought it would “require a great calamity or blunder of massive proportions” for the agreement not to be signed.

</div> Given both Mah’s and Ng’s descriptions of the state of affairs at the material time, it would seem that both parties had understood that they had a common goal in achieving an early signing of the Operational Agreement, and that there was no necessity to specify obligations on each party in the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 As for the second step of the test in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp</span>, it was necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term to cooperate to give the SPA efficacy. As noted at the outset, the SPA was signed on 13 November 2013 (see [1] above). The evidence showed that Mah was involved in the Nangang Project from that point, despite his attempts at trial to show that he had minimal involvement. In the course of cross-examination, Mah acknowledged that he had approached the Malaysian embassy in China, to push for an investment cooperation agreement to be signed at the China-Malaysia Economic Summit (“Summit”) held on 4 October 2013:

Thus, Mah did not have the obligation to ensure that the Operational Agreement would be signed by the stipulated deadline (or the deadlines which he had earlier extended), but had a duty to make reasonable efforts to achieve signing by the Deadline, and certainly not to hinder or prevent the signing of the Operational Agreement.

It was stated in the Reply, that a meeting had been held between Wang Sheng and Mah in May 2016, at which there was a “breakthrough” in the negotiation process.

There was also no evidence led as to what impact these “sticking points” might foreseeably have had on the profitability of the Nangang Project if they were not resolved. More importantly, the Operational Agreement was eventually signed despite these points remaining ostensibly unresolved. It is undisputed that the Operational Agreement did not contain all the terms that the parties were meant to agree on, as they had intended to sign a further supplementary agreement thereafter, although this was ultimately never signed.

</div> This further points towards the conclusion that the Operational Agreement could in fact have been signed earlier, particularly since most of the terms appear to have been agreed between the parties prior to the Deadline (see also [128] below). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 We turn to the evidence specifically in relation to Mah’s involvement in arranging for former PM Najib’s attendance at the signing of the Operational Agreement. It is undisputed that Mah signed and sent the invite to PM Najib on 5 October 2016. On 21 October, Mah was informed that PM Najib would be travelling to Tianjin on 3 November. On the same day, after PM Najib’s visit was confirmed, Mah sent the 21 October Letter to Ng. By 21 October, therefore, Mah must have known that by fixing the signing of the Operational Agreement on 3 November so that PM Najib could witness the signing, the Deadline would necessarily be breached.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Mah claimed that he had merely extended an invitation to PM Najib on behalf of the Xianda SPV and that he “did not make any subsequent follow ups or arrangements for the former [PM’s] attendance at the signing ceremony”.

If he had intended for PM Najib’s attendance to act as a catalyst for the Operational Agreement to be signed, and this was in fact achieved, there appears to be no reason why he still insisted on pulling out of the SPA.

</div>
</div> In any event, Mah’s conduct had made it impossible for the Operational Agreement to have been signed by the Deadline. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 For the above reasons, we conclude that Mah had breached his implied duty to cooperate under the SPA. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Closing Date had materialised </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 For completeness, Ng argued that the Closing Date would have “materialised” if the signing of the Operational Agreement was imminent and had “come into perceptible existence”. On that basis, Mah’s right to terminate the SPA did not arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In our view, the Judge had rightly rejected Ng’s submission that the Closing Date would have “materialised” as long as it had “come into perceptible existence”. The Judge held that the word “materialise” did not indicate that there only needed to be a “practical likelihood” of such events occurring, and that on a contextual reading of Articles 4.1 and 4.7, Mah’s right to terminate the SPA would arise if the signing of the Operational Agreement and the approval of the Feasibility Study Report were not obtained or did not take place by the Deadline (the Judgment at [18]). There is no basis to adopt Ng’s reading of the term “materialise”, whether on a plain reading of the term or reading it in context of the SPA. In fact, Article 4.1 specifically stated that the Closing Date shall take place on the day that the following were “obtained”: the “<span class="font-italic">signing</span> of the Operational Agreement” and the “<span class="font-italic">obtaining</span> of the Approval of the Feasibility Study Report”. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on Mah’s entitlement to terminate the SPA </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 As such, we find that Mah had not validly terminated the SPA and had not given valid notice to terminate. In addition, he had breached his duty to cooperate with Ng to obtain the signing of the Operational Agreement. By the operation of the prevention principle, Mah was thus precluded from relying on the non-fulfilment of that condition under Article 4.7 of the SPA to terminate the agreement. It thus follows that the SPA had not been validly terminated and Mah was liable to Ng for the Tranche 3 Payment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Set-off issue </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 This brings us to the issue of whether Ng’s counterclaim for the Tranche 3 Payment should be set off against Mah’s claim for the Disbursed Sums. Ng can rely on his claim for the Tranche 3 Payment both as a defence of set-off against Mah’s claim, as well as a counterclaim, pursuant to O 18 r 17 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The law in relation to the defence of set-off has been set out in <span class="font-italic">Inzign</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Associated Spring Pte Ltd </span>[2018] SGHC 147 at [72]–[74]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72 A legal set-off involves a debt or liquidated sum due from the plaintiff to the defendant that is capable of being liquidated or ascertained with precision at the time of pleading:<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">[</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Singapore Civil Procedure 2018</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> vol 1 (Foo Chee Hock gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2018)</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">] </span>at para 18/17/4…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73 An equitable set-off may apply whether the amount is ascertained or not, so long as the cross-claim arises from the same transaction as the plaintiff’s claim or is closely connected with it such that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the plaintiff to enforce payment without taking into account the cross-claim:<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Pacific Rim Investments</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tiong &amp; another</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>[1995] 2 SLR(R) 643<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>at [35]. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74 Set-off by judgment arises under the Court’s inherent jurisdiction to set-off cross-liabilities which have been established by judgments, leaving one single liability for the balance sum:<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Longyuan-Arrk</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> (Macao) Pte Ltd v Show and Tell Productions Pte Ltd and another suit</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>[2013] SGHC 160<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>at [66]. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 We agree with Ng that his counterclaim for RMB 8m satisfied the requirement of being a sum that is capable of being ascertained with precision at the time of pleading, and that he was therefore entitled to a legal set-off against Mah’s claim. Set-off by judgment similarly applied. We therefore do not have to decide on whether Ng was entitled to an equitable set-off. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 In the present case, the sum owing under Ng’s counterclaim exceeded the Disbursed Sums for Mah’s claim. Thus, Mah’s claim would be dismissed, and Ng was entitled to judgment for the balance of his counterclaim after the set-off. We are mindful, however, that the extent to which Ng’s RMB 8m counterclaim is set off by Mah’s claim for the Disbursed Sums is not a matter of simply deducting the Disbursed Sums from RMB 8m. Two issues arise for consideration. The first is the date on which Mah was entitled to receive the Disbursed Sums, from which interest should be awarded. The second issue stems from the fact that the Disbursed Sums comprise sums in Singapore dollars (“SGD”) as well as RMB (see [2] above). This gives rise to the question of <span class="font-italic">when</span> the SGD portion of the Disbursed Sums (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, S$241,800) ought to be converted to RMB and set off against Ng’s counterclaim for RMB 8m. This question matters because, as observed in Charles Proctor, <span class="font-italic">Mann on the Legal Aspects of Money</span> (Oxford University Press, 7th Ed, 2012) at para 8.20, “the date with reference to which the set-off is effected can, of course, have a significant impact on the amount payable, because exchange rates between the relevant currencies may have fluctuated between the date on which the respective liabilities were incurred” (cited in <span class="font-italic">Haribo Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Aquarius Corporation</span> [2021] SGHC 278 (“<span class="font-italic">Haribo</span>”) at [241]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 We did not hear submissions from the parties on either of these issues, and, thus, we do not propose to make any finding on them. Instead, we highlight them for the parties to consider and attempt to reach a resolution in respect thereof. In this regard, the relevant principles are set out by Lee Seiu Kin J in <span class="font-italic">Haribo</span> at [240]–[255]. If the parties are unable to agree, we grant them liberty to write in to seek our clarification on these two issues <span class="font-italic">only</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 For the above reasons, we allow the appeal. Having regard to the parties’ written costs submissions, we fix the costs of the appeal at $35,000 (all-in) to be paid from Mah to Ng. As for the costs of the trial, we order Mah to bear Ng’s costs of $130,000 with reasonable disbursements. The usual consequential orders apply. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Quentin Loh<br/>Judge of the Appellate Division</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left">See Kee Oon<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td></tr><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Chua Lee Ming<br/>Judge of the High Court</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tham Lijing (Tham Lijing LLC) and Goh Peizhi Adeline (Withers KhattarWong LLP) (instructed); Tan Li-Chern Terence (Robertson Chambers LLC) for the appellant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Isaac Tito Shane, Kawal Pal Singh s/o Amarjit Singh, Jaspreet Kaur Purba, and Sindhu Nair d/o Muralidharan Nair (Tito Isaac &amp; Co LLP) for the respondent.<br/></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
