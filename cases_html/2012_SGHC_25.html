<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This case concerns the classic issue as to
                    whether parties to an oral agreement had intended to be bound only upon formal
                    execution of a written agreement. In determining this issue, it is not
                    necessarily decisive to establish that the parties had <em>orally</em> agreed to the terms of an intended agreement since
                    written agreements are typically preceded by oral agreements on the terms
                    between the parties. Ultimately that issue must be determined by reference to
                    the objective evidence before the court. In this process, the court will attach
                    significance and weight to the parties’ expressed intention on the
                    requirement for the execution of a written agreement. When such an intention is
                    manifested in the contemporaneous documentary evidence, does an inference
                    necessarily arise that the parties had agreed to defer legal relations until the
                    formal execution of a written contract and if so, which party has the burden to
                    displace such an inference?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The present dispute concerns a bank that sought
                    to provide support and assistance to a valued customer during the recent
                    financial crisis. In so doing, the bank was understandably also motivated to
                    advance its own financial interest. In this case, the parties had expressly
                    stated that “[a] Supplemental Agreement [is] to be executed to effect
                    necessary changes” following a meeting where the parties essentially
                    agreed on the terms of the agreement. The preparation of the written agreement
                    was left to the bank. The signing of the written agreement was however
                    time-sensitive in that there was an expiring time limit during which the bank
                    could exercise certain rights of sale. The written agreement was only finalised
                    between the bank and its lawyers on the “eve” of the expiry of the
                    time limit. All reasonable attempts by the bank to contact the customer to sign
                    the written agreement proved to be futile. The bank claimed that the customer
                    was deliberately avoiding its calls to take advantage of the expiring time limit
                    and indeed the time limit eventually expired without the customer signing the
                    written agreement. The question before me is whether the customer was entitled
                    to take advantage of the situation even if he was somewhat “morally
                    reprehensible” in his conduct. He would be entitled to do so if there was
                    in fact no binding oral agreement. Unfortunately for the bank, which behaved
                    fairly throughout the entire episode, I find that the customer is entitled to do
                    so because I am satisfied from the evidence that the objective intention of the
                    parties, including the bank, was not to be bound prior to the formal execution
                    of the written agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Facts</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The original agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The defendant, Wong Hua Choon
                    (“Mr Wong”), is the President and Chief Executive Officer of
                    Frontken Corporation Berhad (“Frontken”), a company listed on the
                    Main Board of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The plaintiff, OCBC Capital
                    Investment Asia Limited (“OCIA”), is an investment vehicle of
                    Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited
                (“OCBC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In April 2007, Mr Wong and/or Frontken
                    approached OCIA to participate in a placement exercise in respect of shares in
                    Frontken and on 24 July 2007, OCIA invested RM14,999,380.00 in the
                    placement exercise. The terms of the arrangement between OCIA, Mr Wong and
                    Frontken in respect of the placement exercise were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_a"></a>(a)     OCIA would subscribe to 19,736,000
                        shares in Frontken at a subscription price of RM 0.76 per
                    share;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_4-p2_b"></a>(b)     Mr Wong
                        would enter into a Risk Participation Agreement (“RPA”) under
                        which Mr Wong agreed to personally underwrite the downside risk of any
                        fluctuation in the value of the shares acquired by OCIA. The relevant terms
                        of the RPA were as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       There would be a moratorium
                            period of six months from the date the shares were initially listed on
                            the Malaysian Exchange of Securities Dealing and Automated Quotation
                            (“MESDAQ”) during which OCIA would not be able to sell the
                            shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_4-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       After the moratorium, there would be a further period of six
                            months commencing from the 19<sup>th</sup> month
                                (<em>ie</em>, on 11 February 2009) and
                            ending on the 24<sup>th</sup> month (<em>ie</em>, on 10 August 2009) after the listing of the
                            shares on MESDAQ (“the Risk Participation Period”) during
                            which if the shares are sold by OCIA (subject to certain conditions and
                            procedures) below a “floor price”, which was stipulated
                            at 85% of the cost of each Frontken share, Mr Wong would have
                            to pay the difference between the sale price and the floor price
                            (“Risk Participation”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       There was a subsequent bonus issue of 7,894,400
                    shares to OCIA, such that OCIA was allotted a total of 27,630,400 shares in
                    Frontken at an average cost of about RM 0.54 per share. All these shares were
                    subject to the terms of the RPA. The floor price was rounded up to RM 0.47, in
                    accordance with the definition of “floor price” provided in the
                    RPA. In the meantime, Frontken shares were also migrated from the MESDAQ to the
                    Main Board of Bursa Malaysia.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">OCIA’s intention to divest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In 2008, the onset of the global financial
                    crisis caused the share price of Frontken to plummet below the floor price. In
                    February 2009, OCIA decided to exit from its investment in Frontken, and this
                    intention was expressly communicated to Mr Wong by two officers of OCIA,
                    namely Vincent Ng Fook Cheong (“Vincent”) and Goh Chong Jin
                    (“Mr Goh”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       At this point of time, should OCIA exit from its
                    investment, it would suffer a minimum loss of 15% of its investment in Frontken,
                    being the difference between its cost and the floor price of each Frontken
                    share, <em>assuming</em> that OCIA could sell all its
                    shares and that Mr Wong would be able to meet his liabilities under the
                    RPA. The loss would be greater if Mr Wong did not have adequate liquidity
                    to meet his liabilities under the RPA. On the other hand, Mr Wong faced a
                    potential liability of about RM7 million to OCIA, being the difference between
                    the sale price and the floor price of OCIA’s Frontken shares should OCIA
                    sell its entire shareholding on the open market. In addition, an open market
                    sale of OCIA’s 4% shareholding in Frontken would likely further depress
                    the share price of Frontken and thus adversely affect the paper value of
                    Mr Wong’s 20% shareholding in Frontken. As such, both parties
                    embarked upon discussions in order to find a mutually beneficial exit option for
                    OCIA. At this point, OCIA’s representatives were introduced to Nicholas Ng
                    Wai Pin (“Nicholas”) as Mr Wong’s assistant and aide.
                    Nicholas is legally trained and was, at all material times, an independent
                    director of Frontken.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 16 March 2009 (some five months prior to
                    the expiry of the Risk Participation Period), Mr Wong requested OCIA for
                    time to raise sufficient funds to purchase OCIA’s Frontken shares.
                    Mr Wong indicated that he would have some of the funds required immediately
                    and the remainder in a few months’ time. He proposed to make progressive
                    purchases which were to commence immediately. Subsequently, on 19 March
                    2009, Mr Wong communicated to Vincent at a meeting that he had difficulty
                    raising the funds to purchase OCIA’s entire shareholding in Frontken.
                    Vincent suggested that there could be alternative solutions available, but
                    emphasised that OCIA could proceed to sell the shares on the open market
                    “as early as [in] a couple of weeks” if there was no firm proposal
                    from Mr Wong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       During a follow-up meeting on 25 March
                    2009, Mr Goh put forward a proposal whereby Mr Wong would purchase
                    part of OCIA’s Frontken shares and the Risk Participation Period in
                    respect of its remaining shares would be extended. Mr Goh’s minutes
                    of the meeting indicated that Mr Wong had appeared
                    “receptive” at this meeting, as well as at a subsequent meeting on
                    9 April 2009. Thereafter, negotiations between the parties were centred
                    upon this proposal. In the meantime, from the instructions given by OCIA to the
                    brokers of OCBC Bank on 6 April 2009, it was evident that OCIA had
                    completed its internal preparations to sell its shareholding on the open market
                    at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The 23 June 2009 meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Substantive negotiations involving
                    Mr Goh, Mr Wong and Nicholas between 14 April 2009 and
                    10 June 2009 culminated in a firm proposal from OCIA, the essence of which
                    obliged Mr Wong to:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">purchase 3,703,704 Frontken shares at RM 0.54 per
                            share;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">agree to a new Risk Participation Period
                            commencing 1 July 2010 with no expiry date as long as OCIA held its
                            Frontken shares; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">pledge such number of Frontken shares as would be
                            required to secure Mr Wong’s liabilities to OCIA under the
                            terms of the proposal.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Seven points in relation to the proposal were
                    raised by Mr Wong and/or by Nicholas on the behalf of Mr Wong:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_a"></a>(a)     The imposition of a
                        “moratorium period”, during which OCIA could not claim for
                        Risk Participation should it sell its Frontken shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_b"></a>(b)     The inclusion of a term that Risk
                        Participation should not be claimable in respect of the last 15% of
                        OCIA’s Frontken shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_c"></a>(c)     The quantity of Frontken shares to be pledged by
                        Mr Wong as security.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_d"></a>(d)     The issue of whether the share pledge should only be
                        given after the moratorium period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_e"></a>(e)     The inclusion of a term requiring OCIA to forfeit a
                        compensation sum, which was payable by Mr Wong in relation to the share
                        sale from OCIA to Mr Wong, if there was a breach of the moratorium
                        period.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
                        inclusion of a term for Mr Wong’s right to purchase OCIA’s
                        remaining Frontken shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_g"></a>(g)     The issue of the amount of fees for the new arrangement
                        that would be payable by Mr Wong to OCIA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 16 June 2009, Mr Chua Choon Kiang
                    (“Mr Chua”), the Vice-President of the Mezzanine Capital Unit
                    of OCBC, began to be directly involved in the negotiations and requested for a
                    meeting with Mr Wong to obtain an <em>in-principle
                        agreement</em> by 22 June 2009, stressing the urgency of the
                    situation as the window for OCIA to exit within the existing Risk Participation
                    Period was getting smaller. A meeting was scheduled for 23 June 2009
                    (“the 23 June 2009 meeting”), and on 17 June 2009,
                    Mr Chua circulated a summary of the terms and conditions titled
                    “Summary of Indicative Principal Terms and Conditions” dated
                    16 June 2009 (“the Term Sheet”). The covering email stated
                    that the Term Sheet is attached in the hope that both parties “would be
                    able to finalise on [23 June 2009] and start the documentation immediately
                    after that”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The key provisions of the Term Sheet were as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Risk Participation Period:
                        “In force immediately following Restricted Period (1 July 2010)
                        for as long as [OCIA] continues to hold its Frontken
                    shares”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     Restricted Period (or moratorium period): “1 July 2009 to
                        30 June 2010. Risk Participation does not apply during this period;
                        Compensation Sum will also not apply to the balance Sale Shares if [OCIA]
                        sells any shares below [RM 0.47] during this
                    period”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     Sale of Shares to Mr Wong (“Sale Shares”):</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_c-p3_i"></a>(i)       Sale of 3,703,704 shares in
                            five tranches at Market Price, <em>ie</em>, the
                            closing price quoted by Bursa Malaysia for the trading day immediately
                            preceding the date of the sale of shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_c-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Mr Wong “shall compensate
                            difference between Market Price and [RM 0.54]” (<em>ie</em>, “the Compensation
                            Sum”).</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_13-p2_c-p3_iii"></a>(iii)       OCIA “may sell balance Frontken shares
                            at anytime [sic] but if any shares are sold below [RM 0.47] during
                            Restricted Period, [OCIA] must forgo balance Compensation Sum for
                            subsequent tranches of the Sale
                    Shares”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     Security: Mr Wong has to pledge Frontken shares upon signing of
                        this agreement. Mr Wong “shall undertake to maintain the
                        [Loan-to-Value ratio (“LTV”)] to be not more than 1. Should
                        the LTV be more than 1, [Mr Wong] is required to top up by pledging
                        additional Security so that the [LTV] immediately after topping up is not
                        more than 0.9”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>(e)     Shareholder Profit Sharing: Mr Wong would be
                        entitled to profit-sharing, should OCIA make any profit from any eventual
                        disposal of its Frontken shares, according to the formula “(Total Net
                        Proceeds from sale of all Investor shares – RM 15M) x
                        25%”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_f"></a>(f)     Right of first refusal: Mr Wong shall have a right of first refusal to
                        purchase OCIA’s remaining Frontken shares, whereby “the
                        [s]elling price shall be at least 87.5% the previous day’s closing
                        price”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_g"></a>(g)     Fees: Waived by OCIA.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_h"></a>(h)     Documentation: “A Supplemental Agreement to be
                        executed to effect necessary changes.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As such, each of the seven points raised by
                    Mr Wong (see [11]) was
                    addressed in the Term Sheet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The 23 June 2009 meeting was held in
                    Singapore, and was attended by Mr Chua, Mr Wong and Nicholas, with
                    Mr Goh participating (and Vincent listening in) <em>via</em> dialling in from Malaysia. There is no dispute that the
                    parties agreed to follow through with the preparation of the formal legal
                    documentation based on the Term Sheet, and Mr Wong, during his
                    cross-examination, conceded that the parties were indeed in agreement with
                    respect to the terms in the Term Sheet. In addition, Mr Wong agreed to bear
                    all legal fees in connection with the preparation of the formal legal
                    documentation, subject to agreement on the quantum of the fees.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events after the 23 June 2009 meeting</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the next day, <em>ie</em>, 24 June 2009, Mr Goh forwarded to Mr Wong and
                    Nicholas a list of the panel of lawyers that OCIA would be agreeable to appoint
                    to prepare the formal documentation. After some exchange of correspondence
                    between Nicholas and Mr Goh as well as Mr Chua during which
                    Mr Wong (as represented by Nicholas) tried to minimise the legal cost for
                    preparing the documentation, Mr Wong finally gave his concurrence on
                    8 July 2009 to the appointment of Shook Lin &amp; Bok (Malaysia) to prepare
                    the Supplemental Agreement with OCBC’s internal legal department drafting
                    the Sale and Purchase Agreement as well as the Memorandum of Deposit. From then
                    till the time when the documentation was sent to Mr Wong, there was no
                    communication or any meeting between the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The formal legal documentation was eventually
                    completed and sent to Mr Wong for execution on 6 August 2009, just
                    four days before the expiry of the Risk Participation Period with three days
                    spanning over a long weekend. Despite persistent attempts by Mr Chua and
                    Mr Goh to contact Mr Wong, they were not able to reach him.
                    Mr Wong only responded by email on 11 August 2009, the day after the
                    expiry of the Risk Participation Period, in the following terms:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear [Mr Chua],</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I’ve been away since last week to take advantage of the long weekend
                        in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If you recall during our meeting in your office there were <em>still some unresolved issues</em> on the proposed
                        variation to the RPA. These were <em>supposed to be dealt
                            with in the supplemental agreement</em> which I noticed have just
                        been sent to me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>I will forward to my lawyers the various documents you
                            sent me for their review and comments.</em> I’ll come back
                        to you as soon as I hear back from them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     From then until 28 August 2009,
                    OCIA’s representatives repeatedly sought an update from Mr Wong and
                    requested that he sign a “Letter of Extension” in order to extend
                    the Risk Participation Period pending the execution of the Supplemental
                    Agreement, but to no avail. Eventually a meeting with Mr Wong was arranged
                    on 28 August 2009 wherein Mr Chua brought the formal documentation for
                    Mr Wong to sign. Mr Wong declined stating that he was not obliged to
                    do so as the Risk Participation Period had expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     A new “restructuring” proposal
                    was then floated for OCIA to extend a loan to Frontken to purchase OCIA’s
                    Frontken shares. However, negotiations on this proposal came to a stalemate, and
                    OCIA subsequently initiated the present action against Mr Wong. Its cause
                    of action was principally premised on an alleged oral agreement on the terms of
                    the Term Sheet reached at the 23 June 2009 meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     At the close of the trial, I invited the
                    parties to address the following broad issues:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_a"></a>(a)     On the contractual issue,</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_i"></a>(i)       Where the parties
                            contemplate the signing of a written contract, whether that precludes
                            the existence of a binding oral contract;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_a-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       Whether the conduct of the parties
                            after the 23 June 2009 meeting was consistent with the existence of
                            a binding oral contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_20-p2_b"></a>(b)     On the estoppel issue,</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_i"></a>(i)       What was the relevant
                            conduct, if any, giving rise to the common assumption that a binding
                            oral contract had been reached;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_20-p2_b-p3_ii"></a>(ii)       What is the relevance of Mr Wong’s
                            conduct after the receipt of the draft Supplemental Agreement on
                            6 August 2009 and after the expiry of the Risk Participation Period
                            on 10 August 2009?</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether contemplation of a written contract precludes the existence
                of a binding oral contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Contemplation of a written contract <em>per se</em> does not preclude the existence of a binding oral
                    contract. That is ultimately a matter of construction of the documentary
                    evidence as well as the interpretation of the objective intention of the
                    parties. It was previously thought that the addition of the phrase
                    “subject to contract” is conclusive of the parties’
                    intention not to be bound until a contract is signed. See <em>United Artists Singapore Theatres Pte Ltd and another</em> v
                        <em>Parkway Properties Pte Ltd and another</em> [2003]
                    1 SLR(R) 791 at [57].
                    That view was recently revisited in <em>Norwest Holdings Pte Ltd
                        (in liquidation) v Newport Mining Ltd and another appeal</em> [2011]
                    4 SLR 617 (“<em>Norwes</em>t”)
                        at [24] where the Court of
                    Appeal observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the <b><em>better view
                            </em></b><b>is that the question </b><b><em>whether there is a binding contract between the parties should
                            be determined by considering all the circumstances, not just the
                            inclusion of the stock phrase ‘subject to contract’ (on the
                            basis that the substance of the situation must always prevail). These
                            would include what was communicated between the parties by words or
                            conduct</em></b>. In this regard, we are in agreement with the recent
                        decision of the UK Supreme Court in <em>RTS Flexible Systems
                            Ltd v Molkerei </em><em>Alois Muller GmbH &amp; Co
                            KG (UK Production)</em> [2010] 1 WLR 753 in which it was
                        held that (at [56]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Whether in such a case [<em>ie</em>, concerning
                            an agreement that is ‘subject to contract’] the parties
                            agreed to enter into a binding contract, waiving reliance on the
                            ‘subject to [written] contract’ term or understanding will
                            again <em>depend upon all the circumstances of the
                                case</em>, although the cases show that the court <em>will not lightly so hold</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     In deciding whether a binding oral contract
                    was concluded at the 23 June 2009 meeting, it behoves me to consider all
                    the circumstances of the case including the question of whether parties had
                    expressed any intention that their discussions and/or oral agreement were
                    “subject to contract”. In this case, the Term Sheet specifically
                    provided for “[a] Supplemental Agreement to be executed to effect
                    necessary changes”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Burden of proof</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The immediate question that arises for
                    determination is whether such a provision is tantamount to “subject to
                    contract”. This inquiry is significant because if the Term Sheet was
                    indeed “subject to contract”, “very strong and exceptional
                    context” must be demonstrated by OCIA to displace the <em>prima facie</em> meaning of the parties’ intention not to be
                    bound prior to the execution of the Supplemental Agreement. See <em>Norwest</em> at [29]–[31].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     This proposition appears to be well entrenched
                    in case law. In <em>Thomson Plaza (Pte) Ltd v
                        Liquidators of Yaohan Department Store Singapore Pte Ltd (in
                        liquidation)</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 483, Selvam J
                    cited with approval the observations of Gill J in <em>Low
                        Kar </em><em>Yit v Mohamed
                    Isa </em>[1963] MLJ 165 (“<em>Low Kar
                        </em><em>Yit</em>”) at 173:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The authorities would appear to support the view that even where there is
                        nothing in the agreement to suggest that the parties contemplate that the
                        subsequent contract shall contain any new or different terms, nevertheless
                        if it appears that the parties do not intend to bind themselves
                        contractually by the agreement but only by the subsequent contract if and
                        when they should enter into it, there will be no contract. Moreover,
                            <em>if the reference to the execution of the subsequent
                            contract is in words which according to their natural construction
                            import a condition, this will almost invariably be conclusive that the
                            agreement itself was not intended to be a contract...</em> Perhaps
                        I should add that the plaintiffs in this case are asking the court to order
                        the defendants to execute the draft agreement agreed upon, which amounts in
                        effect to asking the court to enforce an agreement to enter into an
                        agreement. That is an order which the court clearly has no power to make in
                        the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Similarly, the Court of Appeal in New Zealand
                    in <em>Concorde Enterprises v Anthony Motors </em><em>(Hutt) Ltd</em> [1981] 2 NZLR 385
                        (“<em>Concorde</em>”) held that the
                    negotiations in that case had been conducted partly between the parties'
                    solicitors and partly between the parties themselves with a view to the
                    production of a commercial agreement of some complexity to be executed by all
                    parties. As such, the New Zealand Court of Appeal concluded that the <em>normal inference</em> is that the parties do not intend to be
                    bound until the written agreement is executed. Cooke J stated
                    at 389:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Unless that inference is displaced the result is
                            that</em>,<em>even though all the terms to be
                            included in the document have been agreed, there is no
                            contract</em> and each party has a locus poenitentiae until at
                        least execution on both sides. It may be that exchange or delivery of
                        executed documents is also necessary, but that need not now be decided.
                        Cases can arise where, without execution of a document on one side or both,
                        the parties act on it, so that an implied contract arises. <em>Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Co</em> (1877) 2 App
                        Cas 666 is a leading illustration…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Similar views were expressed by the English

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Obviously each case depends on its own facts but in my view where, as

                            until both of them sign the agreement…</em></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In his Oral Closing Submissions, faced with
                    the force of the authorities, counsel for OCIA, Mr Edwin Tong
                    (“Mr Tong”) accepted that if the oral contract was
                    “subject to contract”, the burden is indeed on OCIA to demonstrate
                    that the parties intended for legal relations to be immediately binding
                    following the 23 June 2009 meeting. To do so, OCIA must show “very
                    strong and exceptional context” to displace the normal or <em>prima facie</em> inference. This is so even if all the terms
                    have already been agreed. See <em>Norwest</em>
                        at [29], <em>Low
                        Kar </em><em>Yit</em> at 173, <em>Concorde</em> at 389 and <em>Ground &amp;
                        Sharp Precision Engineering Pte Ltd</em> v <em>Midview
                        Realty Pte Ltd</em> [2008] SGHC 160 at [18]. If there was no agreement on the terms,
                    there will be no necessity to consider the <em>further</em>
                    question whether parties had intended to be bound immediately or to defer legal
                    relations until the formal execution of the written contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Subject to contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is, however, important to recognise that
                    whether an agreement is “subject to contract” is a matter of
                    substance and not form. When it is not expressly stated to be “subject to
                    contract”, it is a question of construction whether the parties intended
                    that the terms agreed upon should merely be put into form or to be subject to an
                    agreement to the terms of which are not expressed in detail. This was so stated
                    in <em>Cheverny</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it is not essential that there should have been an
                        express stipulation that the negotiations are to be ‘subject to
                        contract’. As Jessel MR pointed out in relation to negotiations
                        conducted through correspondence in <em>Winn v
                            Bull</em> (1877–78) LR 7 Ch.29 , 32:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“When it is not expressly stated to be subject to a formal
                            contract it becomes a question of construction, whether the parties
                            intended that the terms agreed on should merely be put into form, or
                            whether they should be subject to a new agreement the terms of which are
                            not expressed in detail.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     It follows that the mere fact that the parties
                    did not expressly use the phrase “subject to contract” in either
                    the discussions or the documents does not necessarily preclude it from being
                    construed as such. In <em>Thomson Plaza</em>, the court was
                    concerned with a grant of a new tenancy which stipulated that “[t]he
                    tenancy shall be subject to all the terms and conditions as contained in the
                    specimen Lease Agreement. On or before commencement of the tenancy, a formal
                    Lease of the same form as the specimen Lease Agreement shall be executed between
                    you and the Landlord”. Although the phrase “subject to
                    contract” was not specifically used, the court nonetheless applied the
                    principles governing “subject to contract” cases. Selvam J
                        at [28] held that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Parties who contract on the basis of ‘subject to contract’ do
                        so because they want an escape route in case they wish to call the
                        transaction off. They do not consider it a wrong way of business. It is a
                        last-chance escape route in case they find it impossible or undesirable to
                        fulfil the contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, in <em>Concorde</em>, the agreement
                    involved was held to be “subject to contract” although there was
                    no express use of the phrase “subject to contract” –
                    parties’ solicitors, in their correspondences leading up to an agreement
                    on terms, merely expressed their intention for the subsequent execution of
                    formal documentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     Where there is an <em>express
                        stipulation</em> that an agreement is to be embodied in a formal
                    written document, as in the instant case, its effect will depend on its
                        <em>purpose</em>: <em>Von
                        Hatzfeldt-Wildenburg v Alexander</em> [1912] 1 Ch 284
                        (“<em>Von Hatzfeldt</em>”),
                    at 288–289.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It appears to be well settled by the authorities that if the documents or
                        letters relied on as constituting a contract contemplate the execution of a
                        further contract between the parties, <em>it is a question of
                            construction whether the execution of the further contract is a
                            condition or term of the bargain or whether it is a mere expression of
                            the desire of the parties as to the manner in which the transaction
                            already agreed to will in fact go through</em>. In the former case
                        there is no enforceable contract either because the condition is unfulfilled
                        or because the law does not recognize a contract to enter into a contract.
                        In the latter case there is a binding contract and the reference to the more
                        formal document may be ignored. <em>The fact that the
                            reference to the more formal document is in words which according to
                            their natural construction import a condition is generally if not
                            invariably conclusive against the reference being treated as the
                            expression of a mere desire…</em></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     
          <em>Chitty on
                        Contracts</em> (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed,
                    2008) Vol 1 (“<em>Chitty</em>”),
                    para 2-116 lists three possible interpretations where there is an <em>express stipulation</em> that an agreement is to be embodied
                    in a formal written document:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_a"></a>(a)     The agreement is regarded by the
                        parties as incomplete, or as not intended to be legally binding, until the
                        terms of the formal document are agreed and the document is duly executed in
                        accordance with the terms of the preliminary agreement (<em>eg</em>, by signature). Example: Agreements for the sale of land
                        by private treaty are usually made “subject to contract”
                        – such agreements are normally regarded as incomplete until the terms
                        of a formal contract have been settled and approved by the parties:
                            <em>Chitty</em>, para 2-118; <em>Winn v Bull</em> (1877)
                    7 Ch D 29.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_b"></a>(b)     Where a document is only intended as a solemn record of an already
                        complete and binding agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_31-p2_c"></a>(c)     Where the main agreement lacks contractual force for want
                        of execution of the formal document but that nevertheless a separate
                        preliminary contract comes into existence at an earlier stage, <em>eg</em>, when one party begins to render services
                        requested by the other, so that under this contract, the former party will
                        be entitled to a reasonable remuneration for those services. Conversely, an
                        agreement that originally lacked contractual force for want of execution of
                        a formal document may acquire such force by reason of supervening events.
                        This could, for example, be the position where “it can be objectively
                        ascertained that the continuing intention [sc. not to be bound until
                        execution of the document] of the parties changed or … subsequent
                        events have occurred whereby the non-executing party is estopped from
                        relying on his non-execution”. See <em>Cheverny</em> at [46].</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The third category is relevant to
                    the issue of estoppel by convention which will be separately dealt with below.
                    The issue for now is whether the present case falls into the first or second
                    category.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The Australian courts have expanded the
                    various factual scenarios which can possibly arise in connection with the
                    requirement of a formal contract. The High Court of Australia in <em>Masters v </em><em>Cameron</em>
                    91 CLR 353 at 360 referred to three situations excluding
                    estoppel:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where parties who have been in negotiation reach agreement upon terms of a
                        contractual nature and also agree that the matter of their negotiation shall
                        be dealt with by a formal contract, the case may belong to any of three
                        cases. It may be one in which the parties have reached finality in arranging
                        all the terms of their bargain and intend to be immediately bound to the
                        performance of those terms, but at the same time propose to have the terms
                        restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in
                        effect. Or, secondly, it may be a case in which the parties have completely
                        agreed upon all the terms of their bargain and intend no departure from or
                        addition to that which their agreed terms express or imply, but nevertheless
                        have made performance of one or more of the terms conditional upon the
                        execution of a formal document. Or, thirdly, the case may be one in which
                        the intention of the parties is not to make a concluded bargain at all,
                        unless and until they execute a formal contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In each of the first two cases there is a binding contract: in the first
                        case a contract binding the parties at once to perform the agreed terms
                        whether the contemplated formal document comes into existence or not, and to
                        join (if they have so agreed) in settling and executing the formal document;
                        and in the second case a contract binding the parties to join in bringing
                        the formal contract into existence and then to carry it into execution. Of
                        these two cases the first is the more common…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     A fourth permutation was postulated by the
                    Supreme Court of New South Wales in <em>Ciavarella
                        </em><em>v Polimeni</em> 2008 NSWSC 234
                        at [97]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… where the parties were content to be bound immediately and
                        exclusively on the terms which they had agreed upon whilst expecting to make
                        a new contract in substitution for their first contract, containing, by
                        consent, additional terms.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The fourth scenario clearly has no relevance
                    here. The critical inquiry in resolving the applicable scenario is to determine
                    from the objective evidence whether the parties intended to be <em>immediately bound</em> to perform on the agreed terms or to
                    defer legal relations until formal execution of the written contract. Immediacy
                    of performance is the key consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     Counsel for Mr Wong, Mr Chew Kei-Jin
                    (“Mr Chew”) asserted that on its face, the Term Sheet clearly
                    requires the Supplemental Agreement to be executed in order to give effect to
                    the changes. In my view, such a provision has the same effect as “subject
                    to contract”. This is no different in substance from the clause in
                        <em>Thomson Plaza</em> which likewise required the
                    lease to be signed in order to give effect to the tenancy which was already
                    agreed to be in the same form as the specimen lease. Even if I am left in any
                    doubt about the construction of the provision, the conduct of the parties can
                    and should be examined to determine the parties’ intention and purpose in
                    inserting that provision in the Term Sheet. In this regard, the conduct of the
                    parties, in particular OCIA (as described in detail in <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>–<a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> below), was
                    entirely consistent with its own understanding that legal relations were
                    deferred until execution of the Supplemental Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     
          <em>Cheverny</em>
                    provides some guidelines for determining when a particular case falls into any
                    of the scenarios. At [42], it was
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… With exceptions immaterial to this case, it is possible to make a
                        contract orally. <em>But the more complicated the subject
                            matter the more likely the parties are to want to enshrine their
                            contract in some written document to be prepared by their
                            solicitors.</em> This enables them to review all the terms before
                        being committed to any of them. The commonest way of achieving this ability
                        is to stipulate that the negotiations are ‘subject to
                        contract’…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     As noted earlier, both parties were not
                    separately represented in the drafting or preparation of the Supplemental
                    Agreement. Instead, a common set of solicitors was employed. Both parties had
                    clearly agreed that formal written agreements were to be prepared <em>“to effect necessary changes”</em> and
                    arrangements were made for their execution. Further, this case also involves a
                    commercial transaction of some complexity and of a considerably large value.
                    This is especially compelling in the present case because the Supplemental
                    Agreement seeks to amend an existing written agreement, <em>ie</em>, the RPA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     OCIA advanced several points in its attempt to
                    persuade me that there is no relevant “subject to contract” issue
                    in the case before me. From the evidential perspective, Mr Tong submitted
                    that there was no mention whatsoever during the 23 June 2009 meeting that
                    the agreement was “subject to contract”. This is strictly correct
                    but the point is neither here nor there especially since the requirement for a
                    signed Supplemental Agreement was expressly stated in the Term Sheet. From the
                    pleading point of view, Mr Tong raised (for the first time) in his
                    Supplemental Closing Submissions that Mr Wong did not specifically plead
                    that the Term Sheet was “subject to contract”. This is strictly
                    incorrect as Mr Wong did plead in para 18 of the Defence (Amendment No
                    3) that the agreement was subject to “a formal written contract being
                    signed” as envisaged by the Term Sheet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Insofar as his submissions on the law,
                    Mr Tong relied on a number of authorities in support of the proposition
                    that “unless parties are found to have clearly agreed that no legal
                    relations are to be had without a further step, the Courts can find that the
                    parties are immediately bound even if they do contemplate a formal agreement in
                    writing”. The holdings by Lord Blackburn and Lord Gordon in
                        <em>Rossiter v Miller</em>
                    (1877–78) LR 3 App Cas 1124 (“<em>Rossiter</em>”) are cited in support of OCIA’s
                    argument. Lord Blackburn stated, at 1151:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I quite agree with the Lords Justices that (wholly independent of the
                        Statute of Frauds) <em>it is a necessary part of the
                            Plaintiff's case to shew that the two parties had come to a
                            </em><b><em>final </em></b><em>and
                            complete agreement, for, if not, there was no contract</em>. So
                        long as they are only in negotiation either party may retract; and though
                        the parties may have agreed on all the cardinal points of the intended
                        contract, yet, if some particulars essential to the agreement still remain
                        to be settled afterwards, there is no contract. The parties, in such a case,
                        are still only in negotiation. But the mere fact that the parties have
                        expressly stipulated that there shall afterwards be a formal agreement
                        prepared, embodying the terms, which shall be signed by the parties
                            <em>does not, by itself</em>, shew that they
                        continue merely in negotiation. It is a matter to be taken into account in
                        construing the evidence and determining whether the parties have really come
                        to a final agreement or not<em>.</em> But as soon as
                        the fact is established of the final mutual assent of the parties so that
                        those who draw up the formal agreement have not the power to vary the terms
                        already settled, I think the contract is completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Lord Blackburn’s holding merely reinforced the fundamental
                    principle that the burden falls upon the party asserting the existence of a
                    contract to show that the parties had come to “a <em>final</em> and complete agreement” and the mere fact that
                    parties have expressly stipulated that a formal agreement is required to be
                    executed “<em>does not</em>,<em>of
                        itself</em>” show that the parties are still in
                    negotiations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Lord Gordon stated, at 1154:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I concur with your Lordships in thinking that the judgment come to by the
                        Lords Justices of Appeal is erroneous. I think that the correspondence
                        founded on, constituted a completed contract for the purchase and sale of
                        the lots in question, at the price stipulated, and on the conditions
                        specified in the conditions and stipulations printed on the plan. <b><em>No doubt these conditions provided for a subsequent and formal
                            deed being executed by the parties; but that deed was only for the
                            purpose of more formally setting forth the conditions upon which the
                            parties had agreed.</em></b> If there was anything introduced into the
                        proposed deed, which the purchaser considered beyond the terms and
                        conditions on which he purchased the property, he would have been entitled
                        to object, and, if necessary, the proper terms of the deed could have been
                        adjusted at the sight of a Court of Law. But in my view <em>the contract</em> between the parties <b><em>was
                            concluded by the correspondence and the conditions which were referred
                            to and embodied in it</em></b>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, Lord Gordon’s decision was based on a finding
                    that the agreement was already <em>concluded</em> prior to
                    formal execution. It is important to bear in mind that <em>Rossiter</em> did not actually concern a “subject to
                    contract” issue in the first place. The conditions of the offer to sell
                    the property expressly stipulated: “Each purchaser will be required to
                    sign a contract embodying the foregoing conditions”. Lord Cairns who
                    delivered the main judgment had this to say about the import of that condition
                    in the context of the correspondence exchanged between the parties:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I assume that the construction put by him upon the letter I have quoted
                        was a proper construction, and I entirely acquiesce in what he says, that if
                        you find, not an unqualified acceptance of a contract, but an acceptance
                        subject to the condition that an agreement is to be prepared and agreed upon
                        between the parties, and until that condition is fulfilled no contract is to
                        arise, then undoubtedly you cannot, upon a correspondence of that kind, find
                        a concluded contract<em>. But, I repeat, it appears to me
                            that in the present case there is nothing of that kind; there is a clear
                            offer and a clear acceptance. </em><em>There is no
                            condition whatever suspending the operation of that acceptance until a
                            contract of a more formal kind has been made.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The House of Lords found that everything
                    essential to the completion of the agreement had appeared in the written
                    correspondence exchanged between the parties. An offer was made by the purchaser
                    which was accepted by the vendors. The purchaser was then under the impression
                    that the vendors were making a fresh condition in their purported acceptance;
                    the vendors answered that they were not, and again accepted the same offer. The
                    purchaser’s solicitors wrote to the vendors: “We shall advise [our
                    client] that what has occurred creates, as you maintain, a contract mutually
                    binding”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Next, Mr Tong relies on the Privy
                    Council’s decision in <em>Elias v George Sahely &amp; Co
                        (Barbados)</em> [1983] 1 AC 646 (“<em>Elias</em>”). In that case, the plaintiff and the defendant
                    made an oral agreement for the sale of premises to the plaintiff. On the same
                    day, the plaintiff's solicitor wrote to the defendant's solicitor confirming the
                    oral agreement and setting out its terms. He enclosed a cheque for 10 percent of
                    the agreed price describing it as a deposit which he directed should be held by
                    the defendant's solicitor as stakeholder pending completion of the contract of
                    sale. The defendant's solicitor signed and sent a receipt which stated that he
                    had received the money as deposit for the property <em>“agreed to be sold”</em> by the defendant to the
                    plaintiff. This case is of no assistance in the present dispute as there was no
                    express stipulation requiring the execution of a written contract. The principal
                    issue before the Privy Council was whether the letter enclosing the deposit
                    together with the receipt for the deposit constituted sufficient memorandum for
                    the purposes of the Statute of Frauds given that no written contract was signed
                    by the parties. This issue does not arise here.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In <em>PRA Electrical Pty Ltd v
                        Perseverance Exploration Pty Ltd</em> and Anor
                    [2007] VSCA 310 (“<em>PRA</em>”),
                    another case cited by Mr Tong, the parties negotiated a detailed agreement
                    over a six-week period, and it was an agreement of considerable commercial
                    import following a tender. The negotiations led to a written award of the
                    contract setting out the terms and conditions which was accepted in writing by
                    the contractor. It was, however, a term of the award that the contract did not
                    come into effect until the formal execution of an instrument of agreement.
                    However, without waiting for the execution of the formal agreement, the
                    contractor in fact entered upon the works programme contracted for, and the
                    employer facilitated it doing so. The contractor also furnished the bank
                    guarantee in accordance with the award which was also accepted by the employer.
                    Further, the contractor commenced work at the site and in the course of the
                    works and even after the contractor was ejected from the site, both parties
                    repeatedly referred to and relied upon aspects of the documentation listed in
                    the letter by which the contract was awarded. In fact, the employer wrote to the
                    contractor stating that it was in “breach of our contract conditions in
                    regards to the issuing of our Payment certificate”. The Court of Appeal
                    of the Supreme Court of Victoria in <em>PRA</em> found
                    under these explicit circumstances that a contract was implied between the
                    parties in the terms of the award notwithstanding the omission to execute the
                    instrument of agreement and that the parties had by their conduct waived the
                    requirement of formal execution. Parties can by their conduct waive reliance on
                    the “subject to contract” term. See <em>RTS
                        Flexible Systems Ltd </em><em>v </em><em>Molkerei </em><em>Alois Muller GmbH &amp; Co
                        KG (UK Production)</em> [2010] 1 WLR 753 at [56], cited with approval in <em>Norwest</em> at [24]. No such point was however pleaded or raised by OCIA. In
                    any event, there is simply no evidence to support any waiver. As explained
                        in <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a> above, nothing happened
                    between the parties after Mr Wong agreed to the appointment of Shook Lin
                    &amp; Bok (Malaysia) till the time when the documentation was
                prepared.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     In each of these three cases (<em>Rossiter</em>, <em>Elias</em> and
                        <em>PRA</em>), the existence of a binding agreement
                    prior to formal execution was based on the specific facts in each of the cases.
                    These cases do illustrate the basic point, which is uncontroversial, that
                    parties can reach a binding contract notwithstanding the requirement for formal
                    execution. That is a function of the court’s analysis of the objective
                    evidence whether parties had agreed for legal relations to be immediately
                    binding or whether parties had agreed to defer legal relations until the formal
                    execution of the written contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     It therefore leaves me now to examine the
                    conduct of the parties prior to, at and/or subsequent to the 23 June 2009
                    meeting to determine whether they were consistent with the existence of an oral
                    contract with immediate binding effect.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Whether a binding oral contract was concluded</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     I begin by examining OCIA’s case given
                    that it bears the burden to show “very strong and exceptional
                    context” to displace the <em>prima facie</em>
                    inference that the parties intended for legal relations to be deferred until the
                    execution of the Supplemental Agreement. OCIA essentially sought to rely on two
                    main points in its attempt to displace the <em>prima
                        facie</em> inference.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     First, OCIA emphasised that prior to the
                    23 June 2009 meeting, it had addressed all the issues raised by
                    Mr Wong in the Term Sheet, and that going into the 23 June 2009
                    meeting, there were no outstanding points for negotiation. However, this only
                    goes to show there was an agreement on the terms and does not go so far as to
                    show that the parties had intended to be immediately bound by the oral contract
                    following the 23 June 2009 meeting without the execution of formal
                    documentation, especially since the Term Sheet itself specifically contemplates
                    the requirement for the signing of the Supplemental Agreement “<em>to effect necessary changes</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Second, OCIA also stressed that Mr Wong
                    was fully aware that OCIA was looking to exit from its investment in Frontken
                    since February 2009 and was keen to prevent OCIA from selling the shares on the
                    open market. Thus OCIA argued that both parties had placed utmost importance on
                    the 23 June 2009 meeting with the objective intention to come out of the
                    meeting with either a binding deal and then for formal documentation to be
                    prepared, or no deal at all. There was therefore no contemplation of an
                    agreement “subject to contract”. OCIA relied on an internal email
                    from Mr Goh to Mr George Lee (“George”), Head of
                    Investment Banking of OCBC and a member of the OCBC’s investment committee
                    (“OIC”), dated 18 June 2009 at 6:08pm:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi George,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Just to inform that [Mr Wong] will be coming over to OCBC to meet
                        with [Mr] Chua next Tuesday, 11:30am to finalize the terms of the Risk
                        Participation extension. Note that OIC meeting is next Tuesday
                        afternoon.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Email below contains contents of OIC slides (cleared by [Mr] Chua) which
                        we will be sending to OIC tomorrow 9.30am for approval to divest our
                        Frontken shares and claim Risk Participation Amount <em>in
                            the event that Willie cannot agree to our terms</em>. If Willie
                        agrees, we will seek OIC’s approval for the terms (to be finalized
                        next Tuesday morning).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Regards,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[Mr Goh]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     However, on a plain reading of this email, it
                    at most goes to show that OCIA’s intention was to come out of the meeting
                    with <em>an agreement on the terms</em>, or no deal at all;
                    it does not say that the parties’ intention was to arrive at an <em>immediate </em><em>binding</em>
                    agreement at the meeting. In fact, the statement “[i]f Willie agrees, we
                    will seek OIC’s approval for the terms” contradicts the intention
                    of a binding agreement to be concluded immediately at the meeting as it clearly
                    expressed the necessity for OIC’s approval <em>after</em> the meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     OCIA also highlighted the fact that there was
                    a consensus on the terms of the Term Sheet, and that Mr Wong did not raise
                    objections or disagreed with the same at the 23 June 2009 meeting. Further,
                    there was no expression by any party at the meeting that the oral contract was
                    “subject to contract”. However, again, these facts only go to show
                    that there was an agreement on the terms. The absence of explicit reference by
                    any party at the 23 June 2009 meeting that the agreement was
                    “subject to contract” would not be critical as the Term Sheet
                    itself referred to the necessity for the execution of formal
                    documentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     OCIA relied heavily on two email messages from
                    Nicholas after the 23 June 2009 meeting:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_a"></a>(a)     In his email dated 24 June
                        2009, Nicholas questioned the fee estimate for the preparation of the
                        Supplemental Agreement given “the very concise and good summary of
                        the <em>agreed terms</em> that [Mr Chua] had
                        prepared [emphasis added]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_51-p2_b"></a>(b)     In his email dated 29 June 2009, Nicholas said in
                        the context of the legal costs for the drafting of the Supplemental
                        Agreement that the fee quote should not be so high “to just say that
                        [Mr Wong] <em>agreed</em> to buy shares in a
                        company in which he is already a substantial shareholder [emphasis
                        added]”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In my view, these two email messages do
                    not take OCIA’s case any further. First, they were sent in the context of
                    negotiating the legal fees. Secondly, they merely confirmed that since
                    Mr Wong had agreed to the Term Sheet, the legal fees for drafting the
                    Supplemental Agreement should not be as high as that quoted. Thirdly, in the
                    subsequent email messages of 2 and 3 July 2009, Nicholas repeated his
                    objection to the fee quote since it was a “simple supplemental
                    agreement” and was based on “the excellent summary” set out
                    in the Term Sheet. These facts lend support to my finding that the words
                    “agreed terms” were used to convey Mr Wong’s objection
                    to the fee quote given the parties’ agreement on the terms. At best, it
                    demonstrates that the parties had reached an agreement on the terms set out in
                    the Term Sheet. As explained in <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>
                    above, the fact that parties have reached an agreement on all the terms does not
                    mean that the phrase “subject to contract”, or its equivalent,
                    should not be given its ordinary meaning in the absence of “very strong
                    and exceptional context” to the contrary. This is entirely consistent
                    with OCIA’s own purpose in calling the 23 June 2009 meeting. In its
                    own records, both prior and subsequent to the 23 June 2009 meeting, OCIA
                    revealingly described the agreement as an “in-principle
                    agreement”. In Mr Chua’s email to Nicholas dated 16 June
                    2009, Mr Chua expressed the need for the meeting in order for the parties
                    “to sign-off and [sic] an in-principle agreement”. In OCIA’s
                    internal memorandum dated 28 July 2009, it was explicitly stated that OCIA
                    had Mr Wong’s “in-principal [sic] agreement” to extend
                    the Risk Participation Period and that the documentation process was underway.
                    This was precisely the agreement that was achieved at the 23 June 2009
                    meeting, <em>ie</em>, an agreement on the terms <em>in </em><em>principle</em> subject to
                    the execution of the Supplemental Agreement to effect the “necessary
                    changes”. After all, in the covering email attaching the Term Sheet
                        (see <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above), the purpose of
                    the 23 June 2009 meeting was to “<em>finalise
                        </em><em>the terms</em>” of the agreement
                    and to commence the documentation process immediately thereafter. Conspicuously,
                    OCIA did not describe the agreement as having been <em>concluded.</em></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     OCIA also claimed that in reliance of a
                    binding oral contract, it had held off selling its Frontken shares on the open
                    market after the 23 June 2009 meeting. However, this fact is equivocal as
                    it is equally consistent with OCIA’s expectation that the parties would
                    eventually sign the Supplemental Agreement and not because it thought the oral
                    contract was binding. It bears mention that OCIA likewise did not sell the
                    Frontken shares <em>before</em> the 23 June 2009
                    meeting even though its right to do so had accrued by 11 February
                    2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     OCIA also highlighted that from the receipt of
                    the formal documentation until 28 August 2009, Mr Wong did not
                    expressly renounce the existence of a concluded oral agreement, and had instead
                    continued to act as if it was merely a matter of time before he would execute
                    the formal documents, after his lawyers had verified them. Further, OCIA also
                    relied on Mr Wong’s deceitful and opportunistic conduct in his
                    dealings with OCIA after receipt of the formal documentation. Mr Wong
                    deliberately avoided calls from OCIA from 6 August to 11 August 2009
                    and admittedly lied that he had forwarded the documentation to his solicitors
                    for review. However, these facts at most go to show that Mr Wong had acted
                    in a morally reprehensible manner, and do not establish that a binding oral
                    contract was reached at the 23 June 2009 meeting. The fact that
                    Mr Wong waited till 11 August 2009 (the day after the expiry of the
                    Risk Participation Period) to respond to OCIA is equally consistent with his
                    understanding that he had no liability for Risk Participation after
                    10 August 2009 and hence there was no binding oral contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     It should be noted that OCIA had over six
                    weeks from the 23 June 2009 meeting to the expiry of the Risk Participation
                    Period on 10 August 2009 to prepare the Supplemental Agreement. Although
                    Mr Wong did contribute to some initial delay in the appointment of
                    solicitors, Shook Lin &amp; Bok (Malaysia) was eventually appointed on
                    8 July 2009, which was still over a month before the expiry date. By only
                    sending the documents to Mr Wong on 6 August 2009, just four days
                    prior to the expiry date with three out of those four days spanning over a long
                    weekend, OCIA took the risk that Mr Wong might not sign the Supplemental
                    Agreement prior to the expiry of the Risk Participation Period. Had OCIA acted
                    more efficiently and promptly in forwarding the formal documentation to
                    Mr Wong for his execution, it would have had sufficient time to react and
                    to arrange for an open market sale of the shares should Mr Wong decline to
                    sign it. In fact, this was the evidence of Mr Chua – if Mr Wong
                    had declined to sign soon after the 23 June 2009 meeting, OCIA would have
                    sold its Frontken shares on the open market. Having taken the risks of
                    (a) sending the documents late in the day and (b) hoping that
                    Mr Wong would execute the documents within the short time-frame on or
                    before 10 August 2009, OCIA, regrettably, only has itself to blame when
                    Mr Wong took advantage to wait out the expiry of the Risk Participation
                    Period. In the words of Mr Tong during the Oral Closing Submissions,
                        “<em>along the way the ball was dropped on getting the
                        thing done</em>”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     Mr Wong’s behaviour in <em>refusing or failing t</em>o respond between 6 and
                    10 August 2009 and in misleading OCIA into believing that his lawyers were
                    reviewing the formal documentation might have been morally reprehensible but as
                    stated by Gill J in <em>Low Kar </em><em>Yit</em>, that is not a relevant consideration:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the result I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that there was no
                        concluded contract between the parties to this action. I say "reluctantly"
                        because of the conduct of the defendants in breaking off the negotiations
                        when the terms of the proposed agreement were agreed upon and in
                        capriciously refusing to sign the agreement. However, in the words of
                        Tomlin J. in <em>Lockett v. Norman
                            Wright</em>, <em>supra</em>, "it is no
                        part of my duty to pronounce whether or not the conduct of any of the
                        parties concerned in this matter is open to censure. All I have to do is to
                        determine whether there is or is not a concluded contract between the
                        plaintiffs and the defendants which the plaintiffs can
                        enforce"…</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Similarly, Selvam J in <em>Thomson
                        Plaza</em> observed at [26]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The law with regard to a commercial contract between hard-nosed
                        businessmen is that, save in extreme cases, the court must not rewrite what
                        the parties have agreed simply by relying on the court's notions of
                        unreasonable or unconscionable conduct. To do so would undermine certainty
                        and security in the law of contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     Accordingly, I find that OCIA had failed to
                    adduce sufficient evidence to displace the <em>prima
                        facie</em> inference. This becomes even clearer upon consideration of
                    Mr Wong’s submissions. Mr Chew relied on four key points in
                    support of his submission that the objective intention of the parties was
                    plainly for the agreement to be legally binding only when the Supplemental
                    Agreement is duly executed in accordance with the Term Sheet:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the fact that the approval of OIC had to be
                            obtained after the 23 June 2009 meeting and before OCIA could
                            proceed with the preparation of the Supplemental
                        Agreement;</div>

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">OCIA’s absence of belief in the existence
                            of a binding oral contract post the 23 June 2009 meeting and prior
                            to the commencement of this suit.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Approval of OCBC’s investment committee
                (“OIC”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Approval by OIC on any proposal discussed
                    between OCIA and Mr Wong was always contemplated. In OCIA’s Quarterly
                    Review dated 16 April 2009, it was expressly stated that if Mr Wong is
                    agreeable to the proposal, OCIA “will seek OIC’s approval before
                    proceeding to documentation.” This was repeated in an email dated
                    18 June 2009 which was sent by Mr Goh to Mr Chua shortly before
                    the 23 June 2009 meeting wherein Mr Goh said that if Mr Wong
                    “is agreeable, we will seek OIC’s approval on those
                    terms”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     The fact that OIC’s approval was
                    required is also corroborated by the slides which were prepared for OIC
                    immediately after the 23 June 2009 meeting. One of the slides specifically
                    stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">APPROVAL SOUGHT</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">OIC’s approval is sought to:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-    approve above proposed terms (including sale of our
                            3.7M Frontken shares to [Mr Wong] at RM0.54 a share);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">-    authorise [George] to approve on the final details
                            of divestment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Further, the minutes of the OIC meeting
                    described the terms set out in the Term Sheet as “proposed terms”
                    and conspicuously made no reference to any oral contract having been concluded
                    with Mr Wong at the 23 June 2009 meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The email which was sent by OCIA immediately
                    after the OIC meeting is also consistent with the fact that OIC’s approval
                    is necessary and is not a mere formality. In Mr Goh’s email dated
                    24 June 2009, he added that “…we wish to inform you that we
                    just got OIC approval to extend the Risk Participation Period for Frontken from
                    July 2010 until as long as we hold shares in Frontken. We are now going into
                    documentation on a supplementary agreement”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Any residual doubt (which I did not entertain)
                    as to the requirement of OIC’s approval was effectively removed through
                    the evidence of Mr Goh in cross-examination:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    So if [Mr Wong] agrees to the terms, you will
                            then go up to OIC and get OIC’s approval, right, on those terms.
                            That is what it says [at 3AB 902] correct?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    Yup.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    … So if Mr Wong is agreeable, you will
                            then ask OIC for approval and then if OIC gives its approval, you will
                            then proceed to documentation. Is that the correct sequence or would
                            that have been the sequence?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    Yah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    … So again, it’s very clear here that
                            you need OIC’s approval after Willie agrees.
                        Correct?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    Yah</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">....</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Court .... Mr Chew’s question is: If that
                            is right, then it really doesn’t matter whether OIC’s
                            approval is obtained. Because if it’s obtained, good, fine and
                            dandy. If it’s not obtained, it’s just too bad, we still
                            have to proceed. That’s your view, right? So do you agree with
                            Mr Chew that it doesn’t matter either way whether OIC’s
                            approval was eventually obtained? From your perspective.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Witness    
              <em>I would say it---it---it

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    
              <em>Yah.</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Q    Thank you. And that is why you needed OIC approval,
                            or you were waiting for OIC approval before going into documentation.
                            Correct? That was part of the sequence?</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A    That was mmma---mmma---the trend of thought that
                            time, yah.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     As rightly pointed out by Mr Chew, as it
                    was still necessary to obtain the approval of OIC after the 23 June 2009
                    meeting before OCIA could proceed with the preparation of the Supplemental
                    Agreement, it would follow that it was still open to OIC to either withhold its
                    approval or to request for further amendments to the terms of the agreement,
                    such that the agreement reached at the 23 June 2009 meeting could not be
                    said to have immediate binding effect upon OCIA or Mr Wong. The fact that
                    George was kept abreast of the negotiations with Mr Wong prior to the
                    23 June 2009 meeting and that OIC’s approval was in fact given in the
                    afternoon of 23 June 2009 after the meeting did not rule out the
                    possibility that OIC could still have withheld its approval. It is equally
                    immaterial that Mr Wong was not aware of the requirement for OIC’s
                    approval as it shows that OCIA could not have intended for legal relations to be
                    immediately binding given their knowledge that OIC’s approval was
                    necessary. After all, according to Mr Goh, the approval of OIC
                        “<em>does matter</em>”. Therefore, in my
                    view, an oral binding contract did not come into being at the 23 June 2009
                    meeting prior to the obtaining of OIC’s approval.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Manner of operation of the agreement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The provisions of the Term Sheet and the
                    conduct of the parties post the 23 June 2009 meeting likewise support the
                    inference that the agreement is to have binding effect only after the execution
                    of formal documentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In addition to the express term requiring
                    “[a] Supplemental Agreement to be executed to <em>effect
                        necessary changes</em>”, another provision in the Term Sheet
                    states: “Shareholder shares in [Frontken] shall be pledged to [OCIA]
                        <em>upon the signing of Agreement</em>”. As
                    mentioned earlier, Mr Wong was required to pledge Frontken shares as
                    security for his potential liabilities under the Supplemental Agreement. The
                    requirement and obligation on Mr Wong to pledge his shares only arises upon
                    the signing of formal documentation. It therefore lends further support to the
                    inference that the agreement is to have binding effect only upon such
                    execution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     Further, another key provision of the Term
                    Sheet was that OCIA would sell to Mr Wong 3,703,704 Frontken shares in five
                    tranches. The first tranche was stipulated to be sold on 31 July 2009, some
                    five weeks after the 23 June 2009 meeting. However, there was no attempt by
                    OCIA to sell the first tranche to Mr Wong when the date arrived. There was
                    no correspondence whatsoever from OCIA in relation to the sale of the first
                    tranche as would be expected if OCIA had regarded the oral contract to be
                    immediately binding following the 23 June 2009 meeting. Instead, in the
                    Sale and Purchase Agreement prepared by OCIA’s legal department which was
                    sent to Mr Wong on 6 August 2009 together with the Supplemental
                    Agreement, the date for the sale of the first tranche was <em>unilaterally</em> changed by OCIA from 31 July 2009 to
                    15 August 2009, which was five days after the expiry of the Risk
                    Participation Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     If there was indeed an oral binding contract
                    concluded on 23 June 2009, OCIA would have taken steps to sell the first
                    tranche on 31 July 2009. As the Term Sheet stipulated an <em>effective</em> sale price of RM 0.54 per share (as Mr Wong is
                    required to compensate for the difference between Market Price and RM 0.54),
                    which was OCIA’s average cost per share and was significantly higher than
                    the market price as well as the floor price per share at that time, OCIA would
                    have reduced its risk exposure significantly by proceeding with the sale.
                    Further, it is trite that the terms of a concluded contract can only be varied
                    by mutual agreement (<em>Chitty</em>, para 22-032);
                    however, the consent of Mr Wong to the change in the date for the sale of
                    the first tranche was never procured. While at common law a contract may validly
                    confer on one contracting party the power to unilaterally vary the contract
                        (<em>Chitty</em>, para 22-039), there was no such
                    provision in the agreement here. It is irrelevant that the amendment caused no
                    prejudice to Mr Wong or that it was in fact “beneficial” in
                    deferring the purchase date. Instead, OCIA’s failure to sell the first
                    tranche and its subsequent amendment of the date of sale for the first tranche
                    evidenced two things: (a) the terms agreed on 23 June 2009 were not
                    regarded as immediately binding as they could still be amended, and
                    (b) OCIA viewed the agreement as binding only after its final execution,
                    and having failed to have the contract executed before 31 July 2009, it
                    stipulated a new transaction date of 15 August 2009 for the first tranche.
                    The other difficulty with the unilateral amendment in respect of the sale of the
                    first tranche is that it necessarily implies that Mr Wong would be in
                    breach of contract if he fails to purchase the first tranche on 15 August
                    2009. How could Mr Wong be in breach of a term which he never agreed
                    to?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     When questioned on OCIA’s omission to
                    sell the first tranche on 31 July 2009, Mr Goh offered the following
                    explanation:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Can you explain to us why there was no such sale of
                            the shares to Mr Wong on 31<sup>st</sup> of July
                            2009?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">We wanted to---first on our mind is to get the
                            documentation signed. So---er, er, and then we thought he would execute
                            it after the signing of the documentation and---and we don’t see
                            any detriment ah to him lah by not buying, er, slightly earlier---I mean
                            or slightly later.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">The first part of Mr Goh’s explanation is unhelpful to
                    OCIA’s case – the priority placed on the execution of the contract
                    over an immediate opportunity to reduce OCIA’s risk exposure goes to show
                    that OCIA had treated the agreement as having legal effect only upon formal
                    execution. The second part of Mr Goh’s explanation is unconvincing
                    – it is difficult to believe that OCIA was willing to postpone the sale
                    because there was no detriment to Mr Wong. This is <em>non
                        sequitur</em> to OCIA’s omission to sell the first tranche
                    shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Furthermore, the preamble in the Term Sheet
                    referred to a disclaimer which reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">THIS PROPOSAL IS TO BE USED FOR CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS, AND DOES NOT
                        CONSTITUTE A COMMITMENT OF OCBC BANK TO LEND, INVEST OR AN AGREEMENT OF OCBC
                        BANK TO PREPARE, NEGOTIATE, EXECUTE OR DELIVER SUCH A COMMITMENT... THE
                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL... <b>MAY BE MODIFIED

                            TIME TO TIME DURING THE COURSE OF ITS DUE DILIGENCE AND CREDIT APPROVAL
                            PROCESS</b> OR AS A RESULT OF CHANGED MARKET CONDITIONS OR
                        OTHERWISE…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in bold added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The above disclaimer was inserted by OCIA in
                    the Term Sheet for the purpose of the 23 June 2009 meeting. The disclaimer
                    was added because OCIA knew that the proposal required the approval of OIC and
                    that OIC may modify the proposal as it deems fit. This is again entirely
                    consistent with the fact that the proposal was submitted to OIC for approval
                    immediately after the 23 June 2009 meeting. This is a point of some
                    significance which is to be contrasted with the court’s finding in
                        <em>PRA</em> at [33] that “neither party was at liberty to insert in the
                    conformed contract document a term which had not been agreed prior to the award
                    of the contract”. It is no surprise that in <em>Rossiter</em> at 1151, a similar observation which led the House
                    of Lords to find that a binding contract was concluded was “that those
                    who draw up the formal agreement have not the power to vary the terms already
                    settled”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The fact that no binding oral contract was
                    concluded at the 23 June 2009 meeting can also be inferred from the
                    complete absence of any reference in the Supplemental Agreement to the alleged
                    oral contract of 23 June 2009 notwithstanding the recital of the background
                    facts. In fact, cl 7.6 of the Supplemental Agreement states that it
                    “shall be effective as of the date hereof irrespective of the diverse
                    dates upon which the respective parties may have executed [it]”.That
                    certainly does not relate back to 23 June 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Course of dealing between the parties</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     The course of dealing between the parties also
                    reveals that the parties have dealt with each other on the basis that agreements
                    are legally binding only upon formal execution. This was the common
                    understanding of the parties with respect to the RPA, the very document which
                    the Supplemental Agreement sought to amend.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     For the RPA, a draft dated 5 July 2007
                    was sent to Mr Wong and the terms of the draft were presumably agreed some
                    time shortly thereafter. The RPA was eventually executed on 20 July 2007.
                    The evidence shows that this was the date treated by the parties as the date on
                    which binding legal relations came into being:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_a"></a>(a)     First, in the Affidavits of
                        Evidence-in-Chief (“AEICs”) of all three witnesses for OCIA
                        (Mr Chua, Mr Goh and Vincent), it was common ground that OCIA and
                        Mr Wong entered into the RPA on 20 July 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_72-p2_b"></a>(b)     Secondly, Vincent’s evidence
                        during cross-examination was that if Mr Wong had not signed the RPA on
                        20 July 2007, OCIA would not have proceeded with its purchase of
                        Frontken shares on 24 July 2007:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Right. So let me ask you this, if Mr Wong had
                            not signed the [RPA] on the 20<sup>th</sup> of July,
                            even though instructions had been given to the lawyers to prepare the
                            execution copy, would OCIA have proceeded and accepted the placement
                            shares on the 24<sup>th</sup> of July?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Er, probably not.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Probably not. Probably not because he hadn’t
                            signed it, correct?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Er, yes.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Further, the evidence was that the usual
                    business practice of OCIA was to act on executed documents, and not on oral
                    agreements. This was confirmed by Mr Goh in cross-examination:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Can you tell me if the bank, OCBC or OCIA, is
                            generally in the habit of acting on oral agreements?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">The---the bank’s practice is to have document
                            [sic].</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">This is most probably true of most, if not all, financial
                    institutions and reinforces the inference that the common understanding between
                    OCIA and Mr Wong was that any agreement would only be legally binding when
                    formal documents are executed as expressly provided for under the Term
                    Sheet.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">OCIA’s conduct is consistent with its absence of belief in the
                existence of a binding oral contract</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In addition, Mr Chew also raised three
                    material facts to demonstrate OCIA’s own absence of belief of a binding
                    oral contract concluded at the 23 June 2009 meeting:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a>(a)     OCIA’s attempts to salvage the
                        agreement after the expiry of the Risk Participation Period, including
                        –</p>

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a>(b)     Evidence of
                        OCIA’s representatives under cross-examination indicating their
                        absence of belief in the existence of a binding oral contract reached at the
                        23 June 2009 meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_c"></a>(c)     The urgency with which OCIA treated the execution of the
                        Supplemental Agreement in view of the impending expiry of the Risk
                        Participation Period.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     Before examining the evidence which supports
                    OCIA’s absence of belief of a concluded oral contract at the 23 June
                    2009 meeting, I should make clear that the absence of such belief, <em>of itself</em>, is not strictly decisive. As observed by
                    Michael Black QC sitting as a Deputy Judge in <em>Kvaerner
                        Construction Ltd v Eggar (Barony) Ltd</em>
                    [2000] All ER (D) 1157 (“<em>Kvaerner</em>”), “its only value is as an echo of an
                    earlier intention, it cannot stand alone”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     After the expiry of the Risk Participation
                    Period on 10 August 2009, OCIA requested Mr Wong to sign a
                    “Letter of Extension” in order to extend the Risk Participation
                    Period until 31 August 2009. Subsequently OCIA sought to amend the
                    “Letter of Extension” to grant an indefinite extension to the Risk
                    Participation Period until the execution of the Supplemental
                Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     However, under the Term Sheet, the Risk
                    Participation Period would be “[i]n force immediately following
                    Restricted Period (1 July 2010) <em>for as long as [OCIA]
                        continues to hold its Frontken shares</em> [emphasis added]”.
                    As such, if a binding oral contract on the terms of the Term Sheet was reached
                    at the 23 June 2009 meeting, there would have been no need for an extension
                    of the Risk Participation Period as it would already have been extended
                    indefinitely. Instead, OCIA’s attempts to obtain an interim extension
                    prior to execution revealed that OCIA did not itself believe that there was
                    already a binding oral contract in place. Further, in Mr Chua’s email
                    to Mr Wong on 21 August 2009, the stated reason for the Letter of
                    Extension was for the positions for the parties “to remain <em>status quo</em> (as at 10/8/09) until we sign the new
                    supplemental agreement”. This contradicts OCIA’s case as it
                    suggests that contractual relations between the parties were intended to change
                    (to that governed by the Term Sheet) only upon the signing of the Supplemental
                    Agreement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     After OCIA failed to persuade Mr Wong to
                    sign the “Letter of Extension” or the Supplemental Agreement, a
                    meeting with Mr Wong was arranged on 28 August 2009 wherein
                    Mr Wong again declined to sign the Supplemental Agreement. The following
                    email was sent by Mr Chua to Mr Wong and Nicholas on the same date,
                    wherein a new “restructuring” proposal was mentioned as being
                    discussed at the meeting:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear [Mr Wong] and Nicholas</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thank you for the meeting, it was very enlightening to understand the
                        history of the deal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">To recap, I would appreciate your confirmation on the basic principle of
                        restructuring this deal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    OCBC cost per share is now brought to RM 0.47
                            (original RM 15m)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    Shareholding is 27,630,400 shares (RM
                            12,986,288)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    Current share price of Frontken RM 0.23 (RM
                             6,354,992)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    The understanding is that OCBC would be able to
                            recover RM 12.98m from this restructuring with some potential
                            upside.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Initial thoughts are</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">1.    OCBC will extend a RM 10m loan to
                        Frontken</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.    RM6.3m will be retained in a controlled account for
                            the use of share buy back</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">3.    OCBC will charge RM 3.7m as fees for arranging the
                            restructuring</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">4.    Frontken will repay a total of RM 12.98M on the
                            loan over 3 years (preferably quarterly repayments)</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">5.    OCBC will option to buy up to RM 10m worth of new
                            Frontken shares at exercise price of RM 0.25 with mandatory conversion
                            at RM 0.47</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     As can be seen, this new proposal was entirely
                    dissimilar to the agreement envisaged by the Term Sheet. The contracting parties
                    were now OCIA and Frontken, and Mr Wong was not even a party at all –
                    there is no sale of shares from OCIA to Mr Wong, no Risk Participation by
                    Mr Wong and no share pledge by Mr Wong. Instead, the essence of the
                    new proposal was a loan from OCIA for the purposes of a share buy-back by
                    Frontken, coupled with an option for OCIA to purchase more Frontken shares. The
                    rationale behind this new proposal was explained by Mr Chua under
                    cross-examination:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Nicholas came up with an idea that since Frontken was going to do
                        a restructuring, maybe, er, a share buyback, er maybe we could restructure
                        this re---er deal <em>so that, you know, we could still
                            salvage something out of this</em>…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     Instead of asserting its rights under the
                    purported oral contract, OCIA opted to pursue a new and completely distinct
                    proposal in order to “salvage” the deal with Mr Wong. It is
                    therefore clear that OCIA itself did not recognise that a binding contract had
                    come into being at the 23 June 2009 meeting given the non-execution of the
                    Supplemental Agreement. It is certainly incongruous for OCIA to extend a new
                    loan of RM10 million to Frontken to resolve a breach of an oral contract by its
                    CEO, Mr Wong.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     From the evidence of Mr Chua and
                    Mr Goh under cross-examination, it is apparent that they likewise did not
                    themselves recognise that a binding contract was concluded at the meeting on
                    23 June 2009. The most telling evidence came from Mr Chua:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">So if Mr Wong, after the
                                23<sup>rd</sup> June meeting had called you back
                            half an hour later and said, “You know, Mr Chua, I---I---I
                            think I---I don’t want to go through with this”, would you
                            have said, ”It’s too late”?</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I---I would have said that, erm,
                            “Mr Wong, er, please be prepared that I’ll be selling
                            27 million shares into the market within the next
                            5---with---with---within the next 2 months”.</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">As such, if OCIA had received earlier notice that Mr Wong
                    would not sign the Supplemental Agreement, it would have treated the RPA as
                    still binding and the new arrangements under the Term Sheet as not binding, and
                    would have proceeded to dispose of its shareholding in Frontken “within
                    the next 2 months”, <em>ie</em>, by August 2009
                    as provided under the RPA. The obvious inference is that the oral contract could
                    not have been intended to be binding unless the Supplemental Agreement was
                    executed. If OCIA had regarded the oral contract as binding, OCIA would not have
                    sold off the shares immediately since the new Risk Participation Period would
                    not have commenced prior to 1 July 2010 as stated in the Term
                Sheet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Further, Mr Goh had also conceded under
                    cross-examination that execution of the Supplemental Agreement is necessary for
                    the agreement to be binding and that OCIA’s conduct was consistent with
                    that conclusion:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">Q:</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">I put it to you, Mr Goh, that <em>it was all along intended that for there to be any binding

                                into a written supplemental agreement. Do you agree or

<p class="Judg-1">This concession by Mr Goh is quite critical since he was one of
                    the key personnel from OCIA who was directly involved in the negotiations with
                    Mr Wong. It is also entirely in line with the objective evidence before
                    me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The fact that OCIA treated the Risk
                    Participation Period as binding and the new arrangements under the Term Sheet as
                    not binding until the signing of the Supplemental Agreement is also evidenced by
                    the urgency with which OCIA treated the preparation and signing of the
                    Supplemental Agreement in light of the impending expiry date of 10 August
                    2009. The urgent requirement for the Supplemental Agreement to be executed can
                    be gleaned from the following email messages:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mr Chua’s email to
                        Mr Wong, Nicholas and Mr Goh on 24 June 2009, 1 day after the
                        23 June 2009 meeting, in which he stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Hi [Mr Wong] &amp; Nicholas</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Thank you for the meeting yesterday, it was great that we were able to

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Hi Mei Lin</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">I refer to our phone conversation yesterday and as indicated, need to

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_83-p2_d"></a>(d)     Repeated attempts
                        by OCIA to contact Mr Wong after the formal documentation was sent to
                        him on 6 August 2009.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     If there was indeed a binding oral contract in
                    place after the 23 June 2009 meeting, the new terms regarding the Risk
                    Participation Period would have been in force, while the original expiry date of
                    the Risk Participation Period of 10 August 2009 superseded. The only
                    reasonable explanation for OCIA’s repeated displays of urgency in
                    requiring the execution of the Supplemental Agreement before 10 August
                    2009, and more significantly its own acknowledgment of the expiry of the
                    existing Risk Participation Period, is that no binding oral contract was reached
                    at the 23 June 2009 meeting.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Mr Tong, however, stressed that
                    OCIA’s representatives being lay persons may not have fully appreciated
                    the legal significance of their conduct and/or their language in the email
                    messages. However, in contract law, the court is concerned with the objective
                    intention of the contracting parties, <em>ie</em>, what a
                    reasonable, ordinary observer of their conduct would think their intention was.
                    The legal knowledge (or lack thereof) of a contracting party is irrelevant if
                    their conduct is inconsistent with the existence of a binding oral
                    contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Mr Tong further added that employees of a
                    bank would invariably insist on formalities and/or procedures to be complied
                    with so that the bank will be better protected against prospective claims and/or
                    disputes. This is precisely the point – employees (acting as agents of
                    banks) and customers of banks typically transact on the basis that formalities
                    are required for a binding agreement and this inference has to be displaced by
                    compelling evidence to the contrary in the particular case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Having examined all the points raised by
                    Mr Chew, I would have found that no binding oral contract was concluded at
                    the 23 June 2009 meeting even if the burden was on
                Mr Wong.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">OCIA’s alternative estoppel argument</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     OCIA also relied on the doctrine of estoppel
                    by convention, the elements of which are set out in <em>Travista
                        Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee Augustine and others</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 474:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the parties to a transaction acted on “an
                            assumed and incorrect state of fact or law”;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the assumption is shared by both, or made by one
                            and acquiesced in by the other; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the parties are precluded from denying the truth
                            of that assumption, if it would be unjust or unconscionable to allow
                            them (or one of them) to go back on it.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Estoppel by convention is further explained in
                        <em>Chitty</em>, para 3-107:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Such an estoppel differs from estoppel by representation and from
                        promissory estoppel in that it <em>does not depend on any
                            representation or promise</em>. It can arise by virtue of a common
                        assumption which was not induced by the party alleged to be estopped but
                        which was based on a mistake spontaneously made by the party relying on it
                        and acquiesced in by the other party. It seems, however, that the assumption
                            <em>resembles the representation required to give rise to
                            other forms of estoppel to the extent that it must be
                            “unambiguous and unequivocal”</em>… [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     As is the case with estoppel by representation
                    and promissory estoppel, estoppel by convention is usually considered <em>a “shield” and not a
                    “sword”</em>, that is to say, it does not create any cause
                    of action when none existed before. See Chitty, para 3-113. However, as
                    noted by Phang JA in <em>Tee </em><em>Soon </em><em>Kay </em><em>v
                        Attorney-General</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 133, there has
                    been gradual recognition of the use of estoppel as a
                    “sword”:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… by invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel, the respondent
                        appears, whether by design or otherwise, to be utilising this doctrine as a
                        cause of action in itself. Whether or not this is permissible is an issue
                        that is still shrouded in some controversy. It was always assumed that such
                        a course of action was impermissible. However, the leading Australian High
                        Court decision of <em>Waltons Stores (Interstate)
                            Limited v Maher</em> (1988) 164 CLR 387 allowed the
                        doctrine of promissory estoppel to be utilised as a cause of action in
                        itself: as (in traditional terminology) a "sword" (as opposed to merely a
                        "shield" or defence (as exemplified in the oft-cited English Court of Appeal
                        decision of <em>Combe v Combe</em> [1951]
                        2 KB 215)). There is, in fact, some indication that even in
                        England, a more flexible approach might be adopted. In the recent English
                        Court of Appeal decision of <em>Baird Textiles Holdings
                            Ltd v Marks &amp; Spencer plc</em> [2002]
                        1 All ER (Comm) 737, for example, Sir Andrew Morritt VC did
                        refer to the Australian High Court decision of <em>Waltons Stores (Interstate) Limited v Maher</em>. Morritt VC,
                        whilst not completely closing the door to allowing estoppel to function as
                        the absence of precedent as well as the need for sufficient certainty (which
                        he did not find on the facts) (see <em>ibid</em>
                        at 751). The learned judge did, however, acknowledge that the House of
                        Lords might adopt a different (and more liberal) approach in the future
                        (at 751-752). Judge and Mance LJJ were also of a similar view:
                        emphasising both the point from precedent as well as the desirability of
                        distinguishing amongst the various categories of estoppel (at 753-754
                        and at 760-763 respectively). However, in view of our decision that
                        there are no problems relating to consideration with regard to the contracts
                        entered into by the appellants, we do not have to decide this particular
                        issue in the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The idea that estoppel can only be used as a
                    “shield” is also somewhat mitigated by the principle that one can
                    be estopped from denying the existence of a contract which effectively renders
                    estoppel as an alternative “sword” in the event that an action for
                    breach of contract fails. See <em>Waltons Stores (Interstate)
                        Limited v Maher</em> (1988) 164 CLR 387
                        (“<em>Waltons Stores</em>”); <em>Mitsui Babcock Energy Limited v John Brown Engineering</em>
                    (1997) 51 Con LR 129; <em>Kvaerner</em>.
                    This is the precise context in which OCIA is seeking to apply estoppel by
                    convention in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     
          <em>Waltons Stores</em>
                    is a case of particular relevance to our present case as the High Court of
                    Australia held that although the want of formal execution led to the absence of
                    a binding lease agreement, the company was estopped from denying that it was
                    bound. In <em>Waltons Stores</em>, a company had negotiated
                    to lease some land from the owner. The owner was to demolish a building and
                    construct a new one to the company's specifications. The company’s
                    solicitor forwarded a draft lease to the owner’s solicitor to which the
                    latter suggested certain amendments. On 7 November 1983, the owner’s
                    solicitor told the company’s solicitor that it was essential that the
                    agreement be concluded within the next day or so, and that the owner did not
                    wish to demolish the building until it was clear that there were no
                    problems with the lease. The company’s solicitor said that the company had
                    notified him orally that the suggested amendments to the draft lease were
                    acceptable but he would get formal instructions and would inform the
                    owner’s solicitor the next day whether the company disagreed with any of
                    them. He then sent the owner’s solicitor a redrafted lease incorporating
                    the suggested amendments without objecting to the amendments on the next day or
                    at all. On 11 November 1983, the owner’s solicitor forwarded to the
                    company's solicitor an executed lease “by way of exchange”. The
                    owner then began to demolish the building. About a week later the company had
                    second thoughts about proceeding with the transaction, and after having been
                    told by its solicitor that it was not bound to proceed unless parts
                    were exchanged, told him to “go slow”. Shortly thereafter,
                    the company became aware that the demolition was proceeding. Early in January
                    1984, the owner commenced building works. The building was about 40 percent
                    completed when on 19 January 1984, the company informed the owner that it
                    did not intend to proceed. No communication was exchanged between the
                    company’s solicitors and the owner’s solicitor between
                    11 November 1983 and 19 January 1984.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Mason CJ, Wilson, Brennan and
                    Deane JJ. held that the company was estopped from retreating from its
                    implied promise to complete the contract because knowing the owner had exposed
                    himself to detriment by acting on the basis of a mistaken assumption that the
                    contract was concluded, it was unconscionable for it to adopt a course of
                    inaction which encouraged the owner in the course he had adopted. Deane J
                    further held that the retention of the executed lease by the company’s
                    solicitor and the company’s deliberate silence and inaction had caused the
                    owner to mistakenly assume that a binding contract existed and to act on that
                    assumption to his detriment. Gaudron J held that the company’s
                    imprudence in failing to inform the owner that exchange might not occur caused
                    the owner to act on the assumption that an exchange had taken place, and it
                    would be unjust and unfair to allow departure from that
                assumption.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     There is, however, an important distinction
                    between <em>Waltons Stores</em> and the present case. In
                        <em>Waltons Stores</em>, there was an
                    “unambiguous and unequivocal” assumption that there was a
                    concluded contract held by the owner which led him to go so far as to demolish
                    the old building and construct 40 percent of the new building before being
                    informed by the company that it did not intend to proceed. The company
                    acquiesced in this assumption by its deliberate silence and inaction despite
                    knowledge that the demolition work was underway. In the present case, there is
                    no such “unambiguous and unequivocal” assumption by OCIA as
                    regards the conclusion of a binding oral agreement. Mr Tong accepted that a
                    finding by the court that OCIA did not intend to be bound immediately would be
                    fatal to its alternative estoppel argument.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     As stated earlier at <a href="#p1_74">[74]</a>–<a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above, the evidence shows that OCIA was mindful of the fact
                    that the expiry date of 10 August 2009 under the existing RPA was looming
                    and treated with some urgency the need to secure the execution of the formal
                    documentation before that deadline. OCIA neither treated the original expiry
                    date as having been superseded by the Term Sheet, nor treated formal execution
                    as a mere formality. While OCIA did hold off an open market sale of its Frontken
                    shares, that conduct is equally consistent with its understanding that the terms
                    of the Term Sheet were more advantageous than the option of an open market sale,
                    and its expectation that Mr Wong would eventually execute the Supplemental
                    Agreement. However strong that expectation might be, in my view, it did not
                    qualify as an “unambiguous and unequivocal” assumption. Instead,
                    OCIA took the risk that Mr Wong might not sign off on the Supplemental
                    Agreement eventually when it forwarded the finalised draft to Mr Wong with
                    only four days of the Risk Participation Period remaining. Unfortunately for
                    OCIA, it waited too long in finalising the draft. In the result, it did not have
                    any sufficient time to react to Mr Wong’s refusal to sign the
                    Supplemental Agreement and therefore must bear the unfortunate consequences of
                    its own delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     As such, there is no need in the present case
                    to decide whether estoppel by convention can be used as a “sword”
                    as there was no common assumption that a binding oral contract existed or that
                    the Risk Participation Period had been extended. Accordingly the estoppel
                    argument fails <em>in limine</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     For all the reasons stated above, I find that
                    no <em>binding</em> oral agreement was concluded at the
                    23 June 2009 meeting. Both parties specifically contemplated and agreed
                    that the changes to the RPA would have to be effected by way of an executed
                    Supplemental Agreement which was never signed by either party. In the result,
                    OCIA’s claim is dismissed with costs.</p>
