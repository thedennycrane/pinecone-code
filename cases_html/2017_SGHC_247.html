A dispute arose between OGSP and Comfort, as a consequence of which OGSP lodged a payment claim titled Payment Claim No 12 (“PC12”) against Comfort for certain work done. Comfort did not file a payment response. Although Comfort eventually filed an adjudication response during the adjudication proceedings, the adjudication response was invalid as it was out of time. Hence, OGSP obtained an adjudication determination dated 21 April 2017 in its favour (“the AD”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 OGSP filed Originating Summons No 478 of 2017 (“OS 478”) to enforce the AD as a judgment debt. In response, Comfort filed Summons No 2425 of 2017 (“SUM 2425”) to set aside the AD.

The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd</span> [2013] 3 SLR 380 (“<span class="font-italic">W </span><span class="font-italic">Y Steel</span>”) expressed the respondent’s right to have patent errors considered even though it did not file a payment response in the following terms (at [50]–[52]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">50 Notwithstanding this, we consider the question of whether it would even have been open to W Y Steel, who had not filed a payment response, to make a submission that Osko’s payment claim was patently in error…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51 … In our judgment, under s 17(3) of the Act, even where no response has been filed, an adjudicator must make a determination, and in doing so, it is incumbent on him to consider the material which is <span class="font-italic">properly</span> before him and which he is permitted and, indeed, obliged to consider. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">52 In our judgment, an adjudicator is bound to consider the payment claim before him and cannot make his determination as if the fact that the respondent has not filed a response obviates the need for him to consider the material properly before him. The adjudication does not become a mere formality. The adjudicator is obliged to adjudicate, and in discharging this obligation, he must consider the material properly before him and make an independent and impartial determination in a timely manner …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 Nevertheless, it must be emphasised that the court “should not review the merits of an adjudicator’s decision” (<span class="font-italic">Lee Wee Lick Terence (alias Li </span><span class="font-italic">Weili Terence) v Chua Say Eng (formerly trading as Weng Fatt Construction Engineering) and another appeal</span> [2013] 1 SLR 401 at [66]). Thus, my focus was confined to the issue of whether the adjudicator had failed to consider and spot patent errors in the adjudication application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 As to what is meant by patent errors, the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> intimated that this would refer to “errors manifest from the material that was properly before the [a]djudicator” (at [54]). This was similarly stated by Lee Seiu Kin J in <span class="font-italic">Aik</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Contracts and Services Pte Ltd v Deshin Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2015] SGHC 293 where he noted that patent errors were those that were “on the face of that material” [emphasis omitted] (at [30]). In <span class="font-italic">Kingsford Construction Pte Ltd v A Deli Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2017] SGHC 174, I provided an illustration of a patent error at [35] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… For instance, if the documentary evidence submitted by the claimant plainly contradicted its claimed amount, the respondent would be entitled to point that out to the adjudicator. Indeed, this accords with the plain and simple meaning of “patent” under the Oxford Dictionary which refers to something that is “easily recognisable” or “obvious”. Hence, the adjudicators in this case had to spot obvious and clear cut errors in the payment claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In the present case, I adopted these statements of the law and found that the search for patent errors must be limited to the face of the relevant documents.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 With these principles in mind, I turn now to explain why I found that the adjudicator did not fail to consider any alleged patent errors in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The adjudicator was aware that he had to scrutinise OGSP’s adjudication application for patent errors. This was clear from para 65 of the AD, where the adjudicator noted that “even in the absence of a payment response or an adjudication response, I must not merely rubber stamp a claim. I must consider the material properly before me and consider if there are patent errors”.

</div> Hence, this was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a case where the adjudicator did not know that he had the duty to consider patent errors and hence failed to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Comfort’s argument was essentially that despite having been aware of his duty to look out for patent errors, the adjudicator either failed to spot these errors or had paid lip service to his duty. Neither of these was tenable on the facts before me. Instead, the adjudicator had explicitly referred to the “full lump sum contract price”, the “VO 2 [<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the variation order]”, and the “Costs of Materials”. He had compared these claims made by Comfort against the documents in the adjudication application. There was no evidence at all to suggest that the adjudicator had not done what he said.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Comfort additionally submitted that the adjudicator had failed to spot a patent error as he did not consider the contractual provisions before him, particularly cl 11, as required by s 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the SOPA. Section 17(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(3) Subject to subsection (4), in determining an adjudication application, an adjudicator shall only have regard to the following matters:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) the provisions of the contract to which the adjudication application relates;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In my view, s 17(3) does not prescribe what the adjudicator <span class="font-italic">must</span> consider. Rather, it sets out the <span class="font-italic">outer </span><span class="font-italic">limits</span> of what the adjudicator can consider, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the adjudicator cannot consider anything outside what is stated in s 17(3). When a case falls within the outer limits set by s 17(3), the relevant provision is s 15(3), which provides that where the respondent does not file a payment response, the adjudicator cannot consider the respondent’s “reason[s] for withholding any amount”. Hence, I did not accept Comfort’s submissions that the adjudicator in this case was obliged to look at the contractual provisions by virtue of s 17(3) of the SOPA. Instead, the adjudicator would have been wrong to consider the reasons that Comfort provided unless these were reasons that were already on the face of the record, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, patent errors. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In any event, even if Comfort were right and the adjudicator needed to consider cl 11, I was not satisfied that this was a patent error. The relevant portions of cl 11 provide that OGSP must have provided “relevant supporting documents” for its claim for variation works, which the adjudicator clearly considered at para 68.2 of the AD. The adjudicator looked at the “table summarizing the details” of the variation order and a letter dated 25 October 2016 enclosing two appendices of drawings. The adjudicator clearly considered these to be sufficient supporting documents. To the extent that Comfort was arguing that these were not <span class="font-italic">sufficient</span> supporting documents, this was an attempt to review the merits of the adjudicator’s decision. As I noted above at [22], it is not the function of the court to review the AD’s merits in a setting-aside application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 It was very unfortunate that Comfort took a condescending approach when it replied to OGSP’s PC12 on 30 March 2017. Comfort took the view that it did not need to file a payment response and it must live with the consequences of its decision. If Comfort was so determined to dispute PC12, as its solicitors have done so vigorously in these proceedings, then it should have lodged a payment response with all the reasons that it had canvassed before the court. The adjudicator would then be obliged to consider those reasons subject to the limits in s 17(3) of the SOPA. Comfort refused to take this golden opportunity and it could not use this court as a forum to ventilate its arguments as to the merits, having chosen to sit on its hands when it could have lodged a payment response. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> faced a similar application and it had this to say (at [54]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… W Y Steel was not seeking to rely on errors manifest from the material that was properly before the Adjudicator. Rather, it was seeking to remedy the irremediable consequences of its failure to file a payment response. Significantly, the Adjudication Determination expressly stated … that the Adjudicator did consider “the parties’ submissions and the matters an adjudicator can consider … pursuant to the provisions of section 17(3) of the [Act]”, and there is nothing to indicate that he did not in fact do so. Certainly, there was nothing in the arguments presented before us that went to making good W Y Steel’s suggestion that the Adjudicator had applied a blank or unthinking mind to the issues before him. Accordingly, this argument also fails.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 The Court of Appeal’s comments in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> were also apposite in this case. I rejected Comfort’s attempt to introduce its arguments on the merits of its case by the back door.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Accordingly, I was satisfied that the adjudicator did look out for patent errors and found there were none before he delivered the AD. But even assuming that the adjudicator did overlook some patent errors, whether the court would set aside the AD would depend on the seriousness and the extent of the patent errors. If the patent errors were minor and had a marginal or insignificant impact on the adjudication sum, then logically these would be insufficient to set aside the AD. The court would not readily set aside an adjudication determination for the slightest reasons. This approach is also in line with the overall purpose and objective of the SOPA, which is to provide quick justice for the building and construction industry that has cashflow as its lifeblood. I noted these concerns in the recent case of <span class="font-italic">AES Façade Pte Ltd v WYSE </span><span class="font-italic">Pte Ltd</span> [2017] SGHC 171 (“<span class="font-italic">AES Façade</span>”) at [23] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">At the same time, Parliament recognised that quick justice may not be perfect. An adjudication process speedy enough to ensure that payment was made before its withholding became commercially dangerous was necessary. It was acknowledged that the adjudication process might not be expected to provide the same level of scrutiny and sophisticated legal analysis as would be available before a court or an ordinary arbitral tribunal. In that sense adjudication under the SOP Act delivers a “roughshod” kind of justice, which is compensated for by the fact that the adjudication only has “temporary finality”, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, finality until the dispute is “reopened at a later time and ventilated in another more thorough and deliberate forum” (<span class="font-italic">W</span><span class="font-italic"> Y Steel</span> at [22]). …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A court that readily sets aside adjudication determinations would not be acting in line with the purpose of the SOPA. This is because it would allow unsatisfied respondents to set aside adjudication determinations based on inconsequential failures to consider patent errors, thereby delaying the quick justice envisaged by the SOPA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 However, this was not the case here as I found that the adjudicator had not been in breach of his duty to consider patent errors on the face of the materials before him. Thus, there was no need to deal with the issue of whether the errors were sufficiently material to warrant a setting aside. Accordingly, I rejected Comfort’s submissions that the AD should be set aside on this ground.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Allegations of OGSP’s conspiracy to defraud Comfort</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It was not entirely clear whether the statutory scheme under the SOPA provides for the challenge of adjudication determinations on the ground that it had been obtained by fraud. However, some decided cases appear to have made comments to that effect. In <span class="font-italic">Mansource</span><span class="font-italic"> Interior Pte Ltd v Citiwall Safety Glass Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 3 SLR 264, I noted that “[a]lthough there have been no cases that have held that fraud should be a ground for setting aside an adjudication determination, I am of the opinion that it is a valid ground for setting aside” (at [31]). I did not, however, ultimately make a finding of fraud on the facts. This case went on appeal but the finding on fraud was irrelevant for the purposes of the appeal (see <span class="font-italic">Citiwall</span><span class="font-italic"> Safety Glass Pte Ltd v Mansource Interior Pte Ltd</span> [2015] 5 SLR 482 at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 A similar sentiment was expressed by Lee Seiu Kin J in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel Construction Pte Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Osko Pte Ltd</span> [2012] SGHC 194 at [7], where Lee J concluded that the adjudication determination in that case was valid “except for the possible exception of a clear case of fraud”. Again, this finding was not referenced on appeal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In the Supreme Court of New South Wales case of <span class="font-italic">QC Communications NSW Pty Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">CivComm Pty Ltd</span> [2016] NSWSC 1095 (“<span class="font-italic">CivComm</span>”), the New South Wales Supreme Court interpreted the provisions of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Act 46 of 1999), which is <span class="font-italic">in </span><span class="font-italic">pari materia</span> with the SOPA. The court concluded at [31]–[32] that where an adjudication determination was obtained by fraud in which the adjudicator was not involved, the adjudication determination may be set aside by court proceedings akin to the situation where a judgment was obtained by fraud. The court went on to explain that this may occur where the application is based on facts discovered after the judgment which are material, and it is reasonably clear that the fresh evidence would have provided an opposite verdict.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 I agreed with these observations and found that where an adjudication determination was obtained by fraud that did not pertain to the adjudicator, it may be set aside under the SOPA. Although no provision within the SOPA expressly provides that an adjudication determination obtained by fraud can be set aside by the court, it is trite that the court will not allow its processes to be used to facilitate fraud. An adjudication determination is enforced by applying to the court for an order to enforce it as a judgment debt. Hence, the court will not assist in this process where the adjudication determination had been obtained by fraud on the part of one party. Furthermore, in this case, both parties accepted that fraud was a ground to set aside the AD.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 However, I did not find any evidence of fraud on the facts of this case. Comfort alleged that OGSP had entered into a conspiracy with SS Mechanical and Pintu to defraud it. According to Comfort, under the conspiracy OGSP would claim inflated sums to be collected from Comfort. Pintu and SS Mechanical would assist in this process as Pintu was the point of contact between Comfort and OGSP as the project manager. Hence, Pintu would have known of any ‘frontloading’ (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, inflated claims) that had taken place. To support its claim, Comfort produced an audio transcript of its meeting with Pintu. It asserted that the transcript was evidence of the “frontloading” by OGSP, in that Pintu had admitted to the frontloading during the course of the interview with one Lim Fatt Seng (“Lim”) and Wenda Lew.

Instead, Pintu had not only denied the allegation but had also explained that there were back-to-back contracts between OGSP and Comfort, and between Comfort and Lead Management Engineering &amp; Construction Pte Ltd (“Lead”). Under these contracts, OGSP would complete work for Comfort which would in turn complete work for Lead. Hence, the process of certifying work done was managed by Lead and not by Comfort or Pintu himself. Therefore, Pintu could not have facilitated the process of making inflated claims nor could he have been part of any conspiracy with OGSP to submit inflated claims. Pintu’s position was consistent with cl 4 of the Contract, which provides that the payment from Comfort to OGSP would only be due 30 days after Comfort received the payment from Lead.

</div> Comfort submitted that OGSP knew that it was only owed $73,077.79 but claimed $890,262.23. This showed that OGSP did not honestly believe that the items stated in PC12 were true. Hence, OGSP fraudulently intended to deceive Comfort in the adjudication. In response, Comfort submitted that OGSP did not include the sums in Variation Order No 2 (“VO2”) in the audit confirmation because at the time of the audit confirmation, the adjudication application had not yet been made. Hence, OGSP was unable to recognise the sum of $621,282.73 due under VO2 as “revenue”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I rejected Comfort’s submissions and did not grant its application for a stay. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> confirmed at [60] that the court “retains the discretion to order a stay of enforcement of an adjudication determination where it is necessary to do so in order to secure the ends of justice”. The court then proceeded to set out the situations where a stay may ordinarily be justified at [70] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">70 In our judgment, a stay of enforcement of an adjudication determination may ordinarily be justified where there is clear and objective evidence of the successful claimant’s actual present insolvency, or where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that if the stay were not granted, the money paid to the claimant would not ultimately be recovered if the dispute between the parties were finally resolved in the respondent’s favour …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court also noted that the party asking for a stay must satisfy the “high threshold” of demonstrating that a stay is required because it “will not readily be granted having regard to the overall purpose of the [SOPA], which is precisely to avoid and guard against pushing building and construction companies over the financial precipice” [emphasis omitted] (at [71]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Comfort did not meet this high threshold. OGSP is perfectly entitled to declare dividends for its shareholders as long as it did not put its company in the red. Even the evidence that Comfort cited to the court did not show that OGSP was insolvent or was about to be insolvent. Hence, Comfort could not rely on this ground for its stay application.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span>, W Y Steel argued for a stay because there were 11 lawsuits that had been filed against Osko and the latter would have to pay off the default judgments granted against it in two of the 11 lawsuits. Further, Osko was currently in a net current liability position and had lent money to one of its directors despite its financial difficulties (at [57]). Notwithstanding these liabilities, the Court of Appeal refused to grant the stay, noting that W Y Steel’s evidence was offset by Osko’s evidence that it was solvent even though its paid-up capital was admittedly just $25,000 (<span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> at [58] and [72]). The same conclusion applied in the present case. OGSP’s financial controller, Kuah, deposed on an affidavit that OGSP declared its dividends based on previous retained profits

In this case, even if OGSP could be considered financially weak, this had already been its financial position in October 2013 according to Comfort’s own evidence and Comfort must be taken to have engaged OGSP as its sub-contractor with that knowledge. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">W Y Steel</span> made a similar finding at [72]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72 … Further, to the extent that the accounts of Osko demonstrated that it was in some financial distress, the accounts in question covered the period from 1 December 2010 to 30 November 2011, the very period in which Osko signed on as a sub-contractor to W Y Steel. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The court concluded that W Y Steel could not rely on Osko’s financial distress because it had already known of Osko’s situation at the time it engaged the latter.
