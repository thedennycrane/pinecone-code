Instead of chatting freely like they used to, Mdm Liew would not say much and seemed withdrawn, and Karen found that she often had to talk more to draw her mother out of her shell.  When Mdm Liew did communicate, she made inexplicable errors such as insisting that it was Monday when it was instead a Tuesday.

When Karen informed Mdm Liew of the amount outstanding for her utilities on 26 August 2017, Mdm Liew said that the most recent cheques she had written were on or about 18 May 2017 for air-con servicing, and on 16 July 2017 for S$490.10 to Singapore Power for the July utilities bill.  However, a sum of S$490.10 had <span class="font-italic">already</span> been paid to Singapore Power on 9 June 2017, and went towards the May bill.

Karen’s evidence for this period is that Mdm Liew appeared to be confused when she spoke to her.  For instance, Mdm Liew claimed that she had given her domestic helper S$100 to pay for the utility bills at a Seven-Eleven store, and that she had also walked to the post office with her domestic helper to post a number of letters.

On that day, sometime before Mr Teo arrived at the Namly property for the signing of the POAs, Karen tried to call Mdm Liew on her mobile phone.  She was able to speak to Mdm Liew, but found that Mdm Liew sounded unwell and confused.  No mention was made by Mdm Liew of the POAs which were subsequently signed, nor was there any indication given by Mdm Liew of any intention to sell the Namly property.

He was told by Juwanti, who was present, that Mdm Liew was suffering from a flu.  But, Dr Hwang’s physical examination of Mdm Liew allowed him to conclude that she was not suffering from any of the usual symptoms of flu, such as fever, blocked nose, or coughing.  She was breathing comfortably, and her limbs were not cold or blue.

Mdm Liew’s speech was also slurred and unintelligible, and neither Stella nor Janice were certain if Mdm Liew recognised them.

This time around, they found Mdm Liew propped up in a chair in her bedroom when they arrived.  The defendant, Jacqueline, and their two sons were present and seated around Mdm Liew.  Stella’s evidence was that Mdm Liew was quite quiet and did not speak much, which was not her usual self.  Mdm Liew did not even greet Janice by name, which she normally would have done.  Stella and Janice showed Mdm Liew a photo of the members of their cell group which had been taken during a celebration for Janice’s birthday that had just taken place earlier that day, but she was not able to recognise their faces in the photo or identify who they were.  Stella’s evidence was that Mdm Liew looked ill and quite confused.

The defendant pointed to the fact that Mdm Liew was able to add his son Daniel as a joint-account holder to her bank account, and to Mdm Liew’s interaction with Mr Teo, the solicitor who prepared the POAs, to argue that Mdm Liew was behaving normally.

</div>  Dr Ang believes that Mdm Liew’s state of dementia in the period of November 2017 was likely to be moderate dementia.  The clinic criteria for the diagnosis of dementia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) published by the American Psychiatric Association (“DSM-IV”) cited to me included a finding of a combination of amnesia (referring to forgetfulness) and at least one of three other factors: aphasia (word-finding difficulty and/or difficulty communicating), apraxia (difficulty with simple functioning like buttoning, dressing, or using utensils at mealtime), and agnosia (difficulty recognising familiar faces or items).

</div>  His explanation is that, during a lucid interval, the patient may appear to be alert and attentive, but it does not follow that the patient is able to carry out higher-order executive functions, meaning that the patient may not be able to plan, prioritise, organise, and understand the consequence of her actions.  In his view, even if Mdm Liew was having a lucid interval on 20 November 2017, and appeared alert and attentive to those she interacted with, such as Mr Teo, it is not likely that she was able to understand the nature and effect of the POAs.

</div>  Even if Mdm Liew was suffering from dementia in November 2017, Dr Nagulendran expressed the view that she may have had a lucid interval during the 20 November 2017 meeting where the POAs were signed.  He explained that this was based on the information and facts that he had been given.  The difficulty with this is that the history of Mdm Liew he had been given was provided by the defendant.  Dr Nagulendran therefore was not provided and did not consider several incidents showing Mdm Liew’s mental deterioration starting from July 2017, such as her inability to explain her financial transactions.  Significantly, he did not have the benefit of the transcript of the video and audio recordings of the meeting at Toast Box on 8 December 2017, and the incoherent and nonsensical answers given by Mdm Liew when asked questions by her family members.

</div>  In his view, a score of 25 to 27 would show there is some abnormality, but it would be a borderline case.  As the MMSE is simply a screening tool for dementia, Dr Ho was not able to rule out the possibility that Mdm Liew was suffering from dementia from her MMSE test score without carrying out any structural tests such as imaging of her brain, or carrying out a neuropsychological assessment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 While Dr Ho recorded in his notes of examination on 9 September 2017 that Mdm Liew had “no neurological deficits”, he explained in his oral evidence that this meant that he had tested her upper and lower limbs for power and coordination, which is an indicator of whether she might have been suffering from Parkinson’s disease, and found that there were no problems.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 From my analysis of the medical evidence, it is clear to me that Mdm Liew was suffering from dementia from around mid-2017, and possibly even earlier.  As all the experts agree, dementia is a relentlessly progressive disease that marches from mild dementia, through to moderate, then to severe dementia.  While it is difficult to ascertain the stage of dementia that Mdm Liew suffered from on 20 November 2017, given that Mdm Liew was suffering from moderate to severe dementia in April 2018, and the opinion expressed by Dr Ho that she was already suffering from mild dementia in September 2017, it is likely that Mdm Liew was probably suffering from mild to moderate dementia on 20 November 2017.  I do not accept the defendant’s case that Mdm Liew’s dementia was brought on by the hospitalisations from December 2017 to February 2018, as there is no credible medical opinion that supports such a postulation.  Dr Nagulendran’s suggestion to that effect is speculative and not borne out by any assessment he personally conducted on Mdm Liew.  Further, it is not corroborated by any of the medical texts placed before me.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 My findings as to the clinical component of Mdm Liew’s mental state on 20 November 2017 are not determinative of the issue of whether she had mental capacity as a matter of law.  An assessment of the functional component is also necessary.  In other words, the issue is whether, from the evidence of her conduct leading to and surrounding the execution of the POAs, it is likely that she was able to understand the nature and effects of the POAs and thus able to make a decision for herself in relation to the execution of the POAs.  I turn now to my analysis of that evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The execution of the POAs </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 It is clear that Mdm Liew was suffering from cognitive decline from mid-2017.  There is a clear disjoint between her active lifestyle with weekly church attendance and mahjong sessions with her friends on the one hand, and being unable to remember the names of her children and grandchildren and giving nonsensical answers to questions on the other (see [60] to [63] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 I do not accept the evidence of the defendant and his wife that there was nothing wrong with Mdm Liew.  On balance, I prefer the evidence of Karen, Dr Hwang and Mr Hwang as to their interactions with Mdm Liew, which showed that she was often confused and forgetful.  Their evidence is more credible because there were contemporaneous notes taken as to the condition of Mdm Liew in the form of notes and emails which Karen had sent to herself, and for which the date and time stamps are clear.  I also note the clear and objective evidence from the various videos and recordings of, in particular, the 8 December 2017 meeting.  I should add that the videos and recordings of Mdm Liew before the second half of 2017 provided a sharp contrast with those taken after that, particularly, those in November and December 2017.

Contrary to the defendant’s arguments, I am not satisfied that Stella was biased against him simply because he had declined to give her certain prescription medicines for her coughing.

</div>  Stella’s evidence was corroborated by the recordings of the various phone calls she had with Karen, and was firm and unshaken in relation to Mdm Liew’s condition.  As a longstanding friend of Mdm Liew, it is clear from what she told Karen at the material time about Mdm Liew’s health that her actions were borne out of real concern that Mdm Liew was becoming mentally impaired.  I do not accept that Stella would have concocted evidence simply to vindicate what appeared to me as at most a petty slight that even she did not appear to have placed much weight on.

There was no satisfactory explanation by the defendant as to why, if Mdm Liew was perfectly fine, she could not have given instructions to Mr Teo directly for the sale of the Namly property, instead of appointing the defendant as her attorney to carry this out.  After all, it is obvious to me that the defendant and the developer must already have had talks as to the sale of the property.  The dates are telling in this regard – the POAs were executed on 20 November 2017, and the option to purchase was granted by the defendant merely two days later, on 22 November.  In other words, I am not able to understand why, if Mdm Liew’s mental faculties were intact, she could not have either given instructions directly to Mr Teo, or met with the potential purchaser and then granted the option to purchase by signing it herself.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Further, even if one were to ignore why Mdm Liew could not have given instructions for the sale of the property directly, it puzzles me why Mdm Liew could not have given instructions to Mr Teo directly for <span class="font-italic">even </span><span class="font-italic">the preparation of the POAs</span>.

</div>  I find this to be surprising because the details of the two POAs certainly called for some questions for Mr Teo to answer.  I will deal with this issue more fully later in my judgment (see [135] to [142] below), but for now, I will just refer to three unusual features.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 First, <span class="font-italic">both</span> POAs are stated as being “irrevocable” unless the donor (Mdm Liew) has “written approval from GOH YONG CHIANG KELVIN or the Family Court”.  It struck me as very odd that Mdm Liew would have had to seek the written consent of the defendant in order to revoke the POAs.  Under this arrangement, even if Mdm Liew changed her mind about selling the Namly property, it was really up to the defendant to decide whether he still wanted to go ahead to sell the property.  The only alternative envisaged is for Mdm Liew to seek an order from the Family Court to revoke the POAs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Second, the POA for the sale of the Namly property (the “sale POA”) authorises the sale proceeds to be paid to Daniel, the older of the defendant’s two sons.  This is again surprising given that the defendant’s case is that the instructions of Mdm Liew to him were that he use the sale proceeds of the Namly property to acquire a condominium unit.  Not only that, all the sale POA provides is that the defendant is “[t]o <span class="font-italic">request</span> for all sale proceeds … issued to GOH ENG SHENG DANIEL … to be held on trust for [Mdm Liew] for purchase of a private single storey condominium” (emphasis added).

It does not stipulate that the stated joint owners, Mdm Liew and Daniel, will own shares in the condominium unit in accordance with their respective contributions.  Thus, on its face, the purchase POA appears to manifest an intention to gift the condominium to Daniel on Mdm Liew’s passing, given that they are stated to be joint owners without any specified shares.  The purchase POA also allows the defendant to add himself as a joint owner of the condominium unit together with Mdm Liew and Daniel.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 With these unusual features, I am very surprised that Mdm Liew did not ask Mr Teo any questions at all about the POAs, if she was indeed fully aware of and understood the nature and effect of their terms.  After all, Mdm Liew was known to be an intelligent woman who was able to take care of her finances.  She had worked as an accounts officer for several years, and had even been known to discuss various investments with, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, Stella and Liew Min Chee, her nephew.

</div>  There is nothing in the evidence that suggests to me that she ever intended to make a gift of the Namly property or the sale proceeds to one of the defendant’s sons.  Unfortunately, Mr Teo did not check to verify if she did.             </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Further, as I have already recounted at [52] to [55] above, two days after the execution of the POAs, on 22 November 2017, Mdm Liew was visited separately by both Dr Hwang and, later in the day, Mr Hwang.  Both had called on her to check up on her state of health.  Mdm Liew made no mention to Dr Hwang, or during the WhatsApp video call with Karen made during that visit, that she had decided to sell the Namly property.  When Mr Hwang visited in the afternoon later that day, he had specifically asked Mdm Liew whether she intended to sell the Namly property, and she had clearly stated “no”.  There does not appear to be any credible reason for Mdm Liew’s silence and/or denial about her decision to sell the Namly property, other than her not understanding the import of what she had signed two days earlier, or not even being able to recall the POAs at all.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 In this regard, I am unable to accept the reason given by the defendant, that Mdm Liew decided to keep the sale of the property a secret because she did not want Karen to kick up a fuss and get upset.

</div>  This evidence is completely inconsistent with the clear evidence which demonstrates that Karen and Mdm Liew enjoyed a very close relationship.  For instance, not only did Mdm Liew appoint Karen as the sole donee under her LPA and as the executrix of her final will, she entrusted Karen with the original certificate of title for the Namly property and to manage joint bank accounts they shared.  Mdm Liew also regularly spoke to Karen even while Karen was living overseas in Melbourne, and there was ample evidence in the form of various photographs of outings illustrating that the mother and daughter were close.  The evidence in the form of the video and audio recordings of the meeting on 8 December 2017 is itself sufficient to show that mother and daughter enjoyed a very close bond.  In fact, when asked at that meeting whether she intended to sell the Namly property, Mdm Liew flatly denied it.  I set out the relevant portions of the 8 December 2017 recording transcript below:

This submission suggests that Mdm Liew had planned to secretly sell the Namly property and move in with the defendant’s family at a new home, all without informing her daughter and leaving it to her to find out on her own.  In fact, it is tantamount to alleging that Mdm Liew was actively misleading Karen when she told Karen that she wanted to move in with her family to stay at the Namly property at the 8 December 2017 meeting.  All this is not only far-fetched, it is simply inconsistent with the evidence of how Mdm Liew and Karen’s family shared a close relationship over the years.  The clearly more logical explanation is that Mdm Liew either had no recollection of what she had signed 18 days earlier, or did not understand the nature and effect of the POAs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 In my judgment, a proper analysis of the evidence leads to the ineluctable conclusion that Mdm Liew’s dementia was of such a degree that she was not able to understand the nature and effect of the POAs she executed on 20 November 2017, and thus unable to make a decision for herself in relation to the execution of the POAs.  In short, I find that Mdm Liew lacked mental capacity when she executed the two POAs.  As a matter of law, given my findings on both the clinical and functional components of the test outlined in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([32] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), it follows that the POAs in question are void.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Did the defendant exercise undue influence over Mdm Liew?</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The applicable principles on undue influence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 I turn to consider, assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that Mdm Liew had mental capacity to grant the POAs, whether they were procured by undue influence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The categorisation of classes of undue influence is fairly well-established.  Three main categories of undue influence have been identified in Singapore law, and the analytical framework for undue influence has been clearly set out by a five-judge <span class="font-italic">coram</span> of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">BOM v BOK</span> <span class="font-italic">and another appeal</span> [2019] 1 SLR 349 (“<span class="font-italic">BOM</span>”) at [101].  In understanding the distinction between the categories of undue influence, <span class="font-italic">BOM </span>at [101] is extremely helpful and is partially reproduced (<span class="font-italic">sans</span> references) below:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) “Class 1” undue influence is also known as actual undue influence. Here, the plaintiff has to demonstrate that he entered into the impugned transaction because of the undue influence exerted upon him by the defendant. To do this, the plaintiff has to demonstrate that (i) the defendant had the capacity to influence him; (ii) the influence was exercised; (iii) its exercise was undue; and (iv) its exercise brought about the transaction. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) “Class 2” undue influence is also known as presumed undue influence. Under this class of undue influence, the plaintiff is not required to prove actual undue influence. It suffices for the plaintiff to demonstrate (i) that there was a relationship of trust and confidence between him and the defendant; (ii) that the relationship was such that it could be presumed that the defendant abused the plaintiff’s trust and confidence in influencing the plaintiff to enter into the impugned transaction; and (iii) that the transaction was one that calls for an explanation. This class of undue influence is further divided into “Class 2A” and “Class 2B” undue influence, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (i) Under “Class 2A” undue influence, there are relationships that the law <span class="font-italic">irrebuttably</span> presumes to give rise to a relationship of trust and confidence. Such relationships include solicitor-client relationships, but exclude husband-wife relationships. Once the plaintiff shows that his relationship with the wrongdoer triggers the presumption and that the impugned transaction calls for an explanation, there is a <span class="font-italic">rebuttable</span> presumption that the wrongdoer has exerted undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"> (ii) Under “Class 2B” undue influence, the plaintiff must prove that there is a relationship of trust and confidence. If it is shown that there was such a relationship and that the transaction calls for an explanation, then there is a <span class="font-italic">rebuttable</span> presumption of undue influence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The Court of Appeal also made clear in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR</span> that where there was an interaction between mental impairment and allegations of undue influence in proceedings under the MCA in which a person’s mental capacity was in issue, the court had to have regard to the actual circumstances in which that person lived, and ought not to adopt a theoretical analysis that overlooked those circumstances.  Put another way, the required causative nexus between any impairment of mind and a person’s inability to make decisions would be established even where the person’s inability to make decisions was caused by <span class="font-italic">both</span> her mental impairment and actual circumstances: <span class="font-italic">Re BKR</span> from [117] to [120].  The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Re BKR</span> went on to elaborate at [127] as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… If P is unable to retain, understand or use information relevant to a decision because of a combination of mental impairment and the circumstances he finds himself in, the statutory test for incapacity will be met, and it is no answer then to say that P’s mental impairment would not necessarily rob him of decision-making ability in a different set of circumstances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is therefore clear that questions of mental impairment and considerations of undue influence should be considered holistically, and that it is relevant to consider if there is interaction between a party’s mental impairment and the exertion of undue influence on her by other parties.     </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 I will consider “Class 2B” undue influence first, before I consider “Class 1” undue influence.

This has not really been challenged by the defendant.  In any event, the undisputed facts are that, since her husband’s passing, Mdm Liew was living either with Karen’s or the defendant’s family at all times.  She initially shuttled between the two homes.  Then, when the Namly property became available for occupation because the tenant had moved out in 2003, Mdm Liew moved to live there with Karen and her family.

</div>  Admittedly, the defendant was running a busy medical practice with the help of his wife, but Karen’s evidence is that Mdm Liew was often left to eat alone and watch television in her room by herself.  The defendant did not provide much evidence in his joint affidavit with his wife as to his relationship with Mdm Liew while they lived together in the Namly property from mid-2009.  Regardless, it appears to me from the evidence that the defendant must have given Mdm Liew the impression that he was making a big sacrifice by moving in with his family to live with her at the Namly property.  This in turn created an unequal relationship where Mdm Liew felt that she owed the defendant something.  I infer this from the following pieces of evidence.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 First, both the defendant and his wife, Jacqueline, gave evidence that Mdm Liew had given the defendant the sum of S$1,000,000 via a deed of arrangement dated 15 July 2009, ostensibly as a “gift” for helping to take care of her.

</div>  Granted, the deed of arrangement stipulated that Jacqueline was to return this sum to Mdm Liew in the event that the defendant should pre-decease Mdm Liew, but the payment of such a substantial sum to her own son for his living with her and taking care of her does not appear to have been fully explained on the evidence before me.   Whatever the ultimate reason for such a “gift”, Mdm Liew appears to have felt indebted in some way to the defendant.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Second, despite the defendant and his family living at the Namly property, together with a foreign domestic worker, all the utilities, repair costs (including for maintenance of the remote-controlled gate, air-conditioners, and even a collapse in the roof), and other home expenses for the Namly property were paid for by Mdm Liew.

</div>  She was also named as the executrix of the will.  That will provided that the Namly property was to be wholly bequeathed to Karen, with the rest of Mdm Liew’s assets going to the defendant.  The second of these three wills was made on 9 July 2007, which was during a visit by Mdm Liew back to Singapore.  At that time, she was living with Karen’s family in Melbourne, and had returned to Singapore for a visit.  While in Singapore at that time, she was staying with the defendant.  This second will provided that the <span class="font-italic">defendant</span> was to be Mdm Liew’s executor, and that her assets were to be divided equally between Karen and the defendant.

</div>  The defendant’s evidence is that Mdm Liew showed him the will after she returned from her lawyer’s office, where she had just signed it.  But, barely eight days later, on 17 July 2007, Mdm Liew visited her lawyer’s office again before returning to Melbourne to make the third of the three most recent wills.  She did this on her own, without informing the defendant.  The contents of this third will are substantively the same as the will dated 3 November 2006, and reversed the changes made in the second will.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The lawyer who prepared these wills, Maria Anne Ng, was a subpoenaed witness at the trial.

</div>  Mdm Liew had entrusted the original of that third will to Ms Ng for safekeeping, with instructions that it was not to be shown to either of her children until she passed away.  That will came to light only when it was ordered to be produced in the course of these proceedings.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 To my mind, Mdm Liew’s conduct in relation to the making of the second and third wills shows that she made the second will to mollify the defendant and to convince him that she was going to give him a 50% stake in the Namly property after she passed away.  This was obviously just for the sake of appearances, because she quickly reverted to her original intention of giving the Namly property to Karen in her final will just over a week later.  I find that Mdm Liew’s conduct showed that she was afraid of making the defendant angry, perhaps because she was then living with him during her trip back to Singapore, and he had been exerting pressure on her.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 From the evidence, it is clear that Mdm Liew also grew more and more reliant on the defendant over time.  Sometime in 2014 or 2015, Mdm Liew prepared a handwritten note setting out her instructions for her care if she should fall ill, or if she should pass away.

</div>  Mdm Liew handed this note to the defendant, and obviously hoped that he would comply with it and respect her wishes.  This shows that Mdm Liew knew that she was getting more feeble with age, and that she trusted the defendant to carry out her instructions if she became incapacitated.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 When we consider Mdm Liew’s state of health in the second half of 2017, this degree of reliance becomes even more obvious.  Even if I were to assume that the defendant was entirely oblivious to the fact that Mdm Liew was suffering from dementia, the defendant <span class="font-italic">himself</span> told Karen and Dr Hwang at the meeting on 8 December 2017 that Mdm Liew had been suffering from short-term memory loss.

By September 2017, the defendant also did not permit the domestic helper to accompany Mdm Liew out of the house, which effectively restricted Mdm Liew to the house since she needed assistance to move around.

</div>  These statements and actions show quite clearly that the defendant knew that Mdm Liew was in a vulnerable position and that he had taken on the responsibility, at that time, to provide for her care.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 Finally, even on the defendant’s case, it was Mdm Liew who instructed him to see lawyers for the preparation of the POAs so that the Namly property could be sold and a condominium unit be purchased.  This was even though, according to the defendant, Mdm Liew was perfectly capable of giving instructions to the lawyers directly.  Accepting <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that Mdm Liew had in fact instructed the defendant thus, this is <span class="font-italic">itself</span> indicative that she placed strong reliance on the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In my judgment, the evidence, in its totality, showed that (i) Mdm Liew was afraid of angering the defendant, (ii) she was increasingly reliant on him to care for her, and (iii) by November 2017, she was in such a weakened state physically and mentally that she had no real choice but to trust him to take care of her.  Quite clearly, there was a relationship of trust and confidence, and in fact one of reliance, between Mdm Liew and the defendant.        </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Do the POAs call for an explanation?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 It is well-established that what amounts to a transaction that calls for an explanation is a “fact-sensitive inquiry” where “much would depend on the strength of inferences to be drawn from the circumstances”: <span class="font-italic">Moh Tai Siang v Moh Tai Tong and another</span> [2018] SGHC 280 at [80].  I note also the observation in <span class="font-italic">Royal Bank of Scotland plc v Etridge (No 2)</span> [2002] 2 AC 773 at [22] citing with approval the view of Lindley LJ in <span class="font-italic">Allcard v Skinner</span> (1887) 36 Ch D 145 at 185 that a transaction calls for an explanation where it cannot “be reasonably accounted for on the ground of friendship, relationship, charity or other ordinary motives on which ordinary men act”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 I have already alluded to the fact that the terms of the POAs were rather unusual, particularly when seen in the context of the transaction which the defendant claims they were supposed to effect.  According to him, Mdm Liew’s instructions were that the Namly property was to be sold and the sale proceeds used to purchase a condominium unit in her name and that of Daniel.  That condominium unit was to be jointly owned by Mdm Liew and the defendant in shares according to the proportion of their contributions.  That was the defendant’s pleaded case.

</div>
</div>
</div>  However, the two POAs had several features which did not reflect these purported instructions and  were not explicable on the facts of the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 First, it is not clear to me why there was a need for two POAs when, according to the defendant, his instructions from Mdm Liew was to sell the Namly property and use the sale proceeds to acquire a condominium unit for her to stay in.  Surely, one POA in favour of the defendant would have sufficed.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Second, as outlined at [95] above, the sale POA provides that the sale proceeds are to be paid to Daniel, but there is no provision <span class="font-italic">requiring </span>that these moneys are to be held on trust for Mdm Liew.  The only semblance of any such provision is at [9] of the sale POA, which provides that the defendant is “[t]o <span class="font-italic">request</span> for all sale proceeds … issued to GOH ENG SHENG DANIEL … to be held on trust for [Mdm Liew] for purchase of a private single storey condominium” (emphasis added).  However, this stipulation merely requires the defendant to “request” that Daniel hold the proceeds on trust for Mdm Liew.  The need for this convoluted arrangement, which requires the defendant to ask Daniel to apply the sale proceeds the latter has received when the defendant exercises the purchase POA to acquire a condominium unit, was not satisfactorily explained from the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Third, the purchase POA gives the attorney, the defendant, the authority to add himself as a joint owner, even if he has not paid any part of the purchase price.  This is expressly provided for at [1] of the purchase POA.  This is clearly at odds with what is stated in the defendant’s own affidavit of evidence-in-chief, where he claims that the condominium unit was to be jointly owned in shares according to the proportion of the purchasers’ contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Fourth, assuming the sale proceeds of the Namly property are used for the purchase of the condominium unit, there is no provision in the purchase POA that Mdm Liew and Daniel are to be registered as tenants in common in accordance with their respective shares.  Rather, the POA for the purchase simply provides that they are to be joint tenants.  Thus, on Mdm Liew’s passing, Daniel would become the sole owner of the condominium unit if the defendant elected not to add himself as an owner of the unit.  If the defendant elected to add himself as an owner, the condominium unit would be jointly owned by him and his son on Mdm Liew’s passing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Fifth, and more importantly, the sale of the Namly property by Mdm Liew runs contrary to the evidence that (i) she intended to live in the house for the rest of her life, and (ii) she wanted to bequeath the Namly property to her daughter, Karen.  It will be recalled that Mdm Liew had specifically changed her will dated 9 July 2007 to ensure that it reverted back to the contents of the will dated 3 November 2006, wherein Karen was appointed executor and would be entitled to the Namly property on Mdm Liew’s passing.  In fact, the state of Mdm Liew’s wills dating back to 1999 is instructive:

To this, Mdm Liew again simply nodded her head.  She did not ask him any questions.

First, Mr Teo should have but did not make any attempt to first speak to Mdm Liew, either over the phone or in person, <span class="font-italic">before</span> he started preparation of the POAs.  In my view, he should have first ascertained Mdm Liew’s instructions, and her capacity to give those instructions, before he proceeded to accept instructions conveyed by the defendant.  After all, he had been told that Mdm Liew was an 87 year-old woman, and the effect of the POA for the purchase of the condominium unit was that she would effectively be making a gift of her interest in the property to Daniel and any other co-owner when she passed away.  This was particularly so when, according to Mr Teo, he was aware that Mdm Liew had other children, even though he did not know precisely how many.

He should have explicitly told Mdm Liew that Daniel, and any other co-owners, would be entitled to ownership of the property, to the exclusion of her other potential beneficiaries at law.  In fact, Mr Teo does not even appear to have explained the distinction between a joint tenancy and a tenancy in common to Mdm Liew, despite such distinction clearly being of fundamental importance in <span class="font-italic">any</span> case where a property is to be owned by joint-owners.  I emphasise that such explanation is <span class="font-italic">basic</span> and to be expected of any solicitor when advising his client on a purchase of real property by joint owners.  Mr Teo’s own evidence is that he only explained the concepts of joint tenancy and tenancy in common <span class="font-italic">to the defendant</span>, who was potentially a major beneficiary under the POAs.

He owed her a duty to act in her best interest and in accordance with <span class="font-italic">her</span> instructions.  That being the case, he failed in this duty by not ascertaining from Mdm Liew, when they met in person for the first time, whether she intended for Daniel and any other co-owners to be entitled to own the property to the exclusion of her other children and grandchildren.  Mr Teo tried to explain that he would have drawn the fact that Mdm Liew was effectively making a gift to her son’s family only if she was making a will, but that it was not necessary in this case because he was only preparing powers of attorney.

</div>  I found this distinction to be an illusory one because, in substance, it was entirely clear that Mdm Liew was executing an irrevocable instrument which effectively made an <span class="font-italic">inter vivos</span> gift of a property that she was to be a co-owner of to her grandson.  The Namly property was a significant asset by any stretch of the imagination, and Mr Teo’s approach to dealing with the transaction for its sale and the use of the sale proceeds was at odds with his client’s interests. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Second, I find that Mr Teo had failed to take sufficient steps to satisfy himself that Mdm Liew had sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature and effect of the two POAs she was executing.  It is woefully inadequate to simply ask Mdm Liew whether she had seen a psychiatrist or been admitted to a mental institution before.  It is also not enough merely to get verbal confirmation from the defendant, who is in any event a potential beneficiary under the POAs, that Mdm Liew was mentally capable of executing the POAs, just because the defendant is a doctor.  Given the circumstances, Mr Teo should have asked for a recent medical report confirming that Mdm Liew had sufficient mental capacity to give authority to the defendant to sell her house and buy a new property in her name.  Mr Teo should also have asked Mdm Liew<span class="font-italic"> </span>more questions (<span class="font-italic">e.g. </span>pertaining to the issues raised at [136] and [138] above) to ascertain if she had the mental capacity to understand the POAs and if she was able to make a decision for herself.  The fact that Mdm Liew had nodded in response is not enough to indicate that she understood the terms of the POAs.  In my view, Mr Teo should have been alerted to the fact that something was not quite right because Mdm Liew did not ask any questions at all but mostly only nodded when he spoke.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Third, the terms of the POAs do not fully capture the instructions that had been conveyed by the defendant to Mr Teo.  As I have already pointed out at [95] above, the sale POA curiously directs the defendant to pay the entirety of the sale proceeds to Daniel.  That being the case, Mr Teo should have expressly confirmed with Mdm Liew that she was fine with leaving the sale proceeds with Daniel, <span class="font-italic">on the understanding</span> that he would turn over the sale proceeds to the defendant for the latter’s use to buy the new condominium unit.  When this was raised in Mr Teo’s cross-examination, he claimed that he had told Daniel, who was present by his grandmother when the POAs were signed, that he would be holding the sale proceeds on trust.

</div>  Mr Teo also claimed to have explained to Daniel what being a trustee of the sale proceeds entails.  I must say that I do not accept Mr Teo’s evidence as being credible.  This conversation with, and advice given to, Daniel is not found in Mr Teo’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief or his attendance note for this meeting.  Worse, neither Daniel, David, the defendant, nor the defendant’s wife mentions any such explanation given to Daniel in their evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Mr Teo’s failings in this regard are all the more egregious given the clear and longstanding nature of the authority governing a solicitor’s obligations <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis </span>the disposal of property to one’s successors.  In <span class="font-italic">Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline (Chee Ping Chian Alexander and another, interveners</span>) [2010] 4 SLR 373, the Court of Appeal found that the evidence surrounding the preparation and execution of a will in that case did not show that it had been properly or even explained to the testatrix.  Given the testatrix’s mental state, she could have <span class="font-italic">appeared</span> to understand the contents of the will when it was read to her, but this did not necessarily indicate actual understanding, especially when there was no explanation of what the lines meant.  At [60], the Court of Appeal made clear that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our view, this case demonstrates that solicitors who undertake the task of preparing wills and/or witnessing the execution of wills <span class="font-italic">must</span> take the necessary precautions or steps in order to fulfil their duties to their clients … In any case, as solicitors, they must do what is required, <span class="font-italic">however complicated or difficult the task may be</span>. The central task is to ensure that the terms of the will reflect the wishes <span class="font-italic">of the testator</span> … In every case, the solicitor should be <span class="font-italic">cautious about taking instructions from any person who is</span><span class="font-italic"> to be named as a beneficiary in the will</span>. If a testator is known to be suffering from any mental infirmity, a doctor should be called to certify her mental capacity before she is allowed to sign the will to ensure that such a testator fully understands the will. In the case of a person with mental infirmities like Mdm Goh, it should have included attending on Mdm Goh personally to take instructions <span class="font-italic">from her</span>, providing her with and explaining a draft of the will <span class="font-italic">to her</span>, and if there is <span class="font-italic">any</span> doubt as to her mental capacity, to advise that a psychiatrist (or some other qualified medical practitioner) attend on her to assess her mental capacity. Furthermore, the solicitor should <span class="font-italic">ask the appropriate questions</span> to ascertain the testator’s capacity to understand the contents of the will … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In a similar vein, the Court of Appeal unequivocally stated in <span class="font-italic">Low Ah Cheow and others v Ng Hock Guan</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079 (“<span class="font-italic">Low Ah Cheow</span>”) at [73] and [74] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">73 The preparation of a will involves serious professional responsibilities, which solicitors must <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">uncompromisingly</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>observe and discharge. Regrettably, it seems to us that, all too often nowadays, solicitors appear to consider the preparation of a will to be no more than a routine exercise in form filling. This is <span class="font-italic">wrong</span>. Before preparing a will, the solicitor concerned ought to have a thorough discussion with the testator on <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">all the possible legal issues and potential complications that might arise</span> in the implementation of the terms of the will. The solicitor ought to painstakingly and accurately document his discussions with and his instructions from the testator. He should also confirm with the testator, prior to the execution of the will, that the contents of the will as drafted accurately express the latter’s intention … Half measures or the cutting of corners in the discharge of these serious professional responsibilities will not do. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">74 In our view, the solicitor concerned should also conscientiously seek to avoid being in any situation where a potential conflict of interest may appear to exist. If the solicitor might be perceived as anything less than a completely independent adviser to the testator, he ought not, as a matter of good practice, to be involved in the explanation, the interpretation and the execution of the will. In particular, exceptional restraint and care are called for if the solicitor concerned has a pre-existing relationship and/or past dealings with the sole beneficiary under a will, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and all the more so if the will has been prepared urgently and executed in unusual circumstances with that sole beneficiary’s active involvement</span>. Where such a case occurs, the solicitor involved <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">must be prepared to have his conduct microscopically scrutinised and, perhaps, even his motives called into question</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">While both the above-cited cases concern the preparation of wills, I reiterate that I see no material distinction between those situations and that in the present case, where Mdm Liew was in effect making an <span class="font-italic">inter-vivos</span> gift of her most significant asset, the Namly property.  Mr Teo’s conduct appears to not meet the standard expected of solicitors, and is quite inadequate in rebutting the presumption of undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 I should add that I find the evidence given by the defendant, Daniel and David about the visit by Mr Teo and the execution of the POAs to be most unsatisfactory, and of little effect in rebutting the presumption of undue influence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 Daniel was present in Mdm Liew’s bedroom, together with his brother, David, and the defendant, at the time when Mr Teo was speaking to Mdm Liew about the POAs.

Like his two sons, his evidence as to the visit of Mr Teo to the Namly property on 20 November 2017 leaves much to be desired in terms of details and authenticity.  His answers were uncannily similar to those of David and Daniel, in that all of them seemed reluctant to get into the details of what precisely happened.

</div>  What struck me most though was the defendant’s evidence that he did not remember much about the visit.  This is very surprising given that it was a highly significant event that the defendant had clearly been planning for some time.  Let me explain.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 The defendant’s evidence is that he had tried to persuade his mother in February 2017, and again in June 2017, to sell the Namly property so that they could move into a condominium unit.  She was reluctant to do so.  But when Mdm Liew started to lose mobility in November 2017, she agreed to sell the Namly property and move to a single-storey condominium unit.

</div>  On the defendant’s account, Mdm Liew wanted to appoint him as the attorney to carry this out.  He claimed that Mdm Liew’s instructions to him were to make the POAs irrevocable because he had questioned whether she really wanted to sell the Namly property or whether she would change her mind again.

This is evident from the fact that he knew that the certificate of title (“CT”) for the property had been entrusted by Mdm Liew to Karen for safekeeping, but instead of simply approaching his sister to ask for the CT which he needed to complete the sale, the defendant instructed Mr Teo to incur significant expense to apply for a replacement CT.  In this regard, he lied to Mr Teo that the original CT was lost.

As already mentioned at [18] above, he refused to disclose Mdm Liew’s whereabouts from early December 2017.  In my judgment, the defendant wanted to conceal the fact of the sale of the Namly property from Karen for as long as possible.  It is remarkable that he went so far as informing Dr Hwang at the meeting at Toast Box Sentosa on 8 December 2017 that he was willing to move out of the Namly property and let their family live there with Mdm Liew.

</div>  The defendant must have known that Karen would have tried to stop the sale on the basis that Mdm Liew did not have the mental capacity to understand what she was doing.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 All this being the case, it is simply unbelievable that the defendant would not be extremely concerned about the visit of Mr Teo to the Namly property on 20 November 2017 and the execution of the POAs.  He would have been anxious to ensure that everything went smoothly.  For these reasons, I find it quite incredible that the defendant appears to shrug off the events of that day and that visit as something completely ordinary, of which he does not have much recollection.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In my judgment, on the evidence before me, the defendant has failed to rebut the presumption of undue influence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Actual undue influence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Given my findings as to “Class 2B” undue influence, it is not necessary for me to delve into the issue of whether the defendant exercised actual undue influence over his mother to get her to sign the POAs.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Remedies</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 For the reasons set out in this judgment, I find that Mdm Liew did not have the mental capacity to make the POAs on 20 November 2017.  Alternatively, even if she did have mental capacity, the POAs ought to be set aside because they were procured by the undue influence of the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 In the circumstances, I will grant a declaration that the POAs are void.  There is no need for me to make an order that the registrations of the POAs are to be cancelled and removed, as Karen seeks, because, amongst other reasons, the Namly property has been sold and Mdm Liew has passed away.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 I come to the question of damages.  It will be recalled that the defendant had been ordered by Lee Seiu Kin J to pay the proceeds from the sale of the Namly property into Court.  This was done on 5 March 2018.  Just before the trial commenced, Karen applied for an order for the sale proceeds to be paid to Mdm Liew’s account.  This application was consented to by the defendant and, pursuant to an order that I made on the first day of trial, the Accountant-General was directed to pay out the moneys from the Namly property’s sale proceeds to Mdm Liew on 12 February 2020.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) dated 29 August 2019 (“SOC”) from [57] to [60]. </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 Karen also claims to be entitled to damages in the form of the interest that could have been earned if the sale proceeds had been released to Mdm Liew earlier.  She claims interest on the amount of S$5,099,660.67 for the period between 12 April 2018 and 5 February 2020, at the default interest rate of 5.33% p.a., less the interest accrued from the payment into Court for that period.  However, nowhere in Karen’s submissions is the legal basis for claiming interest as a head of damages <span class="font-italic">in and of itself</span> outlined.  Karen relies on s 18(2) and [6] of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”), which, when read together, provide that the Court shall have the:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[p]ower to direct interest to be paid on damages, or debts (whether the debts are paid before or after commencement of proceedings) or judgment debts, or on sums found due on taking accounts between parties, or on sums found due and unpaid by receivers or other persons liable to account to the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 I am not persuaded that the parts of the SCJA which Karen relies upon are adequate to ground her claim for damages in the form of interest.  First, the SCJA confers a power to grant interest <span class="font-italic">on</span> damages, and not interest <span class="font-italic">as </span>damages.  This distinction was recognised at [129] of <span class="font-italic">The Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Reliance National Asia Re Pte Ltd</span> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 385, which makes clear that s 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) will apply to the interest to be awarded on damages for a late payment, but will not apply to an award of interest as damages.  Second, I do not understand [6] of the First Schedule to the SCJA as conferring power to award interest on the sale proceeds of the Namly property.  The sale proceeds are not “damages”, “debts”, “judgment debts”, “sums found due on taking accounts between parties”, or “sums found due and unpaid by receivers or other persons liable to account to the court”, and I accordingly do not find the parts of the SCJA relied on by Karen to apply to the instant facts.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Karen also seeks punitive damages.  The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">ACB v Thomson Medical Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and others </span>[2017] 1 SLR 918 (“<span class="font-italic">ACB</span>”) established at [176] that “punitive damages may be awarded in tort where the totality of the defendant’s conduct is so outrageous that it warrants punishment, deterrence, and condemnation”.  Such conduct must be “beyond the pale and therefore deserving of special condemnation”.  The Court of Appeal further elaborated, at [200], that punitive damages serve not only to punish the defendant, but also wider social functions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… When it performs its retributive function, a punitive award looks backwards at the conduct of the defendant and imposes a condign sanction; however, a punitive award also looks <span class="font-italic">forward</span> by making an example of the particular defendant to deter would-be tortfeasors from committing similar transgressions, influencing societal behaviour, and allowing the victim of the wrong an avenue to vindicate his/her rights… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[Emphasis original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 Karen’s argument in relation to punitive damages is that they should be awarded on the instant facts because the defendant has committed elder abuse of a financial nature.  However, she also recognises that there is, at least as the law presently stands, no basis in any legislation penalising “elderly financial abuse”.

</div>  The pamphlet appears to be merely an informational document describing financial abuse as “taking advantage of the elderly person’s funds or resources, for personal gain” and stating that the “abuser may exercise undue influence to bring about changes in the making/ execution of wills”.  Second, no authority was cited to support the argument that “elder abuse” would warrant the imposition of punitive damages at common law.  Third, I have reservations that punitive damages should be awarded even if Karen’s case on “elder abuse” was made out.  On that approach, <span class="font-italic">every</span> instance of undue influence vitiating a decision made by an elderly person would, at least <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, give rise to possible punitive damages.  Fourth, it appears to me from the comments made during the Parliamentary debates on the Vulnerable Adults Bill (Bill No. 20/2018) that Parliament made a conscious decision to focus its legislation on physical and emotional abuse to the exclusion of financial abuse.

</div>  In particular, Mr Desmond Lee, then Minister for Social and Family Development, observed that his Ministry would continue to study “the complex issue of financial exploitation among family members” and would debate legislation on that “at an appropriate time”.  Given the specific exclusion of financial abuse under the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018 (No. 27 of 2018), I am not satisfied that the Courts should impose punitive damages for claims of elder abuse of a financial nature.  In reaching that conclusion, I am mindful of the guidance in <span class="font-italic">UKM v Attorney-General</span> [2019] 3 SLR 874 (“<span class="font-italic">UKM</span>”).  <span class="font-italic">UKM</span> addressed the role of public policy considerations in the context of an application by two gay men to adopt a child.  In outlining the proper role of public policy considerations more generally, Menon CJ observed at [112] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In line with this, the court should, as a general rule, be more cautious in resting its decision on public policy where the legal context falls under Category 1A [where the type of public policy relied on is socio-economic, and the type of law relied on is judge-made law]. That is because judges have no special expertise in socio-economic matters. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Given Parliament’s expressed views on the subject, and for the reasons outlined above, I decline to award punitive damages on the instant facts. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 I note for completeness that, following Mdm Liew’s passing, parties made written submissions on the effect her passing might have on the availability of any remedies.  The defendant argued that, relying on s 10(3)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)(i) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed), where a cause of action survives for the benefit of the estate of a deceased person, the damages recoverable for the benefit of the estate of that person shall not include any exemplary damages.  The term “exemplary damages” in this context is used interchangeably with “punitive damages”: <span class="font-italic">ACB</span> at [156] and <span class="font-italic">Aries Telecoms (M) Bhd v </span><span class="font-italic">ViewQwest Pte Ltd (Fiberail Sdn Bhd, third party)</span> [2020] 3 SLR 750 at [97].  However, given my prior findings at [160] above, there is no need for me to address this argument. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 Finally, Karen seeks an order that that the defendant and his family members render an account of any moneys that have been taken from Mdm Liew’s assets from 20 November 2017.  As the defendant’s wife and two sons are not parties to this action, Karen is clearly not entitled to any remedy against them as a matter of law.  Not only that, Karen has not pleaded or proven that the defendant or any of his family members have wrongfully appropriated any of Mdm Liew’s funds or taken her assets, apart from the proceeds of the sale of the Namly property which have already been accounted for.  As such, the claim for an account is entirely misplaced.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 For the reasons set out in this judgment, I find that Mdm Liew lacked mental capacity to execute the two POAs on 20 November 2017.  Even if she did have mental capacity, I find that the POAs are vitiated by reason of undue influence in the form as set out in my judgment.  In the result, I grant a declaration that the two POAs are void.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">164 I shall deal separately with the question of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Ang Cheng Hock<br/>Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kang Kim Yang, Mary Leong Sut San, and Ang Jian Xiang (Templars Law LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Tan Teck San Kelvin and Chng Hu Ping (Drew &amp; Napier LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
