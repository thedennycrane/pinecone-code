<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This originating summons is one of two appeals
                    arising out of arbitration proceedings between Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co
                    Ltd (“STEC”) and Econ-NCC Joint Venture (“ENJV”)
                    which resulted in a partial award dated 29 December 2008 (“Partial
                    Award”) and a correction award dated 28 January 2009
                    (“Correction Award”). Both parties were dissatisfied with certain
                    aspects of the arbitrator’s decision, albeit on different grounds, and
                    therefore agreed pursuant to s 49(3)(<em>a</em>) of
                    the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to
                    appeal to the court on the questions of law they considered to arise from the
                    decision. This originating summons (“OS 235/2009”) is ENJV’s
                    appeal and STEC’s appeal is encompassed in Originating Summons No 226 of
                    2009 (“OS 226/2009”) (see <em>Shanghai Tunnel
                        Engineering Co Ltd v Econ-NCC Joint Venture</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 252).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       STEC is a Chinese public company which carries
                    out engineering and construction activities. At all material times during its
                    dealings with STEC, ENJV was a joint-venture registered in Singapore as a
                    partnership between a Singapore construction company, Econ Corporation Pte. Ltd
                    (now known as Econ Piling Pte Ltd) (“Econ Piling”), and a Swedish
                    company, NCC International Aktiebolag (“NCCI”). By the time OS
                    235/2009 was filed, the joint-venture had been terminated. As both sets of
                    proceedings relate to events that occurred during the subsistence of the
                    joint-venture, however, it is convenient to refer to ENJV rather than to the
                    individual partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The parties were engaged in works relating to
                    the construction of part of the Circle Line of the Mass Rapid Transit System.
                    ENJV was the main contractor employed by the Land Transport Authority
                    (“LTA”) and it in turn employed STEC as a sub-contractor for part
                    of the works. The disputes that arose subsequently were, in accordance with the
                    contract, referred to arbitration by a sole arbitrator, Mr George Tan
                    (“the Arbitrator”). STEC was the claimant in the arbitration but
                    ENJV both defended the proceedings and put in a counter-claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Background</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The main contract between LTA and ENJV was dated
                    1 August 2002 (“Main Contract”). It was ENJV’s task to
                    construct and complete the MRT stations at MacPherson and Upper Paya Lebar as
                    well as the tunnels at this section of the Circle Line (“Main Contract
                    works”). There were 13 phases under the Main Contract. In Phase 3, the
                    basic structure of the rail tunnels should have been completed. The completion
                    date stipulated in the Main Contract for Phase 3 was 31 December
                    2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       By a Letter of Award dated 5 December 2002
                    (“LA”), STEC was awarded a sub-contract by ENJV for the bored
                    tunnelling works in Phase 3 of the Main Contract at the price of $20,172,966.00
                    (“Sub-Contract”). By virtue of cl 2.0 of the LA, the
                    following documents were incorporated into the Sub-Contract:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The LA;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">General Terms and Conditions for Domestic
                            Subcontract Work (“GTC”); and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Main Contractor’s Programme, referred to in
                            the arbitration proceedings as the “22B3
                            Programme”.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">Broadly speaking, the works under the Sub-Contract (“the
                    Sub-Contract works”) comprised tunnelling works for both north-bound
                    (“NB”) and south-bound (“SB”) tunnels, including the
                    installation of precast reinforced concrete segments in strict compliance with,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, the 22B3 Programme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The commencement and completion dates for the
                    Sub-Contract works were stipulated at cl 4.0 of the LA as 15 December
                    2002 and 31 December 2004 respectively. In particular, STEC was to complete
                    the installation of tunnelling works including First Stage Concrete by
                    16 November 2004. As the issues arising in this appeal relate to the
                    completion of the Sub-Contract works, the clauses in the LA and GTC which are
                    pertinent to completion are reproduced below.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_a"></a>(a)     Clause 4.0 of the LA
                        states:</p>

                            be in accordance with the Main Contractor’s Programme as revised
                            from time to time or as instructed by the Main Contractor.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In particular the Domestic Subcontractor shall complete the
                            installation of the tunnelling works (last segment lining) including
                            First Stage Concrete by <b>16 Nov 04</b>. The
                            Domestic Subcontractor shall then demobilize within 2 weeks, all plant,
                            equipment, tools, surplus materials, temporary works out of the tunnels
                            &amp; shafts including cleaning the tunnels and shafts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">In the event of a revision of the Main Contractor’s Programme,
                            the original duration of the programmed activity of the Domestic

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_6-p2_b"></a>(b)     Clause 17.0
                        of the LA provides for completion, delay and time extension as
                        follows:</p>

                            Such sum or sums shall be deducted or recovered by the Main Contractor

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Pursuant to cl 9.0 of the LA and Appendix V
                    of the GTC, ENJV was to complete preparatory works before STEC could carry out
                    the boring works. These preparatory works included:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Design and construction of launch
                        shaft;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Construction and preparation of launch shaft
                            surface area for STEC to construct the crane foundation and to assemble
                            the gantry crane; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Casting of base slab in the launch shaft and
                            removal of temporary struts to enable STEC to lower the tunnel boring
                            machine (“the Machine”) cradle into the launch shaft and
                            assemble the Machine cradle and the Machine.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Based on the 22B3 programme, the dates for
                    handing over of the SB and NB launch shafts to STEC for commencement of work
                    were 24 April 2003 and 8 May 2003 respectively. Tunnelling works for
                    SB and NB tunnels were to be carried out concurrently. For various reasons, ENJV
                    could not complete the requisite preparatory works according to schedule. The SB
                    launch shaft was handed over to STEC on 27 June 2003 whilst the NB shaft
                    was handed over on 11 August 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       STEC alleged that the late handover of the
                    launch shafts by ENJV entitled it to 84 days of extension of time. This was
                    disputed by ENJV, which claimed that despite the late handover of the launch
                    shaft, STEC had not commenced installation of its site offices and had not
                    mobilised the necessary labour and resources to commence the Sub-Contract works
                    as at the date of actual handover of the launch shafts. Thus, the late
                    commencement of the Sub-Contract works could not be wholly attributable to the
                    delay in the handover of the launch shafts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 20 May 2005, STEC gave notice to ENJV
                    of its intention to commence arbitration proceedings pursuant to cl 32 of
                    the GTC. STEC’s position was that it was not at fault for failing to meet
                    the contractual deadlines but was entitled to extensions of time while ENJV
                    disputed this and claimed that the delay in the completion of the Sub-Contract
                    works had caused it substantial loss for which STEC should be held liable. There
                    was also a dispute over whether ENJV was entitled to withhold certain monies
                    from STEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The arbitration proceedings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     On 6 December 2005, STEC made an
                    application to the Arbitrator for an interim award to be made summarily in its
                    favour. This application was dismissed on 3 April 2006 by the
                    Arbitrator’s interim award (“Interim Award”). Following this
                    decision, STEC re-amended its statement of case and changed its position in
                    relation to the nature of cl 17.0.0 of the LA. It should be noted that the
                    parties had agreed that the Domestic Arbitration Rules of the Singapore
                    International Arbitration Centre (2<sup>nd</sup> Ed,
                    1 September 2002) (“SIAC Domestic Rules”) should govern the
                    conduct of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The hearing of the arbitration commenced in
                    March 2007. Further hearings took place in April and May 2007 and oral evidence
                    was completed on 24 May 2007. Thereafter, both parties filed closing
                    submissions and written replies to the same. The Arbitrator subsequently granted
                    the parties leave to make further submissions and the fifth and final set of
                    submissions from ENJV was received on 14 August 2008. On 15 December
                    2008, the Arbitrator denied ENJV’s request to put in a sixth set of
                    submissions and declared the close of the hearing of the arbitration. He issued
                    the Partial Award on 29 December 2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In January 2009, solicitors for both STEC and
                    ENJV wrote to the Arbitrator to seek clarification and correction on various
                    points of the Partial Award. On 28 January 2009, the Arbitrator issued the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The questions of law raised by ENJV relate to

<p class="Judg-1">There were two other questions of law that arose out of omissions
                    rather than findings of the Arbitrator. One of these related to costs orders for
                    which ENJV had applied and the other related to the Arbitrator’s dismissal
                    of all the heads of contra charges under Group 9 of ENJV’s claim for
                    contra charges when he had found that only one head of claim should be
                    dismissed. The various questions will be discussed in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Questions relating to substantial completion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The questions posed by ENJV in relation to the
                    DLP and therefore in relation to substantial completion are:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the Arbitrator erred in law in relying on
                            the commencement of the DLP in determining the substantial completion of
                            the Sub-Contract works; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Whether the Arbitrator erred in law in holding
                            that the meaning and effect of the DLP in the Main Contract were the
                            same as the meaning and effect of the DLP in the
                        Sub-Contract.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     One of the objections to ENJV’s appeal
                    that STEC raised in its respondent’s case was that the questions posed by
                    ENJV were not questions of law and therefore were not appealable under
                    s 45(1) of the Act. This objection has, in my judgment, no application to
                    the questions set out in <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above because
                    these questions relate to construction of the contractual terms binding the
                    parties and such issues are accepted as being legal issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Contractual provisions</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The relevant contractual provisions which have
                    to be looked at in relation to these questions are found in the LA, the GTC and
                    the Main Contract. First, Clause 4.0 of the LA provides that the completion
                    date for the Sub-Contract was 31 December 2004. In particular, the
                    installation of the tunnelling works (last segment lining) including first stage
                    concrete was to be completed by 16 November 2004. Clause 5.0 of the LA
                    provided for the DLP as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">

                        calendar months from the completion of the installation of the tunnelling
                        works (as described in Item 4.0 above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The GTC provided for completion of the
                    Sub-Contract works as follows in cl 17.0:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When the whole of the Domestic Subcontract works have been substantially

                        Certificate of Substantial Completion. The issue of the Certificate of
                        Substantial Completion for the Domestic Subcontract Works shall be on a
                        “Back-to-Back” basis i.e. it shall be subject to the issue of
                        a similar certificate by the Engineer to the Main Contract unless otherwise
                        provided in the Letter of Award.</p>

                        of the Certificate of Substantial Completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Arbitrator’s reasoning</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     At para 98 of the Partial Award, the
                    Arbitrator opined that with the parties’ acceptance of the commencement of
                    the DLP on 8 March 2005, he “should find that STEC had achieved
                    substantial completion of the Sub-Contract works on 8 March 2005”.
                    He had accepted STEC’s arguments that (at paras 97-98):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">97.    … relying on clauses 1.1 and 54.1 of the
                            Main Contract Conditions that as the DLP is calculated from the date of
                            the Substantial Completion of the Works, it must mean that STEC had
                            achieved substantial completion of the Sub-Contract works on
                            8 March 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">98.    Although these Main Contract provisions do not
                            directly govern the relationship between the parties, I find no reason
                            to assume that substantial completion of the Sub-Contract works should
                            be different from that for the Main Contract. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In my view, with all due respect to the
                    Arbitrator, he made an error in deciding that the parties’ acceptance of
                    commencement of DLP itself determined the date of substantial completion of the
                    Sub-Contract works because he made this decision in reliance on the Main
                    Contract provisions only and without regard to the language of the Sub-Contract
                    itself. No doubt, his interpretation of the Main Contract cannot be faulted.
                    Under cl 1.1 of the Main Contract, “defects liability period”
                    is calculated from the date of substantial completion of the <em>whole</em> of the Main Contract works, <em>and not for
                        any Phase or Section or part thereof certified by the Engineer</em>.
                    The date of substantial completion is taken, under cl 54.1 of the Main
                    Contract, to be the day named in the Certificate of Substantial Completion.
                    Therefore, under the Main Contract, the DLP for the whole of the Main Contract
                    works would indeed commence on the day named in the Certificate of Substantial
                    Completion. The Arbitrator, however, himself noted that the Main Contract
                    provisions did not directly govern the relationship between STEC and ENJV and
                    therefore his first recourse should have been to the terms of the
                    Sub-Contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The position under the Sub-Contract is
                    different from that under the Main Contract. It is clear from the wording of the
                    LA and the GTC that the commencement of the DLP and date of completion of the
                    Sub-Contract works were not intended by the parties to coincide. Under
                    cl 5.0 of the LA, the DLP commences upon the “completion of the
                    installation of the tunnelling works” as described in cl 4.0 of the
                    LA. Under cl 4.0 of the LA, STEC was under the obligation to
                    “complete the installation of the tunnelling works (last segment lining)
                    including First Stage Concrete by 16 Nov 04”, which is a separate
                    date from the date of completion of the Sub-Contract works, which was stipulated
                    to be 31 December 2004. If the works had progressed as the parties had
                    envisaged under the Sub-Contract, ideally, the DLP should have commenced on
                    16 November 2004, even though the date of completion of the Sub-Contract,
                        <em>viz</em>, 31 December 2004, had not arrived
                    yet.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Through no coincidence, 31 December 2004
                    was also the stipulated date of completion of Phase 3 of the Main Contract. The
                    installation of tunnelling works including First Stage Concrete by STEC was one
                    of the activities to be completed before ENJV and its other sub-contractors
                    could carry out other works to the tunnels to achieve basic structural
                    completion. There were six other items of work to be completed, only two of
                    which (albeit the more substantial) were to be done by STEC. Thus in the
                    Sub-Contract, unlike the Main Contract, commencement of DLP was divorced from
                    substantial completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Clause 17 of the GTC envisaged that on
                    substantial completion of the Sub-Contract works, ENJV would issue a certificate
                    to this effect. However, it was also contemplated that such certificate would be
                    issued on a back to back basis with the issue of a similar certificate by the
                    Engineer under the Main Contract. In the event, this certificate issued by the
                    Engineer stated that Phase 3 of the Main Contract works (<em>ie</em>, the Sub-Contract works) was completed on 2 June 2006.
                    There was, however, evidence that the LTA considered that the B2 tunnels were
                    substantially completed on 16 August 2005. Therefore, it would seem that
                    the Engineer’s certificate may not have reflected the actual date of
                    substantial completion of the Sub-Contract works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In my judgment, if the Arbitrator had
                    construed the provisions of the Sub-Contract, he would have found that under the
                    Sub-Contract, unlike the Main Contract, the DLP would not necessarily commence
                    on the date of substantial completion. Accordingly, in order to determine the
                    actual date of substantial completion, he would have looked at the evidence in
                    relation to what STEC had done by 8 March 2005 and found as a fact whether
                    the Sub-Contract works were substantially completed on that date or on
                    16 August 2005 or on any other date. The Arbitrator misdirected himself by
                    relying on the provisions of the Main Contract and the parties’ acceptance
                    that DLP started on 8 March 2005 to determine substantial completion. The
                    questions of law posed in <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above must be
                    answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The legal difference between “delay” and
                “interruption”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The next question of law is whether the
                    Arbitrator erred in law in failing to make a distinction between a delay and an
                    interruption when he assessed the actual duration of delay in relation to
                    Delaying Event 5 of STEC’s claim. The point here is whether these two
                    terms have distinct legal meanings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     Delaying Event 5 related to STEC’s claim
                    that the progress of its works on the Drive B3 SB tunnel was delayed by 34 days
                    as a result of the transfer of the SB Machine transformer to the NB Machine and
                    the subsequent malfunction of a particular transformer. ENJV denied that STEC
                    was entitled to any extension of time for Delaying Event 5.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     ENJV relied on the testimony of the experts of
                    both parties on time and delays, to wit Jonathan Prudhoe (for STEC) and Thomas
                    Harker (for ENJV), for its contention that the 34-day duration of
                    “delay” stated in the experts’ Joint Statement on Time was
                    merely expressing the period between the date of transfer of the transformer and
                    the date of resumption of work, and that this period was merely an
                    “interruption” and not “delay”. STEC’s expert
                    in particular had confirmed that the 34 days was the period of interruption and
                    not actual delay and that there were only 31 days of delay. Therefore, ENJV
                    submitted, the Arbitrator had erred in finding that (a) there was no difference
                    between a “delay” and an “interruption”; and (b)
                    ENJV was responsible for the 34-day delay which entitled STEC to an extension of
                    time for that duration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     From the transcript, it appears that
                    Mr Prudhoe had pointed out that there was a disagreement between the
                    experts on the appropriate terminology; while Mr Prudhoe preferred to use
                    the term “delay”, Mr Harker preferred to use the term
                    “interruption”. The Arbitrator addressed this issue in
                    para 87 of the Partial Award where he said:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">87    First of all, I agree with STEC “that the
                            durations have been agreed regardless of whether one refers to these
                            durations as delay or interruption or period whereby an activity could
                            not proceed or work was not going on.” If I focus on the
                            substance rather than the nomenclature, I find some difficulty in seeing
                            the difference between a delay and an “interruption.” I am
                            not persuaded that there is a difference and I accordingly hold that the
                            experts have agreed on the durations in the Joint
                        Statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In Chow Kok Fong, <em>Construction Contracts Dictionary</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell Asia,
                    2006), “delay” is defined as (at p 103):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>delay</b>
<em>n</em>. In relation to the progress of construction
                        works, refers to: (a) the period of time by which the works has fallen
                        behind a specified time target; <em>or</em> (b) the
                        difference in the time taken for the works to be actually completed against
                        the period allowed for completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is no definition of interruption and ENJV did not put forward
                    any other legal definition or any authority which supported its contention that
                    the two terms had different meanings and consequences in law. The textbooks and
                    the cases do not discuss that difference because, as the Arbitrator recognised,
                    it is merely a matter of semantics, not substance. So long as there has been
                    either a period of time by which the works have fallen behind a specified time
                    target or a difference between the time taken for the works to be actually
                    completed and the duration allowed for completion under the contract, there can
                    be said to have been “delay” caused. The critical question is
                    really which party had caused the delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     If it was the main contractor, or employer,
                    who caused the delay, <em>ie</em>, prevented the timely
                    completion of the contract works in any way, the general rule is that he loses
                    the right to claim liquidated damages for non-completion to time for he
                    “cannot insist on a condition if it is his own fault that the condition
                    has not been fulfilled” (<em>Amalgamated Building
                        Contractors Ltd v Waltham Holy Cross UDC</em> [1952] 2 All
                    ER 452, at 455): see <em>Keating on Construction
                        Contracts</em> (Stephen Furst and Vivian Ramsey, gen ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell, 8<sup>th</sup> Ed, 2006) at
                para 9-018.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In the Partial Award, the Arbitrator made the
                    following findings of fact:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     As a result of Delaying Event 5,
                        STEC could not proceed with the Sub-Contract works for a duration of 34 days
                        (at para 87); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     It was “more likely than not that the insulation
                        material was inherently defective rather than it was damaged by misuse or
                        neglect owing to poor maintenance” (at
                    para 221).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As a result, he found that STEC should not be
                    held responsible for Delaying Event 5 and was thus entitled to 34 days’
                    extension of time in respect of the same. ENJV criticised the award of 34
                    days’ extension of time on the basis that STEC’s own expert had
                    calculated the delay as being 31 days. Whether the period of delay was 31 days
                    or 34 days was a question of fact and was for the Arbitrator to determine. Even
                    if he did make a mistake of fact, such mistake is not amenable to appeal. The
                    Arbitrator was well entitled to find as matters of fact what the duration of the
                    delay or interruption was and whose fault caused that delay.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The question of law must therefore be answered
                    in the negative and it must be stated that the question posed turned out not to
                    be a question of law at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The true construction of clause 17.0 of the LA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     ENJV has framed the following questions as
                    questions of law arising out of the Arbitrator’s findings in relation
                    cl 17.0 of the LA:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Arbitrator erred in law
                        in holding that he was not <em>functus officio</em> and
                        was therefore able to hold that cl 17.0 of the LA is not a liquidated
                        damages provision and that STEC was not estopped by its position at the
                        hearing leading to the Interim Award;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_b"></a>(b)     In the alternative, whether the Arbitrator erred in law
                        in his construction that cl 17.0 is not a liquidated damages provision;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_c"></a>(c)     In any
                        event, whether the Arbitrator erred in law in dismissing ENJV’s claim
                        for the monies in relation to cl 17.0 and finding that ENJV was
                        entitled to retain the monies under the said clause.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     These questions of law are based on two
                    positions taken by ENJV. The first was that the Arbitrator had determined in the
                    Interim Award that cl 17.0 of the LA was a liquidated damages
                    clause and as such had rendered himself <em>functus
                        officio</em> in relation to these issues and unable to depart from the
                    earlier determination. The second position was that the Arbitrator had wrongly
                    construed cl 17.0 in the Partial Award when he decided it was not a
                    liquidated damages provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On 6 December 2005, STEC applied pursuant
                    to r 27 of the SIAC Domestic Rules for a summary award in its favour in the
                    sum of $5,910,000. The material portions of r 27 state as follows:</p>

                    of $1m deducted by ENJV pursuant to cl 17.0.0 of the LA. In its submissions
                    for the purposes of the summary award, STEC stated that it was on common ground
                    with ENJV that liquidated damages under that clause was capped at the sum
                    of $1m and that these “capped damages” related to the period
                    between 17 November 2004 and 31 December 2004. Beyond 31 December
                    2004, STEC submitted, no liquidated damages were payable because neither
                    cl 17.0 of the LA nor any other provision of the Sub-Contract incorporated
                    the rates of liquidated damages from the Main Contract either expressly or on a
                    “back-to-back” basis into the Sub-Contract. STEC accepted that
                    ENJV may be entitled to claim <em>general damages</em> of
                    $1m but submitted that this must be proven in evidence at the main
                    hearing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     In response, ENJV submitted that in relation
                    to the 16 November 2004 completion date for installation of tunnelling
                    works, the parties had agreed to daily rates of liquidated damages up to a cap
                    of 30 days or $1m under cl 17.0 of the LA. ENJV contended that STEC’s
                    failure to meet the 16 November 2004 completion date attracted liability to
                    pay liquidated damages at an increasing rate up to a maximum of $1 million.
                    Therefore, STEC’s breach of its contractual obligations to complete the
                    Sub-Contract works on time, as well as to provide non-defective works, gave rise
                    to a bona fide claim for damages (liquidated or otherwise) on the part of ENJV
                    as main contractor and entitled ENJV to deduct such damages from payments due to
                    STEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     It should be noted that as at the date of
                    STEC’s application for summary award, <em>viz</em>,
                    6 December 2005, STEC’s pleadings in its amended statement of claim
                    dated 17 October 2005 stated that cl 17.0 of the LA had set out a
                    “damages cap” mechanism (at paras 106-107):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">106.  Clause 17.0
                            of the Letter of Award addresses completion delay and additionally sets
                            out a “damages cap” mechanism to be applicable to the
                            Claimants “…<em>in the event
                                that</em> (the Claimants) <em>delays the

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">107.  This
                            mechanism is one which, by the Claimants’ interpretation, the
                            Claimants agree to progressive deductions or back charges by the
                            Respondents of:-</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">a)    S$20,000.00 per day for the first 10 days of

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">b)    S$30,000.00 per day for the following 10 days;
                                and culminating at</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">c)    S$50,000.00 per day for the next and final
                                tranche of 10 days – thereby limiting the Claimants to a
                                “cap” of S$1,000,000.00 payable <em>as
                                    liquidated damages</em> (“LD” or
                                “LDs”) for a mutually recognised period of 30 days of
                                Sub Contract delay (“the damages cap”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">When this pleading was amended on 21 February 2006, STEC
                    continued to maintain its case that cl 17.0.0 of the LA was meant as a cap
                    on the liquidated damages payable to ENJV.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Given the state of the pleadings and the
                    submissions from both parties, the Arbitrator recorded in the Interim Award
                    dated 3 April 2006 that (at para 81):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although clause 17.0 of the Letter of Award appears to be capable of
                        a number of interpretations, <em>the parties are on common
                            ground</em> that clause 17.0 is a liquidated damages
                        provision. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Naturally, he also recorded the fact that (at para 84):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Either way, whichever meaning of clause 17.0 is adopted, <em>the parties are in broad agreement</em> that the
                        Respondents can, in principle, deduct liquidated damages up to a cap of
                        S$1,000,000 under that clause for delay between 17 November 2004
                        and 31 December 2004. There is, of course, disagreement over whether
                        the circumstances justify such a deduction. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Ultimately, in the Interim Award, in
                    dismissing STEC’s application for a summary award, the Arbitrator made
                    “no ruling at this stage”(at para 89) whether STEC was indeed
                    liable for liquidated damages up to the cap of S$1m or at all, as he found that
                    ENJV had a “bona fide and arguable claim” for that
                sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Relevant findings in the Partial Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Subsequently, STEC changed tack. It amended
                    its pleadings before the hearing and in its Final Statement of Claimant’s
                    Case (which was dated 15 September 2006) there is no mention that
                    cl 17.0 of the LA was meant as a liquidated damages provision with a cap at
                    $1m. In its amended statement of the claimant’s reply and defence to
                    counterclaim dated 27 October 2006, STEC averred at para 166 that
                    cl 17.0 of the LA did not set out any liquidated damages payable by
                    STEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In response, ENJV contended that the
                    Arbitrator was <em>functus officio</em> and could not
                    reopen the issue of whether cl 17.0 of the LA was a liquidated damages
                    provision and that STEC was estopped from contending that cl 17.0 was not a
                    liquidated damages provision since it had agreed in its submissions in relation
                    to the summary award application that cl 17.0 was such a
                provision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     On the <em>functus
                        officio</em> point, in the Partial Award, the Arbitrator observed (at
                    para 410):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Although I note and recorded the common understanding of the parties [that
                        cl 17.0.0 of the LA is a liquidated damages provision], <em>I did not consider it necessary for me to make any finding or
                            ruling, conclusive or otherwise on the nature of the provision or
                            STEC’s liability for liquidated damages</em>. This was
                        because STEC has to show that there was no viable defence that justifies a
                        full hearing of the evidence, in order to succeed in its application for a
                        summary award. It was enough for me to establish whether ENJV had a
                        “bona fide and arguable claim” for the sum against which a
                        summary award was sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Arbitrator did not consider himself to have been <em>functus</em> on the issue relating to cl 17.0.0 of the
                    LA as there had been (at para 414):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… no final determination (just a determination that there was a
                        bona fide and an arguable case) that ENJV is entitled to this sum, that
                        clause 17.0, LA is a liquidated damages provision or that it has a
                        right to a deduction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The Arbitrator also dismissed ENJV’s
                    contention that STEC was estopped from raising the issue of the interpretation
                    of cl 17.0.0 of the LA as that issue had been determined in the Interim
                    Award (see para 416 of the Partial Award). He was not satisfied that the
                    requirements for establishing an issue estoppel were met. In particular, he held
                    that (at paras 420 and 424):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">420.  Even if the Interim Award contains a finding that
                            clause 17.0 of the LA is a liquidated [<em>sic</em>] provision (which it does not), <em>I
                                find there was no ruling that amounted to a declaration or
                                determination of STEC’s or ENJV’s rights. All that was
                                decided or determined was that ENJV possessed an arguable claim that
                                ought to be allowed to proceed. There is no final and conclusive
                                judgment on the merits</em>. Consequently, I am not satisfied
                            that the first requirement to establish an issue estoppel is
                        met.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">424.  Although it is the same issue in the sense that
                            the question is whether clause 17.0 of the LA is a liquidated
                            damages provision, the prior decision [<em>ie</em>,
                            the Interim Award] cannot be said to “traverse the same
                            ground.” What was to be determined then was whether ENJV had an
                            arguable claim that was adequate to defeat STEC’s application for
                            a summary award. On the other hand, what I have to address in this Award
                            is the final determination of the issue where the parties’ rights
                            and obligations are established.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     Construing cl 17.0 of the LA on the
                    merits, the Arbitrator held that that clause, on a plain reading, only enables
                    ENJV to retain money beyond that allowed in the retention clause (<em>viz</em>, cl 8.0 of the LA), subject to an upper limit
                    of $1m. He was not persuaded that cl 17.0 was a clause that provided
                    for the payment of liquidated damages on delay. Therefore, he dismissed
                    ENJV’s counterclaim for liquidated damages pursuant to cl 17.0 of the
                    LA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Functus Officio and Res Judicata</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     On appeal, ENJV revisited the arguments it had
                    made before the Arbitrator and which were rejected by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     There is no doubt that the concept of
                        <em>functus officio</em> is part of the law of
                    arbitration. Section 44 of the Act states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>Effect of award</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>44</b>. —(1) An award made by the arbitral
                        tribunal pursuant to an arbitration agreement shall be <em>final and binding on the parties</em> and on any person claiming
                        through or under them and may be relied upon by any of the parties by way of
                        defence, set-off or otherwise in any proceedings in any court of competent
                        jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)   Except as provided in section 43, upon an award
                        being made, including an award made in accordance with section 33, <em>the arbitral tribunal shall not vary, amend, correct, review,
                            add to or revoke the award</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In s 2(1) of the Act,
                    “award” is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">"award" means a decision of the arbitral tribunal on the substance of the
                        dispute and includes any interim, interlocutory or partial award
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In the Interim Award, the Arbitrator had
                    dismissed STEC’s application for a summary award in its favour. The
                    consequence of dismissal of the application was that the parties continued the
                    action from the position that they were in prior to the application: <em>Singapore Court Practice 2009</em> (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed)
                    (LexisNexis, 2009) (“<em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em>”) at para 14/3/5. There was no decision on any
                    substantive matter relating to the disputes being arbitrated. In strict terms
                    therefore, there was no <em>award</em> in favour of STEC
                    within the meaning of “award” in s 2(1) of the Act.
                    Accordingly, at the time of the arbitration hearings leading to the issuance of
                    the Partial Award, the parties were proceeding from the position that they were
                    in prior to the application for summary award (not prior to the Interim Award).
                    At that time, the Arbitrator had made no findings in relation to cl 17.0 of
                    the LA which were “final and binding on the parties” under
                    s 44 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In any event, read in their proper context,
                    the passages that ENJV quoted from the Interim Award to support its contention
                    that the Arbitrator had made “determinations” to the effect that
                    cl 17.0 of the LA was a liquidated damages clause did not have such
                    effect. The Arbitrator was merely recording the agreement between STEC and ENJV
                    with regard to the interpretation of cl 17.0 as a liquidated damages
                    provision. He did not state definitively that he was in agreement with their
                    interpretation. Indeed, he appeared to have contemplated instead that
                    cl 17.0 “appears to be capable of a number of
                    interpretations” (at para 81 of the Interim Award) and stated that
                    his decision to dismiss STEC’s application for summary award would have
                    held “whichever meaning of clause 17 is adopted” (at
                    para 84). In my judgment, therefore, the Arbitrator was not <em>functus</em> in this regard.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     Under r 22.2(a) of the SIAC Domestic
                    Rules, the arbitral tribunal has the power to “allow any party, upon such
                    terms (as to costs or otherwise) as it may determine, to amend any case
                    statements or other documents filed in the arbitration”. Exercising this
                    power, the Arbitrator allowed STEC to amend its pleadings such that in the Final
                    Statement of Claimant’s Case, its previous contention that cl 17.0 of
                    the LA was a liquidated damages provision was removed and it then advanced its
                    case on the basis that that clause did not provide for liquidated
                    damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In <em>Halsbury’s Laws of
                        Singapore</em> vol 2 (LexisNexis, 2003 Reissue), the doctrine of
                        <em>res judicata</em> as applied to arbitral
                    proceedings is described in the following terms (at para 20.117):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The doctrine of res judicata which applies to proceedings in court applies
                        similarly to matters referred to arbitration. <em>Upon the
                            award being made on the matter in dispute, the original cause of action
                            is extinguished</em>. The rights of the successful party no longer
                        lie in the original cause of action but in the right to enforce the award in
                        its terms. Where, however, the reference to arbitration does not confer upon
                        the arbitrators jurisdiction to resolve all matters in dispute between the
                        parties, then the original cause of action remains in existence as regards
                        those excluded matters. … [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     In its case, ENJV relies on the case of
                        <em>Khan v Goleccha International Ltd</em> [1980]
                    2 All ER 259 (“<em>Khan</em>”) for
                    its stand that STEC had conceded that cl 17.0 is a liquidated damages
                    provision and is estopped from changing that position. In <em>Khan</em>, a licensed moneylender had agreed to sell a property to a
                    purchaser and to provide finance for the purchase. The purchaser sued and one of
                    the issues which arose for consideration was whether the transaction constituted
                    a moneylending transaction that was subject to the UK Moneylending Act. The
                    purchaser lost at first instance and appealed. At the appeal hearing, counsel
                    for the purchaser conceded on a point of law that the transaction was <em>not</em> a moneylending transaction. Thus, the appeal was
                    dismissed by consent. Two years later, the purchaser commenced a second action
                    against the same moneylender and sought to assert that the transaction was
                    actually a moneylending transaction. The English Court of Appeal held that the
                    concession made by the purchaser in the Court of Appeal in the first action
                    founded an issue estoppel preventing him from asserting in the second action
                    that the transaction was a moneylending transaction. Brightman LJ observed
                    that (at 266):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Looking at the matter broadly, the issue of “lending of
                        money” was raised in the Queen’s Bench action [<em>ie</em>, the first action]. The judge decided that there
                            <em>was</em> a lending of money within the meaning
                        of the Act. The plaintiff appealed. The Court of Appeal gave judgment
                        dismissing the appeal. The judgment was given by consent and the consent was
                        given because the defendant claimed, and the plaintiff accepted, that there
                        was <em>no</em> lending of money. <em>In
                            my view, that admission by the plaintiff, given to the court and
                            founding the judgment by consent, was just as efficacious for the
                            purpose of issue estoppel as a judicial decision by the court after
                            argument founding a similar judgment. The only sensible approach of the
                            law, in my view, is to treat an issue as laid at rest, not only if it is
                            embodied in the terms of the judgment, or implicit in the judgment
                            because it is embodied in the spoken decision, but also if it is
                            embodied in an admission made in the face of the court or implicit in a
                            consent order</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Bridge LJ concurred, noting that (at 268):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Here the issue loan or no loan was in the first round of litigation
                        between the parties an issue raised in the Court of Appeal which, if the
                        appeal had run its course, would not necessarily have been determined by the
                        court, but might well have been determined by the court, as part of its
                        reasoning in deciding whether or not the appeal should be allowed. <em>In the event what happened was that Mr Khan, through his
                            counsel, quite specifically and categorically chose to withdraw that
                            issue from the consideration of the court on the basis that, in relation
                            to that issue, he was bound to accept defeat and acknowledge that the
                            case against him was unanswerable. If the selfsame issue were now
                            allowed to be raised and litigated in those proceedings, I ask myself,
                            would it not be a case of the company being vexed a second time in
                            relation to an issue which it was open to Mr Khan to have had
                            determined in the previous proceedings?</em> To that question, to
                        my mind, there really can only be one answer. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Brightman LJ’s observations were
                    relied on by ENJV to contend that on the present facts, the <em>very fact</em> that in its application for summary award STEC had
                    accepted that cl 17.0 of the LA was a liquidated damages provision meant
                    that the issue of the proper interpretation of cl 17.0 of the LA should be
                    “laid at rest”. I do not agree that this approach should be taken.
                    The court hearing <em>Khan</em> was faced with very
                    different facts. As a result of the concession made by counsel for the purchaser
                    on the appeal in the first action, the appeal was dismissed by consent of both
                    parties. That judgment was a final and binding decision on both parties in that
                    the <em>substance</em> of the issue in dispute, <em>ie</em>, whether the transaction in question was a
                    moneylending transaction, had been definitively and finally determined by the
                    Court of Appeal. That judgment was not a judgment <em>dismissing</em> the purchaser’s application for <em>summary judgment</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     In my respectful view, it is not possible to
                    quarrel with the Arbitrator’s analysis on the issue of whether STEC was
                    estopped from changing its position on the proper interpretation of cl 17.0
                    of the LA. What he decided in the Interim Award was whether ENJV had a bona fide
                    and arguable counterclaim, not whether cl 17.0 was a liquidated damages
                    provision. That was a provisional decision subject to review after hearing all
                    the evidence and he was not then bound to allow that counterclaim in the Partial
                    Award. A counterclaim that is held to be “arguable” for the
                    purposes of a summary award may not necessarily be allowed in the eventual
                    arbitral award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Furthermore, the dismissal of STEC’s
                    application for summary award put the parties in the position they were in
                        <em>before</em> the application was made. At that
                    point, there should not be any barrier to STEC’s changing of position on
                    the interpretation of cl 17.0 of the LA by amending its case statements to
                    reflect that change. STEC’s position in this case is not parallel to the
                    purchaser’s position in <em>Khan</em>. In that case,
                    the concession by his counsel on appeal in the first action led to the dismissal
                    of the appeal. Therefore, the judgment that was final and binding on him was the
                    first instance judgment which he had appealed against. Here, there was no award
                    which STEC was bound by. In the Interim Award, the Arbitrator had not made any
                    final determination on the substance of the issue of how cl 17.0 should be
                    construed. Therefore, it was open to STEC to amend its case statement and change
                    its position on the proper construction of cl 17.0 of the LA and no
                    estoppel existed.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Construction of clause 17.0 of the LA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     ENJV’s alternative argument was that the
                    proper construction of cl 17.0 of the LA is that it is a liquidated damages
                    provision and that the Arbitrator had erred in finding that it is not.

                    increasing rate of losses that would flow from a breach of that deadline. Thus,
                    ENJV submitted, in drafting cl 17.0 of the LA, the parties had intended to

<p class="Judg-1">STEC submitted that cl 17.0 should be read in the light of this retention clause in the LA, and drew particular attention to the part of cl 17.0 which states that ENJV “shall retain the following <em>additional sums</em>” [emphasis added], contending that the sum to be retained (maximum of $1m), was <em>in addition to</em> the sums retained pursuant to cl 8.0.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     STEC further submitted that the following
                    references in cl 17.0 of the LA indicate that damages for delay in
                    completion of the Sub-Contract works should be governed by cll 15 – 18 of
                    the GTC, not cl 17.0 of the LA:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Domestic Subcontractor is fully aware that liquidated damages for the
                        Basic Structure Completion [<em>ie</em>, Phase 3] in
                        the Main Contract is $49,000 per day and Completion of the Whole of the Main
                        Contract Works is $66,000 per day.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Domestic Subcontractor’s attention is also directed [<em>sic</em>] Clause 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the General
                        Terms and Conditions for Domestic Subcontract Work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Clause 15 of the GTC imposes an
                    obligation on STEC to “carry out and complete” the Sub-Contract
                    works “by the completion date as set out in the Letter of Award”,
                        <em>ie</em>, 31 December 2004. It also allows STEC
                    to give notice to ENJV of any delay which, being a “relevant
                    event”, may entitle it to an extension of time. Clause 16 of the GTC
                    defines what may qualify as a “relevant event”, including in its
                    description “failure of the Main Contractor to give possession of the
                    Site as indicated in the Main Contractor’s Programme” and
                    “delay caused by any act or omission of the Main Contractor”.
                    Clause 17 of the GTC provides for damages payable by STEC in the event of
                    late completion. The first para thereof reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>17    Completion</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Should the Domestic Subcontractor fail to complete the Domestic
                        Subcontract Works by the completion date or any extended date or dates as
                        may be granted under this Domestic Subcontract and such delay results in
                        delay to the completion of the Main Contract Works, then the Domestic
                        Subcontractor shall pay or allow to the Main Contractor a sum equivalent to
                        any loss or damage suffered or incurred by the Main Contractor which is
                        attributable to the delay caused by the Domestic Subcontract Works. Such sum
                        or sums shall be deducted or recovered by the Main Contractor from monies
                        due or which may become due to the Domestic Subcontractor under this or any
                        other subcontract.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The second para of cl 18 of the GTC which is entitled
                    “Rate of Progress” reproduces the first para of cl 17.
                    Whilst such repetition may appear redundant, it appears to me that this is an
                    emphasis which indicates that parties were intent on providing that the measure
                    of damages for delay on the part of STEC would be “a sum equivalent to
                    any loss or damage suffered or incurred” by ENJV as a result thereof: in
                    effect, an indemnity. There is no mention in either cl 17 or cl 18 of
                    the GTC of liquidated damages. The fact that the Sub-Contract has specifically
                    provided for a particular measure of damages by these clauses would be one
                    reason militating against interpreting cl 17.0 of the LA as providing for a
                    different measure of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In Duncan Wallace, <em>Hudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts</em> vol 2
                    (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 11<sup>th</sup> Ed, 1995)
                        (“<em>Hudson’s</em>), the author notes
                    that (at para 10·001):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Contracts often contain provisions for the <em>payment of
                            sums of money</em> … in the event of particular specified
                        breaches of the contract. These provisions vary very considerably, but their
                        main objectives are to act as an inducement to due performance of a
                        particular contractual obligation, or to regulate beforehand in an agreed
                        and certain manner the rights of the parties, rather than leave them to the
                        less predictable remedies otherwise available, and in particular the
                        assessment of damages in the event of breach of the obligation in
                        question.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The simplest provisions of this type are provisions stating in round
                        figures what <em>payments are to be made or what the damages
                            are to be in a certain event</em>. These are classical liquidated
                        damages or penalties provisions, and are most commonly found in building
                        contracts in relation to the contractor’s obligation to complete the
                        work within the specified time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These comments may seem to suggest that cl 17.0 of the LA can be
                    read as providing for liquidated damages. However, the typical liquidated
                    damages clause provides for <em>payment</em> by the
                    party in delay beyond the completion date to the innocent party, in this case,
                    by the sub-contractor to the main contractor. Such is not the effect of
                    cl 17.0. Instead, it provides that up to $1m may be <em>retained</em> (in addition to the sums already retained under
                    cl 8.0 of the LA) by ENJV in the event that STEC does not complete the
                    installation of the tunnelling works by 16 November 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The interpretation of the clause promoted
                    by STEC is aided by the fact that the date 16 November 2004 was also
                    significant because:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">the DLP is stated in cl 5.0 of the LA to be
                            24 calendar months from “the completion of the installation of
                            the tunnelling works”, <em>ie</em>,
                            16 November 2004; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">under cl 8.0 of the LA, the
                                2<sup>nd</sup> moiety of release of sum retained is
                            scheduled to be at the end of 24 months after the completion of the
                            installation of the tunnelling works, <em>ie</em>,
                            at the end of the DLP.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">From this perspective, the additional sum of up to $1m to be retained
                    by ENJV for delay to the completion of the installation of the tunnelling works
                    beyond 16 November 2004 could well have been intended to serve as an
                    additional inducement to STEC to perform its obligations during the DLP
                    satisfactorily as well as a fund from which ENJV could draw in the event that
                    STEC failed to complete the works properly or to rectify defective
                works.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Furthermore, the author of <em>Hudson’s</em> writes that (at para 10·021):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… it is desirable to note again that liquidated damages clauses for
                        delay by definition represent a pre-estimate of <em>all</em> (not some of) the owner’s damages caused by delay
                        in completion.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As stated above, cll 17 and 18 of the GTC make STEC liable to pay
                    ENJV a sum equivalent to the loss incurred by ENJV for delay to the completion
                    of the Main Contract works which resulted from delay to the completion of the
                    Sub-Contract works. Clause 17.0 of the LA notifies STEC that liquidated
                    damages payable by ENJV to LTA for delays to completion beyond the stipulated
                    completion date for “Basic Structure Completion”, <em>ie</em>, 31 December 2004 (also the date stipulated in
                    cl 4.0 of the LA as the completion date for the Sub-Contract works) are
                    calculated at $49,000 per day. Thus, cl 17.0 of the LA gives STEC notice
                    that in the event that it failed to complete the Sub-Contract works by
                    31 December 2004, and such delay resulted in delay to the completion of
                    Phase 3 of the Main Contract, it may be liable to pay ENJV $49,000 per day
                    on the basis that this would be the amount of damage per day incurred by ENJV
                    itself. To the extent that delay in the completion of the installation of
                    tunnelling works by 16 November 2004 causes delay to the completion of the
                    Sub-Contract works which in turn results in delay to the completion of the Main
                    Contract works, construing cl 17.0 as a liquidated damages
                    clause instead of a retention clause may end up allowing ENJV double
                    recovery, since it would then be entitled to obtain up to $1m from STEC under
                    cl 17.0 of the LA and additional damages at the rate of $49,000 per day
                    under cl 17 of the GTC for the same delay beyond 31 December
                    2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     When the parties appeared before me for oral
                    arguments on this appeal, I pointed out that the terms “Retention”
                    and “Liquidated Damages” are both well known and constantly used
                    in the construction industry. The parties here were all active players on the
                    construction scene and must have come across those terms on practically a daily
                    basis. That being the case, if ENJV had wanted cl 17.0 of the LA to be a
                    liquidated damages clause, ENJV would have drafted it to achieve that effect and
                    would not have agreed to the use of the word “retain” in the way
                    it was used in cl 17 without any qualification to indicate that sums
                    retained were to satisfy claims for liquidated damages. The only reference to
                    liquidated damages in the clause is in respect of ENJV’s liability to
                    LTA and having made such reference, had the parties intended the retained amount
                    to be applied as liquidated damages payable to ENJV itself, it would have
                    required no extraordinary drafting skill to say so. They did nothing of the
                    kind, however. It appeared to me at the hearing, and it appears to me now, that
                    the parties’ intentions as reflected in the wording of cl 17 were
                    that it should be a retention clause to incentivise STEC to perform its
                    work efficiently and not a liquidated damages clause since the measure of
                    damages was to be, pursuant to cll 17 and 18 of the GTC, the actual loss
                    suffered by ENJV by reason of STEC’s default. I can see no error of law in
                    the way that the Arbitrator interpreted cl 17.0 of the LA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     As a further alternative, ENJV made the
                    argument that on the Arbitrator’s own interpretation of cl 17.0 of
                    the LA as a retention clause, he should have allowed ENJV to retain the $1m
                    since he also found STEC liable for 68 days’ of delay. In particular, ENJV
                    contended that the Arbitrator should have directed that the $1m be retained
                    until the completion of the assessment of loss and damages incurred by ENJV. The
                    flaw in this argument is that this was not pleaded before the Arbitrator. In the
                    arbitral proceedings, ENJV’s counterclaim for the $1m was premised on its
                    interpretation of cl 17.0 as a liquidated damages clause. In its amended
                    statement of respondent’s case and counterclaim, ENJV stated at
                    paras 102 – 104:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">102.  At the stipulated rates, ENJV would be entitled
                            to the maximum sum of liquidated damages of S$1,000,000.00 once the
                            aggregate number of days of non-completion reaches 30
                        days.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">103.  It cannot be denied that the installation of the
                            tunnelling works including First Stage Concrete was not completed within
                            the 30 day period after 16 November 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">104.  Accordingly, ENJV claims the maximum <em>liquidated damages of</em><b><u>S$1,000,000.00</u></b> payable under
                            Clause 17.0 LA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     ENJV’s entitlement to the $1m should
                    depend on its success in establishing its counterclaim. On the present facts,
                    the Arbitrator had dismissed that counterclaim on the basis that cl 17.0 of
                    the LA does not provide for liquidated damages. It does not lie in ENJV’s
                    mouth now to claim that even though it had <em>failed</em>
                    in establishing its counterclaim, it should nevertheless be entitled to retain
                    the $1m when that was never its stated case before the Arbitrator. Since its
                    claim to the $1m was dismissed, it should not be entitled to retain that sum of
                    money. Further, I have held in OS 226/2009 (see [24] – [40] of that
                    judgment) that the Arbitrator did not render a complete decision when he
                    indicated that although ENJV had failed to establish STEC’s liability for
                    its counterclaim, this issue could be deferred to another forum or tribunal. In
                    my judgment there, I stated (at [39]) that the Arbitrator should have dismissed
                    the counterclaim. Once the counterclaim is dismissed in full, there would be no
                    basis at all for any retention of the $1m by ENJV. The Arbitrator had not erred
                    in omitting to direct that STEC was required to pay $1m to ENJV and that
                    therefore ENJV could retain the $1m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The scheme of arrangement</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     The questions posed by ENJV in relation to the
                    scheme of arrangement are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Arbitrator erred in
                        failing to give effect to the Scheme and in particular to clause 4.1.3
                        of the Scheme which provides that no creditor shall commence or continue any
                        proceedings against Econ Piling for the adjudication of any claim for
                        recovery of debt or damages by civil action or arbitration without the
                        consent of Econ Piling;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether the compromise of the partnership debts and
                        liabilities of Econ Piling under the terms of the Scheme and in particular
                        cl 9.2 thereof also discharged the partners of Econ Piling in respect
                        of those debts and liabilities;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether any issues arising out of the Scheme would only
                        affect the enforcement of the award; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_74-p2_d"></a>(d)     In any event, whether the Arbitrator
                        misconducted himself in not according to ENJV the opportunity to make oral
                        submissions in respect of ENJV’s applications to stay or dismiss the
                        arbitration claim against Econ Piling.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Material facts relating to the Scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     On 15 March 2004, by a court order, Econ
                    Piling was placed under judicial management. On 15 September 2004, the
                    judicial manager proposed the Scheme to the creditors of Econ Piling. Under the
                    Scheme, an investor would purchase all the shares in Econ Piling for $1, and
                    inject a sum of $350,000 into the pool of assets comprising all the assets of
                    the company, which would then be set aside for distribution to the scheme
                    creditors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     Under cl 1.2 of the Scheme,
                    “Creditors” are defined as “[a]ll creditors of the Company
                        [<em>ie</em> Econ Piling], whether secured,
                    preferential, contingent or unsecured, to whom a liability is owed” by
                    Econ Piling arising out of any transaction entered into, or actor or omission of
                    Econ Piling and/or persons, carried out or which took place before the Fixed
                    Date. The “Fixed Date” is 16 September 2004 (under
                    cl 1.2).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     Clause 4 of the Scheme provides for a
                    moratorium and extinguishment of all claims. Under cl 4.13, no Creditor
                    shall take any step to commence or continue any proceedings against Econ Piling
                    for the adjudication of any claim or alleged claim including proceedings for the
                    recovery of debt or damages by civil action or arbitration. Pursuant to
                    cl 9.2, any Creditor who fails to lodge a proof of debt within the
                    stipulated time period shall not be entitled to participate in the payment under
                    the Scheme and any claim by such a Creditor shall be extinguished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     The Scheme was approved by the court on
                    25 October 2004.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Relying on the Scheme, ENJV submitted that as
                    STEC had not lodged a proof of debt against Econ Piling, STEC had thereby
                    discharged Econ Piling from all its liabilities to STEC since any claim STEC had
                    against Econ Piling had been extinguished pursuant to cl 9.2 of the Scheme
                    for failure to lodge a proof of debt. This argument is premised on the further
                    propositions that Econ Piling and NCCI were jointly and not severally liable to
                    STEC and that discharge of one partner from its liabilities would result in a
                    discharge of the partnership from its liabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">STEC’s preliminary objection</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     STEC submitted that ENJV was not entitled to
                    raise the questions of law relating to the Scheme in its appeal against the
                    Partial Award. It argued that these contentions had already been determined by
                    the Arbitrator in the Interim Award dated 29 September 2008
                        (“2<sup>nd</sup> Interim
                Award”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     What had happened was that by a letter dated
                    28 May 2008 (more than a year after completion of the hearing of the
                    arbitration), ENJV made an application to the Arbitrator for (a) dismissal of
                    the arbitration against Econ Piling and (b) a reference of a point of law to a
                    court for a decision under s 45 of the Act. The Arbitrator dismissed this
                    application by the 2<sup>nd</sup> Interim Award. His finding in
                    para 63 thereof was that ENJV had failed to satisfy him that there was a
                    question of law on which he should grant permission to ENJV under s 45 of
                    the Act. The Arbitrator was careful to reserve his position to decide the
                    issues. In para 64 he held:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">64.    Nothing in this interim award should be construed
                            as conclusive findings or rulings of fact or law in the arbitration or
                            for any future award or the final award, and any findings or rulings
                            herein are confined to and relevant for the application under section 45
                            of the Arbitration [<em>sic</em>] only. I reserve
                            my jurisdiction to make the appropriate findings and rulings in the
                            final award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     It is clear that the Arbitrator did not make
                    any finding in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Interim Award on the
                    substantive questions of law which ENJV now seeks to raise as emanating from the
                    Partial Award. Accordingly, STEC’s preliminary objection has no
                    merit.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Material findings in the Partial Award</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     The Arbitrator found that the events and the
                    proceedings relating to the Scheme were extraneous to the arbitration and were
                    only brought to his attention at the stage of closing submissions. Therefore, he
                    rejected ENJV’s arguments relating to the Scheme. He was also not
                    persuaded that ENJV’s liability should be discharged on the basis of
                    STEC’s failure to lodge a proof of debt, concluding that ENJV had failed
                    to demonstrate that its liability to STEC had been discharged.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Extinguishment of STEC’s claims against Econ Piling</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     It would be recalled that the Sub-Contract
                    works had commenced in 2003 and were scheduled for completion on
                    31 December 2004. The events relating to Econ Piling’s legal status
                    therefore took place during the course of the Sub-Contract works. However, ENJV
                    did not notify STEC either of the judicial management or of the court approval
                    of the Scheme on 25 October 2005. Instead, the Sub-Contract proceeded as if
                    the Scheme had not been put in place and Econ Piling had not been placed under
                    judicial management.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     It is important to note that the Scheme was
                    never pleaded nor was any evidence relating to it placed before the Arbitrator.
                    It was also never mentioned at any of the arbitral hearings. The Scheme was in
                    force throughout the arbitration proceedings. Yet, instead of making it clear
                    that STEC’s claims against it (or at least against Econ Piling) had been
                    extinguished, ENJV defended the arbitration vigorously and even advanced its own
                    counterclaims against STEC with utmost conviction without any mention of the
                    Scheme. Since ENJV had prosecuted the arbitration without objection, Econ Piling
                    as a partner in the ENJV partnership, must be deemed to have waived any right to
                    rely on cl 4.1.3 of the Scheme which prohibited any creditor of Econ Piling
                    from commencing arbitration proceedings without its consent. It could also be
                    argued that ENJV is estopped from now raising the Scheme at all since its
                    failure to raise the Scheme as a defence caused STEC to conduct its claim in the
                    arbitration and incur expense on the basis that there was no legal impediment to
                    the proceedings whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     In these circumstances, I consider that the
                    Arbitrator had acted entirely correctly in rejecting ENJV’s arguments
                    based on the Scheme and instead deciding the claims and counterclaims based on
                    the pleadings and the evidence that had been presented in the arbitration. It is
                    difficult to see what else the Arbitrator could have done when ENJV had not
                    pleaded the Scheme as a defence and, in any case, it was not clear cut from the
                    legal point of view what impact the existence of the Scheme had on either Econ
                    Piling’s or NCCI’s liability as a member of the joint venture. Since
                    the Sub-Contract work was done both before and after the Scheme came into
                    effect, there was also an issue as to whether ENJV’s liabilities to STEC
                    had arisen before the Fixed Date and, if so, to what extent. Indeed, before the
                    Arbitrator STEC had argued that its claims had not crystallised when the Scheme
                    came into force and therefore it was not a “Creditor” within the
                    meaning of that term in the Scheme. These were matters that would have been
                    explored in full detail, both factually and legally, had the necessary pleadings
                    been filed. In their absence, the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to subsequently
                    consider these points.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Even if under the Scheme STEC’s claims
                    against Econ Piling were extinguished for failure to lodge a proof of debt, in
                    my judgment, STEC’s claims against NCCI, the other joint debtor, were not
                    so extinguished. During oral argument, I expressed my view to counsel that NCCI
                    which was jointly liable with Econ Piling as a partner of ENJV could not benefit
                    from the Scheme <em>ie</em>, any release of Econ
                    Piling’s liability to STEC arising because of the implementation of the
                    Scheme could not <em>ipso facto</em> release NCCI from its
                    joint liability. Subsequent to the hearing, this view of the law was endorsed in
                    another case involving Econ Piling and the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In <em>Econ Piling Pte Ltd and
                        another v Sambo E&amp;C Pte Ltd and another matter</em>
                    [2010] SGHC 120, Steven Chong JC dealt with the question whether NCCI,
                    the partner of Econ Piling at the material time, was also released by compromise
                    under the Scheme if Econ Piling was released by such compromise. Chong JC held
                    that the joint debts and liabilities of Econ Piling as a partner in any joint
                    venture, including ENJV, were compromised or settled in accordance with the
                    terms of the Scheme in the sense that “<em>no claim can be
                        brought against [Econ Piling] in respect of such joint debts and
                        liabilities</em>” (at [16]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Chong JC then went on to deal with <em>NCCI’s</em> liabilities to ENJV’s debtors. After
                    examining the authorities, Chong JC observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_a"></a>(a)     A scheme of arrangement and its
                        attendant legal consequences owe their efficacy entirely to the order of
                        court that sanctioned it. A scheme of arrangement amounts to a release by
                        operation of law (at [28]); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_89-p2_b"></a>(b)     The courts had consistently recognised that a release by
                        operation of law did not release the other joint or co-debtors from their
                        liabilities (at [26]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As there was no express provision
                    under the Scheme that had released NCCI from its joint liabilities to the
                    creditor, the judge held that NCCI was not released from its joint liabilities;
                    such release would mean that NCCI would enjoy an unexpected windfall in being
                    released from its joint liability to ENJV’s creditors, a consequence which
                    was neither contemplated nor intended under the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     I entirely agree with the views expressed by
                    Chong JC. Even if STEC’s claims (or part thereof) against Econ Piling were
                    extinguished owing to the compromise effected by the Scheme, that did not lead
                    to the extinguishment of STEC’s claims against NCCI as that would result
                    in a windfall accruing to NCCI and great injustice and prejudice to
                STEC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     As a result, I hold that the Arbitrator did
                    not err in omitting to give effect to the Scheme in the Partial Award. Following
                    from that, the question whether the Arbitrator erred in law in holding that
                    issues arising in respect of the Scheme would only affect the enforcement of the
                    award must also be answered in the negative. Since the issues arising out of the
                    Scheme were not strictly relevant to the arbitration proceedings, those issues
                    should go towards enforcement of the award. If Econ Piling successfully
                    maintains its current position that STEC has no claim against it in respect of
                    Econ Piling’s joint liabilities, then STEC can look to NCCI as the joint
                    debtor for enforcement of the award. It also follows that the Arbitrator did not
                    misconduct himself when he did not accord ENJV the opportunity to make oral
                    submissions in support of its application for the dismissal or stay of the
                    arbitration proceedings due to the existence of the Scheme.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Question relating to costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     The question of law posed by ENJV in this
                    regard is whether the Arbitrator erred in law when he, in considering the costs
                    of and occasioned by STEC’s amendment to its pleadings, failed to take
                    into account:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_a"></a>(a)     ENJV’s costs incurred and
                        thrown away by STEC’s abandonment of legal and factual issues;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_92-p2_b"></a>(b)     ENJV’s costs incurred in presenting the application for costs before
                        the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     While the parties were in the midst of
                    preparing for the arbitration hearings which were scheduled to commence on
                    31 July 2006, STEC changed its solicitors. On 13 July 2006, STEC was
                    given leave by the Arbitrator to amend its pleadings and fresh timelines were
                    given for the hearings. On 15 September 2006, STEC filed and served its
                    Final Statement of Claimant’s Case which necessitated consequential
                    amendments to both parties’ pleadings. Substantial amendments were made by
                    ENJV because STEC had abandoned many issues during the process of reformulating
                    its pleadings. The question of liability for and quantum of costs payable as a
                    result of STEC’s amendment of its pleadings were addressed in the
                    parties’ closing submissions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     ENJV sought costs as follows:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$45,000, being the costs incurred in making
                            consequential amendments to ENJV’s pleadings arising out of
                            STEC’s amendments to its pleadings;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$60,000, being the costs incurred and thrown away
                            by STEC’s abandonment of the factual and legal issues when it
                            reformulated its pleadings; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">$4,000, being the costs incurred in having to

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     The Arbitrator dealt with ENJV’s
                    application for costs at paras 564 to 573 of the Partial Award. The more
                    relevant paras for present purposes are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">564.  By this
                            application, ENJV seeks the following order:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“That the Claimants pay the Respondents the costs of and
                            occasioned by the amendment of the Claimants’ pleadings forthwith
                            and in any event including costs incurred by ENJV in the subsequent
                            consequential amendment of all ENJV’s pleadings.”</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">568.  ENJV also submits [<em>sic</em>] the quantum of costs payable at paragraphs 3719 to
                            3731 of the Respondents’ 1<sup>st</sup>
                            Submission. According to ENJV, a reasonable sum reflecting the volume of
                            work carried out by ENJV’s solicitors in having to effect the
                            consequential amendments to ENJV’s pleadings arising from
                            STEC’s amendments of its pleadings is S$45,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">572.  Having considered the parties’ submissions,
                            I am incline [<em>sic</em>] to agree with ENJV that
                            there were significant amendments to STEC’s pleading. I do not
                            accept STEC’s contention that STEC’s claims have
                            “remained substantially similar to those contained in the
                            original form.” The amended pleading did have the merit of
                            bringing the issues into sharper focus and were probably an improvement
                            over the original pleading. Nonetheless, this takes away nothing from
                            the fact that the amendments entail considerable work as a
                            consequence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">573.  Overall, while I accept ENJV’s point that
                            much work was done by them as a result of the amendments, I do not think
                            but I do not think [<em>sic</em>] they are entitled
                            to the S$45,000 but would award and direct that STEC pays ENJV the sum
                            of S$12,000.00 which I hereby tax and fix as the costs payable for the
                            amendments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     It would be noted from the above that the
                    Arbitrator did not comment on ENJV’s claims for (a) $60,000 for costs
                    thrown away by reason of STEC’s abandonment of issues and (b) $4,000 for
                    costs incurred in making the application for costs. ENJV’s point before me
                    was that these were separate heads of claim in relation to costs and the
                    Arbitrator erred in not considering them separately. STEC’s rebuttal was
                    two-fold. On the one hand, it contended that the issue was clearly one of
                    quantum and not of principle: the Arbitrator had recognised that ENJV was
                    entitled to costs and had fixed those costs at $12,000, thus exercising his
                    discretion in respect of quantum. On the other, STEC argued that at the most the
                    Arbitrator had made an error of law and such an error could not be appealed
                    against.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     I do not agree with STEC’s contention
                    that the Arbitrator’s decision was only in relation to quantum and that it
                    should be interpreted as his deciding that for all three heads of costs claimed
                    ENJV should be awarded $12,000. It is plain from the paragraphs of the Partial
                    Award that I have quoted at <a href="#p1_95">[95]</a> above that
                    the Arbitrator was dealing only with the costs incurred in relation to the
                    amendments that had to be made by ENJV to meet STEC’s reformulated claims.
                    The Arbitrator did not consider the work that had been rendered redundant by
                    reason of the change in the pleadings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     As regards the second contention, that whilst
                    there may have been an error of law on the part of the Arbitrator such error did
                    not entitle ENJV to appeal because no question of law arose, I must first
                    consider whether there was such error of law.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In Michael O’ Reilly, <em>Costs in Arbitration Proceedings</em> (LLP Professional Publishing,
                        2<sup>nd</sup> Ed, 1997), the author observes (at
                    para 4.4.3):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A party who seeks to amend his case will normally be allowed to do so
                        “on the usual terms”, namely that <em>the costs
                            incurred and thrown away by the amendment and the costs of any
                            consequential amendment are to be the other party’s in any
                            event</em>. In some situations, however, the arbitrator may
                        adjudge that the amendment was made necessary by some action on the part of
                        the opposing party, in which case a different costs order may be made.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In relation to costs “thrown
                    away”, the authors of <em>Singapore Court Practice
                        2009</em> state, at para 59/1/4:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">‘Costs thrown away’ refers to the specific situation in which
                        costs have been wasted by a party. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The order is also appropriate when costs have been occasioned by
                        an amendment (see <em>State of Perak v PRALMM Muthukaruppan
                            Chettiar</em> [1938] MLJ 247) or adjournment. …
                        The important question of exactly what costs are recoverable as costs thrown
                        away by reason of an adjournment (sometimes referred to as ‘costs of
                        the day’) was considered in <em>Choo Ah Kiat v Ang Kim
                            Hock</em> [1983] 2 MLJ xciv, which concerned the
                        adjournment of a trial at the behest of the plaintiff. The deputy registrar
                        accepted the principle that ‘costs thrown away’ by an
                        adjournment refer to ‘costs that have been incurred and which must be
                        incurred over again’, and therefore have been thrown away in
                        consequence of the adjournment (at xcv).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In <em>Lim Hong Seng v East
                        Coast Medicare Centre Pte Ltd</em> [1994] 3 SLR(R) 680, I
                    ordered costs thrown away in favour of a defendant who had put up a counterclaim
                    that had to be abandoned in the light of the plaintiff’s discovery of a
                    certain fact, stating (at [76]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, the defendants are entitled to the costs of the amendment
                        to para 8 of the statement of claim and the abandonment of their
                        counterclaim. It was not for the defendants to tell the plaintiff how to run
                        his case. He might very well have initially omitted to rely on the express
                        right of way after carefully considering the options open to him. The
                        defendants were not to know that this omission resulted from ignorance
                        rather than a considered strategy. <em>Once the plaintiff
                            posed his case in a certain manner the defendants were entitled to take
                            all courses open to them to meet it including the formulation of the
                            counterclaim. They then had to drop the counterclaim because of the
                            plaintiff’s belated discovery of the true position</em>.
                            <em>The costs they had incurred were thrown away by
                            reason of the plaintiff’s change in direction. The defendants are
                            entitled to recover those costs</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    From the above discussions on the law, it
                    can be seen that there are at least two types of costs that may be incurred by a
                    party to litigation when the other party thereto amends his case: costs incurred
                    by the amendment and costs thrown away by reason of the amendment. The
                    Arbitrator therefore plainly erred when he only considered the claim for costs
                    incurred by the amendment and did not consider that for costs thrown away. He
                    was also in error when he omitted to consider whether ENJV was entitled to ask
                    separately for costs in respect of its application for costs. The issue here is
                    whether these errors resulted in any question of law that could be appealed
                    on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    In <em>Northern Elevator
                        Manufacturing Sdn Bhd v United Engineers (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2004] 2 SLR(R) 494 (“<em>Northern
                        Elevator</em>”) the Court of Appeal observed (at [19]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[A] “question of law” must necessarily be a finding of law
                        which the parties dispute, that requires the guidance of the court to
                        resolve. When an arbitrator does not apply a principle of law correctly,
                        that failure is a mere “error of law” (but more explicitly, an
                        erroneous application of law) which does not entitle an aggrieved party to
                        appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">STEC’s submission in essence was that the Arbitrator’s
                    failure to deal with the other two claims for costs was an error of law which
                    did not entitle ENJV to appeal. It argued that the court cannot set aside an
                    award because there is an error of law on the face of the record. That argument
                    was based on a principle enshrined in earlier versions of the Act. In
                    s 28(1) of the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 1985 Rev Ed) it was expressly
                    provided that the court did not have jurisdiction to set aside or remit an award
                    on the ground of errors of fact or law on the face of the record. The old
                    s 28(1) has no equivalent in the presently prevailing version of the Act.
                    This does not mean, however, that the court can allow an appeal because the
                    Arbitrator has committed an error in respect of established law. <em>Northern Elevator</em> is binding on me and it is also in
                    line with current judicial philosophy that the courts should not exercise a
                    tight supervisory power over arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Accordingly, I agree with STEC’s
                    submission that ENJV was not entitled to rely on the Arbitrator’s failure
                    to deal with parts of their costs application to formulate questions of law to
                    be considered on appeal. The error of the Arbitrator did not give rise to a
                    right of appeal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">ENJV’s claim for contra charges</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The question of law posed here was whether
                    the Arbitrator had erred in law in dismissing all the heads of contra charges
                    under Group 9 of ENJV’s claim for contra charges without dealing with the
                    merits when he had found that only one head of claim should be
                    disallowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    ENJV counterclaimed for costs incurred in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    In its closing submissions, STEC disputed
                    liability for all the claims by ENJV under Group 9 of the Contra Charges. In the
                    Partial Award, the Arbitrator dismissed the entire claim in relation to Group 9,
                    but only gave reasons for dismissing the claims in respect of the flatbed
                    coupling and the braked flatcars. He had omitted to mention his reasons, if any,
                    for dismissing the claims in respect of the other items in Group 9, totalling
                    $14,787.10.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Section 50(4) of the Act is relevant to this
                    question. It provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    If on an
                            application or appeal it appears to the Court that the award

<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    does not set out the arbitral tribunal’s

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the Court may order the arbitral tribunal to state the reasons for its

<p class="Judg-1">It is impossible for me to know whether the Arbitrator’s reasons
                    for dismissing the claims were legal or factual since he did not give his
                    reasons for the same. Therefore I must order the Arbitrator to explain his
                    reasons for his decision before I can decide whether there is any question of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    The question on this issue is whether the
                    Arbitrator erred in law in holding that STEC’s clarification request dated
                    14 January 2009 (“the Clarification Request”) was made under
                        s 43(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Act and not under
                        s 43(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The Partial Award was rendered on
                    29 December 2008. STEC’s solicitors wrote to the Arbitrator on
                    14 January 2009 seeking “clarification on various points arising
                    from the Partial Award” and inviting the Arbitrator to “correct
                    the Partial Award” on the following points, if necessary:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">A.</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Double-accounting in arriving at “152 days
                            of delay”;</span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    By a letter dated 16 January 2009, ENJV
                    contended that the Clarification Request was made under s 43(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Act and thus required its consent which had
                    not been given. On 19 January 2009, STEC’s solicitors wrote to the
                    Arbitrator stating that as the Clarification Request related to computational
                    errors it was made pursuant to s 43(1)(<em>a</em>) and
                    thus ENJV’s consent was not required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    In the Correction Award, the Arbitrator
                    expressly agreed with STEC’s position and stated that he published the
                    Correction Award “to correct error [<em>sic</em>] in
                    computation and typographical errors in the Partial Award” (at
                    para 8 of the Correction Award), <em>ie</em>, pursuant
                    to his power under s 43(1)(<em>a</em>), not (<em>b</em>).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Section 43(1) of the Arbitration Act
                    provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-Heading1">
<b>Correction or interpretation of
                            award and additional award</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>43</b>. —(1) A party may, within 30 days of the
                        receipt of the award, unless another period of time has been agreed upon by
                        the parties —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)   upon notice to the other parties, request the
                            arbitral tribunal to correct in the award <em>any error
                                in computation, any clerical or typographical error, or other error

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b)   upon notice to the other parties, request the
                            arbitral tribunal to give an interpretation of a specific point or part

                                the other parties</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Relatedly, r 34 of the SIAC Domestic Rules provides for
                    correction of awards as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-Heading1"><b>Rule 34   </b>
<b>Correction of Awards</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34.1  A party may, <em>within 14 days of
                                receipt of the award</em>, by notice served on the other party
                            and the Tribunal and filed with the Registrar, request the Tribunal to
                            correct in the award any error in computation, any clerical or
                            typographical error or any error of a similar nature. If the Tribunal
                            considers the request to be justified, it makes the correction within 14
                            days of receipt of the request.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34.2  The Tribunal may correct any error of the type
                            referred to in Rule 34.1 on its own initiative within 28 days of the
                            date of the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">34.3 Any correction made under Rule 34.1 or 34.2 is to be set out in a
                        separate correction award. The correction award forms, and takes effect as,
                        part of the main award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The Clarification Request was mainly aimed
                    at pointing out double-counting of the 84 days of delay in respect of which the
                    Arbitrator had found that STEC had waived its entitlement to claim extension of
                    time.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Considering the Clarification Request, the
                    Arbitrator noted that there could have been some confusion arising from
                    STEC’s claim for extension of time in the alternative. STEC’s main
                    claim for extension of time was 156 days, but it also pleaded 112 days as the
                    alternative claim. At para 16 of the Correction Award, he reasoned
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… The 84 days claimed for Delaying Event No 1 [<em>ie</em>, late hand over of the launch shaft sites] was a
                        component of the original 156 days claimed (see paragraph 163, Partial
                        Award), not the 112 days’ alternative (which was the duration that the
                        experts have agreed to and which I had established as the material
                        duration). However, when STEC waived the 84 days for Delaying Event No 1 by
                        the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA, the waiver must apply to the 112 days
                        duration established, even though in terms of actual duration, there can
                        only be 68 days remaining after accounting for the 44 days of extension of
                        time granted. Nonetheless, I accept that the problem is essentially
                        computational. No fresh finding or a reversal of any finding of fact is
                        required.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As a result, he found that STEC’s liability for delayed
                    completion to the Sub-Contract works should be 68 days. The other
                    uncontroversial error in the Partial Award that he corrected was the date from
                    which interest was to be paid by ENJV. Instead of taking that date as
                    20 May 2005, the date of STEC’s Notice of Intention for Arbitration
                    and Notice to Appoint Arbitrator, he had taken that date to be 2 August
                    2005, the date on which parties confirmed his appointment as the Arbitrator. In
                    the Correction Award, he replaced references to 2 August 2005 with
                    20 May 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    In <em>The Review of
                        Arbitration Laws – Final Report</em> (Law Reform and Revision
                    Division, Attorney-General’s Chambers, 2001), it is explained that
                    s 43(1) of the Arbitration Act was modelled after Article 33 of the
                    UNCITRAL Model Law on Arbitration. The report also explained the arbitral
                    tribunal’s power to correct an award as follows (at
                    paras 2.32.1—2.32.2):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.32.1    … The power to correct an award relates
                            to both clerical mistakes and such other statements or mis-statements
                            made which were never intended by the tribunal. <em>Such
                                errors would include mistakes arising out of miscalculations, use of
                                wrong data in calculations, omission of data in calculations, and
                                clerical or typographical errors made in the course of typing or
                                drafting the award</em>. Such mistakes or omissions need not
                            have been directly attributable to the tribunal. However, mistakes or
                            errors of judgment, whether of law or fact cannot be corrected by the
                            invocation of this rule. Corrections may be made on the tribunal’s
                            own initiative or at the request made by any of the parties to the
                            tribunal within 30 days of the date of the award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">2.32.2    Apart from the correction of errors, [section]
                            43 would also give to the tribunal the power on the application of a
                            party to give an interpretation or clarification of the award or part of
                            the award. The interpretation or clarification when made would form part
                            of the original award. In relation to claims made but omitted from the
                            decisions in the award the tribunal may also make an additional award on
                            claims presented in the arbitral proceedings but omitted from the award.
                            Again these powers are not intended to permit the tribunal to re-visit
                            issues canvassed and decided or to re-consider any part of the decisions
                            consciously made.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    The comments in the report fortify my
                    decision that the Clarification Request by STEC was a request made under
                        s 43(1)(<em>a</em>) as the errors corrected were
                    computational and clerical in nature. The errors that the Arbitrator corrected
                    in the Partial Award arose out of “miscalculations, use of wrong data in
                    calculations, omission of data in calculations”. In calculating the total
                    number of days of delay for which STEC should be held liable, he had omitted to
                    factor in the 84 days’ waiver by STEC. His use of 2 August 2005 as
                    the date from which interest should be calculated was a “clerical
                    error” as he had mistakenly typed in the date of his confirmation as
                    Arbitrator instead of the date on which STEC had given Notice to Appoint
                    Arbitrator, which was the date he had intended to type. The Correction Award did
                    not provide any interpretation or clarification of his findings in the Partial
                    Award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    Accordingly there was no error in the
                    Arbitrator’s decision that STEC’s clarification request was made
                    under s 43(1)(a) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    In view of the answers given above to the
                    questions posed by ENJV, the Partial Award must be remitted to the Arbitrator
                    for him to reconsider the date of substantial completion of the Sub-Contract
                    works. He must also provide his reasons for dismissing the entire claim
                    encompassed in Group 9 of the contra charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    As ENJV has been only partially successful
                    in its appeal, I will hear the parties on costs.</p>
