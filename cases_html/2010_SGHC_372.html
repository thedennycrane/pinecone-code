        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff, EC-Asia International Ltd
                    (“the company”), made an application for pre-action discovery
                    under Order 24 Rule 6 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,
                    2006 Rev Ed) from the defendant, PricewaterhouseCoopers. The application
                    was dismissed by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”). The company
                    appealed against the dismissal, and I allowed the appeal and granted the
                    application. The defendant now appeals against my decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff was a company registered under the
                    Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) in 1993. Ang Ah Peng (also known
                    as Kelvin Ang) (“Kelvin Ang”) was the founder and managing
                    director of the plaintiff. The defendant was the statutory auditor of the
                    company from the Financial Year ended 30 June 2000 to the Financial Year
                    ended 30 June 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In the initial years the company appeared to be
                    doing well. In 2004, it was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (“the
                    ASX”) but its fortunes changed. Subsequently it went into voluntary
                    liquidation and was delisted from the ASX. On 18 May 2007, Neo Ban Chuan
                    (“the Liquidator”) was appointed with two others as liquidators,
                    but his co-liquidators subsequently left, and he continued as the sole
                    liquidator. He issued his report (the “Liquidator’s Report”)
                    on 29 July 2008 which set out the facts leading up to the collapse of the
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The declared activities of the company</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The stated business of the company was the
                    recycling of memory chips that do not meet the data specification of major
                    memory chip manufacturers (“rejected chips”). These chips were
                    recycled by the company, re-branded with its brand names, and sold to other
                    companies to be used in their products.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The company ostensibly carried on its business
                    by:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">purchasing rejected chips from chip manufacturers
                            upon immediate payment of the purchase price;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">paying for the purchases by drawing on trade
                            financing facilities granted to it by banks;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">recycling, rebranding and selling the recycled
                            chips to third party purchasers on credit terms; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">factoring the accounts receivable from its
                            purchasers and using the monies obtained from the factoring to repay the
                            banks and fund operations.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The investigations</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In 2006/2007, the company experienced financial
                    difficulties and one creditor bank issued a letter of demand. On 6 March 2007,
                    the board of directors of the company appointed KPMG Business Advisory Pte Ltd
                    (“KPMG”) to undertake an independent financial review of the
                    company with a view to making proposals to the company’s creditors to
                    restructure the company’s debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       KMPG conducted a stock check of the
                    company’s inventories in Singapore and Hong Kong and discovered that the
                    company purchased a substantial proportion of its rejected chips from three Hong
                    Kong companies, namely Landwide Tech Ltd (“Landwide”), Tec-Hill
                    Semiconductor Ltd (“Tec-Hill”) and Max Luck International Trading
                    Ltd.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       KPMG further discovered that a substantial
                    portion of the company’s sales of reprocessed and recycled chips was made
                    to Landwide, Tec-Hill and another company, Chi Tat Enterprise Company
                    (“Chi Tat”). KPMG concluded that the sales and purchases of the
                    company’s stocks were not genuine transactions and that much of the
                    company’s operations consisted actually of passing the same stocks between
                    Singapore and Hong Kong with the associated paper trail but without any actual
                    re-processing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       When KPMG presented its findings to the
                    company’s creditors on 13 April 2007, Kelvin Ang admitted that the
                    company’s accounts receivables of which over 90% were attributed to
                    Landwide, Tec-Hill and Chi Tat were not in fact collectable and that the stocks
                    reflected in its books had little or no value. He further admitted that he had
                    for seven years been falsifying invoices to create the appearance of genuine
                    sales and purchases in order to deceive the company’s creditors and obtain
                    credit facilities from them. Kelvin Ang was eventually charged and convicted for
                    his fraudulent activities in respect of these sham transactions: see <em>Public Prosecutor v Ang Ah Peng</em> [2009] SGDC
                94.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     There were also other matters of interest
                    relating to the affairs of the company:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_i"></a>(i)     
            <b><em>Conflict of
                            Interests of Lo Tak Fu</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2">Lo Tak Fu
                        (“Lo”) was a director of the company and also the majority
                        shareholder of Landwide. The Liquidator stated in the Liquidator’s
                        Report that it was reasonable to assume that the defendant knew or ought to
                        have known of Lo’s majority interest in Landwide and that knowledge
                        would indicate an increased audit risk which warranted more intensive audit
                        procedures in relation to obtaining audit evidence for the company’s
                        dealings with Landwide.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_10-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     
            <b><em>The Poison Pen
                        Letter</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-2">In 2003, the company had applied to be listed
                        on the Singapore Stock Exchange (“SGX”). On the last day of
                        the period offer for its listing on the SGX, the Monetary Authority of
                        Singapore (“MAS”) issued an interim stop order after the SGX
                        and MAS received a letter on 22 May 2003 (“the Poison Pen
                        Letter”) from a “former staff” of the company which
                        alleged that:</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_ii-p3_a"></a>(a)       two named former employees
                            who had both been convicted of dealing in stolen goods, were the real
                            directing minds of the company;</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_ii-p3_b"></a>(b)       the company had violated intellectual property
                            rights by purchasing unbranded blank chips and selling them under
                            branded names like “Samsung”, “Hynix” or
                            “Infineon”; and</p>
<p class="Judg-3"><a id="p1_10-p2_ii-p3_c"></a>(c)       the company was inflating in the accounts of
                            profits from a customer in Hong Kong declaring higher buying
                            price.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The directors of the company had instructed a
                        law corporation to conduct an investigation. The investigation which was
                        confined to the first allegation but not the second and third allegations
                        concluded that neither of the two named persons was in control of the
                        company. No independent investigation was conducted into the second and
                        third allegations. The independent directors stated in the prospectus for
                        the subsequent listing on the ASX that, at the time of the failed attempt of
                        listing on SGX, they had made their own enquiries into each of the
                        allegations contained in the Poison Pen Letter and had found that there were
                        no basis for the allegations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Liquidator was of the view that if the
                    second and third allegations in the Poison Pen Letter were true, the company
                    would have engaged in fraudulent practices in deceiving its customers and the
                    users of the chips and that the defendant, which was on the distribution list of
                    the Poison Pen Letter should be cautious that fraud could be involved, and plan
                    its audit procedures accordingly.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Liquidator further stated the defendant
                    may be liable for conducting its audit of the company negligently, thereby
                    allowing the perpetration of the fraud by Kelvin Ang, and he intended to
                    continue investigating the defendant’s conduct of the audit during the
                    period of their engagement.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Correspondence leading to the pre-action discovery
                application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On 1 February 2008, the company, through
                    their solicitors at that time, Shook Lin &amp; Bok LLP
                    (“SL&amp;B”), wrote two letters to the defendant, an open letter
                    and a “Without Prejudice” letter. Only the open letter was
                    produced during the application, and it read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We act for the Liquidator of the Company, ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We understand that you were the statutory auditors for the Company for
                        Financial Years ended 30 June 2001 to 30 June 2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As you may be aware, on 10 May 2007, the Liquidator of the Company
                        commenced an action in the High Court against the former Managing Director
                        of the Company, Mr Kelvin Ang Ah Peng (“Kelvin Ang”) for,
                            <em>inter alia</em>, breach of fiduciary and
                        statutory duty on the basis of Mr Kelvin Ang’s fraudulent conduct
                        which resulted in losses to the Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On 21 June 2007, the Company obtained interlocutory judgment against Mr
                        Kelvin Ang with damages to be assessed. Final judgment was entered against
                        Mr Kelvin Ang on 19 December 2007 for the sum of US$25,981,338 on the basis
                        of admissions made in his letter to the Liquidator dated 10 December 2007
                        wherein Mr Kelvin Ang admitted, <em>inter alia</em>,
                        that his fraudulent conduct had caused loss and damage to the
                        Company.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our client’s investigations into the affairs of the Company have
                        shown that <em>the Company has a potential claim against
                            you</em> in respect of, inter alia, your failure to exercise
                        reasonable skill, care and diligence as statutory auditors which resulted in
                        the fraudulent conduct of Mr Kelvin Ang going undetected.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For the avoidance of doubt, all our client’s rights and the rights
                        of the Company are expressly reserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The “Without Prejudice” letter was not produced at the
                    hearing of the application, but was produced during the appeal hearing before me
                    and I will refer to it later on.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     On 21 August 2008, SL&amp;B wrote to the
                    defendant to request for:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     all letters and other documents
                        setting out the terms of engagement governing the defendant’s
                        engagement as the statutory auditors of the company;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     the company’s documents, notes,
                        memoranda, correspondence and/or copies thereof which were supplied to the
                        defendant in the course of their engagement for the purposes of preparing
                        the accounts of the company;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     the audit and other working papers produced and/or
                        generated by the defendant in the course of and/or as a result of their

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     other documents in the possession,

                        or property of the company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In response to the request,
                    the defendant furnished the requested documents with the exception of the audit
                    papers and working papers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     No further action was taken for a while, till
                    28 May 2009 when the company’s new solicitors, Bih Li &amp; Lee wrote
                    to the solicitors for the defendant, Rajah &amp; Tann LLP
                    (“R&amp;T”) and renewed its request for the audit papers and
                    working papers. This request was again rejected. In its reply dated 2 July
                    2009 R&amp;T stated, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>

                            view that <em>the Defendants’ audit procedures need
                                to be scrutinized carefully</em> and, although <em>I have not come to a firm conclusion</em> on this,

                            two (2) main areas in which fraud was perpetrated. As auditors, audit
                            programmes on stocks (also referred to as inventories) and accounts
                            receivable need to achieve six (6) objectives, namely, completeness,

                            particular, <em>if fraud is assessed to be a risk
                                factor</em>, additional audit procedures are usually
                            conducted. ... One of the areas that will have to be considered is

                            papers will be needed for such a review to be fair and

                        issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The Necessity issue arose from O 24

<p class="Judg-1">The defendant made three points: firstly, that the plaintiff by its
                    own conduct had already taken a view that it had a viable claim; secondly, that
                    the plaintiff was able to initiate a case without the desired information, and
                    thirdly, that the plaintiff had not shown that the audit papers and working
                    papers were necessary.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On the Time Limitation issue, the defendant
                    submitted that even taking the date of the filing of the application, 8

                    statements for the periods preceding 30 June 2003 (which counsel referred
                    to as the “Pre 2004 Audits”) any action for negligent audit in
                    respect of the Pre 2004 Audits would be outside the six-year limitation period
                    prescribed by s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev
                    Ed).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The AR’s decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The AR only dealt with the Necessity issue. In
                    his brief grounds of decision he referred to the main decisions from our courts
                    on pre-action discovery, namely <em>Bayerische Hypo-und
                        Vereinsbank AG v Asia Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em>
                    [2004] 4 SLR(R) 39 and <em>Kuah Koh Kim v Ernst &amp;
                        Young</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 485, and noted that they affirmed
                    that discovery would not be ordered if an applicant already knew that he had a
                    viable claim and was able to plead his case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Applying the law to the facts, the AR found
                    that the Open Letter “<em>taken in isolation</em>,
                    would probably be insufficient for the court to conclude that the plaintiffs
                    thought that it had a viable claim” because a potential claim was quite
                    different from a good or viable claim. However, he found that there were
                    “several other factors which tipped the balance.” He identified
                    three factors:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_i"></a>(i)     that the Open Letter did not request
                        for documents, and had alluded to investigations being carried
                    out;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     that a
                        “Without Prejudice” letter was issued simultaneously with the
                        Open Letter. While the contents of the “Without Prejudice”
                        letter were not revealed to him, he presumed from the fact of
                        “Without Prejudice” communications that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... parties did enter into negotiations in an attempt to settle the
                            matter. This carries with it an inference (albeit not a very strong one)
                            that the plaintiff knew it has a viable cause of action against the
                            defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_22-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     that neither did the plaintiff state on affidavit nor did counsel
                        submit that the plaintiff was not able to plead its case without disclosure
                        of the information sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Review of the decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The AR was correct that when SL&amp;B stated
                    in the Open Letter that the plaintiff had a potential claim against the
                    defendant, that was not a statement of the plaintiff’s conclusion that it
                    already had a viable claim against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Against this background, careful consideration
                    must be given to the factors which were found to tip the balance against the
                    plaintiff. I found that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_i"></a>(i)     on the first factor, the AR had
                        drawn wrong inferences that the plaintiff did not request for documents in
                        the Open Letter because it already concluded that it had a viable claim
                        against the defendant. That was inconsistent with the express use of the
                        words “potential claim”. I have often seen counsel’s
                        unjustified confidence in his or her cases, but seldom the converse. If the
                        writer had felt that there was a claim against the defendant, there was no
                        reason for him not to state that in plain terms without
                        qualification.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     on the second factor, it was unsafe for the AR to draw any inferences
                        without knowledge of the contents of the contemporaneous “Without
                        Prejudice” letter. Privilege over the “Without
                        Prejudice” letter and the correspondence that followed was waived
                        during the hearing of the appeal before me and the letters were produced
                        during the appeal. The “Without Prejudice” letter read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">We refer to the above matter and our open letter of the same
                            date.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Notwithstanding the contents of our open letter, our client now
                            invites you to make a proposal for an amicable resolution of this
                            matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Please let us have your response and/or proposal within seven (7) days
                            of the date hereof.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">All our client’s rights are expressly reserved.</p>
<p class="Judg-2">It was evident by the letter that SL&amp;B was hoping to secure an
                        amicable settlement of the “potential claim”, and the writer
                        had not asserted that it had determined that the plaintiff had a claim
                        against the defendant or indicated the basis of the claim. With the
                        unveiling of the “Without Prejudice” letter, the AR’s
                        inference that “the plaintiff knew that it has a viable cause of
                        action against the defendant” was unfounded; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_24-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     on the third factor, the
                        AR’s treatment of the fact that the plaintiff or counsel did not state
                        that the plaintiff was not able to plead its case without the documents
                        sought as a tipping factor was difficult to understand. The Liquidator had
                        deposed in the affidavit in support of the application that “the
                        Defendants’ audit procedures need to be scrutinized carefully”
                        and, “although I have not come to a firm conclusion on this, the
                        Defendants are likely to be a party to future proceedings”. On a fair
                        and careful reading of the Liquidator’s affidavit, it was clear that
                        the plaintiff was not ready or able to plead a cause of action without
                        reviewing the requested papers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     On the conclusion of the review of the grounds
                    of decision, I found that the AR had drawn wrong inferences in arriving at the
                    three tipping factors. I also found little substance in the points the defendant
                    raised. The Liquidator had explained in his affidavit that he needed the audit
                    papers and working papers to come to an informed decision whether the plaintiff
                    had a viable cause of action. Unless he was dishonest or wrong in his affidavit,
                    his professional conclusion should be accorded due weight, and there was nothing
                    to suggest that he was being disingenuous or was mistaken. It was evident that
                    before he decided to sue he would need to know whether the defendant was aware
                    of the Poison Pen Letter, whether the defendant was aware of Lo’s conflict
                    of interests, whether the defendant had issued proper instructions to address
                    the risks of fraud, and whether the defendant’s staff had complied with
                    instructions when they carried out the audits.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The AR did not address the <em>ex turpi causa</em> issue and the time limitation issue. He probably
                    thought that it was not necessary for them to be dealt with as the application
                    had failed on the necessity requirement. As I disagreed with his finding on that
                    issue, I will address the two other issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Ex turpi causa</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defendant relied on the <em>Stone &amp; Rolls</em> decisions of the Court of Appeal and the House
                    of Lords and argued that the courts had, “on very similar facts ... held
                    that the company in question was precluded from suing its auditors in negligence
                    for failing to detect the on-going fraud of its managing
                    director”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     It is useful to set out the material facts in
                        <em>Stone &amp; Rolls</em>. The plaintiff in that case
                    was the liquidators of a company, Stone &amp; Rolls Ltd
                    (“S&amp;R”), and the defendants were the company’s auditors.
                    A pivotal figure, one Stojevic, stood out in the decisions. In the lead judgment
                    of Rimer LJ in the Court of Appeal, Stojevic was found to be the
                    “sole directing mind and will” of the company, and that he
                    “owned, controlled and managed the company”, that “the
                    company was his company and that it was for practical purposes, a one man
                    company”, and that he was the company’s “controlling mind
                    and will”. In the judgments of the House of Lords, Stojevic was described
                    as “the persona of S&amp;R”, “its directing mind and
                    will”, “the very ego and centre of the personality of the
                    corporation” and “the embodiment of S&amp;R for all
                    purposes”, and S&amp;R was described as “even on the most exacting
                    definition of the term, a one-man company”. Through Stojevic’s
                    manipulation, S&amp;R defrauded banks by deceiving them into believing that they
                    were financing S&amp;R in commercial transactions. When the fraud came to light,
                    a bank sued and obtained judgment against S&amp;R and Stojevic. S&amp;R was
                    unable to pay the judgment and was put into liquidation, and the liquidators of
                    the company sued the company’s auditors for negligence for failing to
                    detect the fraud when they audited the company’s accounts, and the
                    auditors applied to strike out the claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords
                    applied the <em>ex turpi causa</em> principle and struck
                    out the claim. The principle was explained by Lord Mansfield CJ in <em>Holman v Johnson</em> (1775) 1 Cowp 341 at 343
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an
                        immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiff’s own stating or
                        otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the
                        transgression of a positive law of this country, there the court says he has
                        no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes; not for the
                        sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a
                        plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The courts held that since Stojevic was the beneficial owner and the
                    directing mind and will of S&amp;R, the company was to be imputed with awareness
                    of the fraud perpetrated against the bank, the auditors could invoke the
                        <em>ex turpi causa</em> defence to the company’s
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The relationship between Kelvin Ang and the
                    plaintiff company was materially different from the relationship between
                    Stojevic and S&amp;R. Kelvin Ang did not control the company as Stojevic
                    controlled S&amp;R. The company was a public company limited by shares
                    registered in Singapore under the Companies Act and was also listed on the ASX.
                    As Kelvin Ang held 37% of the company’s shares through his personal
                    shareholding and deemed interest (and therefore other parties held the remaining
                    63% of the shares of the company), he did not own the company. While he was the
                    managing director and sole executive director of the company and was involved in
                    the administration and day-to-day operations of the company, he had to report to
                    the board of directors of the company, he was not the embodiment of the
                    company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Although the company had alleged that Kelvin
                    Ang was its controlling mind and will,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> the
                    company was manifestly not a one-man company that S&amp;R was. Stojevic’s
                    absolute control and domination over S&amp;R was vital to finding by the Court
                    of Appeal and the House of Lords that the defence of <em>ex turpi
                        causa</em> was available to S&amp;R’s auditors, but in the
                    present case the plaintiff could not be identified with Kelvin Ang in the manner
                    that S&amp;R was identified with Stojevic. The facts did not support the
                    contention that the company could not claim against the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Time Limitation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The defendant’s basis for applying the
                    six-year limitation period to the plaintiff’s right of discovery was
                    unduly narrow. The plaintiff was seeking pre-action discovery to ascertain if it
                    had a viable claim in negligence against the defendant. The defendant’s
                    conduct throughout the period of its engagement as the company’s auditor
                    was relevant to show whether it was negligent. If the Pre 2004 Audits audit
                    papers and working papers revealed that the defendant was aware of risks of
                    fraud by the company, or that instructions which had been issued by the
                    defendant to its staff in connection with the audits were not followed, the
                    information would be relevant to the determination of the defendant’s
                    conduct within the limitation period. A six year cut-off period could not be
                    applied to the plaintiff’s application on the basis put forward by the
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     I found that the application was made in good
                    faith by the Liquidator after he had explained the information that he had, and
                    had identified the papers that he had to examine to make a reasoned decision
                    whether there was a case of negligence against the defendant. Implicit in the
                    application was his awareness that if he obtained the additional information and
                    found that they did not help to establish a case, the plaintiff would not sue
                    the defendant, unless other evidence was available.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In these circumstances, the application was
                    necessary for disposing fairly of the matter and it could save not only costs,
                    but time and anxiety for both the plaintiff and the defendant. I therefore
                    allowed the appeal and granted the plaintiff’s application.</p>
