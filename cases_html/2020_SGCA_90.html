The Applicant was charged with trafficking of not less than 1,963.3g of methamphetamine that was found in a black trolley bag which he had brought from Nigeria into Singapore and had handed over to one Hamidah Binte Awang (“Hamidah”). The trafficking charge under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) reads as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center">That you, <span class="font-weight-bold">ILECHUKWU UCHECHUKWU CHUKWUDI</span>,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">on the 13th day of November 2011, sometime between 10.16 p.m.and 11.34 p.m., along River Valley Road, Singapore, did traffic in a ‘Class A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed), to wit, by giving to one Hamidah Binte Awang (NRIC No. [redacted]) a trolley bag which contained two packets containing 2,496 grams of crystalline substance, which was analysed and found to contain <span class="font-weight-bold">not less than 1,963.3 grams of</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> methamphetamine, </span>without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(l)(a) and punishable under section 33 of the said Act, and further upon your conviction under section 5(1) of the said Act, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under section 33B of the said Act. [emphasis in bold in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 At the end of a joint trial of the Applicant and Hamidah, the trial judge (“the Judge”) acquitted the Applicant but convicted Hamidah on a separate charge. The Prosecution appealed against the Judge’s decision acquitting the Applicant. The Court of Appeal reversed the acquittal and convicted the Applicant on the trafficking charge. Pivotal to the decision of the Court of Appeal were the numerous lies and omissions made by the Applicant in his statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), for which there did not appear at the time to be any innocent explanation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In a decidedly fortuitous turn of events, when the matter was remitted to the Judge for sentencing, material evidence came to light that the Applicant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) with dissociative symptoms. This evidence arose from the examination of the Applicant by Dr Jaydip Sarkar (“Dr Sarkar”), a psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), who at that point was slated to be the Prosecution’s witness for the sentencing phase. According to Dr Sarkar, the Applicant’s PTSD arose as a result of a childhood trauma in his hometown in Wukari, Nigeria, when the Applicant was nearly killed and had witnessed the killing of others. In his report, Dr Sarkar took the position that the Applicant’s PTSD symptoms were triggered after he was informed that he was facing the death penalty associated with the trafficking charge, and this condition might have resulted in an “overestimation of threat to his life which could have prompted him to utter unsophisticated and blatant falsehoods in order to save his life”.

</div>
</div> For this reason, the Court of Appeal granted the criminal motion filed by the Applicant to reopen the Court of Appeal’s earlier conviction. No finding was made by the Court of Appeal on Dr Sarkar’s assessment of the Applicant and the matter was remitted to the Judge for him to receive further expert evidence on PTSD. The Judge has since rendered his findings, which will be examined in the course of this judgment. It is in the light of those findings that we now review the Court of Appeal’s earlier decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Facts</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Applicant arrived in Singapore from Lagos, Nigeria, on 13 November 2011. According to the Applicant, he ran a business selling second-hand electronic goods in Nigeria and the purpose of the visit to Singapore was to purchase used laptops for sale back home. As part of this plan, the Applicant was introduced by a childhood friend by the name of Izuchukwu to one Kingsley, who purportedly had relevant business contacts in Singapore who could assist the Applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 At the trial, the Applicant told the court that on 12 November 2012, the day of his departure from Nigeria, he only took a black laptop bag to the airport in Lagos. There, he met Izuchukwu and Kingsley. Kingsley handed to the Applicant a black luggage trolley bag (“the Black Luggage”) which he requested the Applicant to pass on to a contact in Singapore, who in turn would help the Applicant with his sourcing of second-hand electronic goods. The Applicant was informed that the Black Luggage contained clothes belonging to the said contact. On inspection, the Applicant found only clothes in the Black Luggage and nothing seemed amiss. The Applicant’s evidence was that the Black Luggage underwent a physical check and X-ray scan at the airport in Lagos. It was subsequently checked in by the airline for the flight to Singapore. All of foregoing took place without any incident.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 On his arrival in Singapore on 13 November 2011, the Applicant proceeded to the immigration checkpoint at Changi Airport, and he was detained for questioning. During this time, the Applicant received several SMS messages from a Nigerian number asking whether he had cleared immigration and about his location. The Applicant’s evidence was that the messages were from Izuchukwu, who worked as a travel agent and had helped the Applicant with his travel arrangements to Singapore. One of the messages was “Have u seen him?” and “[phone number redacted] call him plz”. The Applicant’s evidence was that those messages referred to another Nigerian national who Izuchukwu had also arranged a visa for, and who was supposed to be at the airport with the Applicant.

</div>
</div> Eventually, the Applicant did meet another Nigerian national by the name of Adili and they were placed in the same room by the authorities. Another message from Izuchukwu asked the Applicant to inform the checkpoint authorities to contact “ESP” if there were any issues. ESP refers to ESP Lines (S) Pte Ltd, a Singapore freight forwarding company which had assisted in making the arrangements for the Applicant and Adili to visit Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 After the Applicant cleared immigration, he collected the Black Luggage from the baggage claim counter. The Black Luggage was then subjected to both an X-ray scan and physical check, which again yielded nothing. Thereafter, the Applicant left the airport with both the Black Luggage and his laptop bag. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 The Applicant proceeded to take a taxi to Kim Tian Hotel in Geylang, where he was supposed to stay. On his arrival however, Kingsley called the Applicant and told him to go to Hotel 81 in Chinatown (“Hotel 81”) instead. The Applicant complied. CCTV footage at Hotel 81 showed that the Applicant arrived there at about 8.36 pm. After speaking to the receptionist in the lobby, the Applicant realised that he did not have enough Singapore dollars to pay for his stay at the hotel. He deposited the Black Luggage at the hotel lobby and went out to look for a moneychanger. The CCTV footage showed that he returned about 12 minutes later. The Applicant then paid for one night’s stay at the hotel because he was supposed to meet Kingsley’s contact for the sourcing of used electronic goods the next day.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 That same night, the Applicant received a call from Kingsley’s contact informing him that a woman would collect the Black Luggage from him. This led to a meeting between the Applicant and Hamidah at Clarke Quay. The CCTV footage showed that the Applicant left Hotel 81 with the Black Luggage at around 10.16 pm.

</div>
</div>
</div> The Applicant took a taxi from the hotel and alighted at a bus stop in Clarke Quay. As Hamidah had difficulty locating the Applicant, the Applicant approached a Caucasian male who was standing near the bus stop, to ask him to give directions to Hamidah over the phone. The Applicant’s evidence is that when he walked towards the Caucasian male, he left the Black Luggage at the interior of the bus stop. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 When Hamidah finally arrived at the bus stop, she alighted from her car and introduced herself to the Applicant. According to the Applicant, Hamidah introduced herself as “Maria”. After handing over the Black Luggage to Hamidah, the latter invited the Applicant to get into the car. They chatted and upon Hamidah’s inquiry, the Applicant told Hamidah that he had not eaten anything since his arrival in Singapore. Hence, Hamidah offered to take the Applicant to an African restaurant and he agreed. As it turned out, the restaurant was closed and Hamidah offered the Applicant some drinks from the boot of her car instead. Sometime during their journey in the car, the Applicant accidentally dropped his mobile phone into Hamidah’s drink. Eventually, Hamidah dropped the Applicant off at a taxi stand in Clarke Quay and he returned to Hotel 81. The CCTV footage at Hotel 81 showed him going up to his room without the Black Luggage at 11.34 pm. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 At around 11.55 pm on 13 November 2011, Hamidah was stopped at the Woodlands Checkpoint. The Black Luggage was retrieved from her car and was cut open at the sides. The controlled drugs in question, which were found to contain not less than 1963.3g of methamphetamine, were recovered from the Black Luggage. Hamidah was arrested. The next morning, on 14 November 2011, the Applicant was arrested in his room at Hotel 81. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 Various statements were obtained from the Applicant: the statement recorded at 1pm on 14 November 2011 shortly after his arrest (“the First Statement”); the cautioned statement recorded at 9.41pm on 14 November 2011 (“the Cautioned Statement”); and the long statements taken between 21 and 24 November 2011 (“the Long Statements”). As alluded to above at [2], the Applicant told a series of lies and omitted material facts in his statements to the CNB. The lies and omissions will be examined in greater detail later in this judgment. For present purposes, it suffices to note that in all his statements, the Applicant denied bringing the Black Luggage into Singapore, denied meeting Hamidah to pass her the same bag at Clarke Quay and did not mention Kingsley. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">HC (Acquittal)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 At the joint trial of the Applicant and Hamidah, the key issue identified by the Judge was whether the Applicant and the co-accused person Hamidah, had knowledge of the drugs concealed in the Black Luggage. The Applicant’s main case was that he had come to Singapore for business and had been asked to deliver the Black Luggage on behalf of Kingsley to a business contact he was supposed to meet. Given the various checks which the Black Luggage had undergone at the Nigerian airport, he had no reason to suspect that the Black Luggage contained illicit drugs. Furthermore, the Applicant argued that it was not inexplicable for him to take a defensive stance after he was arrested and charged with an offence that carried the death penalty. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 The Applicant was acquitted of the charge against him in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Hamidah Binte Awang and another</span> [2015] SGHC 4 (hereinafter, “<span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal)</span>”). The Judge had, at [48], accepted the Applicant’s testimony that he came to Singapore to purchase electronic goods for his business. This was corroborated by the US$5,000 the Applicant brought into Singapore as well as by the evidence of one Mr Kervinn Leng (“Kervinn”), a director of ESP who had been informed by his Lagos office that the Applicant was a trader coming to Singapore and had arranged a Singapore visa for the Applicant.

</div>
</div> Moreover, the Judge found that the Applicant’s conduct was generally inconsistent with knowledge of the drugs. Amongst other things, the Applicant had appeared, from the CCTV footage at Changi Airport, to be composed and he had collected the Black Luggage despite the delay at immigration (at [52]); the Applicant had left the Black Luggage unattended at the lobby of Hotel 81 when he left to exchange money (<span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Acquittal) </span>at [54]); and the Applicant had essentially gone for a joyride with Hamidah after handing the Black Luggage to the latter (at [60]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In respect of the First Statement, the Applicant’s explanation in <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal)</span> was that: (a) he did not lie when he said he only brought one piece of luggage into Singapore because he had not considered his laptop bag to be a piece of luggage; and (b) alternatively, he lied because he had been told by the CNB officers that there had been an arrest on the night of 13 November 2011 and two packets of drugs were recovered from the Black Luggage. The Judge rejected the first explanation (at [64]). However, the Judge found that he could not rule out the possibilities that the Applicant lied in his statements because he had learnt that there was an arrest the night before and drugs were found in the Black Luggage and/or that he was arrested for drug trafficking and had hence decided that the “best way forward” was to lie about the Black Luggage (at [66]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 In respect of the Cautioned Statement and the Long Statements, the Applicant explained at trial that he lied or omitted information because he had not been informed of the full facts surrounding his arrest and, having heard that the trafficking charge carried the death penalty, he decided that the safest course of action was a complete denial. While the Judge found that the Applicant had been overly defensive, he did not think this unequivocally showed that the Applicant knew about the drugs in the Black Luggage <span class="font-italic">before </span>he was arrested (at [67]). This was especially so given the Applicant’s conduct before arrest, which as explained above at [14], was considered inconsistent with a knowledge of the drugs. Notably, the Judge also observed that the Applicant considered himself a victim of circumstances and viewed the investigating officer, one ASP Deng Kaile (“ASP Deng”), with absolute suspicion, which could have contributed to the Applicant’s decision to deny everything relating to the Black Luggage and Hamidah. Thus, the lies could equally be explained by the Applicant’s realisation <span class="font-italic">after </span>he was arrested that there had been drugs in the Black Luggage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Judge thus found that the Applicant’s evidence at trial was generally credible and was more consistent with a person with <span class="font-italic">no </span>knowledge of drugs in the Black Luggage (<span class="font-italic">HC</span> (<span class="font-italic">Acquittal</span>) at [69]). The Judge noted that the drugs “were so well hidden that [the Applicant] could not have known about it unless he was told of it” (at [70]). The Applicant’s explanation for his lies “was not unreasonable given the situation he found himself, including the fact that he was in a foreign land for the first time”. In the circumstances, the Judge found that the Applicant had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA on the balance of probabilities and hence he acquitted the Applicant. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">CA (Conviction)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The Prosecution appealed against the decision in <span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Acquittal)</span>. The key issue before the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor</span><span class="font-italic"> v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi </span>[2015] SGCA 33 (hereinafter, “<span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Conviction)</span>”) was whether the Applicant had rebutted the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA. The court considered the key dispute to be the probative effect of the various lies and omissions made by the Applicant in his statements as follows (at [33]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In determining whether the Judge had erred in accepting the [Applicant’s] defence, the <span class="font-weight-bold">key</span> dispute centres on the probative effect of the numerous lies and omissions made by the [Applicant] in his statements to the CNB, and the Judge’s treatment of the [Applicant’s] explanations for those lies and omissions. To narrow the point down even further, <span class="font-weight-bold">the critical</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> question to be answered</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">is whether the </span><span class="font-weight-bold">[Applicant] had lied for innocent reasons, or whether he had intentionally lied because he </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">knew </span><span class="font-weight-bold">that telling the</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> truth would link him to the crime.</span> [emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 In respect of the First Statement, the court agreed with the Judge’s rejection of the Applicant’s defence that he had not lied because he did not consider the laptop bag to be a piece of luggage (at [35]). However, the court also rejected the Applicant’s alternative case that he had lied because he had been told by the CNB officers that there was an arrest the previous night and that drugs were found in the Black Luggage (at [36]). The court found that the evidential basis for this was scant notwithstanding the Judge’s apparent acceptance of its possibility. In any event, the Applicant had testified at trial that the first time he had any inkling that the charge against him was related to the Black Luggage was when his counsel visited him. This took place <span class="font-italic">after</span> the First Statement had been recorded. Hence, the Applicant’s alternative explanation was patently inconsistent with his own evidence (at [43]). Nonetheless, the court remarked that, taken in isolation, it is <span class="font-italic">possible</span> that the Applicant lied in the First Statement even though he did not know before he was arrested that the Black Luggage contained drugs (at [45] and [54]). What troubled the court was that the Applicant’s lies persisted in his subsequent statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 In respect of the lies and omissions in the Cautioned Statement, the Applicant rehashed his explanations in <span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Acquittal)</span>. In the main, his evidence was<span class="font-italic"> </span>that he was “full of confusion”, ASP Deng had not been specific about the circumstances of the offence and that he could not “open [his] heart … because [he] was in high tension”. In <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>, the court rejected these explanations (at [51]). The charge and caution had been read to the Applicant and he must have understood the nature and consequences of the charge as well as any failure in disclosing material information relating to his defence. In fact, the Applicant had specifically admitted at trial that he understood the caution.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The court considered that the Applicant’s failure to mention Kingsley was a material one which justified the drawing of an adverse inference (<span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Conviction) </span>at [58]). There was no good reason for the Applicant’s omission since he could have mentioned Kingsley without saying anything incriminating about the Black Luggage. The court further found that the Judge erred in finding that the Applicant’s overly defensive behaviour did not show <span class="font-italic">unequivocally</span> that he must have known about the drugs in the Black Luggage before<span class="font-italic"> </span>he was arrested. The burden of proof was on the Applicant to prove his lack of knowledge by rebutting the presumption in the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 In the circumstances, the court considered that the Applicant’s lies were more consistent with his having had knowledge of the drugs before his arrest. In accordance with the principles set out in <span class="font-italic">Regina v Lucas (Ruth) </span>[1981] QB 720 (“<span class="font-italic">Lucas</span>”), these lies could be used as corroborative evidence of guilt, even though the Prosecution did not need to rely on the lies (at [59]–[60]). It was clear that the Applicant’s lies were deliberate, material and shown to be false by independent evidence. The essential question was whether the Applicant’s lies stemmed from a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. In this regard, the court concluded at [61] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… The [Applicant’s] excuses for the lies were wholly unsatisfactory and unbelievable. It is clear to us that he had deliberately lied to distance himself from the drugs in the Black Luggage, the existence of which he knew. Quite simply, there is no acceptable explanation for the lies save for his realisation of his guilt. To suggest that the [Applicant] was justified to lie as a defensive move would be to turn reason and logic on its head.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 In addition, the court highlighted that even if lies were not regarded as corroborative evidence of guilt, they could nevertheless be relevant for evaluating the Applicant’s creditworthiness. On the facts, the Applicant’s disclosure of material and exculpatory facts for the first time at trial rendered his testimony less credible (at [63]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 The court in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>considered that even putting aside the Applicant’s lies and omissions, various aspects of his evidence were also difficult to believe. They can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) There was little objective evidence for the Applicant’s narrative that he came to Singapore for business. It was, at best, weakly corroborated by the evidence of Kervinn, who had never spoken with the Applicant directly before his arrival in Singapore (at [67]). Furthermore, since Kervinn was the one who applied for the Applicant’s entry visa into Singapore, one could not seriously expect a person intent on trafficking drugs to disclose the true purpose of his visit. The US$5,000 which the Applicant brought into Singapore was also a rather small amount for a trader in electronic goods (at [68]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) There were various suspicious circumstances surrounding the entire trip (at [70]–[78]). For example, even though it was the Applicant’s first overseas trip, and purportedly a business trip, the Applicant left for Singapore without obtaining any contact details from Kingsley. It was also difficult to believe that the Applicant would have meekly agreed to Kingsley’s request to pass the Black Luggage to an unknown contact. In the court’s view, the Applicant’s behaviour was completely nonchalant and any reasonably prudent person would have enquired further. Furthermore, the court also considered the Applicant’s willingness to follow Kingsley’s instructions to change from the Kim Tian Hotel to Hotel 81 without any reservation and the numerous text messages received from Izuchukwu whilst the Applicant was at Changi Airport to be unusual.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Finally, the court also disagreed with certain points which the Judge took to indicate the Applicant’s <span class="font-italic">lack </span>of knowledge of the drugs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 First, the court took issue with the Judge’s assessment of the Applicant’s conduct at Changi Airport and at Hotel 81. The Judge had highlighted that the Applicant claimed the Black Luggage despite the hiccup at immigration, and that the Applicant was content to leave the Black Luggage at the lobby of Hotel 81 for 12 minutes. Both of these events were taken by the Judge to indicate a lack of knowledge of the drugs in question on the Applicant’s part. In the court’s view however, the Judge’s assessments of the two events were too narrow and in a sense inconsistent, and they did not necessarily indicate a lack of knowledge (at [80]–[81]). This was because abandoning the Black Luggage at the airport carried with it the threat of reprisal by those who entrusted the drugs to him, whilst insisting on taking the Black Luggage with him when he was going out of the hotel to exchange money could have aroused suspicion especially since the hotel lobby was a relatively safe place for temporary stowage.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Second, while the court agreed with the Judge that the Applicant’s conduct in going for a ride with Hamidah was unusual, it did not consider it to be so dispositive (at [82]). It could equally be said that it was strange for Hamidah herself to have invited the Applicant for a ride. In fact, Hamidah had given evidence that the Applicant had appeared nervous. Hence, properly viewed, the Applicant’s behaviour appeared to be an aberration from the totality of the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 For the above reasons, the threshold for appellate intervention was crossed even though the appeal turned primarily on questions of fact. The court’s observations in this regard bear quoting as they succinctly set out the very context in which the present application is raised before us:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">87  In the present case, the [Applicant’s] version of the facts is quite improbable. There was also no corroborating evidence for various key aspects of the [Applicant’s] case. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">That said, we would still have hesitated to think that</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> the</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> </span>[Applicant’s]<span class="font-weight-bold"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">version of the facts is so incredible that it would </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">ipso facto justify appellate interference.</span> Had the case <span class="font-italic">merely </span>turned on the Judge’s assessment on the credibility of the [Applicant’s] oral testimony at trial (and nothing more), we might have declined to interfere.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">88  <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What tipped the scales are the numerous lies and omissions made by the </span>[Applicant]<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in his statements, for which there is no innocent explanation.</span> This is an important distinguishing factor from <span class="font-italic">Farid </span>and the majority judgment in <span class="font-italic">Hla Win. </span>In those cases<span class="font-italic">, </span>the evidence of the respective respondents at trial was consistent with their statements, and this lent credibility to their evidence at trial (see <span class="font-italic">eg, Farid </span>at [28] and <span class="font-italic">Hla Win </span>at [42] and [43]). Indeed, even Yong CJ in his dissenting judgment in <span class="font-italic">Hla Win </span>said that the respondent “had been a very consistent witness” (<span class="font-italic">Hla Win </span>at [61])…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 Therefore, having particular regard to the Applicant’s lies and omissions, the Court of Appeal concluded that the Judge’s decision in <span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Acquittal) </span>was against the weight of evidence and convicted the Applicant on the trafficking charge.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">CA (Reopening)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Following the decision in <span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Conviction)</span>, the matter was remitted to the Judge for sentencing. As explained at length in <span class="font-italic">Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi v Public Prosecutor</span> [2017] 2 SLR 741 (hereinafter, “<span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Reopening)</span>”), fresh and material evidence had arisen in the form of the psychiatric report by Dr Sarkar. As mentioned, Dr Sarkar opined that the Applicant was suffering from PTSD, that his symptoms were triggered after he was told by the CNB officers that he was facing the death penalty and that the PTSD might have caused the Applicant to lie in his statements (<span class="font-italic">CA (Reopening) </span>at [20]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Applying in the main the principles laid out in <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing v Public Prosecutor </span>[2016] 3 SLR 135 (“<span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span>”), the question before the court was whether there was sufficient material on which the court could say that there <span class="font-italic">may</span> have been a miscarriage of justice in <span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Conviction) </span>such that the concluded appeal should be reopened. We highlight the following remarks made by the court (<span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing </span>at [50] affirmed in <span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Reopening) </span>at [14]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In our judgment, the principle of finality is no less important in cases involving the death penalty. There is no question that as a modality of punishment, capital punishment is different because of its irreversibility. <span class="font-weight-bold">For this reason, capital cases deserve the most anxious and searching scrutiny.</span> This is also reflected in our laws. … <span class="font-weight-bold">But, once the processes of appeal and/or review have run their course, the legal process must recede into the background, and attention must then shift from the legal contest to the search for repose.</span> We do not think it benefits anyone – not accused persons, not their families nor society at large – for there to be an endless inquiry into the same facts and the same law with the same raised hopes and dashed expectations that accompany each such fruitless endeavour. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 After examining Dr Sarkar’s evidence in the context of the decision in <span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Conviction)</span>, the court in <span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Reopening) </span>was satisfied that Dr Sarkar’s report was sufficient material that was both new and compelling (at [23]–[43]). Dr Sarkar’s report also raised a “powerful probability” that the decision in <span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Conviction) </span>was demonstrably wrong (at [45]). Given the exceptional circumstances of the case, the application to reopen the Applicant’s conviction was allowed, though no finding was made as to whether the Applicant indeed suffered from PTSD or how he was affected by it during the statement-taking process (at [50]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The matter was then remitted to the Judge to adduce further evidence and make the relevant findings based on the following terms of reference (at [50]):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the Applicant was suffering from PTSD;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the typical effects of PTSD on a sufferer; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if the Applicant was indeed suffering from PTSD:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the period of time during which PTSD affected him;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the effects of PTSD on him during that period; and </div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) the extent to which PTSD affected him when he gave his statements to the CNB.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Following which, as we stated in <span class="font-italic">CA (Reopening) </span>at [51], the Court of Appeal would review its decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">HC (Remitted) – an overview</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 At the remitted hearing, a total of four experts were called (three by the Applicant and one by the Prosecution) and hot-tubbed. At the end of the remitted hearing (but before closing submissions), the Applicant applied in Criminal Motion No 22 of 2018 to revise the original terms of reference (set out in [34] above), arguing that the amendment was justified by the evidence which had been given by the four experts. The court allowed the application in part. The Judge was instead requested to make findings based on the following terms (with the amendments underlined):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the Applicant was suffering from PTSD;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the typical effects of PTSD on a sufferer;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if the Applicant was indeed suffering from PTSD:</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(i) the period of time during which PTSD affected him;</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(ii) the effects of PTSD on him during that period; and</div><div class="Judg-3 mb-3 text-justify">(iii) the extent to which PTSD affected him when he gave his statements to the CNB; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) <span class="font-underline">if the Applicant was not suffering from PTSD, whether he was suffering from post-traumatic stress symptoms (“PTSS”).

His main findings may be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Applicant suffered from PTSD as a child after witnessing the Wukari massacre when he was about five years old and continued to suffer from it until some indefinite time before he arrived in Singapore on 13 November 2011 (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span> at [113]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) However, the Applicant was <span class="font-italic">not</span> suffering from PTSD after his arrest on 14 November 2011 when the various statements were taken (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [129]). This was mainly because neither the arrest nor the Applicant being informed that the charge attracted the death penalty was sufficient to constitute a traumatic event.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Applicant suffered from various PTSS during the statement-taking process that took place after he was arrested in November 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Though the Judge was of the view that the Applicant <span class="font-italic">failed</span> to prove his claims <span class="font-italic">as to the extent</span> to which the various PTSS <span class="font-italic">affected</span> him when he was making those statements, the Judge, nevertheless, made the following notable observation at [193]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">However, it was clear from the evidence that Ilechukwu was an individual deeply affected by the traumatic memories of the Wukari massacre. While a normal person might not have lied under such circumstances, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">it is not inconceivable</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">that a person with a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">traumatic past</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> would</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> have done so if he believed that lying would get him out of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">traumatic</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> predicament that he was in</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that lying would be a means to “protect” oneself. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">This is an important observation, which we will return to in due course.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Apart from the medical evidence adduced from the experts, the Prosecution also called Adili as a witness primarily for the purpose of showing that the Applicant’s “Kingsley story” was false. This would have the consequential effect of undermining the reliability of Dr Sarkar’s expert opinion in so far as it may show that the Applicant lied to him in the course of their interviews. However, for reasons which the Judge had indicated at <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span> at [51]–[52], he found that he could <span class="font-italic">not</span> take Adili’s evidence on this issue into account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 For completeness, after the Judge’s decision in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>was released, the Applicant applied in Criminal Motion No 10 of 2019 (“CM 10/2019”) for an order that the Judge be permitted to answer a specific question – whether based on his findings, an innocent explanation for the Applicant’s lies and omissions was possible. We dismissed the motion for two reasons. First, it clearly related to matters beyond the revised Terms of Reference. Second, it was, in substance, an application for the Judge to review the actual merits of the decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>, the very issue which the Court of Appeal had reserved for itself to decide.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ cases </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Applicant’s case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 In his written submissions, counsel for the Applicant again sought leave to remit the matter to the Judge to answer the specific question of whether an innocent explanation for the Applicant’s lies and omissions is possible.

</div> Three main points have been advanced which can be outlined as follows.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 First, the Applicant endorses the Judge’s findings in <span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Remitted)</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that: (a) as a result of the Wukari massacre in his childhood he suffered from PTSD that lasted from the age of five until some indefinite date before he arrived in Singapore on 13 November 2011; and (b) he suffered from various PTSS during the taking of the statements. Notably, the Applicant concedes that he is “<span class="font-italic">unable</span> to prove (solely on the basis of the medical evidence and without reference to the wider issue of the Applicant’s guilt or innocence) that, on the balance of probabilities, the various PTSS <span class="font-italic">caused him to lie</span>” [emphasis added].

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 We should also mention that upon consideration of the parties’ submissions, we invited further submissions on two specific points. The first relates to the distinction between PTSD and PTSS and the second concerns the incidence of the burden of proof as to whether the Applicant’s lies were motivated by a realisation of guilt, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>lies. We will return to these points a little later.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Having found in <span class="font-italic">CA (Reopening) </span>that there was sufficient material on which the court might<span class="font-italic"> </span>find that there was a miscarriage of justice, the question before us now is whether the decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>is <span class="font-italic">in</span><span class="font-italic"> fact </span>demonstrably wrong. Therefore, at the heart of this application is whether, <span class="font-italic">in the light of the fresh evidence </span><span class="font-italic">concerning the Applicant’s PTSD and PTSS </span>and the Judge’s findings in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span>, the Applicant can be said to have rebutted the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Central to that overarching question is how the Applicant’s PTSD and/or PTSS could have anything to do with his lies and omissions – specifically whether either condition could provide an innocent explanation for the lies and omissions. In this regard, it bears emphasising that the court in <span class="font-italic">CA (</span><span class="font-italic">Conviction)</span> explained that what “tipped the scales” were the Applicant’s numerous lies and omissions, “for which there is no innocent explanation” (at [88]). Indeed, the Judge himself reiterated the same question at the conclusion of his decision without answering it because it was outside the revised Terms of Reference (<span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Remitted) </span>at [208]). Accordingly, we will now evaluate the Judge’s findings in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>in some detail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In the light of the revised Terms of Reference, the decision in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>is comprehensive. For the present purpose, however, an examination of the following three aspects would suffice:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Was the Judge correct to find that the Applicant suffered from PTSD during his childhood?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Was the Judge correct to find that the Applicant did not experience a traumatic event in 2011 for the purpose of Criterion A of the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria?</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Was the Judge correct to find that the Applicant suffered from PTSS in 2011 and if so, how were they connected to his lies and omissions?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">While the critical aspect of the case concerns the third issue, it is necessary for us to proceed with our analysis sequentially given the cumulative nature of the evidence and discussion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Given the length of the judgment in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span>, we think it would be expedient and help in better understanding, if we first indicate our answers to the three questions. We agree with the Judge that the Applicant suffered from PTSD during his childhood as a result of the Wukari massacre. However, we differ from the Judge on the second question and would proceed to answer the third question, which the Judge hesitated to do because of the revised Terms of Reference. We find that having regard in particular to the “sensitisation effect” operating on the Applicant in 2011, as shall be explained in detail below, the Applicant’s arrest and his being informed of the death penalty associated with the trafficking charge were sufficient to satisfy Criterion A of the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria. We agree with the Judge that the Applicant was in 2011 suffering from PTSS and find that there is a rational and credible connection between the Applicant’s PTSS and the lies and omissions in his statements.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Our analysis</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Preliminary issues </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 We begin by briefly addressing two preliminary issues. The first relates to the approach which this court ought to adopt when undertaking the review of the decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>. Should this court look at the entire case <span class="font-italic">de novo</span> without regard to the decision already made in <span class="font-italic">CA </span><span class="font-italic">(Conviction</span>)? This question is distinct from the question as to the test or standard which must be met before a concluded criminal appeal should be re-opened, which test was set out in <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing </span>at [77] and applied in <span class="font-italic">CA (Reopening)</span>. We have passed that point. The present motion is to review the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>, to determine whether that decision is still correct – particularly, whether in light of the evidence adduced in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span>, the decision in <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal)</span> should be reversed. In other words, assuming the fresh evidence had been before the court when it was considering <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>, would it have drawn the same inferences and arrived at the same conclusion? </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 We would also add that this approach is consistent with the following analysis enunciated in <span class="font-italic">CA (Reopening)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [45]–[46]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45  We earlier highlighted that the False Statements Issue was “[w]hat tipped the scales” in CCA 10/2014 and led us to overturn the Judge’s acquittal of the Applicant … We have also found that the IMH Report is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>powerfully probative in relation to the False Statements Issue. <span class="font-weight-bold">We therefore find that the IMH Report does </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prima facie </span><span class="font-weight-bold">raise a “powerful probability” that our decision in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span><span class="font-weight-bold">is wrong</span> …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">46  In resisting the Present Motion, the Prosecution has pointed to other aspects of our reasoning in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>(apart from our reasoning on the False Statements Issue) to show that our decision in CCA 10/2014 is not demonstrably wrong (<span class="font-italic">eg</span>, our analysis in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>at [71]–[82] of the Applicant’s “improbable” account of the events which took place on 13 November 2011). <span class="font-weight-bold">As we stated in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span><span class="font-weight-bold">at [83], CCA 10/2014 “turn[ed] primarily on questions of fact, and it is a well-established principle that an appellate court is usually slow to overturn the factual findings of a trial judge”. The IMH Report raises a powerful probability that our decision on the False Statements Issue – and, in turn, on CCA 10/2014 as a whole – is wrong</span>, notwithstanding the other aspects of our reasoning in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>which support our decision in that appeal. Given these circumstances, we think it would be best to reconsider all the facts of this case only after the additional evidence outlined in our orders at [50] below has been adduced and dealt with.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The second preliminary issue relates to the applicable presumption under the MDA. Before us, the parties agreed that the relevant presumption is that under s 18(1) of the MDA, notwithstanding that the case in <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal) </span>and <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>had proceeded on the basis that the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) applied. We agree with the parties that this is the correct position in the light of this court’s pronouncements in <span class="font-italic">Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor </span>[2019] 2 SLR 254 (“<span class="font-italic">Adili</span>”) and will say nothing further on this point.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">DSM-5 PTSD Criteria</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The Applicant called three experts below: Dr Sarkar, Dr Ken Ung (“Dr Ung”) and Dr Mundasa Winslow (“Dr Winslow”).

(<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [41]). Specifically, only either Criterion C <span class="font-italic">or</span> D needs to be met in order to qualify for a PTSD diagnosis. However, we need not be unduly concerned by this distinction because the Judge had in fact applied the more stringent DSM-5 PTSD Criteria for adults in determining whether the Applicant suffered from PTSD following the Wukari massacre. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 All four experts also agreed that PTSD is an episodic and not a continuous psychiatric disorder (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [45]), although there appeared to be some ambiguity as to what exactly this meant. Dr Sarkar, Dr Ung and Dr Winslow submitted that the Applicant had a “lifetime diagnosis” of PTSD, which was taken to be synonymous with the word “episodic”. More importantly, it was also agreed by all the experts that if the Applicant was found to have suffered from PTSD in his <span class="font-italic">childhood</span>, the threshold for assessing <span class="font-italic">Criterion A</span> of the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, an immediate threat to life) subsequently would be lowered (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [30]). In other words, a past diagnosis of PTSD produces a “sensitisation effect” which would place the Applicant “at a higher risk of developing subsequent PTSD” (<span class="font-italic">HC Remitted </span>at [46] and [118]). This is a consequential effect of some significance, which we shall return to in due course.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Applicant suffered from PTSD as a child</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 We turn then to the Judge’s findings proper. The Judge found that the Applicant suffered from PTSD as a child around the age of five, after witnessing the Wukari massacre. The Judge’s extensive analysis of the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria during the Applicant’s childhood is set out in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [62]–[114] and we do not propose to rehash the same points here. Before us, the parties did not dispute this finding save in relation to two particular respects which can be briefly addressed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 First, the Prosecution argues that the Judge arrived at the diagnosis from a piecemeal agglomeration of the expert evidence, which is impermissible. If only a single expert’s evidence had been relied on (as the Prosecution submits should be the case), it would have been clear that the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria would not be fulfilled.

</div> and he agreed that the Applicant was not entitled to construct his own “piecemeal” diagnosis of PTSD from the evidence of the various experts (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span> at [55(c)] and [60]). The Prosecution argues that the Judge himself nevertheless went on to rely on a combination of Dr Sarkar’s and Dr Ung’s evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 We need not be detained by this argument, which we consider to be an untenable one. There is no issue with the Judge’s method of relying on the body of evidence gleaned from all the experts to arrive at his conclusion that the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria was satisfied during the Applicant’s childhood. As a matter of logic and common sense, we see no reason why the court should constrain itself by examining each expert’s evidence in isolation. In a case where the medical evidence is contested, the eminently sensible approach is for the court to have regard to the entire corpus of evidence. The Prosecution’s criticism is also at odds with the nature of the hot-tubbing exercise conducted below. To the extent that the Judge rejected the Applicant’s attempts at a “piecemeal” diagnosis, the Judge obviously did not consider his holistic consideration of all the expert evidence to be piecemeal or in any way internally inconsistent. We agree with the Judge’s approach. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Second, the Prosecution also argues that there was no evidence supporting the Judge’s finding of Criterion E5, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, problems with concentration being satisfied.

</div> Criterion E states that the marked alteration in arousal or reactivity must be “associated<span class="font-italic"> </span>with the traumatic event(s), beginning and worsening” thereafter. There is no suggestion that the problems with concentration must <span class="font-italic">only </span>be or <span class="font-italic">exclusively </span>linked to the Wukari massacre. The Judge expressly considered Dr Cheok’s suggestion that the Applicant’s poor concentration might be attributable to his hunger and poverty instead of the Wukari massacre (at [90]). He found that Dr Cheok’s view was inconsistent with the Applicant’s preference for sports (as Dr Ung himself had noted) and the prolonged period over which this symptom was observed (<span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Remitted) </span>at [92]). On balance, the Judge was satisfied that Criterion E5 was made out and we agree.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 For the above reasons, the Judge’s findings in respect of the Applicant’s childhood PTSD are sound and we can find no basis for interfering with them.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Applicant suffered from PTSD or PTSS during the statement-taking process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 As we highlighted earlier (at [60]), all the experts agreed that a past diagnosis of PTSD produces a “sensitisation effect” which would place the Applicant “at a higher risk of developing <span class="font-italic">subsequent PTSD</span>”: <span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Remitted)</span> at [46] and [118].

The Judge, however, found that the Applicant did not experience a Criterion A traumatic event at either point of time. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 In respect of the Applicant’s arrest, the Judge noted that Dr Sarkar only adopted the position that the arrest was a traumatic event at the remitted hearing after he learnt of the testimony given by the Applicant during the hearing for <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal)</span>. Thus, the Judge found at [124] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I am <span class="font-weight-bold">not satisfied</span> that Ilechukwu’s version of events, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he perceived the arrest as a “war”, with “people scattering”, proved that the manner of his arrest in 2011 <span class="font-weight-bold">was an event which exposed him to “actual or threatened</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> death, serious injury, or sexual violence” as required by Criterion A.</span> There was also no objective evidence to suggest that the CNB officers who arrested him exposed him to “actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence”. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">While the Judge had acknowledged the sensitisation effect in the section preceding the quoted paragraph (at [118]–[120]), it is not entirely clear to us why he decided that Criterion A was not satisfied. A possible explanation is that while he did in the preceding paragraphs refer to the “sensitisation effect”, for some unknown reason thereafter he overlooked that aspect. This can be seen from the fact that in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [124], the Judge talked about the Applicant not perceiving the arrest as “an event which exposed him to ‘actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violence’ as required by Criterion A. He should not have been applying the strict Criterion A test but an attenuated version of that test. He did not discuss how Criterion A should be applied to the 2011 events in the light of the “sensitisation effect”. We will be returning to this question in greater detail later (at [84] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 In respect of the charge, Dr Ung and Dr Sarkar had suggested that Criterion A might be satisfied because the Applicant was informed that he could suffer the death penalty if convicted of the trafficking charge. However, in the Judge’s view, because none of the Applicant’s experts explained how being verbally informed of that constituted a Criterion A event of the requisite degree of trauma, he decided that the Applicant had not satisfied the criterion (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [128]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In the circumstances, given that Criterion A was not satisfied, the Judge concluded that the Applicant did not suffer from a fresh episode of PTSD in relation to the events in 2011 (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [129]). Nevertheless, the Judge, in accordance with the revised Terms of Reference, proceeded to consider whether the Applicant did suffer from PTSS. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">PTSD and PTSS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Before we examine the Judge’s findings on PTSS proper, it is important to first clarify the distinction between PTSD and PTSS, and its effect on the Applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 Towards the end of the remitted hearing before the Judge, it became apparent from the flow of expert evidence that the original Terms of Reference, which focused only on PTSD, could be an overly parochial and pedantic approach.

If, on the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria, the Applicant was determined not to have PTSD, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, that would be the end of the inquiry.

In our judgment, a finding of PTSD or PTSS may have the same legal effect, which is that it <span class="font-italic">may</span> provide an innocent explanation for the Applicant’s lies in his statements to the CNB. This is a substance over form approach that accords with the fact-intensive nature of the essential question arising out of <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>.

</div> we also do not think our present approach in the instant case undermines the principles governing s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA, which affords the court a discretion to pass a sentence of life imprisonment in lieu of the death penalty when offenders suffer from a recognised and proven psychiatric condition. In <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran a/l K </span><span class="font-italic">Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2019] 2 SLR 216 (“<span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran</span>”) at [31], this court held that the abnormality of mind under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the MDA must arise from an established psychiatric condition. The reasoning employed in <span class="font-italic">Nagaenthran </span>was based on the specific statutory provision and Parliament’s express intention to limit the exception to individuals suffering from a recognised and proven psychiatric condition. That inquiry takes place at an <span class="font-italic">ex post </span>stage <span class="font-italic">after</span> the accused person has been <span class="font-italic">convicted</span> of a charge under the MDA. Whether a person suffers from an abnormality of mind such that he can avail himself of the statutory exception to the death penalty is a narrow and binary inquiry. In contrast, the foundational inquiry here is a logically anterior one – simply put, it is solely to determine whether the lies and omissions in the Applicant’s statements could be due to PTSD or PTSS and thus whether the Applicant’s conviction in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span> is unsafe. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The PTSS</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81  We turn next to the Judge’s analysis of the Applicant’s PTSS. In summary, the Judge found that the Applicant suffered from the following PTSS during the statement-taking process:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) When the First Statement was recorded, the Applicant was suffering from intense psychological distress (Criterion B4): <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [148].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) When the Cautioned Statement was recorded, the Applicant was suffering from dissociative reactions (Criterion B3)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and intense or prolonged psychological distress (Criterion B4): <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [154] and [158].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) When the Long Statements were recorded, the Applicant was suffering from intense and prolonged psychological distress (Criterion B4), a persistent and negative belief about others (Criterion D2), and a persistent negative emotional state (Criterion D4): <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [172], [175] and [178]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Criterion A</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The threshold issue raised by the Prosecution is that the PTSS must be associated with a Criterion A traumatic event. According to the Prosecution, since the Judge had declined to find the arrest or the notification of the death penalty as satisfying Criterion A (see [71] above), the findings on PTSS are erroneous.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 We agree with the Prosecution that PTSS must refer to the specific symptoms listed in the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria. It is clear from the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria that they explicitly refer to a predicate Criterion A traumatic event. It is true that the Judge did <span class="font-italic">not</span> explicitly address what constituted the predicate Criterion A event in his analysis and findings of the various PTSS. Moreover, as indicated earlier at [69], and with respect, it is not entirely clear if the Judge gave due regard to the operation of the sensitisation effect arising from the Applicant’s childhood PTSD when considering whether Criterion A was satisfied. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 We note that when evaluating Criterion A in the context of whether the Applicant was suffering from PTSD in 2011, the Judge did preface his analysis of Criterion A by acknowledging the sensitisation effect (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [118]–[120]). As we already explained earlier (at [60]), it was common ground between the parties that, in the light of the diagnosis of PTSD during the Applicant’s childhood, there was a sensitisation effect that would lower the threshold for Criterion A when a subsequent event should occur as in 2011. For example, Dr Ung testified that “even an innocuous trigger could retrigger his PTSD experience”.

</div> It seems to us that this inherent variability of the sensitisation effect accounts for the divergence between the experts as to whether, and which of the events in 2011, might satisfy the attenuated Criterion A.

</div> While the Applicant’s evidence would not ordinarily be remarkable, we consider that his childhood diagnosis of PTSD and the concomitant sensitisation effect, coupled with the reference to the word “war”, all point to the fact that at that moment he had a flashback of what he witnessed in Wukari. We agree with the Judge and Dr Sarkar that the Applicant’s account displays a degree of negativity which is unusual and persistent (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [178]). This testimony, we must re-emphasise, was given in 2014 before the Applicant’s PTSD or PTSS was put in issue. We therefore consider it to be credible and material evidence. Significantly also, the Applicant’s account of how the arrest took place was not refuted or contested at trial. During cross-examination by the Prosecution in <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal)</span>, the evidence shows that Applicant essentially repeated the same account quoted above.

To that extent, psychiatrists no doubt have the challenging task of <span class="font-italic">objectively</span> reconstructing a patient’s <span class="font-italic">subjective</span> mental state, as they must in providing expert evidence in legal proceedings. In the final analysis, the diagnostic process is a holistic exercise of clinical judgment based on the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria applied in the context of specific facts, medical history and circumstances of each individual patient. This is not to suggest that the court will not scrutinise the cogency of the medical evidence. The court regularly engages in the difficult task of sieving and analysing all the evidence, including the oft-contested medical evidence. In doing so, the court carefully considers, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the cogency and limits of the medical evidence complemented by, where appropriate, an understanding of human experience and common sense. We cannot overemphasise the fact that here we are dealing with a person who as a child developed PTSD as a result of the Wukari massacre, and bearing in mind the sensitisation effect, his subjective perspective and reaction to any particular stressful situation will necessarily be different, and might even appear irrational, to a normal person who is not so affected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In the present case, though it is agreed between the four experts that the sensitisation effect is an accepted phenomenon documented in the scientific literature, we note that the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria is silent on it. Nonetheless, the general notion of sensitivity is adverted to, as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… PTSD is often characterized by a <span class="font-weight-bold">heightened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic event</span> (e.g., following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the threat potentially caused by cars or trucks) and those not related to the traumatic event (e.g., being fearful of a heart attack) (Criterion E3). Individual with PTSD may be very reactive to unexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response, or jumpiness, to loud noises or unexpected movements … (Criterion E4)… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 Moreover, the following diagnostic features stipulated in the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria (which do not appear to take into account the sensitisation effect) are striking and worth noting:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The essential feature of [PTSD] is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to one or more traumatic events…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A <span class="font-weight-bold">include, but are not limited to,</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual physical assault … being kidnapped, being taken hostage,</span> terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or human-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The Applicant’s account of the arrest has been outlined above. It is uncontroverted that upon opening the door to his hotel room following the knock he heard, the Applicant was swiftly and forcefully restrained by police officers before being handcuffed. All of this was taking place, as Dr Sarkar noted, on foreign soil where the Applicant had arrived for the first time (see also, <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal) </span>at [70]). While there is certainly no suggestion that the CNB officers involved in the arrest physically assaulted the Applicant, we do not consider the arrest to be categorically different from the examples cited in the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria above. In the case of the Wukari massacre, there was an immediate threat to the Applicant’s life as he witnessed others being murdered before him. While the two events obviously differ in terms of gravity, both the arrest and the Wukari massacre presented a real and proximate threat to the Applicant’s life or liberty. To that extent, we agree with Dr Sarkar that there are similarities between the two events. In the circumstances, we consider it more probable than not that the arrest would have constituted a traumatic event, having due regard to the sensitisation effect operating on the Applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 As against this, the Prosecution highlighted in its submissions below, other evidence which in its view, militated against the suggestion that the arrest was a traumatic event for the Applicant.

It is evident that the specific context of the cross-examination quoted above concerned the question of whether there was a rational basis for the Applicant’s distress since he had not been informed of the charge (or death penalty) at that point. There is an appreciable difference, particularly when the sensitisation effect is borne in mind, between agreeing that one does not fear and one has no <span class="font-italic">rational basis </span>for fear. We do not consider the Applicant’s concession inconsistent with a finding that the arrest was a distressing event that satisfied the attenuated Criterion A. More importantly perhaps, it appears that the Applicant was not asked in cross-examination whether the <span class="font-italic">arrest </span>itself caused him to fear for his life. The above exchange highlighted by the Prosecution understandably focused on what an ordinary rational person would feel in similar circumstances. In our assessment however, that disregards the Applicant’s unusually negative account of the arrest as quoted earlier. We consider that evidence to be credible and thus, we do not think much weight can or should be given to Applicant’s ostensible concession here.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 Second, the evidence of the arresting officers from the CNB was that they did not notice anything unusual about the Applicant’s behaviour after the arrest. This is corroborated by how the Applicant testified in <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal)</span> that he had “no problem” and was “walking peacefully” with the CNB officers after his arrest. Again, in the particular circumstances of this case, we do not think this necessarily negates our finding that Criterion A is satisfied on the Applicant’s arrest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 We accept the evidence of the CNB officers that they had observed no visible signs of the Applicant’s PTSS. However, the presentation of PTSD can vary greatly and may not necessarily manifest overtly. This much is expressly stated in the DSM-5 PTSD Criteria:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Diagnostic Features</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Emotional reactions to the traumatic event (e.g., fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part of Criterion A. <span class="font-underline">The clinical presentation of PTSD varies</span>. In some individuals, fear-based experiencing, emotional, and behavioural symptoms may predominate. In others, anhedonic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some individuals, arousal and reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, <span class="font-underline">while in others, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally some, individuals exhibit combination of these symptom patterns</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Therefore, the fact that the CNB officers did not detect anything unusual in the Applicant’s behaviour following his arrest is not entirely surprising and is certainly not determinative. In this connection, it should also be highlighted that Dr Sarkar had diagnosed the Applicant with PTSD with dissociative symptoms, which is a specific subtype of PTSD. The DSM-5 PTSD Criteria states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-underline">Specify whether:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">With dissociative symptoms: </span>The individual’s symptoms meet the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder, and the individual experiences persistent or recurrent of either of the following:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1. <span class="font-weight-bold">Depersonalization</span>: Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached from, and as if one were an outside observer of, one’s mental processes or body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality of self or body or of time moving slowly).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 While this issue of the subtype of PTSD was not explored in depth in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span>, Dr Sarkar did explain what it means.

However, in our view, the contradiction is more apparent than real. The fact that the Applicant was “walking peacefully”, though somewhat relevant, is ultimately inconclusive as to his mental state. At no point in the Applicant’s testimony did he concede that he was not in a state of fear after the arrest. In fact, his evidence in both <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal) </span>and <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>suggests the opposite. On a closer reading of the transcript, for the Applicant to say that he was walking peacefully with the CNB officers seems to say more about the relatively calm nature of his interactions with the officers rather than his state of mind. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 Third, the Applicant’s account of the arrest given to Dr Sarkar, as recorded in his report, was relatively brief compared to the events surrounding his being informed of the charge. We acknowledge that in his interviews with Dr Sarkar, the Applicant did not seem to volunteer details about the arrest and had focused instead on his being informed of the death penalty.

</div> Similarly, little mention is made of the arrest in the reports of Dr Ung, Dr Winslow and Dr Cheok. However, we do not consider this to be fatal to the finding that the arrest constituted a Criterion A event. Nonetheless, if there is any doubt as to the sufficiency of the arrest as a traumatic event, we find that the evidence relating to the charge lays that to rest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The charge</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 When the Applicant was informed of his charge, he was also told that he might face the death penalty, as was recorded in the Cautioned Statement. This took place at around 9.41 pm on 14 November 2011 after his arrest earlier that day at 11.00 am. As will be recalled, it was Dr Ung’s and Dr Winslow’s opinion that the Applicant being informed that he could face the death penalty would constitute a Criterion A event (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [86]). It was also the original position which Dr Sarkar had taken in his report and maintained. Dr Cheok himself also acknowledged the possibility of this being a Criterion A event (see [87] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 The key parts of the Applicant’s evidence concerning the reading of the charge given in <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal)</span> are as follows:

We do not think this evidence was exaggerated or embellished by the Applicant. Again, this evidence was provided in 2014 and is supported by Dr Sarkar’s report in 2017, which goes into some detail concerning the Applicant’s mental state from the time after the charge was read out to him.

</div> The Prosecution highlighted that the objective and contemporaneous evidence contradicted the Applicant’s account recorded in Dr Sarkar’s report. In short, the testimony of the interpreter who was present when the charge was read by ASP Deng (who also recorded the Cautioned Statement), as well as those of ASP Deng and the CNB officers who escorted the Applicant that day, all showed that there was nothing remarkable about the Applicant’s conduct on 14 November 2011. The routine medical examination of the Applicant after the Cautioned Statement was recorded also revealed no abnormalities. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 Specifically, the Prosecution took issue with two sentences each in paragraphs 43 and 48 of Dr Sarkar’s report (quoted in [112] above and underlined). In respect of paragraph 43, there was no evidence that any of the CNB officers had asked the Applicant what was wrong or had assured him to trust in Singapore’s legal system. There was also no evidence that the Applicant had laid down on the floor at any point during the taking of the Cautioned Statement. In respect of paragraph 48, ASP Deng did not say to the Applicant that he was lying and “will hang”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 We find Dr Sarkar’s report, including the paragraphs highlighted by the Prosecution, to be reliable. We address each of the points in turn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 In respect of paragraph 43, it is not clear to us whether the Applicant meant that he lay down during the recording of any statement or that he was referring to some other instance when he was in custody. In fact, on a closer reading of Dr Sarkar’s report, particularly paragraph 43, it seems that the Applicant was describing events <span class="font-italic">after </span>the Cautioned Statement was recorded. When asked in cross-examination in <span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Remitted) </span>whether he laid down on the floor during the taking of the Cautioned Statement, we note that the Applicant vehemently denied doing so and became rather agitated.

</div> We recognise that the evidence of the CNB officers is that they did not make such remarks to the Applicant at any point in time. In our view, even if it were shown that these remarks were contrived by the Applicant, we find it to be an immaterial embellishment that has little effect on the reliability of Dr Sarkar’s report. Thus, it is not necessary to make a factual finding on this very point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 Finally, the Applicant also insisted that ASP Deng said to him “[y]ou are lying. You will hang” during the statement-taking process, as set out in paragraph 48 of Dr Sarkar’s report. To be clear, the Applicant does not challenge the voluntariness of any of his statements under s 258(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 We think this apparent embellishment on the part of the Applicant must be viewed in context. What is pertinent is that the Applicant was found to have developed a persistent paranoia towards ASP Deng. This flowed from his persistent and negative belief about others (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>Criterion D2) (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [198]).

The first day, the first couple of hours in the evening when the cautioned statement was taken, it was a different motivation to lie, <span class="font-weight-bold">and the long statement seven days later there was a very different</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> motivation which was very specific to the investigating officer </span>and [the Applicant’s] perception of the investigating officer actually playing him and setting him up in a kind of conspiratorial game where the conclusion had been waged right from the outset that he would be killed and the IO was just amassing evidence to justify the killing, and he believed that he was not told the truth at the beginning, because he said “The IO did not explain to me how the baggage and the drugs were linked” and so on and so forth, so because he believed that the IO had not been honest and upfront with him, he said he would not be honest and upfront with him. This is in his 2014 testimony.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">And some of the reasons that he gives almost borders, as I said earlier, not so much psychosis but certainly paranoid… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The suspicion that he had towards the IO in particular borders on sort of paranoia a bit more than normal suspicion that he would have.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 We are inclined to agree with Dr Sarkar’s explanation and the Judge’s finding that the Applicant’s persistent and negative belief about others caused him to develop a persistent paranoia towards ASP Deng. In all the circumstances, what might have appeared at first blush to be an exaggeration on the part of the Applicant to Dr Sarkar, is actually consistent with the Applicant’s paranoia towards ASP Deng. Thus, we are satisfied that Dr Sarkar’s report is probably reliable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 Returning to the main inquiry as to whether the charge constitutes a Criterion A event, we find that there is ample basis to make such a finding. Under ordinary circumstances, we accept that a mere verbal caution and notification of the death penalty would not be construed as a Criterion A event. However, bearing in mind again the sensitisation effect and the circumstances of the Applicant’s arrest earlier that day, we are satisfied that the reading of the charge to the Applicant would be an event which met the attenuated Criterion A. We do not consider it improbable that the Applicant could have considered the charge to be a proximate threat to his life that triggered or aggravated his PTSS. This is supported by both the Applicant’s testimony in <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal) </span>and Dr Sarkar’s evidence in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>as explained above. Dr Ung and Dr Winslow also took the position that the charge constituted a Criterion A event. In addition, it should be noted that on the day of his arrest and during the taking of the First Statement and Cautioned Statement, the Applicant had on three occasions refused food and drink when offered. This, to us, constitutes some evidence that the Applicant was distressed by the arrest and the charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 Therefore, taking into account the sensitisation effect operating on the Applicant, we find that both the arrest and the reading of the charge were events which satisfied Criterion A for the purposes of the various PTSS. We pause to note that on a close reading of the Judge’s analysis of the PTSS, it is apparent that he adverted to both events notwithstanding that he did not analyse them under the rubric of Criterion A (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [145]–[146] and [150]–[152]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) The remaining PTSS</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Apart from the threshold issue with Criterion A, the Prosecution in its alternative submissions, also took issue with the Judge’s reasoning for finding specific PTSS. We shall briefly address this criticism. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) First Statement</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 The Judge found that the Applicant was suffering from “intense or prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s)” (Criterion B4) when the First Statement was taken. The Judge considered that Dr Sarkar was in fact talking about Criterion B4 when he stated that “people who attack and assault him during the arrest in his mind are the enemies. They are symbolically similar to what he experienced as a child” despite the absence of an express reference to the said criterion (see [92] above; <span class="font-italic">HC Remitted </span>at [138]). The Prosecution argues that those statements of Dr Sarkar were actually made in reference to the issue of whether Criterion A was satisfied in 2011 as we have analysed in the preceding section.

</div>
</div> In our view, while Criterion D1 and Criterion B3 are distinct, they do overlap in so far as both are concerned with dissociative phenomenon. For ease of reference, they refer to:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">B Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">…</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">3  Dissociative reactions (<span class="font-italic">e.g., </span>flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.)</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">D Negative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidence by two (or more) of the following:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1  Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as head injury, alcohol, or drugs).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The important point is that Dr Sarkar relied on <span class="font-italic">dissociative phenomenon </span>and <span class="font-italic">dissociation </span>in his comments on Criterion D1, which would reasonably refer to Criterion B3 as well. As highlighted earlier at [104], when asked what “PTSD with dissociative symptoms” meant, Dr Sarkar explained that dissociation can manifest in memory lapses and “out of body” experiences. As such, we think the Judge was entitled to find that Criterion B3 was met on Dr Sarkar’s evidence and had properly done so (<span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Remitted) </span>at [151]–[153]). Dr Sarkar’s omission to draw a specific link to Criterion B3 is not fatal. Likewise, the fact that the Judge did not make a positive finding on Criterion D1 itself is of no consequence to the present inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 In respect of Criterion B4, the Judge noted that Dr Ung’s report states that after being informed of the charge, the Applicant suffered from intense or prolonged psychological distress as there were “cues related to case triggering daily distress for a few months”. The Prosecution essentially argues that it is unclear what Dr Ung meant by this. We accept that there is some ambiguity in this part of Dr Ung’s evidence. Nonetheless, as seen from the above at [112], Dr Sarkar’s report, particularly paragraphs 42 to 43, is clear and compelling evidence that the Applicant was suffering from intense distress around the time of the Cautioned Statement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) Long Statements</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Finally, the Judge found that Applicant suffered from intense psychological distress (Criterion B4), persistent and negative beliefs about others (Criterion D2) and persistent negative emotional state (Criterion D4) during the recording of the Long Statements (<span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Remitted) </span>at [172]–[178]). Again, the Prosecution argues that there was no clear basis on the expert evidence for reaching those conclusions.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> For example, it is difficult to imagine how a finding of markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities (Criterion D5) would relate to the Applicant’s lies and omissions. Nonetheless, the specific PTSS engaged in the present case as summarised above do not pose such difficulties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 However, the Judge found that the Applicant was not able to show the connection between the PTSS and his lies and omissions (see, for example, <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted</span><span class="font-italic">) </span>at [188] and [197]). As mentioned earlier, the Judge considered that the Applicant’s persistent and negative belief about others caused him to develop a persistent paranoia of ASP Deng during the recording of the Long Statements. However, since no submission was made connecting the persistent paranoia to the Applicant’s continued lies, the Judge declined to make a finding to that effect (at [199]). We note parenthetically that of the various PTSS which the Judge found the Applicant to be experiencing, the Judge omitted to consider the effect of the Applicant’s intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) during the Cautioned Statement. However, nothing turns on that omission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The Judge’s conclusion on the effect of the PTSS on the Applicant is important and bears quoting in full (at [207]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">207  As for the issue of the extent to which PTSS affected Ilechukwu when he gave the three categories of statements, I note that the three Defence experts set out slightly different explanations as to why Ilechukwu might have lied in his statements. Dr Sarkar stated in his report that the presence of PTSD was “likely to have led to an overestimation of [the] threat to his life” which could have prompted him to utter unsophisticated and blatant falsehoods in order to save his life. Although Dr Sarkar did not say in his report that the presence of PTSS (as opposed to PTSD) would result in a similar effect, it was clear that Dr Sarkar held this view in light of his testimony at [<span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Remitted)</span>]. As for Dr Ung, he stated that the two relevant effects that PTSD had on Ilechukwu were in relation to (a) effects on his thinking and decision making and (b) hyper-arousal and avoidance behaviour. At the same time, Dr Ung also concurred with Dr Sarkar’s view that the PTSD was “likely to have led to an overestimation of [the] threat to his life”. Dr Winslow too expressed agreement with this aspect of Dr Sarkar’s opinion, and also that “the defendant was suffering from acute symptoms of PTSD with dissociation around the time that he made the inconsistent and unreliable statements (between 24 November and 21 November 2011). This could be a factor relevant in providing an unreliable account.” Dr Cheok, like the Defence experts, simply stated that there was no direct link between PTSD and lying. As the Defence relied primarily on Dr Sarkar’s view that Ilechukwu overestimated the threat to his life as a result of the symptoms, I confine my analysis solely to this aspect of his opinion. As I have already stated above at [188],<span class="font-weight-bold"> I find that the Defence failed to spell out</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> with sufficient clarity how the symptom of “intense psychological distress” caused Ilechukwu to overestimate the threat to his life during the recording of the Pocketbook Statement. For purposes of clarity, I also state that I find that the Defence had not shown how any of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">other </span><span class="font-weight-bold">PTSS caused Ilechukwu to</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> overestimate the threat to his life on a balance of probabilities in relation to the Cautioned Statement and Long Statements. </span>[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 We are somewhat puzzled by the Judge’s conclusions. As we highlighted to the Prosecution in the hearing before us, it is unclear to us why on the weight of the expert evidence, which the Judge had found to be credible and reliable, the Judge reached the conclusion that there was no connection between the Applicant’s condition and his lies and omissions. Consistent with the Judge’s position, the Prosecution repeatedly urged upon us that there is no explicable connection between the Applicant’s PTSS and the lies and omissions as well. With respect, we are unable to agree. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Certainly, we are not surprised that the experts unanimously take the position that PTSD/PTSS does not <span class="font-italic">ipso facto</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">cause</span> a sufferer to lie. However, the Applicant’s case does not hinge on proof of causation between his psychiatric ailments and his conduct, which at any rate, appears to be an impossible task as a matter of empirical science. The Applicant’s case is based on the opinion of Dr Sarkar, which Dr Ung and Dr Winslow agreed with, that the Applicant’s condition led to an <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">overestimation of the threat to his life </span>which could have prompted him to utter unsophisticated and blatant falsehoods in an attempt to save his own life. In our view, this is clearly cogent expert evidence of a sufficient connection between the Applicant’s PTSD/PTSS and his lies and omissions. Let us elaborate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 We understand Dr Sarkar’s evidence on this point to be that the Applicant’s PTSS in 2011 <span class="font-italic">affected</span> the Applicant’s capacity to appreciate the circumstances he was in and the material events. As we have explained above, this is attributable to his arrest and/or his being informed of the death penalty that came with the trafficking charge. This is not to say that he was deprived<span class="font-italic"> </span>of his cognitive capacity or that he was <span class="font-italic">non compos mentis </span>at any point, but rather that the PTSS caused the Applicant to harbour irrational or illogical notions of his circumstances <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">ncluding</span> that he was in danger even though he might have been innocent. These misconceived conceptions in turn supplied a plausible explanation for his lies because, conceivably, the Applicant was eager to save his own life and foolishly thought that by telling lies this objective could be achieved. Of course, we accept and recognise that an ordinary person without similar psychiatric ailments like the Applicant may also experience fear or perceive a threat to his life when arrested. The present case is fundamentally different, however, because the Applicant’s fear was rooted in or at least could be attributed to a relevant psychiatric condition or symptoms. The Applicant’s response was not simply a case of difference in the degree of fear experienced but rested on an epistemically distinct basis – that is, a gross misapprehension of the situation brought about by his history of PTSD and his PTSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Dr Ung explained it slightly differently while also endorsing Dr Sarkar’s explanation. His evidence was that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35. Those suffering PTSD go to great lengths to avoid being ‘re-traumatized’ <span class="font-weight-bold">(secondary to hyper-arousal and avoidance behaviour)</span>. Ilechukwu spoke of deciding to lie to avoid the death penalty. Irrespective of a diagnosis of PTSD, the fear of the death penalty may induce many to lie to save themselves. In his context, <span class="font-weight-bold">having PTSD adds significantly to such a drive to ‘save oneself’.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">“<span class="font-italic">Those who have been traumatized never want to be traumatized again; in some situations, the degree of hypervigilance can be so extreme that it resembles (and may be mistaken) for a paranoid state</span>” </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in italics in original; emphasis added in bold]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 We acknowledge that the Applicant’s behaviour and decision to lie was irrational and indeed, Dr Sarkar himself alluded to this in the course of the <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span> hearing.

</div> Even factoring for the stress that would ordinarily accompany the fact of being arrested, one would expect a reasonable accused person, if he were innocent, to be forthcoming with the truth as soon as possible. However, given the Applicant’s history of PTSD and his PTSS operating at the material time in 2011, we agree with Dr Sarkar that it may have resulted in the Applicant conjuring contrivances in a misguided attempt to distance himself from the entire event. However imprudent this overly defensive stance may appear to a reasonable bystander, in the particular circumstances of the Applicant here, we consider the explanation of Dr Sarkar and Dr Ung to be plausible. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 We note that Dr Cheok seems to take an absolute position that there is no link between the Applicant’s PTSS and his lies.

</div>
</div>
</div> Dr Cheok repeatedly states that in the scientific literature, there is no suggestion of a causal link between PTSD and lying. We have difficulty accepting Dr Cheok’s position both on the evidence and as a matter of common sense. As we have already explained, none of the experts or the parties take the position that PTSD/PTSS invariably or inexorably results in lies. That much is corroborated by the scientific literature referenced by Dr Cheok. However, Dr Cheok has not explained specifically why the Applicant’s PTSD/PTSS might not result in an overestimation of the threat to his life, which in turn might have caused him to lie. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 We do not think there is any real gap or deficiency in the expert evidence as to the connection between the Applicant’s condition and his lies. As the Prosecution acknowledged before us, the multifarious and complex domains of the human mind are not always susceptible to the prescription of neat rules or definitive causal relationships. In the present circumstances, it is difficult to imagine what else could reasonably be expected of the experts providing an explanation for the connection between the Applicant’s condition and his lies and omissions in the statements. Indeed, when pressed on this point during the hearing, the Prosecution was unable to offer a clear answer to us. When the court analyses medical evidence in particular, regard must be had to its limits. Although there may be a limit to the answers that medical science can offer at present, that does not mean that there is an absence of medically supported opinion supporting the Applicant’s case. In our judgment, there is ample credible evidence from the majority of the experts that there exists a plausible link between the Applicant’s history of PTSD, his PTSS during 2011 and his lies and omissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 In fairness to the Judge, we recognise his observations at [191]–[193] which formed a key part of the Applicant’s case before us. His observations which were made in the context of the Applicant’s dissociative reactions during the recording of the Cautioned Statement bear quoting:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">191  Thus, the primary effect of “dissociation”, as stated by Dr Sarkar, is an “inability to remember” and a “focus on protecting” oneself and “[avoiding] getting re-traumatised about” past traumatic memories.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">192  The Defence submitted that these effects experienced during the recording of the Cautioned Statement caused Ilechukwu to adopt an “overly defensive posture”. Dr Sarkar said that Ilechukwu focused on protecting himself to avoid getting re-traumatised about past memories. Dr Sarkar also said that this was why Ilechukwu avoided talking about the Black Luggage.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">193  Dr Cheok did not agree with this view. I note that Dr Sarkar did not say that this was a recognised psychiatric condition and the evidence he gave at [190] above was an opinion based on his clinical experience dealing with trauma patients. In view of this, I am unable to make a finding that this was what had happened in Ilechukwu’s case. <span class="font-weight-bold">However, it was clear from the evidence that Ilechukwu was an individual deeply affected by the traumatic memories of the Wukari massacre. While a normal person might not have lied under such circumstances, it is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not inconceivable</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> that a person with a </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">traumatic past</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> would have done so if he believed that lying would get him out of the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">traumatic predicament that he was in</span>, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that lying would be a means to “protect” oneself.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 We accept that the Judge’s remarks at [193] are somewhat oblique and inconsistent with his conclusion at [207], which we have rejected for the reasons above. It seems that whilst the Judge could not accept unreservedly Dr Sarkar’s specific postulations as to how the Applicant’s dissociative reactions were linked to his lies, he nonetheless thought that there was some rational connection between the Applicant’s childhood PTSD, his PTSS in 2011 and the lies and omissions in his statements. We agree that there was such a connection. The Applicant suffered from PTSD as a child and the combination of his arrest and being informed of the death penalty he faced in 2011 if convicted of the trafficking charge was traumatic. Having regard to Dr Sarkar’s evidence (which was endorsed by Dr Ung and Dr Winslow) as discussed above, the plausible explanation, put simply, is that because of the Applicant’s PTSS, he overestimated the threat to his life, and that could have been a cause which compelled him to lie.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 Apart from PTSD and PTSS, we should add for completeness that it was also undisputed by the experts in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>that the Applicant was below average in intelligence though not intellectually disabled.

</div> Dr Sarkar had also suggested in his report that there was some evidence that the Applicant suffered from mild neurocognitive disorder (MND) which might have caused him to persevere with non-profitable strategies when it came to problem-solving. Since these two points were not seriously pursued before the Judge and on appeal, we do not propose to dwell on them. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The correctness of </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 Having evaluated the Judge’s findings in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span>, we return to the broader question in the present application as to whether the decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>should still stand. In particular, would it still be proper for this court to draw an adverse inference against the Applicant for his lies and omissions, as was done in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [22] above)? Finally, in the totality of the circumstances, has the Applicant rebutted the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities? </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Adverse inference</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 We first turn to examine the principles for drawing adverse inferences, which were applied in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>. The starting point is s 261 of the CPC, which applies to cautioned statements. It reads:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Inferences from accused’s silence</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">261. —(1) Where in any criminal proceeding evidence is given that the accused <span class="font-weight-bold">on</span><span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold">being charged with an offence, or informed by a police officer or any other person charged</span> with the duty of investigating offences that he may be prosecuted for an offence, failed to mention any fact which <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">he </span><span class="font-weight-bold">subsequently relies</span> on in his defence, being a fact which <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">in the circumstances</span> existing at the time he could <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">reasonably have been expected</span> to mention when so questioned, charged or informed, as the case may be, the court may in determining —</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper</span>; and the failure may, on the basis of those inferences, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">of any evidence </span>given against the accused in relation to which the failure is material.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Simply put, the effect of s 261 of the CPC is that the accused person’s omission in stating a material fact for his defence in the cautioned statement allows the court to draw an adverse inference, which in turn can be used to corroborate other evidence. As the court noted in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [52], deliberate untruths or lies may equally invite the drawing of adverse inferences. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 A court may also, where appropriate, draw an adverse inference against an accused person for failing to state his defence in his long statements. If the fact or circumstance that is withheld will exculpate the accused from an offence, a court may justifiably “infer that it is an afterthought and untrue, unless the court is persuaded that there are good reasons for the omission to mention that exculpatory fact or circumstance” (<span class="font-italic">Kwek Seow Hock v Public Prosecutor</span> [2011] 3 SLR 157 at [19]; see also, <span class="font-italic">Lim Lye Huat Benny v Public Prosecutor </span>[1995] 3 SLR(R) 689 at [25]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 It is well-established that the court’s power to draw adverse inferences is a discretionary one based on the specific facts at hand, as is plain from the wording of s 261 of the CPC. In this exercise of determining whether lies and/or omissions of an accused person might be used to corroborate evidence of guilt the following requirements set out in <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> at 724 must be satisfied:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The lie told out of court is deliberate;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) It relates to a material issue;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The statement must clearly be shown to be a lie by independent evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 Conceptually, the <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>principles can be viewed as a set of guidelines for aiding the court’s determination of whether to draw a species of adverse inference predicated on the lies and omissions of an accused person. Whilst there may be a distinction between lies and omissions in some cases, whether something is a lie is a question of fact to be determined by the court. In the present case, it is clear to us that there is no meaningful distinction between the Applicant’s lies and omissions in his statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The principles in <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>have been regularly endorsed by the Singapore courts. It is pertinent to note that in England, the principles are applied in the context of directions to be given to juries where lies are being relied on as corroboration (see <span class="font-italic">Phipson on Evidence </span>(Hodge M Malek gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th ed, 2019) at para 16-09). The purpose of a <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>direction is to avoid the risk that the jury might adopt “an inadmissible chain of reasoning” that equates the accused person’s lying with guilt (<span class="font-italic">R v Middleton </span>[2001] Crim LR 251). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 An adverse inference based on lies should be drawn only under carefully prescribed circumstances. In the present case, the key element in dispute is the third limb, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>whether the lies are motivated by a realisation of guilt. In this regard, we highlight that lies can amount to corroboration of evidence of guilt if they are shown to be told out of a motive that can <span class="font-italic">only </span>be linked to his guilt: <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter </span>[2020] 1 SLR 486 at [141]. This stringency is underpinned by an evidential concern as to the reliability of lies as was highlighted by V K Rajah J (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Chee Cheong Hin Constance </span>[2006] 2 SLR 24 at [92]. Furthermore, strictly speaking, lies may be used to corroborate other evidence of guilt but are not in themselves, evidence of guilt, as emphasised by Chan Sek Keong CJ in <span class="font-italic">Kamrul Hasan Abdul Quddus v Public Prosecutor </span>[2011] SGCA 52 at [18]–[19].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 In assessing an accused person’s lies, it must be borne in mind that there exists two possible counterfactuals. First, an accused person may lie because he is guilty and there is, as a matter of common sense, a real chance that he would do so in an attempt to evade punishment. Second, an accused person who might in fact be innocent, may also lie for some reason not linked to guilt such as a misconception of circumstances attributable to a clinical condition as is the Applicant’s case. As we highlighted to the Prosecution during the hearing before us, careful consideration must be had to both scenarios before determining which one is applicable on the facts. This approach was adopted by the court in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>when it asked whether there was an innocent explanation for the lies and omissions.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Application</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 To recapitulate, in the First Statement, the Applicant’s main lie or omission was that he brought only one piece of luggage (the laptop bag found in his hotel room) to Singapore when he in fact brought in two pieces.

</div> His explanations were that: (a) he did not lie because he had not considered his laptop bag to be a piece of luggage; and (b) alternatively, he lied because he was told by the CNB officers that there had been an arrest on the night of 13 November 2011 and two packets of drugs were recovered from the Black Luggage (<span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal) </span>at [62]–[66]). As noted earlier, the court in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>rejected both explanations (at [44]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159 One issue that arises in relation to the Applicant’s explanations for the First Statement is that the Applicant was arguably still lying in <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal) </span>at [62]–[64]. As noted above, one of the Applicant’s explanations was essentially that his evidence on the First Statement that he only brought one piece of luggage into Singapore was <span class="font-italic">not</span> a lie because he had not considered his laptop bag to be a piece of luggage. On one view, the Applicant appears to resort to another lie (that he had not considered his laptop bag to be a piece of luggage) to explain the lie in his First Statement (that he only brought one piece of luggage into Singapore). This was even though by this point in 2014, there was no suggestion that the PTSD and/or PTSS were in issue. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">160 The relevant parts of the Applicant’s evidence at trial in 2014 are as follows (<span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [61]–[63]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61  After his arrest, Ilechukwu had insisted in all of his statements that he did not have anything to do with the Black Luggage or Hamidah. This was subsequently proven to be untrue. The prosecution submitted that these lies showed that he knew that the Black Luggage contained illicit drugs, otherwise he would have come clean upon questioning.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62  <span class="font-weight-bold">In his first statement recorded</span> shortly after he was arrested, Ilechukwu said he brought only one luggage into Singapore:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: When you arrive at airport in Singapore, how many luggage did you bring?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A: One</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q: Is that the luggage?

The prosecution submitted that Ilechukwu’s explanation cannot be true in light of the next question ([62] above). <span class="font-weight-bold">In response, Ilechukwu claimed that everything, including his laptop bag, had been taken out of the hotel</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> room and the officer did not point to any bag when the statement was taken.</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">161 The Applicant’s evidence in <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal) </span>should be construed carefully. The Applicant’s clear position from the beginning of <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal) </span>until now is that he brought two pieces of luggage into Singapore. What the Applicant was seeking to do at trial, as quoted above, was to explain why he had said in his First Statement that he only brought one piece of luggage into Singapore. We note that the Judge in <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal) </span>had considered it unlikely that the Applicant would have been mistaken as to the number of pieces of luggage and rejected his explanation (at [64]). This was affirmed by the court in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>at [35].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">162 As we have already explained at length, each of the two events, the arrest and the Applicant being informed of the death penalty, would separately constitute a Criterion A traumatic event in the present case primarily because of the sensitisation effect. This furnishes a possible innocent explanation for the Applicant’s lies in his statements, including the question of the number of pieces of luggage he brought into Singapore. That the Applicant in the first-instance trial in 2014 tried to explain away the lie on some other basis other than his PTSD and/or PTSS is unsurprising. The reality is that at the time of the trial leading to <span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal)</span>, there was no suggestion whatsoever that there might be a medical basis which could provide an innocent explanation for the Applicant’s lies and omissions in his statements. To this extent, we agree with counsel for the Applicant that in so far as his defence in 2014 appears to be untruthful, little weight should be accorded to that and it should not be counted against him when viewed in the entire context.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">163 In the Cautioned Statement, the Applicant said he “did not give anything to anybody” and maintained that he had only left his hotel room to “change money and look around” when in fact he had gone out to pass the Black Luggage to Hamidah.

</div> Also, Kingsley was not mentioned in any of his statements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">165 It is not necessary to rehash at this juncture the Applicant’s explanations for his continued lies and omissions in the Cautioned Statement and Long Statements. These have been traversed earlier (see [20] above). It suffices to recall that the Court of Appeal had disbelieved all of them (at [51]–[58] of <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>) and found that there was “no acceptable explanation for the lies save for his realisation of his guilt” (at [61] thereof). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">166 In our judgment, there is now a plausible innocent explanation that accounts for the Applicant’s lies and omissions in his statements. The critical new finding that emerges from <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>as we have analysed it, is that there is a plausible connection between the Applicant’s PTSS and the lies and omissions. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">167 In the light of the medical evidence connecting the Applicant’s history of PTSD and experiencing of PTSS in 2011 to his lies and omissions, it can no longer be said with a reasonable degree of confidence that the Applicant’s motive for the lies and omissions can <span class="font-italic">only</span> be attributed to a realisation of guilt. To reiterate, we accept the evidence of Dr Sarkar, Dr Ung and Dr Winslow that the Applicant’s history of PTSD and in particular his PTSS arising out of the events in 2011 may have led him to grossly overestimate the threat on his life. This may in turn have prompted the Applicant to utter the unsophisticated and blatant falsehoods in his statements in an attempt to escape from the death penalty and to save his life. This ostensibly imprudent and irrational response must also be considered with the persistent paranoia which the Applicant harboured towards ASP Deng, which in our view may explain the Applicant’s continued lies even during the making of the Long Statements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Therefore, it is plausible that the Applicant’s lies and omissions in his statements were the result of his PTSS rather than a realisation of guilt. In the circumstances, it is unsafe to draw any adverse inference against the Applicant from his lies and omissions. Consequently, it is also inappropriate to rely on the Applicant’s lies and omissions to impugn his creditworthiness as had been done in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>at [62].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 That however is not the end of the matter. In <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>, it was the numerous lies and omissions – which had no innocent explanation save for the Applicant’s guilty mind – that tipped the scales and led the court to find that the presumption under MDA was not rebutted by the Applicant.

At the same time, the “inherent difficulties of proving a negative” must be borne in mind so that the burden of rebutting the relevant presumption “should not be made so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge” (<span class="font-italic">Harven a/l Segar v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2017] 1 SLR 771 at [2]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">172 We also highlight the following observations made by the majority of the court in <span class="font-italic">Gopu Jaya Raman v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 1 SLR 499 at [25]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In this setting, <span class="font-italic">there is only one fact that is controversial: the Appellant’s knowledge that the drugs were hidden in the Motorcycle</span>.

To determine this fact, a delicate and fact-sensitive inquiry is required, in the context of which we must unpack and examine each relevant fact or piece of evidence to assess whether it supports one or both possibilities. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">A fact that is consistent with both possibilities is likely to be probatively neutral unlike a fact that is consistent with only one of the two possibilities.</span> However, although the Prosecution has a statutory presumption operating in its favour, when it comes to assessing the evidence in order to determine whether the presumption has been rebutted, the starting point should be neutral with no predilection for either conclusion. The real significance of the statutory presumption is that it reverses the burden of proof. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">But once the evidence has been led, it must be evaluated neutrally to determine whether the presumption has been rebutted.

What remains then is to evaluate the other evidence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">174 The Applicant’s evidence from the outset was that he was in the business of selling electronics in Nigeria and had come to Singapore to purchase second-hand electronics for resale back home.

However, that does not necessarily mean that the Applicant was part of the plan (<span class="font-italic">HC </span><span class="font-italic">(Acquittal) </span>at [51]). Despite the delay at immigration, the Judge also observed that the Applicant remained composed and went ahead to collect the Black Luggage instead of walking away. From the CCTV footage, he did not appear to be flustered. He was also unflustered when the Black Luggage was put through the X-ray machine and physically checked by an officer. If he were not an innocent participant, it would be rather remarkable that he proceeded to collect the Black Luggage and had remained calm at all material times at Changi Airport as noted by the Judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">179 Furthermore, the fact that the Black Luggage had been checked several times both in Nigeria (according to the Applicant’s evidence which we are inclined to believe) and in Singapore (which is undisputed) and yet yielded nothing, is an objective factor relevant to our assessment as well. The reality is that the drugs in question were only found after the Black Luggage was cut open at the Woodlands Checkpoint after Hamidah was arrested.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">180 When the Applicant arrived at Hotel 81, he realised he did not have enough Singapore dollars on him and thus went out to a moneychanger located across the street from the hotel. Notably, the Applicant left the Black Luggage at the hotel lobby for about 12 minutes before returning. Whilst it may be true that the safer and least suspicious option available to the Applicant at that point might have been to stow the Black Luggage at the lobby rather than carting it along, we have some doubts as to whether the Applicant had made such a calculated decision then. As a first-time visitor to Singapore, this was not a place he was familiar with. It is entirely possible for someone with the knowledge of the drugs in his possession to hold onto the Black Luggage without necessarily arousing suspicion. Indeed, this may be the more prudent option as compared to leaving it at an unfamiliar hotel lobby. On balance, we think this fact lends further weight to the perception that the Applicant probably did not know that there were drugs in the Black Luggage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 Finally, the circumstances surrounding the Applicant’s meeting with Hamidah are also notable. The Applicant’s evidence was that he had been waiting for Hamidah at a bus stop in Clarke Quay but Hamidah was unable to find him. Thus, the Applicant approached a Caucasian male who was also at the bus stop so that he could give directions to Hamidah. It seems somewhat unusual to us that anyone who is knowingly involved in a criminal enterprise would voluntarily approach and interact with a third party, since that would carry with it the real risk of being identified subsequently. More unusual was that the Applicant agreed to join Hamidah on what was to all accounts a joyride after he had passed the Black Luggage to her. This clearly prolonged the risk of the Applicant getting caught with the Black Luggage. As noted in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [82], this was one of the strongest points in the Applicant’s favour. Moreover, this was a country he was totally unfamiliar with and if he were up to no good, the natural instinct would have been to leave at the soonest possible moment. We find it difficult to disagree with the Judge’s observations that the Applicant’s behaviour is more consistent with someone who did not have any knowledge of the drugs in the Black Luggage (<span class="font-italic">HC (Acquittal) </span>at [54]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 It is a trite principle that an appellate court is usually slow to overturn the factual findings of a trial judge especially where the finding is based on the oral testimony of witnesses (see <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>at [83]–[84] citing <span class="font-italic">ADF v Public Prosecutor and another appeal </span>[2010] 1 SLR 874 at [16] and <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Farid bin Mohd Yusop </span>[2015] 3 SLR 16 at [53]). The present is such a case. Having analysed the totality of the evidence apart from the lies and omissions, we find that it is more probable than not that the Applicant did <span class="font-italic">not </span><span class="font-italic">know </span>that there were drugs in the Black Luggage. The Applicant has consistently maintained that he came to Singapore for a business purpose and was asked by Kingsley to help pass the Black Luggage – which was checked multiple times – and it seems to us that both these assertions are plausible and credible, viewed in the light of all the circumstances alluded to at [180]–[181]. The picture that emerges from the evidence is that the Applicant had grossly misjudged Izuchukwu and Kingsley, and naively believed that he was doing a simple favour in return for promised business contacts. Unwittingly, he had been deceived into transporting drugs on their behalf to Kingsley’s contact in Singapore.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 In the premises, without the adverse inferences based on the Applicant’s lies, the remaining evidence is consistent with him not having knowledge that there were drugs in the Black Luggage. The Judge had believed his claim of ignorance. For both Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA and myself, who were in the <span class="font-italic">coram</span> which delivered the decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction),</span> if the evidence adduced in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span> had been before us then, we would not have held that the lies and omissions in the statements of the Applicant tipped the balance and caused us to overturn the acquittal of the Judge. There would have been nothing that tipped the balance and the acquittal of the Judge would have been allowed to stand. The Chief Justice and Judith Prakash JA who join this enlarged <span class="font-italic">coram</span> to hear this case are also of that view. The third member of the <span class="font-italic">coram</span> which decided <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>, Tay Yong Kwang JA, is of a different view.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 While we stated at the outset (at [3]), that the medical evidence – which we have considered to be determinative for the reasons explained – arose out of fortuitous circumstances, those circumstances were very much part of the normal process which would apply following the overturning of the acquittal decision of the High Court. What is exceptional is the fact that the evidence that the Applicant could possibly be affected by PTSD came from the Prosecution’s psychiatrist, Dr Sarkar, when he interviewed the Applicant to determine his mental health for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence. As mentioned, if that evidence adduced in <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>concerning the Applicant’s PTSD/PTSS had been before the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>, the outcome would have been different. In all the circumstances, we find that the decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>is demonstrably wrong and the Court of Appeal’s conviction is hereby set aside. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 Accordingly, we allow the application and affirm the order of the High Court acquitting the Applicant of the trafficking charge. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Sundaresh Menon             Andrew Phang Boon Leong     Judith Prakash<br/>Chief Justice                     Judge of Appeal     Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"><br/>Chao Hick Tin<br/>Senior Judge</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Author text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Tay Yong Kwang JA (dissenting):</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Introduction</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 The Applicant was charged under s 5(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) for trafficking in not less than 1,963.3g of methamphetamine (“the drugs”) contained in a black luggage (“the Black Luggage”) which he had brought into Singapore and handed over to Hamidah Binte Awang (“Hamidah”) subsequently.

</div> On the day of his departure from Nigeria, he met Kingsley and Izuchukwu at the airport there. Kingsley passed him the Black Luggage, told him it contained clothes and asked him to pass it to a contact in Singapore. The Applicant asserted that he did not know of this in advance and that he did not have any details of Kingsley’s contact but agreed to do this nevertheless as a favour to Kingsley. The Applicant claimed that the request that he convey the Black Luggage assured him that there would be somebody waiting for him in Singapore. The fact that Kingsley had called this person from the Lagos airport further reassured him.

At Hotel 81, he left the Black Luggage at the hotel lobby for about 12 minutes. He got into Hamidah’s car even after handing her the Black Luggage. The Judge found all these actions to be inconsistent with the Applicant having knowledge that there were illegal drugs in the Black Luggage (at [52], [54] and [60]).

It was equally possible that the Applicant had decided that the best way forward for him in the circumstances was to lie about the Black Luggage and deny any association with it because he realised that there had been an arrest the night before and that a luggage with two packets of drugs was found and/or that he had been arrested for drug trafficking (the Applicant’s “alternative case”) (at [66]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) In respect of the Applicant’s cautioned statement recorded on 14 November 2011 at 9.41 pm (the “Cautioned Statement”) and the four statements recorded under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) between 21 and 24 November 2011 (“the Long Statements”), the Applicant explained at the trial that he lied or omitted information because he had not been informed of the full facts surrounding his arrest and having heard that the trafficking charge carried the death penalty, he decided that the safest course of action was to deny everything that was not then in his possession. The Judge found that while the Applicant had been defensive and “perhaps excessively so”, this did not show unequivocally that he knew about the drugs in the Black Luggage before<span class="font-italic"> </span>he was arrested. The Judge held that it could instead be explained by a realisation after his arrest that there were drugs in the Black Luggage. This was especially since the Judge found that the Applicant’s conduct before his arrest was not consistent with a person who had knowledge of the drugs. As he was suspicious about the investigating officer, ASP Deng Kaile (“ASP Deng”), that could have contributed to his decision to deny everything concerning the Black Luggage and Hamidah (at [67]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195 The Judge found that the Applicant had rebutted the presumption of knowledge of the drugs under s 18(2) of the MDA on a balance of probabilities.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 In finding that the Applicant had knowledge of the drugs in the Black Luggage, <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span> found that his defence was, in the final analysis, an unlikely account from an unreliable source (at [89]). This was since the Applicant’s version of the facts was quite improbable, although perhaps not to the degree that it would by itself justify appellate interference (at [87]). In particular, there was little evidence to corroborate the Applicant’s claim that he had come to Singapore for business and the US$5,000 he had brought was a rather small amount if he had intended to trade in electronic goods (at [66]-[68]). The Applicant’s account was suspicious for a number of reasons. First, the Applicant had travelled out of Nigeria for the first time, allegedly for a serious business trip, without the contact’s name, details or a clear itinerary. He also had a hotel booking for only one night. Second, the account of how compliant the Applicant had been to Kingsley’s instructions, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, to carry the Black Luggage or to stay in Hotel 81 was suspicious. Third, the numerous text messages the Applicant received upon arrival in Changi Airport suggested it was not a legitimate business<span class="font-italic"> </span>trip (at [71] to [78]). The sole objective fact in the Applicant’s favour was the fact that he got into the car with Hamidah after handing over the Black Luggage to her but this fact was of limited value. The fact that the Applicant claimed the Black Luggage despite having been delayed at the immigration section in the airport here and that he was willing to leave the Black Luggage in the lobby in the care of the staff of Hotel 81 for 12 minutes while he went to exchange money did not indicate he did not know there were drugs therein (at [79]-[82] and [88]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 If the case had turned solely on the Judge’s assessment of the Applicant’s credibility, appellate intervention might not have been warranted (at [87]). What tipped the scales were the numerous lies and omissions made by the Applicant in his statements, for which there was no innocent explanation (at [88]). In respect of the First Statement, <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>rejected the Applicant’s assertion that he did not lie. However, unlike the Judge, <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>also<span class="font-italic"> </span>rejected the Applicant’s alternative case (see [194(b)] above), finding that it was speculative and the evidential basis for it threadbare. This was since none of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers testified that they had said anything regarding Hamidah’s arrest, that two packets of drugs were found in a bag or that the Applicant was being arrested for drug trafficking. The Applicant also did not assert in his evidence that he had been told this (at [35]-[42]). Rather, the Applicant testified that the first time he had any inkling that the charge against him was related to the Black Luggage was when his counsel visited him (at [43]). <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span> therefore found that he had not only lied in the First Statement but was also untruthful about why he had lied. The lie might not have been held against the Applicant if he had come clean afterwards but he did not (at [45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 In respect of the lies and omissions in the Cautioned Statement, <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>held that the Applicant’s explanations that he was confused and the investigating officer had not been “open” or specific about the circumstances of the case were convenient excuses (at [48], [50] and [51]). By this time, as was his position in the alternative case, the Applicant must have known about the nature and consequences of the charge and that it related to the Black Luggage and its transfer to Hamidah. He had also said he understood the caution perfectly.

</div>
</div> The explanations given for the lies in the Long Statements were broadly similar, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that the Applicant had decided to lie out of fear as his life was at stake and that he had decided that denying anything that was not in his possession would be the safer course to take as he did not know the full facts of what had happened. We similarly rejected these explanations in relation to the Long Statements (at [56] and [58]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 The Applicant did not provide any good reasons for his omission to mention key exculpatory facts or circumstances, in particular, Kingsley, who was essential to his defence. This could have been done without having to say anything about the Black Luggage. The Judge should have drawn an adverse inference in this regard (at [58]). The Judge’s observation that the Applicant’s defensive behaviour did not show “unequivocally” that he had the requisite knowledge prior to his arrest suggested that he might have overlooked that the burden of proof was on the Applicant and not the Prosecution to show that he did not have such knowledge. While the Prosecution did not need to rely on the lies in the statements as corroborative proof of guilt, they were more consistent with the Applicant having had knowledge of the drugs in the Black Luggage before the arrest (at [59]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 The lies were deliberate, related to material issues and have been proven independently to be untrue. Further, the Applicant’s excuses for the lies were wholly unsatisfactory and unbelievable and there was no acceptable explanation for the lies save for his realisation of guilt (at [61]). These lies met the criteria in <span class="font-italic">Regina v Lucas (Ruth) </span>[1981] QB 720 (“<span class="font-italic">Lucas</span>”) and could be used as corroborative evidence of guilt (“<span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>lies”). Finally, a lie not corroborative of guilt could still be relied upon to find that an accused person was not creditworthy. The Judge did not have sufficient regard to the lies and omissions in concluding that the Applicant’s evidence at trial was generally credible (at [62] and [63]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The remittal </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 Psychiatric reports were obtained with a view to considering whether the Applicant had grounds to argue that he should be sentenced to life imprisonment under s 33B(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) MDA on the basis of diminished responsibility. A medical report was produced by Dr Jaydip Sarkar (“Dr Sarkar”) when the Applicant was assessed by the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”). In this report, Dr Sarkar opined that the Applicant was suffering from, among other things, PTSD with dissociative symptoms at the time the various statements were taken by the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers. He opined that the acute symptoms of PTSD may have been a factor relevant to the unreliable account provided by the Applicant and that the presence of PTSD “is likely to have led to an overestimation of threat to his life which could have prompted him to utter unsophisticated and blatant falsehoods in order to save his life”.

</div>
</div>
</div> The IMH report was “new” evidence since it could not have been obtained earlier even with reasonable diligence. In <span class="font-italic">CA (Reopening)</span>, this court applied a slightly modified form of the principles laid down in <span class="font-italic">Kho Jabing</span> due to the unique turn of events which led to the production of the IMH Report. As such, it sufficed that the IMH report was <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>reliable, substantial and raised a “powerful probability” that the decision in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>was wrong (at [34], [36] and [45]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204  The matter was therefore remitted to the Judge with directions for him to receive evidence from Dr Sarkar. Following several criminal motions, the final terms of reference for the Judge’s determination were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) whether the Applicant was suffering from PTSD;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) the typical effects of PTSD on a sufferer;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) if the Applicant was indeed suffering from PTSD:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) the period of time during which PTSD affected him;</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(ii) the effects of PTSD on him during that period; and </div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(iii) the extent to which PTSD affected him when he gave his statements to the CNB;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(d) if the Applicant was not suffering from PTSD, whether the Applicant was suffering from PTSS. If he was suffering from PTSS:</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(i) the precise symptoms should be identified;</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(ii) the period of time during which PTSS affected him;</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(iii) the effects of PTSS on him during that period; and</div><div class="Judg-List-2 text-justify">(iv) the extent to which PTSS affected him when he gave his statements to the CNB.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 The Judge’s decision following the remitted hearing is in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Hamidah Binte Awang and another </span>[2019] SGHC 161 (“<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span>”). The Judge’s conclusions were: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Applicant was <span class="font-italic">not </span>suffering from PTSD during the time the various statements were taken, although he had suffered from PTSD as a child (“childhood PTSD”) up to an indefinite time before the arrest (at [204]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Applicant had been suffering from various PTSS when the statements were recorded from him (at [205]-[206]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Nevertheless, the Judge held that the Applicant had not shown on a balance of probabilities how any of the PTSS had caused him to overestimate the threat to his life during the recording of the various statements (at [207]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Adili (the appellant in <span class="font-italic">Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor </span>mentioned at [196] above) was called by the Prosecution to testify at the remitted hearing. Adili had flown into Singapore on the same flight as the Applicant and was arrested for drug trafficking in a separate operation. The Prosecution called Adili to give evidence on the events in Nigeria prior to his arrest on 14 November 2011. Adili’s account contradicted the Applicant’s evidence as to how the Applicant had obtained the Black Luggage from Kingsley. Adili stated that the Applicant had the Black Luggage with him in Izuchukwu’s house (see <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [50] and [51]). According to the Prosecution, this showed that the Applicant lied<span class="font-italic"> </span>to Dr Sarkar. Since it was not contended that the Applicant was suffering from PTSD or PTSS during the 2014 trial (or as the Prosecution argued before us, in 2016, when he was seen by Dr Sarkar), this would mean that the Kingsley story was fabricated intentionally by the Applicant during the trial. The Prosecution reasoned from this that the omission of the Kingsley story from the Applicant’s statements was not due to any PTSD or PTSS and that the lies in the same statements were similarly not caused by any such conditions.

If Adili had been called in the committal hearing, the Applicant would have had the opportunity to prepare for his cross-examination of Adili, to cross-examine the Prosecution’s other witnesses and to call his own witnesses on this issue. Since this was not done, the Judge declined to make any finding on whether Adili’s evidence affected the veracity of the Applicant’s account to Dr Sarkar (at [51] and [52]). Before this court, the Prosecution argued that the Kingsley story was raised by the Applicant for the first time on the sixth day of the 2014 trial and that they had no notice of this at the committal hearing stage. The Prosecution observed that, in any event, the court in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>found that the Prosecution had adduced sufficient evidence to make out its case without Adili’s testimony.

We accept that this is correct. Firstly, as all the experts agreed, there is no direct link between PTSD and lying. Secondly, even if there were a direct link between PTSD and lying, there remains the irreducible possibility that the Applicant lied because he was guilty. The proof of this is immediately apparent when we contemplate, for argument’s sake, the hypothetical scenario of someone who suffers from PTSD <span class="font-italic">and</span> traffics drugs. PTSD and criminal activity are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, we concede that we are unable to prove (solely on the basis of the medical evidence and without reference to the wider issue of the Applicant’s guilt or innocence) that, on the balance of probabilities, the various PTSS caused him to lie. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 Instead, the Applicant confines his submissions to asserting a possibility that the lies were caused by his PTSS.

However, the experts called by the Applicant appeared to be in broad agreement, even if they had not identified the same symptoms in their reports. The Judge sifted through the evidence and gave detailed reasons for each PTSS that he found was exhibited by the Applicant at the relevant time. He also explained why the contentions of the Prosecution and of Dr Christopher Cheok (“Dr Cheok”) did not persuade him. On the totality of the evidence, I see no reason to disagree with the Judge’s findings on this point.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">PTSS in 2011</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 Mr Eugene Thuraisingam (“Mr Thuraisingam”) accepted that the Judge was correct to find that only certain PTSS but not PTSD existed in 2011.

This was accepted by the Judge (see <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted)</span> at [56]) and is evident from a plain reading of the DSM-5 criteria. This meant that if the Prosecution is correct in suggesting that there had been no Criterion A event in 2011, the clinical manifestations of the Applicant would not have been, strictly speaking, “PTSS” as defined in the DSM-5. In any case, Dr Cheok did not deny that the Applicant exhibited “stress-related symptoms”.

Dr Sarkar, in opining that the Applicant’s PTSD was triggered by the arrest, relied on the fact that the Applicant described his arrest using terms such as “war” and “chaos”.

</div> I question the extent to which the words used by the Applicant should be given such weight, particularly since, as the Prosecution noted, the Applicant had described the arrest elsewhere in much less dramatic terms. It is also hard to see how being arrested by the CNB officers would have been anything like the Wukari massacre he had experienced. The Applicant might have meant simply that the situation was chaotic and caused him to be fearful, which would be understandable even for someone without PTSD/PTSS. This was also alluded to in the Judge’s observation that while it was possible<span class="font-italic"> </span>that the fear he felt during the arrest was related to the Wukari massacre, it was equally possible that he was fearful because he was under arrest in a foreign country (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [146]). This is significant since any “intense psychological distress” he experienced as a result of the latter would not, strictly speaking, be PTSS. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">226 Notwithstanding these difficulties, I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the arrest constituted a Criterion A event. I also proceed on the basis that the PTSS of “intense psychological distress” was exhibited by the Applicant at the material time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The reading of the charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">227 In any event, there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the reading of a charge constituted a Criterion A event.

</div> Whether or not the Applicant suffered from sleep disturbance, regard must be had to the specific<span class="font-italic"> </span>nature of the PTSS in considering whether or not it might provide an innocent explanation for the lies and omissions.

The pertinent issue, therefore, is what effect, if any, the PTSD or PTSS had on the Applicant’s mental state when he was answering questions and on any inclination or decision to lie.

</div> I agree. The presence of PTSD and/or PTSS must be capable of supplying a reason for the lies or material omissions that would be consistent with innocence. As will be discussed later, the expert evidence is unanimous in the view that having PTSD/PTSS is not equivalent to being a liar or someone incapacitated from telling the truth or incapable of differentiating truth from falsehood.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Burden of proof</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 The Applicant argued that the Prosecution bears the burden of showing that the lies and omissions were motivated by a realisation of and/or desire to conceal guilt. This was because, other than knowing possession, s 18(1) of the MDA does not presume any other fact. The Applicant submitted that where a primary fact is equally capable of bearing a favourable and an unfavourable inference, the court should treat the primary fact as probatively neutral (relying on <span class="font-italic">Gopu Jaya Raman v Public Prosecutor </span>[2018] 1 SLR 499). As it is the Prosecution who alleges that the Applicant lied because of guilt, it is the Prosecution which must prove this fact pursuant to s 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“EA”), regardless of whether this fact is relied upon to prove knowing possession beyond a reasonable doubt or to argue that the Applicant has not rebutted the s 18(1) MDA presumption on a balance of probabilities.

</div> The Applicant contended also that placing the burden of proof on the Prosecution would not be unduly lenient to accused persons. If it is established that there were lies or omissions in an investigative statement, this would normally call for an explanation from the accused person, failing which, the court may be justified in holding that the accused person has failed to discharge his or her evidential burden of “keeping alive” the issue of motive. Further, even if the Prosecution fails to show that the lies and omissions were actuated by a guilty motive, the court will still have to evaluate all the evidence in determining whether the accused person has successfully rebutted the presumption.

</div> At trial, however, the Applicant sought to discharge this burden by advancing the story about Kingsley. This was “barely” sufficient to shift the evidential burden to the Prosecution. The Prosecution discharged its evidential burden by (a) proving that the Applicant had told lies and made material omissions in his various statements and showing that he had no good reason for them save to conceal his knowledge that the drugs were in the Black Luggage; and (b) by cross-examining him to expose the incredibility of the account he gave at trial.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 Under s 18(1) MDA, the Applicant is presumed to have had knowing possession of the thing later discovered to be a controlled drug. As the Prosecution sought to rely on this presumption, it did not, at least at the outset, need to adduce evidence of the presumed fact. However, in seeking to bolster its case and to challenge the Applicant’s account, it sought to assert that the lies and omissions were <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>lies. As such, the starting point for the analysis is s 105 of the Evidence Act, which provides that the burden of proof as to any particular fact falls on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person. As it was the Prosecution who sought to rely on the alleged <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>lies as part of its case, the burden falls upon it to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>requirements were met.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 This would first require the Prosecution to show that the Applicant lied about a material issue. The mere fact of a material lie would ordinarily call for an explanation from the accused person. This would be consistent with the case law on drawing adverse inferences from an accused person’s failure to mention key facts in his defence in his cautioned statement. Where the Prosecution can show that it was a deliberate lie which relates to an ingredient of the charge, a logical nexus between the lies and guilt would be shown. In the present case, there was no dispute that the Black Luggage was very material to the charge because the Applicant brought it into Singapore and it was found to have drugs concealed in it. The Applicant acknowledged that he lied deliberately not once but several times in respect of the Black Luggage. Once such lies and omissions were proved by the Prosecution and indeed they were admitted by the Applicant, the obvious and entirely logical question that arises is why the Applicant should seek assiduously and consistently to deny any knowledge of or to disavow any connection with the Black Luggage if he really thought that the Black Luggage contained merely clothes which a friend of his friend had requested him to deliver to someone in Singapore. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 In practically all such cases, who else but the person who lied or omitted material facts could explain why he lied or made the omissions? The Prosecution certainly would not be able to. Apparently, none of the experts in this case could either as they had acknowledged that they could not read the mind of the Applicant when he decided to lie or to withhold material information. The evidential burden therefore naturally and logically shifted to the Applicant to show that there was some other motive(s) for his lies. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 This is completely consonant with s 108 of the EA which provides that when any fact is especially with the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him. Illustration (a) in that section also states that when a person does an act with some intention other than that which the character and circumstances of the act suggest, the burden of proving that intention is upon him. If the Applicant succeeds in showing some other motive(s) for his many lies, the Prosecution’s case on <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> lies would contain a reasonable doubt. The Prosecution has to eliminate other possible innocent motives only if these appear from its own evidence or are raised by the Applicant. This the Prosecution can do by cross-examination of the Applicant and his witnesses or by adducing contrary evidence. If the law were that the Prosecution must prove that the Applicant could have no other possible innocent motives for his lies and omissions, it would be imposing on the Prosecution the impossible task of proving multiple negatives in having to show that none of the innumerable reasons why an accused person might lie applied to the particular case. It is therefore only if the Prosecution is unable to rebut the innocent motives or reasons raised by the accused person or which arise from the Prosecution’s own evidence that the accused person’s lies would not satisfy the <span class="font-italic">Lucas </span>requirements and therefore would not be corroborative evidence of guilt. However, such lies could still be relevant in assessing the accused person’s credibility (see <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span> at [62] and [63]). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Application to the present case</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 It is not disputed, in the present case, that there was no direct link between lying and PTSD/PTSS.

The issue is whether either of them could be supported by the evidence such that the inference for the Applicant’s lies and omissions is not that they were motivated by a realisation of guilt and fear of the truth. There are two main matters to consider. First, the lies and omissions were direct and specific and the Applicant chose to make them deliberately. Second, the evidence of the Applicant’s experts indicated that there were various PTSS operating on him such that he might not have responded in the same manner as an individual without PTSS. Even the Applicant acknowledged that the evidence did not show a definitive or probable “causal link” between the PTSS and the lies. Instead, the Applicant only put his arguments at the level of a possibility,

</div> at the time of the arrest and when the First Statement was recorded (see <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [148] and [182]). This was a finding he reached primarily on the basis of Dr Sarkar’s remarks that the experience of being made a captive and of having the officers barge through the door was “symbolically similar” not just to what he had experienced or seen during the Wukari massacre but also “at several points during his adult life” (see <span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [136] and [138]). The Judge also noted the Applicant’s testimony that he was fearful at the time of the arrest and that he had described it as being like “war”, with “everyone scattering” (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at<span class="font-italic"> </span>[146]). However, the Judge found that the Applicant failed to spell out with sufficient clarity how the “intense psychological distress” experienced by him at the time the statement was recorded caused him to overestimate the threat to his life, which in turn caused him to lie. He was therefore not prepared to accept the Applicant’s submissions on this point and made no finding on whether the “intense psychological distress” suffered by the Applicant indirectly caused him to lie (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [188]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">252 I agree with the Judge’s assessment on this point. I can accept that an accused person whose hotel room was raided suddenly by a group of officers could be quite frightened and shocked at least for the first few minutes. Even so, this issue also raises the question why the Applicant could not have simply explained during the 2014 trial that he lied in the First Statement because he was so overwhelmed by the CNB officers’ actions that they evoked in his mind the Wukari incident and whatever other incidents that shocked him during his adult life. I do not think anyone needs to have a diagnosis of PTSD or PTSS or has to be told that he has some psychiatric problem before he is able to make such a simple explanation, especially if he is truly innocent of any wrongdoing. As we have seen above, the Applicant chose to lie again in court instead of stating this purported truth.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">253 Further, while the Applicant might have been frightened and shocked and going on the basis that he was still in that state when the First Statement was recorded about two hours after the raid on his hotel room, it is extremely hard to accept that he thought the best thing to do in a foreign land when arrested and questioned by law enforcement officers was to lie about the Black Luggage instead of telling the simple truth that all he did was to bring the Black Luggage containing clothes into Singapore to hand over to a contact here. On his own evidence, he came to Singapore hoping to do business by buying second hand electronic goods. He was obviously quite comfortable and confident about this country as he came here without any concrete idea as to who or where he was supposed to do business with except for some nebulous and seemingly fluid information allegedly given to him while he was in Nigeria. His own evidence about moving hotel on arrival here also showed that he had no firm plans on where he was going to stay even for the first night. Certainly, he did not say that he thought that Singapore was a dangerous place with crooked law enforcement officers who could not be trusted. The Applicant told Dr Sarkar that he trusted Kingsley because Kingsley was Izuchukwu’s friend and the Applicant trusted Izuchukwu completely.

</div> Given the allegedly naïve trust that he had placed in Izuchukwu and Kingsley, it was plainly implausible that his first thoughts after arrest were that there was something illegal about the Black Luggage that Kingsley had handed to him in the presence of Izuchukwu and that the only safe course for him was to lie and deny any knowledge or connection with the Black Luggage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">254 Before us, the Applicant sought to revisit the alternative case that he ran in the 2014 trial, namely, that he lied in the First Statement because he<span class="font-italic"> </span>realised that there had been an arrest the night before in which a luggage with two packets of drugs were found and/or<span class="font-italic"> </span>that he had been arrested for drug trafficking and therefore decided that the best way forward was to lie about the Black Luggage.

</div> If this were true, it would show that there was also no reason for him to seek to distance himself completely from the Black Luggage by telling the lies in the First Statement. Yet, the Applicant’s only reason for distancing himself from the Black Luggage was to “protect” himself because he somehow knew after the arrest that the Black Luggage must have contained drugs. I therefore similarly reject the Applicant’s PTSS Explanation. I think the only reason that there was a need for him to lie in order to “save himself” was if he knew about the drugs concealed in the Black Luggage. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">256 In my view, the Prosecution’s description of the Applicant’s testimony as an “edifice” of lies upon lies was apt and the experts’ evidence, to the limited extent that they addressed the link between intense psychological distress and lying on the specific facts of the present case, should therefore be viewed with circumspection. For the foregoing reasons, I am not persuaded that the intense psychological distress experienced by the Applicant during the recording of the First Statement provided an innocent explanation for his lie. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Cautioned Statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">257 In the Cautioned Statement, the Applicant stated that:

I was in my hotel room and there was a knock and they said Police and I opened the door. They came in asked me where my luggage. I told them this is all I have. They asked me if I go out. I told them I only go to change money and look around. They searched the place and they found nothing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">A number of untruths can be discerned from the Cautioned Statement. First, it is common ground that the Applicant had handed over the Black Luggage to Hamidah and the statement that he did not “give anything to anybody” was therefore patently untrue. Secondly, assuming that he did not think that his laptop bag could be considered a piece of “luggage” (as he had initially claimed in relation to the First Statement), it should have been apparent to him that the question “where my luggage” also referred to the Black Luggage, which was not in the room at that time. Finally, his claim to have left the hotel only to change money and to look around was also untrue, since he also left later to hand over the Black Luggage to Hamidah. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">258 The Judge found that at the time the Cautioned Statement was recorded (which was about 9.41pm, more than ten hours after the arrest), the Applicant was suffering from dissociative reactions (Criterion B3)<span class="font-italic"> </span>and intense and prolonged psychological distress (Criterion B4) (<span class="font-italic">HC (Remitted) </span>at [154] and [158]). While the Judge did not make express findings on the effects of Criterion B4 on the Cautioned Statement, his view was presumably the same as that on the First Statement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that he was not prepared to find that this PTSS caused the Applicant to overestimate the threat to his life or caused him to lie. The Judge said:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">190  The effects that “dissociation” had on [the Applicant] were stated by Dr Sarkar in the following manner:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…I would submit to the court that his inability to associate the bag, the black luggage bag with two packets of drugs that were concealed within and his inability to associate Hamidah the co-accused with Maria, the person as she represented herself to him, represents this inability to remember. And immediately after arrest and the caution statement thereafter, I would submit is a manifestation of a dissociative phenomenon where he is so focused on protecting himself and getting retraumatised about his memory of the past …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">192 The Defence submitted that these effects experienced during the recording of the Cautioned Statement caused [the Applicant] to adopt an “overly defensive posture”. Dr Sarkar said that [the Applicant] focused on protecting himself to avoid getting re-traumatised about past memories. Dr Sarkar also said that this was why [the Applicant] avoided talking about the Black Luggage.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">193 Dr Cheok did not agree with this view. I note that Dr Sarkar did not say that this was a recognised psychiatric condition and the evidence he gave at [190] above was an opinion based on his clinical experience dealing with trauma patients. In view of this, I am unable to make a finding that this was what had happened in [the Applicant’s] case. However, it was clear from the evidence that [the Applicant] was an individual deeply affected by the traumatic memories of the Wukari massacre. While a normal person might not have lied under such circumstances, it is not inconceivable that a person with a traumatic past would have done so if he believed that lying would get him out of the traumatic predicament that he was in, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that lying would be a means to “protect” oneself.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">259 Part of the account that the Applicant gave to Dr Cheok contradicted Dr Sarkar’s assertion that the Applicant was focused on “protecting himself”. Among other things, the Applicant told Dr Cheok that:

</div> From his account to Dr Cheok, the Applicant’s first response to his belief that he would be sentenced to death was to decide to tell the truth and that he only changed his mind when “questions were asked about other people associated with his case”<span class="font-italic">. </span>If this is construed as referring to the Long Statements, in which the Applicant was asked about various individuals such as Hamidah and Adili, then his “stress” would similarly not explain why the Applicant lied in the Cautioned Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">261 If the Applicant had thought that the death penalty was a certainty, it was unclear what purpose would have been served by his lies or how lying could provide any protection. Further, the Applicant was warned, in the caution read to him before the statement was recorded, that the omission to mention any facts in his defence could lead to the court being less likely to accept his defence subsequently and might have a negative effect on his case in court. He was told specifically that it might be better for him to mention any facts in his defence in the Cautioned Statement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">262 The Applicant testified that he did not know, when the charge was read to him for the purpose of recording the Cautioned Statement, that there were drugs in the Black Luggage.

Even if he did not know the name of the road and Hamidah’s real name at that time and did not know that the two packets of drugs alleged in the charge were found in the Black Luggage, the date, the time and the bus stop would have indicated to him clearly that the CNB was referring to the incident that happened the night before. All that the Applicant had done around that time was to take a taxi to the bus stop where he handed over the Black Luggage to a lady. He could have stated this easily and truthfully. Yet, he said that he did not give anything to anybody. Further, he sought to give the impression that he had left the hotel only to change money and to look around. The persistent efforts to say nothing about the Black Luggage or that he had met someone in Singapore were very telling. In my opinion, they pointed clearly to a guilty mind which was acutely aware of what was concealed in the Black Luggage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">263 The Applicant also claimed that he was confused, did not understand what was going on when the charge was interpreted to him and was not “thinking any more like a human being”.

</div> However, far from being unable to think clearly, I find that he was in fact being selective in what he said in the Cautioned Statement. For example, he chose not to lie about having gone to the moneychanger or to look around. The only significant thing that he had done the previous day was to meet a lady in the evening to hand over something quite large to her. He spent some time with her, even going for a ride in her car. He could not have forgotten all those events already the next day. It was clear to me that he was able to distinguish between facts that would have linked him to the Black Luggage and facts which were quite innocuous. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Long Statements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">264 The Applicant also told several untruths in the Long Statements recorded between 21 and 24 November 2011, some seven to ten days after his arrest on 14 November 2011.

He claimed that his plan was to “come to Singapore and call [his] Nigerian friends who had been to Singapore, to ask for contacts to buy second hand computers from” and asserted that he did not have any specific person or shop in Singapore that he was supposed to go to.

The Judge observed that the Applicant did not detail how the symptoms of “intense psychological distress” and a “persistent negative emotional state” during the recording of the Long Statements would have led him to develop “persistent paranoia” of ASP Deng (the recording officer of all the statements except the First Statement), in turn causing him to consciously maintain his previous lies (at [197]). While the Judge found that the Applicant’s “persistent and negative belief about others” caused him to display a “persistent paranoia” towards ASP Deng, the Applicant did not make any submissions on how this “persistent paranoia” caused him to maintain his previous lies consciously. The Judge therefore declined to make a finding on this point (at [199]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">270 I agree with the Judge’s assessment.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> it is clear that his lies throughout the statements were targeted specifically<span class="font-italic"> </span>at denying the Black Luggage and anything related to it. If he had thought that the Black Luggage contained only clothing and nothing illegal, he would not have needed to deny recognising Adili’s photograph or having met him at the Singapore airport. How would Adili have linked him to any drugs? This applies similarly to his denial about knowing or meeting Hamidah or Maria. Adili was arrested subsequently for importing 1,961g of methamphetamine into Singapore and was convicted, although he was acquitted subsequently by the Court of Appeal. Hamidah was also arrested and convicted for attempting to export (to Malaysia) not less than 1,963.3g of methamphetamine in the Black Luggage handed over to her by the Applicant. Was it sheer coincidence that the persons that the Applicant falsely denied knowing were subsequently arrested also for drug offences involving methamphetamine? Plainly, it was not.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">272 Finally, if the Applicant’s claim is that he did not tell the truth in the Long Statements because he was still fearful and shocked by the circumstances of his arrest, it must have been evident to him, by the time of the Long Statements, that he was in the hands of law enforcement officers in Singapore and not in any situation or place that resembled even remotely the circumstances of the Wukari massacre. It was quite obvious by then that the CNB officers were nothing like the marauding, murderous mobs that he said he experienced as a young boy. Further, he made no allegations about threats of harm from the law enforcement officers while in remand. Any fear or anxiety that he felt then would be reasonably expected of anyone in remand for a capital charge or other serious offence anyway.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold"> Whether the conviction in </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> should be set aside</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">273 In my opinion, the many lies told by the Applicant in his statements were <span class="font-italic">Lucas</span> lies which pointed clearly and cogently to his guilty mind concerning the drugs concealed in the Black Luggage. Nevertheless, even if the lies and omissions were not corroborative evidence of the Applicant’s guilt, he would not have rebutted the presumption in s 18(1) MDA in any case. As stated in <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction) </span>at [62], a lie which is not corroborative of guilt can still be relied upon to make a finding that an accused person is not creditworthy. In particular, we affirmed the observation in <span class="font-italic">Heng Aik Peng v Public Prosecutor </span>[2002] 2 SLR(R) 535 at [27] that an accused person’s lies could be taken into account when assessing his creditworthiness even if<span class="font-italic"> </span>he has a valid reason for lying, so long as the court gives careful consideration to the accused person’s explanations for the lies and omissions. The fact remains that the Applicant here was a person who told many deliberate lies on highly material issues on separate occasions and then continued to lie in both the 2014 trial and at the remitted hearing. Further, this was despite the fact that there was no evidence that he was suffering from PTSD/PTSS during the period of these two hearings. As such, any PTSD/PTSS would not have provided even a remotely satisfactory answer to the edifice of lies constructed by the Applicant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">274 I sympathise with the Applicant for his past suffering in respect of whatever horrors he had witnessed in his homeland, especially as a young boy. However, in the final analysis of all the evidence here, the Applicant’s defence was truly a highly unlikely account from a totally unreliable and untruthful source. In my view, the hypothesis by the defence psychiatrists about why the Applicant chose to lie in the First Statement is unsupportable. However, even if that hypothesis could explain the lies and omissions in the First Statement, I really do not see how it could continue to operate for the Cautioned Statement after a formal charge and warning were administered to the Applicant some ten hours after his arrest. It is even more bewildering to me how that hypothesis could continue to excuse the Applicant’s deliberate untruths in the Long Statements recorded seven to ten days after his arrest. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">275 In my opinion, the defence is a case of hypothesis built upon hypothesis built upon hypothesis, in order to try to explain away a continuous and consistent stream of very focused lies. With respect, it appears to me that the defence started out by postulating a highly doubtful hypothesis, sought to convince the court to accept it as truth or at least as injecting doubt into the Prosecution’s case and then strove to construct on that questionable foundation an illusory tower of credence to cover the multitude of untruths lying underneath. The Applicant’s case harped on his feeling the dire need to tell lies because of his past traumatic experience in order to protect and to liberate himself from the death trap that he alleged that he had walked into unknowingly. According to him, the simple truth was that a friend of a good friend had asked him in Nigeria to bring along a luggage of clothes to hand over to someone in Singapore. After a week or more of telling persistent lies to the CNB and finding that he was still in custody, why did it not occur to him that the truth would set him free? Why did he wait for more than two years to reveal the “truth” in court? Even then, it will be remembered that he still tried to create a clever lie for his First Statement at the 2014 trial. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">276 For all the reasons discussed above, I do not think that the new evidence, considered with all the other evidence, reveals any error at all in the previous decision to convict the Applicant. I still hold that the Prosecution’s case against him was proved beyond reasonable doubt. I would therefore dismiss the application to set aside <span class="font-italic">CA (Conviction)</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Tay Yong Kwang<br/>Judge of Appeal</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam, Suang Wijaya and <br/>Johannes Hadi (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) and <br/>Jerrie Tan (K&amp;L Gates Straits Law LLC) for the Applicant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kristy Tan, Uni Khng and Zhou Yihong (Attorney-General’s Chambers) <br/>for the Respondent.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Background to the application</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1 Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi (“the Applicant”) was charged under s 5(1)(    <em>a</em>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), with
trafficking of not less than 1,963.3g of methamphetamine found in a black
luggage (“the Black Luggage”) which he had brought from Nigeria into
Singapore and had handed over to one Hamidah Binte Awang (“Hamidah”) on 13
November 2011.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2 In 2015, at the end of a joint trial of the Applicant and Hamidah, the
High Court judge (the “Judge”) acquitted the Applicant. The Prosecution
appealed against the Judge’s decision acquitting the Applicant. The Court
of Appeal reversed the acquittal and convicted the Applicant on the
trafficking charge in    <em>Public Prosecutor v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi </em>[2015] SGCA 33
(“<em>CA (Conviction)</em>”). Critically, what tipped the scales in the
appeal were the numerous lies and omissions made by the Applicant in his
statements to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), for which there did not
appear at the time to be any innocent explanation. For instance, in his
oral evidence at trial, the Applicant claimed that one “Kingsley”,
introduced to him by a friend of his, “Izuchukwu”, had told him to pass the
Black Luggage to a contact in Singapore.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3 Following the decision in <em>CA (Conviction)</em>, when the matter was
remitted to the Judge for sentencing, fresh and material evidence came to
light that the Applicant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder
(“PTSD”) with dissociative symptoms. This evidence arose from the
examination of the Applicant by Dr Jaydip Sarkar, a psychiatrist with the
Institute of Mental Health (IMH), who was slated to be the Prosecution’s
witness. According to Dr Sarkar, the Applicant’s PTSD arose as a result of
a childhood trauma in his hometown in Wukari, Nigeria, when the Applicant
was nearly killed and had witnessed the killing of others.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4 In Dr Sarkar’s opinion, the Applicant’s PTSD symptoms were triggered
after he was informed that he was facing the death penalty associated with
the trafficking charge, and this condition might have resulted in an
“overestimation of threat to his life which could have prompted him to
utter unsophisticated and blatant falsehoods in order to save his life”.
For this reason, the Court of Appeal in 2017 granted the criminal motion
filed by the Applicant to reopen its earlier conviction. No finding was
made by the Court of Appeal as to Dr Sarkar’s assessment of the Applicant.
The matter was remitted to the Judge for him to receive further expert
evidence on PTSD based on the terms of reference issued by the Court of
Appeal.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5 The Judge made three main findings in    <em>Public Prosecutor v Hamidah Binte Awang and another </em>[2019] SGHC
161 (“<em>HC (Remitted)</em>”) in the light of the expert evidence adduced
at the remitted hearing:
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(a) The Applicant suffered from PTSD as a child after witnessing the Wukari
massacre when he was about five years old and continued to suffer from it
until some indefinite time before he arrived in Singapore on 13 November
2011.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(b) However, the Applicant was not suffering from PTSD after his arrest on
14 November 2011 when the various statements were taken. This was because
neither the arrest nor the Applicant being informed that the charge
attracted the death penalty was sufficient to constitute a traumatic event.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(c) The Applicant suffered from various post-traumatic stress symptoms
(“PTSS”) during the statement-taking process.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>The majority’s decision
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6 The central question in this application is whether the decision in    <em>CA (Conviction) </em>is in fact<em> </em>demonstrably wrong. This
entailed an examination of the following questions (at    <strong>[50]</strong> and <strong>[52]</strong>):
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(a) Was the Judge correct to find that the Applicant suffered from PTSD
during his childhood?
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(b) Was the Judge correct to find that the Applicant did not experience a
traumatic event in 2011 for the purpose of Criterion A of the DSM-5 PTSD
Criteria?
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
(c) Was the Judge correct to find that the Applicant suffered from PTSS in
2011 and if so, how were they connected to his lies and omissions?
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7 On the evidence it was clear that the Applicant suffered from PTSD during
his childhood as a result of the Wukari incident: at <strong>[61]</strong>-    <strong>[65]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
8 The majority of the Court of Appeal also found that the Applicant’s
arrest and his being informed of the death penalty associated with the
trafficking charge each constituted a traumatic event in the circumstances.
This is attributable to the sensitisation effect, which all the expert
witnesses agreed was operating on the Applicant. This sensitisation effect
essentially meant that since the Applicant was found to have suffered from
PTSD as a child, he was at a higher risk of developing PTSD subsequently.
The finding that the two events were traumatic is also borne out by the
Applicant’s testimony given at the first-instance trial in 2014, long
before any issue relating to the Applicant’s PTSD was raised: at    <strong>[82]</strong>-<strong>[124]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
9 The majority agreed with the Judge that the Applicant suffered from
various PTSS during the recording of his statements to the CNB: at    <strong>[126]</strong>-<strong>[134]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
10 Contrary to the Judge’s findings, there was a credible connection
between the Applicant’s condition in 2011 and his lies and omissions in his
statements. As the majority of the expert witnesses testified, the
Applicant’s condition led to an overestimation of the threat to his life
which could have prompted him to utter unsophisticated and blatant
falsehoods to save his own life. In other words, the PTSS caused the
Applicant to harbour irrational or illogical notions of his circumstances
including that he was in danger even though he might have been innocent.
These misconceived conceptions in turn supplied a plausible explanation for
his lies because, conceivably, the Applicant was eager to save his own life
and foolishly thought that by telling lies this objective could be
achieved. While an ordinary person without similar psychiatric ailments
like the Applicant may also experience fear under the same circumstances,
the present case is fundamentally different because the Applicant’s
response was not simply a case of difference in the degree of fear
experienced but rested on an epistemically distinct basis – that is, a
gross misapprehension of the situation brought about by his history of PTSD
and his PTSS: at <strong>[138]</strong>-<strong>[146]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
11 In respect of the decision in <em>CA (Conviction)</em>, the Court of
Appeal had drawn adverse inferences against the Applicant as a result of
his numerous lies and omissions, for which there was no innocent
explanation. In the light of the fresh evidence and findings above, it
cannot be said with any reasonable degree of confidence that the
Applicant’s lies and omissions were only attributable to a realisation of
his guilt. It follows that no adverse inference can now be drawn against
the Applicant in this regard. Consequently, it is also no longer
appropriate to rely on the Applicant’s lies and omissions to impugn his
creditworthiness: at <strong>[157]</strong>-<strong>[168]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
12 Since no weight can be given to the Applicant’s lies and omissions, the
majority found that on the remaining evidence, the Applicant had rebutted
the presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the MDA on the balance of
probabilities. As the Judge had found in his first-instance acquittal
decision, the totality of the circumstances, including the Applicant’s
conduct and demeanour around the time of the alleged offence, was more
consistent with a lack of knowledge on his part of the drugs in the Black
Luggage: at <strong>[171]</strong>-<strong>[181]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
13 Therefore, the decision in <em>CA (Conviction) </em>is demonstrably
wrong in the light of the fresh evidence, which arose out of exceptional
circumstances, <em>ie</em>, an opinion proffered by the Prosecution’s
psychiatrist instead of the Applicant’s own appointed psychiatrist. The
Court of Appeal’s conviction in 2015 is hereby set aside.<em> </em>
Accordingly, the majority affirmed the order of the High Court acquitting
the Applicant of the trafficking charge: at <strong>[182]</strong>-    <strong>[184]</strong>.<em></em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
Decision of the minority of the Court of Appeal (delivered by Tay Yong
Kwang JA):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
14 The central question was whether the motive for the Applicant’s lies was
his realisation of guilt and fear of the truth: at <strong>[232]</strong>.
Proceeding on the basis of the Judge’s findings of PTSS at the various
points in time, the many lies told by the Applicant in his statements were
found to be <em>Lucas </em>lies (<em>ie</em>, lies which could be used as
corroborative evidence of guilt). These pointed clearly and cogently to his
guilty mind concerning the drugs concealed in the Black Luggage: at    <strong>[230]</strong> and <strong>[273]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
15 In the statement recorded from him approximately two hours after his
arrest (“the First Statement”), the Applicant consciously and deliberately
lied when he claimed that he had only brought one luggage, namely, a laptop
bag into Singapore and further lied in court to explain away the lie in the
First Statement: at <strong>[248]</strong>-<strong>[254]</strong>. The
Judge rightly did not accept the Applicant’s submissions on how his
“intense psychological distress” caused him to lie. If he had been
frightened and shocked when his room was raided suddenly by the officers,
he could have explained at the trial that he had lied in the First
Statement because he had been so overwhelmed by the officers’ actions that
they evoked in his mind the Wukari incident: at <strong>[251] </strong>and    <strong>[252]</strong>. It was implausible, given his allegedly naïve trust
in Izuchukwu and Kingsley, that his first thoughts after arrest would have
been that there was something illegal about the Black Luggage and therefore
that the only safe course was for him to lie and deny any connection with
it when questioned by law enforcement officers: at <strong>[253]</strong>
.The edifice of lies was such that the experts’ evidence, to the limited
extent they addressed the link between intense psychological distress and
lying on the facts of the present case, should be viewed with
circumspection. This distress did not provide an innocent explanation for
the lie in the First Statement: at <strong>[256]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
16 In the cautioned statement recorded from the Applicant (“the Cautioned
Statement”), the Applicant claimed he had not given “anything to anybody”,
among other lies: at <strong>[257]</strong>. The reasons the Applicant gave
for the lies were rejected. For example, contrary to Dr Sarkar’s assertion
that the Applicant had been focused on protecting himself, the Applicant
had told Dr Christopher Cheok that when the charge was read to him, he made
up his mind to tell the truth and he only changed his mind thereafter.
Further, if he had indeed thought that the death penalty was a certainty as
he claimed, it was unclear how lying could have provided any protection. He
had also been warned before the statement was recorded that it might be
better for him to mention any facts in his defence: at    <strong>[260] </strong>and <strong>[261]</strong>. Despite his claim that
he had been confused, it was clear the Applicant had been able to
distinguish between facts that would have linked him to the Black Luggage
and facts which were quite innocuous: at <strong>[263]</strong>. The
persistent efforts to say nothing about the Black Luggage or that he had
met someone in Singapore were very telling and pointed clearly to a guilty
mind which was acutely aware of the drugs in the Black Luggage: at    <strong>[262]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
17 The Applicant also told several untruths in the statements recorded from
him some seven to ten days after his arrest (“the Long Statements”), which
were again calculated to avoid any reference to the Black Luggage or
individuals that would have connected him to it: at <strong>[264]</strong>.
The various PTSS suffered by the Applicant did not provide an explanation
for the lies and omissions: at <strong>[269] </strong>and    <strong>[270]</strong>. Even if the Applicant did not trust the
investigating officer, it was illogical for this to have resulted in his
persistent efforts to dissociate himself from the Black Luggage especially
if he did not know at the time that the charge was linked to it and after
he had been cautioned that he should not hold back anything in stating his
defence. It was not sheer coincidence that the individuals the Applicant
falsely denied knowing were also subsequently arrested for drug offences
involving methamphetamine: at <strong>[270] </strong>and    <strong>[271]</strong>. It would have been evident by the time of the Long
Statements that he was in the hands of law enforcement officers and not in
a situation or place which remotely resembled the circumstances of the
Wukari massacre. Any fear or anxiety he felt then would have been
reasonably expected of anyone in remand for a serious offence: at    <strong>[272]</strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
18 Even if the lies and omissions were not corroborative evidence of the
Applicant’s guilt, he would not have rebutted the presumption in s 18(1)
MDA. The Applicant told many deliberate lies on highly material issues on
separate occasions and continued to lie both in the 2014 trial and the
remitted hearing, despite the lack of evidence that he was suffering from
PTSD or PTSS during the two hearings. As such, any PTSD or PTSS would not
have provided a remotely satisfactory answer to the edifice of lies
constructed by the Applicant: at <strong>[273]</strong>. His defence was in
the final analysis a highly unlikely account from a totally unreliable and
untruthful source: at <strong>[274]</strong>. The defence was a case of
hypothesis built upon hypothesis built upon hypothesis in order to try to
explain away a continuous and consistent stream of very focused lies: at    <strong>[275]</strong>. The Prosecution’s case had been proved beyond
reasonable doubt and the application to set aside the Applicant’s
conviction should be dismissed: at <strong>[276]</strong>.
