“sometimes in January 2011” to “sometime in the beginning of 2011”. Charges are usually revised to contain better particulars as more information become available.

A reasonable inference is that over the period, doubts had arisen over the omitted particulars.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 It was also unsatisfactory that right up to the trial, the rape charges only referred to a “forested area” in Punggol. By that time, the investigations must have disclosed if the offences took place in a building, on the open ground or in a motor vehicle (as was disclosed on the first charge).  Such particulars ought to be included in the charges.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Primary evidence</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The girl and the accused are not strangers.

As the prime mover was subsequently scrapped no photographs could be taken when they would have been important evidence.  Secondly, apparently no information was obtained from the sister who the girl said the accused and instructed to leave the flat immediately before the commission of the fourth offence, because she did not refer to the incident in her evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">What the girl said of the offences</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 The girl did not tell anyone of the offences till April 2010, and she did not make any police report, and was not in favour of a report being made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The first person the girl spoke to about the accused’s actions was her boyfriend.

Secondly, the offence in the third charge was committed after the accused was alleged to be instructed the younger sister who was 13 years old at that time to leave the flat to buy lunch, and had refused to let the girl to go along with her. In the face of the accused’s denial that the events took place, the prosecution should have the girl’s evidence corroborated by her sister, who was presented at the trial as a corroborative witness.

</div> The events the girl account was not a routine everyday occurrence, and the sister was old enough to have some recollection of it, but that was not done.  The sister gave evidence on the events of 25 December 2011, but no questions were asked and no information volunteered about leaving the flat to buy lunch in June 2010. It is important to know if she remembered the accused’s instructions to her to leave the flat alone to buy lunch.  The girl’s request and the accused’s refusal, and how the girl and accused behaved when they had their lunch could be significant evidence. The omission raised questions over the girl’s account on the accident. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Section 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97 Rev Ed 1997) provides that a court may presume that</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In Professor Jeffrey Pinsler’s <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process</span> 3rd Edn.

It follows from this that the advocate does not produce a witness who could reasonably be expected to give evidence in the circumstances of the case, adverse inferences may be drawn.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-center">Example</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The Plaintiff claims against the defendant for injuries sustained in a car accident.

It may be that the investigators had not verified this with her in the investigations, that she did not have any recollection of the alleged events, or that her recollection did not support the girl’s account and the prosecution case.

</div>
</div> For such cases, the Court of Appeal had made clear in <span class="font-italic">AOF v PP</span> [2012] 3 SLR 4 that </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">111 It is well-established that in a case where no other evidence is available, a complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt (see s 136 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)(“EA”)) – but only when it is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration (see generally the decision of court in <span class="font-italic">PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik</span> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 601 at [37]-[44] (“<span class="font-italic">Liton</span>”) and the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">XP v PP</span> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at [27]-[36] (“<span class="font-italic">XP</span>”)).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">112 The need for “fine-tooth comb” scrutiny in so far as allegations of sexual abuse are concerned is particularly acute, “given both the ease with which allegations of sexual assault may be fabricated and the concomitant difficulty of rebutting such allegations” (see the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Chng Yew Chin v PP</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 124 at [33], cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Liton</span> at [37]-[38]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">113 In <span class="font-italic">XP</span>, V K Rajah JA observed (at [31]) that the requirement that the alleged victim’s evidence ought to be “unusually convincing”:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… <span class="font-italic">does nothing, however, to change the ultimate rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt</span>, but it does suggest how the evidential Gordian knot may be untied if proof is to be found solely from the complainant’s testimony against the Appellant. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">114 Apart from stating that its role is that of a cognitive aid, Rajah JA further elaborated on what “unusually convincing” entails (see <span class="font-italic">XP</span> at [29]-[35]). Rajah JA’s pronouncements can be distilled into the following propositions:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) First, subsequent repeated complaints by the complainant cannot, in and of themselves, constitute corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the requirement for “unusually convincing” testimony. As Yong Pung How CJ noted in the Singapore High Court decision of <span class="font-italic">Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 591 (“<span class="font-italic">Khoo Kwoon Hain</span>”) at [51]”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the complainant’s evidence is not ‘unusually convincing’, I cannot see how the fact that she repeated it several times can add much to its weight.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, the “unusually convincing” reminder should not be confined to categories of witnesses who are supposedly accomplices, young children or sexual offence complainants.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, a conviction will only be set aside where a reasonable doubt exists and not simply because the judge did not remind himself of the “unusually convincing” standard.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Fourthly, an “unusually convincing” testimony does not overcome even materially and/or inherently contradictory evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The phrase “unusually convincing” is not term of art; it does not automatically entail a guilty verdict and surely cannot dispense with the need to consider the other evidence and the factual circumstances peculiar to each case. Nor does it dispense with having to assess the complainant’s testimony against that of the accused, where the case turns on one person’s word against the other’s.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) Fifthly, even where there is corroboration, there may still not be enough evidence to convict.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">115 Moving from the level of scrutiny to the elements of what an unusually convincing testimony consists of, it is clear that a witness’s testimony may only be found to be “unusually <span class="font-italic">convincing</span>” by weighing the <span class="font-italic">demeanour</span> of the witness alongside both the <span class="font-italic">internal and external</span> <span class="font-italic">consistencies</span> found in the witness’ testimony. Given the inherent epistemic constraints of an appellate court as a finder of fact, this inquiry will <span class="font-italic">necessarily</span> be focussed on the internal and external consistency of the witness’s testimony. However, this is <span class="font-italic">not</span> to say that a witness’s credibility is <span class="font-italic">necessarily </span>determined <span class="font-italic">solely</span> in terms of his or her demeanour. As Rajah JA observed in <span class="font-italic">XP</span> ([111] supra at [71]-[72]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I freely and readily acknowledge that a trial judge is usually much better placed than an appellate judge to assess a witness’s credibility, having observed the witness testifying and being cross-examined on the stand. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">However, demeanour is not invariably determinative; contrary evidence by other witnesses must be given due weight, and if the witness fails to recall or satisfactorily explain material facts and assertions, his credible demeanour cannot overcome such deficiencies.</span> As I explained in <span class="font-italic">PP v Wang Ziyi Able</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 61 at [92]-[96], an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw necessary inferences of fact not supported by the primary or objective evidence on record from the circumstances of the case.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">While an appellate court should be more restrained when dealing with the trial judge’s assessment of a witness’s credibility, there is a difference between an assessment of a witness’s credibility based on his demeanour, and one based on inferences drawn from the internal consistency in the content of the witness’s testimony or the external consistency between the content of the witness’ evidence and the extrinsic evidence. In the latter two situations, the trial judge’s advantage in having studied the witness is not critical because the appellate court has access to the same material and is accordingly in an equal position to assess the veracity of the witness’s evidence (see Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 (‘<span class="font-italic">Jagatheesan</span>’) at [40], citing <span class="font-italic">PP v Choo Thiam Hock</span> [1994] 2 SLR(R) 702 at[11]).</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 Touching on the same concern, Yong Pung How CJ cautioned in <span class="font-italic">Kwan Peng Hong v PP</span> [2012] 2 SLR(R) 824 that</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">32 … although the ease of making an allegation and the difficulty of refutation are not just confined to sexual cases, they are generally of more concern in sexual cases. It is in the nature of sexual offences, that often all the court has before it are words of the complainant against the denials of the accused. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">33 … it is dangerous to convict on the words of the complainant alone unless her evidence is unusually compelling or convincing (<span class="font-italic">Tang Kin Seng v PP</span> ([28] <span class="font-italic">supra</span> at [43]), <span class="font-italic">Teo Keng Pong v PP</span> ([24] <span class="font-italic">supra</span> at [72] and <span class="font-italic">Soh Yang Tick v PP</span> [1998] 1 SLR(R) 209 at [43]). In short, the court is to be extremely cautious in relying on the sole evidence of the complainant for a conviction. The phrase “unusually compelling or convincing” simply means that the complainant’s evidence was so convincing that the Prosecution’s case was proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of that evidence.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Strictly speaking, the girl’s evidence did not stand alone. There was the evidence of her mother, brother, sister and boyfriend, who she told about the accused’s actions. The corroborative effect of such evidence is stated in s 159 of the Evidence Act that</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating <span class="font-italic">to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took</span> place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(Emphasis added)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 However this provision must be applied with caution as Yong CJ had pointed out <span class="font-italic">in Khoo Kwan Hain v PP</span> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 591 </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">49 … although s 159 has the effect of elevating a recent complaint to corroboration, the court should nevertheless bear in mind the fact that corroboration by virtue of s 159 alone is <span class="font-italic">not</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>corroboration by <span class="font-italic">independent</span> evidence. It would be dangerous to equate this form of corroboration with corroboration in the normal sense of the word. … </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The focus on a complaint made “at or about the time when the fact took place”, or a “recent complaint” is apposite.  Good sense dictates that a complaint should be made within a reasonable time after the event. Where a person remains silent, and only complains after a long delay, that delay must be scrutinised. In the present case, the girl was not at all prompt in her complaints although she had every opportunity to complain. There were no reasons for her not to confide in members for her family or her boyfriend. She had ample time to recover from any distress or embarrassment that she may had experienced.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 Someone so abused and humiliated would be expected to seek help and redress when she breaks her silence. In her case, however, she was still reluctant to make a police report. Furthermore, when she did speak, what she said was contradictory and inconsistent, with allegation of touching (and no rape) to the mother, and rape (and no digital penetration) to the brother, sister and boyfriend. With the passage of time, the girl should not have difficulty to recount accurately the forms of abuse she was put through.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Reverting to her evidence regarding the prime mover, it was apparent that her description of the prime mover’s cabin and the accused’s frequent use of the prime mover was contradicted by the evidence of Mr Sim. The Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Heng Aik Ren Thomas v PP</span> [1998] 3 SLR(R) 142 advised that </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">35 Where the quality of the identification evidence is poor, the judge should ask … (I)s there is any other evidence which goes to support the correctness of the identification. If the judge is unable to find other supporting evidence for the identification evidence, he should then be mindful that a conviction which relies on such poor identification evidence would be unsafe….</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 Looking at her evidence of the accused sending her sister out of the flat so that he can be alone with her (which should be corroborated by her sister), nothing was mentioned by the sister at all. These, and the other matters I have referred to have a negative impact on her credibility. This is the reason for the court to say in <span class="font-italic">Kwan Peng Hong</span> that “it is dangerous to convict on the words of the complainant alone unless her evidence is unusually compelling or convincing”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The girl’s evidence was not unusually compelling or convincing and the other evidence did not strengthen the prosecution case in any significant way. At the end of a case, a court has to decide whether the prosecution had proved the charges against an accused person beyond a reasonable doubt and whether it is safe and fair to convict the accused. Where there is clear evidence which supports each element of a charge, the charge is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Conversely, when there are substantial flaws and shortcomings in the evidence as there are here, there will be reasonable doubts.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Upon a review of the case, the prosecution had not proved any of the charges to the required standard, and the accused is to be acquitted on the five charges. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Kan Ting Chiu<br/>Senior Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Lin Yinbing and <span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)">Michael Quilindo</span><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> </span>(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Mr Abraham Vergis (Providence Law) </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">and Sadhana Rai (CLAS Fellowship, Law Society of Singapore) for the Accused.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
