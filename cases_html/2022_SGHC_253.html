In Suit 1041, the plaintiff, Ms Dai Yi Ting, is claiming against the defendant, Mr Chuang Fu Yuan, in negligence for personal injuries arising from an accident on 27 February 2019. Broadly, Suit 1041 involves an e-scooter rented from the first third party, Grabcycle (SG) Pte Ltd, that was driven within the premises of the second third party, the National University of Singapore. The defendant was operating the e-scooter and the plaintiff was a pillion rider. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 At the end of the hearing before me, I granted the defendant’s application and ordered that Suit 1041 be bifurcated, with the trial on liability to be heard separately from, and prior to, the hearing for the assessment of damages (if necessary). Nevertheless, because of the lack of specific case law on bifurcation in relation to personal injury cases like the present one, I now provide the full grounds for my decision.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 At the hearing before me, Ms Istyana Putri Ibrahim (“Ms Ibrahim”) submitted on behalf of the defendant that it was just and convenient to bifurcate the trial. To begin with, Ms Ibrahim suggested that there are broadly three issues for determination at trial:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) whether the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for allegedly causing the accident;</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) whether one or more of the third parties are liable to indemnify for or contribute to any liability of the defendant; and</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) how much the plaintiff can claim from the defendant in damages.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 With these broad issues in mind, Ms Ibrahim advanced three reasons for the trial to be bifurcated:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) There may be multiple parties liable for the accident, and so issues of liability should be tried and heard together before the issue of quantum of damages.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(b) There could be substantial time and costs saved if the issues of liability are heard before those concerning damages.</div><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(c) The issues of liability and quantum of damages between the plaintiff and defendant are distinct and inherently complex.</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 The plaintiff was against bifurcation. Ms Michelle Kaur (“Ms Kaur”) submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the plaintiff is a “sensitive” plaintiff. Specifically, the plaintiff has sustained multiple injuries that have impaired her brain’s functioning. As such, it would be unjust and unfair for the plaintiff to attend court twice: she would be faced with the strain of being on the stand twice and would also have to re-live the accident while struggling with the impairments caused by her brain injuries. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 To substantiate this point, Ms Kaur showed me a report from the plaintiff’s psychiatrist, Dr Calvin Fones, which stated that “protracted litigation has been a major source of stress and serves as a maintaining factor of her depression”. However, I attached little or no weight to the report as it was not exhibited by way of an affidavit. Instead, the letter was attached as an annex to the plaintiff’s submissions for the hearing. In gist, however, the plaintiff’s case was that she dreads seeing the defendant twice over, as she would have to, should the trial be bifurcated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">7 Ms Kaur also submitted that bifurcation would not be cost-effective as more costs would be involved in attending court. Ms Kaur disagreed with the defendant’s position that costs would be saved if bifurcation was ordered, such that parties would not have to prepare for issues of quantification at the initial phase. In this regard, Ms Kaur further explained that the parties have been discussing the prospect of attending mediation and the third parties have requested an updated quantification of the plaintiff’s claim so that they can take instructions on mediation. As such, regardless of whether the matter is resolved at the trial on liability, the documents relating to the updated quantification must still be obtained so that the parties may attempt mediation. Accordingly, there was no need to bifurcate the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Finally, Ms Kaur suggested that the defendant’s application for bifurcation was premature as the parties may reach a resolution at mediation and there would therefore be no need for further litigation in court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The power to order bifurcation </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 <span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">In considering the parties’ arguments, I adopted as my starting point O 33 r 2 of the ROC 2014, which gives the court the power to order bifurcation to begin with. Order 33 r 2 provides that:</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Time, etc</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">.</span><span class="font-weight-bold">, of trial of questions or issues</span> <span class="font-weight-bold">(O.</span><span class="font-weight-bold"> 33, r. 2)</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">2. </span>The Court may order any question or issue arising in a cause or matter, whether of fact or law or partly of fact and partly of law, and whether raised by the pleadings or otherwise, to be tried before, at or after the trial of the cause or matter, and may give directions as to the manner in which the question or issue shall be stated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Being framed as a discretion with the use of the word “may”, it is implicit in O 33 r 2 that the normal practice is for a unified trial of all issues of fact and law, including issues of liability and damages. As such, the burden is on the party applying for bifurcation to convince the court that it is appropriate to make such an order.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Further, as the learned authors of <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2021</span> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“<span class="font-italic">White Book</span>”) note (at para 33/3/3), O 33 r 2 should be read together with O 33 r 3(2) since they both deal with the general power of the court to order the separate trials of separate issues or questions. Order 33 r 3(2) provides that “[i]n any [action begun by writ] different questions or issues may be ordered to be tried by different modes of trial and one or more questions or issues may be ordered to be tried before the others”. Broadly, the learned authors state that these rules: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… provide the machinery for avoiding the trial of unnecessary issues or questions, by isolating particular issues or questions for separate trial and thus eliminating or reducing delay and expense in the preparation and the trial of issues or questions which may ultimately never arise for trial or which otherwise warrant being separately tried …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">By this view, the primary purpose behind the power to order bifurcation as provided for by O 33 r 2 read with O 33 r 3(2) of the ROC 2014 is to ensure the efficient conduct of a trial. Indeed, by avoiding (or potentially avoiding) the trial of unnecessary issues or questions, there will be a corresponding elimination or reduction of delay and expense in both the preparation for the trial and of the trial itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 While this was not relevant for the present application, which proceeded under the ROC 2014, the power to order bifurcation is provided for more directly in the new Rules of Court (2021 Rev Ed) (“ROC 2021”). Order 9 r 25(2) of the ROC 2021 now provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(2) The Court may order a bifurcated hearing in that the issues concerning liability are to be heard by a Judge before the issues concerning the amount of damages or the taking of accounts are heard by a Judge or the Registrar. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">If bifurcation is ordered pursuant to O 9 r 25(2), then the court must, pursuant to O 9 r 25(12), give the appropriate directions, as set out in O 9 r 25(9), for the assessment of damages or the taking of accounts. Further, O 15 r 15 of the ROC 2021 also applies in relation to the subsequent directions needed on the assessment of damages following the hearing on liability.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 An important distinction between the provisions providing for the power to order bifurcation in the ROC 2014 and the ROC 2021 is the presence of O 3 r 1 in the latter, which provides for the attainment of certain Ideals in civil procedure. In particular, O 3 r 1(3) provides that “[t]he Court must seek to achieve the Ideals in all its orders or directions”. As such, the power to order bifurcation provided for by O 9 r 25(2) of the ROC 2021 must be applied with the Ideals in O 3 r 1(2) in mind. These Ideals are “akin to constitutional principles by which the parties and the Court are guided in conducting civil proceedings” and they are “to be read conjunctively” (see <span class="font-italic">Civil Justice Commission Report</span> (29 December 2017) at Chapter 1, para 3 (Chairman: Justice Tay Yong Kwang)). The court is empowered to do what is right and necessary based on the facts of the case before it to ensure that justice is done, provided it is not prohibited from doing so and its actions are consistent with the Ideals (see <span class="font-italic">Singapore Civil Procedure</span><span class="font-italic"> 2022</span> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2022) at para 3/1/4, citing <span class="font-italic">Public Consultation on Civil Justice Reforms</span>, Recommendations of the Civil Justice Review Committee and Civil Justice Commission (26 October 2018) at para 21).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 At this juncture, it suffices to note that these Ideals relate to the promotion of expeditious (O 3 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>)) and cost-effective proceedings (O 3 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>)) that are achieved by the efficient use of court resources (O 3 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>)), and are all ultimately tailored towards the achievement of fair and practical results (O 3 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">e</span>)), which ensures the fair access to justice (O 3 r 1(2)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>)). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">General principles on the power to order bifurcation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1) ">15 </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Having considered the source of the power to order bifurcation, I turned to the general principles concerning the power to order bifurcation.

V K Rajah JA, writing for a unanimous court, held that an application prior to trial under O 33 r 2 (of the then-applicable Rules of Court) for a bifurcation of the hearing on liability and damages would inevitably succeed if the circumstances render it “just and convenient” to so order (at [64]). In that case, the court noted that the question of damages was somewhat controversial as it required the assistance of expert evidence on share valuation and incorporated potentially complex issues. Thus, the court was of the view that substantial costs and time could have been saved if the liability issues had been resolved first. This is because if there was found to be no liability, then the controversial question of damages could be avoided. It was therefore “just and convenient” to have bifurcated the trial, but this had not been done in that case because no such application was made prior to trial. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1) ">17 </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">In the subsequent High Court decision of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Scintronix</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> Corp Ltd v Ho Kang Peng and another </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">[2011] SGHC 28</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> (“</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Scintronix</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">”)</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">, Kan Ting Chiu J similarly had to decide whether the hearing of the plaintiff’s action against the two defendants should be bifurcated. The plaintiff’s action against the first defendant was for breaches of his contractual, fiduciary and/or statutory duties, and the action against the second defendant was for breaches of his contractual duties. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1) ">18 </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Kan Ting Chiu J took as his starting point the “just and convenient” test from </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Lee Chee Wei </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">(at [16]). </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">After undertaking a thorough examination of the relevant English cases, Kan J explained that the rules of bifurcation are not unchanging. Rather, bifurcation should be regarded as “intrinsically related to case management” (at [25]). Therefore, when policies on case management change, the judicial rulings on bifurcation will also change. Kan J then discerned that Singapore’s current policies on case management have resulted in a greater willingness on the part of courts to order bifurcation. He explained as follows (at [26]):</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… Courts in Singapore, as their counterparts in England, have been more amenable to bifurcate hearings. The Court of Appeal’s observation in <span class="font-italic">Lee Chee Wei</span> that the hearing should have been bifurcated reflects the present attitude. This development may be a response to the increased caseload of the courts. Bifurcation enables the courts to deal with more cases, and depose with those cases where liability is not established. Even in a case where liability is established, there is still savings of court time, as the damages can be dealt with by a registrar, allowing the judge to go on and hear other cases. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 <span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">On the facts of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Scintronix</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> itself, Kan</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> J held that it was “just and convenient” to bifurcate the trial (at [33]). He did not accept the defendant’s submissions that there was no clear demarcation between issues of liability and of damages. Indeed, the learned judge held that even if there had been some degree of overlap between the issues, that did not necessarily weigh against bifurcation if the facts of the case made bifurcation an appropriate order in the circumstances (at [28]). Further, the learned judge also said that the case for bifurcation would be stronger in cases where there are multiple claims (and, hence, multiple issues of liability) and multiple forms of damages claimed (and, hence, multiple issues of damages). This is because an order for bifurcation would isolate the issues of damages to be determined separately from those of liability (at [27]).</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Principle</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1) ">20 </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Accordingly, the </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">principle</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> that emerges from </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Lee Chee Wei</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">and </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Scintronix</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">is that the court should order bifurcation where it is “just and convenient” in the circumstances of the case to do so.

In that case, McFarland J upheld a Master’s order for bifurcating the trial of an employee’s claim against his employer following an accident at work, such that liability would be determined before quantum. The employee was working atop an asphalt storage bin clearing material from a ramp. The employee fell to the bottom of the bin and then onto the ground, suffering severe injuries. He brought claims against his employer alleging negligence and breach of statutory duty. The employer denied liability on the basis that the employee was carrying out a forbidden task in a forbidden area. In the event of a finding of liability, the employer asserted contributory negligence on the part of the employee. The Master hearing the case at first instance ordered that there should be split hearings, to first determine liability and then to determine quantum.

Templeman LJ held that, while the Vice-Chancellor’s analysis appeared correct from the plaintiff’s perspective, he had erred in not considering the matter from the defendant’s perspective. In his view, an order for bifurcation, while clearly beneficial to the plaintiff, would have prejudiced the defendant. This was because the defendant was considering the possibility of defeating the plaintiff’s claim on liability by calling evidence to show that the plaintiff had not suffered any damage at all. If the defendant chose to do so, it may well have needed to call its witness on damages at the bifurcated trial for liability.

This is because, if the defendant failed to convince the trial judge that the plaintiff had not suffered any loss, then there would remain the trial for damages. However, by then, because of the way it would have run its case, the defendant would have “fired off all [its] artillery in the form of [its] evidence on quantum”. This would give the plaintiff an unfair benefit because, in the time between judgment for liability and trial for damages, the plaintiff would be able to prepare itself extensively, having already had prior knowledge of the defendant’s evidence on damages. The defendant would be caught in a difficult position of deciding between recalling the same witnesses who may have already given evidence on quantum during the trial for liability and duplicating them by calling other witnesses. Whichever course the defendant ended up choosing, its evidence would be of a less profound effect than if it had been able to wait until after the plaintiff had shown its hand on the question of damages. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1) ">37 </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">While modern attitudes towards rules of civil procedure may discourage parties from keeping their cards close to their chest until the last possible moment, the facts and holding of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Abbey Life Assurance</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> serve as a good reminder </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">that, over and above the expeditious and cost-effective conduct of proceedings, it is always important to consider, as an overarching consideration, whether an order for bifurcation will impose not insubstantial injustice on the party opposing the order for bifurcation.</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Specific principles on the power to order bifurcation in personal injury cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Particular concerns in personal injury cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1) ">38 </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Having considered the general principles on the power to order bifurcation, I turned to consider the specific principles in relation to personal injury cases.

The advantages listed by Judge Tobin are quite similar to those discussed above, namely, the promotion of expeditious and cost-effective proceedings. However, the disadvantages are quite particular to the jury system, such as by removing the issues of damages from a case, the plaintiff is less likely to be able to present a sympathetic view of his case. Further, if a new jury were to be constituted for the trial on damages, this would take considerable time and effort. If the first jury is told to come back to decide damages, that would be prejudicial to the plaintiff since the natural tendency of the jury is to do that which does not require them to return for too long. However, in the end, Judge Tobin argues in favour of bifurcation since bifurcated cases settled at almost twice the rate of non-bifurcated cases, at least in Florida at the time of his writing. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1) ">41 </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> In response to Judge Tobin’s article, Dan Cytryn in “Bifurcation in Personal Injury Cases: Should Judges be Allowed to Use the ‘B’ Word” (2001) 26(1) Nova Law Review 249 suggests that bifurcation should be the exception rather than the rule in personal injury cases. Cytryn’s view is that bifurcation should only be ordered when “the benefits of bifurcating the proceedings clearly outweigh the detriment and prejudice to any party opposing the bifurcation” (at 266). This stems from Cytryn’s belief that bifurcation in personal injury cases is a procedure that is highly favourable to the defence because the jury would not be presented with the complete picture of the plaintiff’s claim. As with Judge Tobin’s article, these concerns about the bifurcation of personal injury cases stem from the jury system in the US. Quite obviously, this is not a concern in our system. </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1) ">42 </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Apart from the plaintiff not being able to present his entire claim if a trial for personal injury is bifurcated, there are other unique characteristics of personal injury cases. First, there could be uncertainty as to the plaintiff’s future, including that the plaintiff’s life expectancy may be shortened by the accident. Second, unlike in commercial cases where the loss has been set at the moment of breach, there may not be a firm prognosis of the plaintiff’s condition until some years after the accident. Third, unlike commercial cases where there will often be a lengthy trail of documentary records, there is unlikely to be such a trail for personal injury cases. In the end, all of these unique characteristics, including the concern that the plaintiff is not able to present a complete (and sympathetic) picture of its case, stem from the very </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">personal</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> nature of personal injury cases. </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">I therefore had to consider whether this ultimate attribute should lead to particular factors being considered in deciding whether to order a bifurcation in personal injury cases. </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Particular factors to personal injury cases</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Two general considerations</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) No general concern against bifurcation in personal injury cases</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In considering these particular factors, I started with two general considerations. First, while there may have been concerns against bifurcated trials in personal injury cases in the past, these concerns no longer exist. As Carswell LJ said in the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal decision of <span class="font-italic">Millar (a minor) v </span><span class="font-italic">Peeples</span> <span class="font-italic">and others </span>[1995] NI 6 (“<span class="font-italic">Millar</span>”) (at 9–10), albeit in the Northern Irish context, jury trials in their system have become exceptional in personal injury cases. As such, the reasons for keeping an action in a unitary trial, such as those relevant in the US system, have been reduced. This may be why, as Lord Denning MR noted in <span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Coenen</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">(at 988), Winn </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">LJ’s Committee recommended in the</span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Report of the Committee on Personal Injuries Litigation </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">(</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">1968, Cmnd 3691) at para 494(b) “a more robust and less restrictive” approach towards the order of bifurcation in personal injury cases. This analysis applies equally in our context, which eschewed the use of juries decades ago. Accordingly, while the starting point is the same as with commercial cases, in that the </span>normal practice is for a unified trial of liability and damages for personal injury cases, there should <span class="font-italic">not </span>be a presumption <span class="font-italic">against </span>bifurcation in personal injury cases, as some of the older cases appear to suggest. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The general irrelevance of any tactical advantage accruing to the plaintiff</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Second, the tactical advantage that might accrue to a plaintiff in a personal injury case by not ordering bifurcation should not be a relevant consideration. In <span class="font-italic">Millar</span>, the plaintiff suffered severe injuries when he was hit by a car driven by the first defendant while crossing a road to attend a fete (an outdoor public function usually organised for charity) at his school. Traffic was heavy on that day. Furthermore, a line of stationary vehicles had built up behind a fire engine, which was one of the attractions at the fete. The plaintiff sued the first defendant for negligent driving. He also sued the North Eastern Education and Library Board (“the Board”) in negligence for failing to take steps to protect children who might be at risk from traffic around the fete. On the Board’s application, the Master granted an application for bifurcation. On appeal, a judge reversed the Master’s decision. The Board then appealed to the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff’s primary argument before the Court of Appeal was that it would be hard on him to give evidence twice, and that if the trial were not split, there would be a greater incentive for the defendants to settle. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Carswell LJ restored the Master’s decision and ordered that the trial be bifurcated. Writing for a unanimous court, the learned judge held that, in deciding if it was just and convenient to order bifurcation, the court should balance the advantages and disadvantages to each party and consider the public interest that unnecessary expenditure of time and money in a lengthy trial should not be incurred. In this regard, Carswell LJ emphasised that a court should not place undue weight on the tactical advantage that might accrue to a plaintiff by refusing to order a bifurcated trial. Such an advantage may occur because a defendant who is faced with a lengthy trial may be more inclined to settle on terms favourable to the plaintiff. However, Carswell LJ rejected the relevance of such considerations on the premise that the paramount duty of a court is to look at the interests of <span class="font-italic">all </span>parties in determining whether to order bifurcation. Thus, on the facts of <span class="font-italic">Millar</span>, while the plaintiff’s strain in having to give evidence twice should not be minimised, that had to be balanced against the considerable disadvantages that would result if the trial was not bifurcated. This included the quite important factor that the trial would become far longer and more expensive if it were not bifurcated. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Similarly, McFarland J in <span class="font-italic">Gibney </span>was confronted with the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff’s application for bifurcation was merely a tactical device to ground an interim payment application. In response, the learned judge pithily noted that it was his experience that “most applications, of whatever type, made by parties tend to be motivated to gain tactical advantage”. This is the self-evident essence of adversarial proceedings. However, McFarland J maintained that each case must be dealt with on its own facts and appeared to discount the primary relevance of any supposed tactical advantage accruing to the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Four particular factors</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1) ">47 </span>Having taken into account these general considerations, I now turn to explain the particular factors that may affect the order <span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">for bifurcation in personal injury cases. </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Degree of uncertainty in plaintiff’s future </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48  First, the greater the uncertainty in the plaintiff’s future, <span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">the more likely it will be for an order for bifurcation to be made. In </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">the English Court of Appeal decision of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Stevens v William Nash Ltd </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">[1966] 1</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> WLR 1550, the plaintiff suffered multiple injuries to his right arm and hand. The prognosis for his future was uncertain. However, the plaintiff desired to take a training course of six months’ duration to qualify as a capstan lathe setter operator. While he would lose his earnings during training, he could, within 18 months of qualifying, earn a similar wage to that prior to the accident. The unified trial for liability and damages took place two years after the accident. The plaintiff’s arm had only been released from a plaster cast three days before the trial. Winn LJ, in allowing the plaintiff’s appeal to increase the damages awarded, also suggested that it might have been preferable for the trial judge to have tried the issue of damages sometime after the issue of liability. This was because the trial judge simply had little certainty on the plaintiff’s future so as to be able to make an appropriate order on the damages to be awarded (at 1554–1555). </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) The point at which firm prognosis of the plaintiff can be made</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Second, the later a firm prognosis of the plaintiff can be made after the incident, <span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">the more likely it will be for an order for bifurcation to be made. In </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">the Court of Appeal decision of </span><span class="font-italic" style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Hawkins v New Mendip Engineering Ltd </span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">[1966] 1</span><span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)"> WLR 1341, the plaintiff suffered a head injury at work. While drugs helped to keep his condition in check, there remained a 50% chance of major epilepsy developing but no firm prognosis could be made until five years after the accident. If the plaintiff did develop major epilepsy, he could become virtually unemployable. The defendant appealed against the trial judge’s award, arguing that it was too high. Winn LJ commented that this would have been a suitable case for bifurcation, and for the trial for damages to take place five years after the trial for liability, when there would be greater certainty in terms of the plaintiff’s prognosis (at 1347–1348). </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The complexity of the facts and availability of evidence</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 <span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Third, </span>depending on the complexity of the facts, as well as the existence of video or other documentary evidence, it may be better for the trial for liability to take place before damages. This will be especially the case if an earlier determination on liability is made easier because the facts are fresher in everyone’s memory (see <span class="font-italic">White Book</span> at para 33/3/5). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(D) Possibility for consolidation of several actions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 <span style="color: rgba(33,33,33,1)">Fourth, </span>if an order may be made for several actions arising out of the same accident to be consolidated up to the determination of liability, with liberty to each claimant to have his own damages assessed separately, then this ought to be considered when deciding whether to make a bifurcation order (see <span class="font-italic">White Book</span> at para 33/3/5 citing <span class="font-italic">Healy v A Waddington &amp; Sons Ltd </span>[1954] 1 WLR 688). In this connection, it is relevant to point out the fact that <span class="font-italic">Coenen</span> was a case with two consolidated actions concerning a road traffic collision between two vehicles.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">My decision: this was an appropriate case for bifurcation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 With the principles discussed in mind, I decided that this was an apt case for bifurcation. The onus was on the defendant to show why it was necessary to bifurcate the matter. Applying the “just and convenient” test, I agreed that this was an apt case for bifurcation for the following reasons that were advanced before me.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant’s reasons for bifurcation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 First, I found that there was a clear demarcation between the issues of liability and of damages. Indeed, I saw no indication that the plaintiff intended to run a case which would result in issues of liability and of damages being intertwined. As such, I agreed that there could be substantial cost savings if the issues of liability are decided before the quantum of damages. There will be no abortive work for the damages issue should the liability issue be decided in favour of the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Second, I agreed with the defendant that there are potentially difficult issues arising from the multiplicity of parties involved. This is especially the case since the defendant, as he is entitled to do, has brought in the two relevant third parties in the action. In particular, I also agreed with the defendant that the issues of damages might be inherently complex. They may potentially require a rather involved process. It would therefore be more efficient and in the interests of justice for issues of liability to be decided first.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s reasons against bifurcation</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In my view, the defendant had established a good case for bifurcation to be ordered. I turned then to consider the plaintiff’s objections. In sum, while I sympathised very much with the plaintiff’s plight, I concluded that the reasons she advanced were not <span class="font-italic">legally </span>material to a determination on bifurcation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 First, as important as they are, the plaintiff’s difficulties, such as having to attend trial twice over, were personal in nature. As with the case in <span class="font-italic">Millar</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>these were therefore not strictly relevant to the determination on bifurcation, which is more focused on the broader questions of efficiency (which is in the public interest) and whether substantive justice can be better achieved for all parties (including the plaintiff but <span class="font-italic">also </span>the defendant). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Second, I disagreed that bifurcation may not be cost-effective. Instead, as I have explained in relation to the defendant’s reasons, given the potentially difficult issues raised at the liability stage, including the liability of the third parties, it may be more cost-effective for the liability issues to be decided first. Indeed, if the liability issues are eventually determined against the plaintiff, then all parties can save costs through the avoidance of assessment proceedings. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Third, the plaintiff also alluded to the fact that the third parties had already been asking for a quantification of her claims so that they could take instructions on mediation. I did not think that this assisted the plaintiff. Whether proceedings are bifurcated (or not) should not stop her or her solicitors from providing this information, which would necessarily be tentative prior to the final judicial disposition of the matter, to the third parties. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 For all the above reasons, I ordered for the trial to be bifurcated with costs of the application to be paid to the Director of Legal Aid.</div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Goh Yihan<br/>Judicial Commissioner</div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Sandhu Viviene Kaur and Michelle Kaur (Clifford Law LLP) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Istyana Putri Ibrahim, Zheng Shaokai, Sivabalan s/o Thanabal and Goh Yi Ling (Legal Aid Bureau) for the defendant;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Parmar Karam Singh and Low Huai Pin (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the first third party;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Pan Xingzheng Edric, Sim Zhi Quan Sean and Soh Joh Ming Jonathan (Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP) for the second third party. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
