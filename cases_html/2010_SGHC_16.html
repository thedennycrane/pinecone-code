<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an appeal by Ozone Community
                    Corporation (“Ozone”), a company incorporated and existing under
                    the laws of Japan, against the decision of the Principal Assistant Registrar of
                    Trade Marks (the “PAR”) in <em>Advance Magazine
                        Publishers Inc. v Ozone Community Corporation</em> [2009] SGIPOS 4.
                    Ozone had applied to register the trade mark, “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”
                        (<em>ie</em>, a word mark), in Class 16 (Trade
                    Mark Application No T02/03173J), in respect of the following goods
                    (“Ozone’s goods”):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Before the PAR, AMP based its opposition on the
                    following grounds:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_a"></a>(a)     section 8(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1999 Rev Ed)
                        (“TMA”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_b"></a>(b)     section 8(3) TMA; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_3-p2_c"></a>(c)     section 8(4) TMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">AMP’s
                    opposition under ss 8(3) and 8(4) TMA <em>failed</em>
                    but its opposition <em>succeeded</em> under
                        s 8(2)(<em>b</em>) TMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In allowing AMP’s opposition to <em>succeed</em> under s 8(2)(<em>b</em>) TMA, the PAR found that there was a “likelihood of
                    confusion” between Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark
                    and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark in Class 16 covering
                    “Magazines, books and publications” (<em>ie</em>, the second entry in the table at <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above), see [79] of the PAR’s Grounds of Decision
                    (“GD”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In Ozone’s appeal before me, only two
                    grounds were canvassed by the parties, <em>viz</em>,
                        ss 8(2)(<em>b</em>) and 8(4) TMA. Counsel for AMP
                    confirmed that AMP was not relying on s 8(3) TMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       After hearing the parties’ oral
                    submissions and considering their written submissions, I reversed the decision
                    of the PAR and allowed Ozone’s Trade Mark Application No T02/03173J for
                    the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark in Class 16 to proceed to
                    registration (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above). I now give the
                    reasons for my decision. To facilitate understanding, I have set out the

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       With respect to AMP, the PAR set out the
                    following background facts at [11]–[17] of his GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>[AMP’s] Evidence</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    [AMP’s] only statutory declaration was
                            declared on 24<sup>th</sup> August 2005 in the United
                            State [<em>sic</em>] of America by Mr. John W.
                            Bellando, the Vice President of [AMP] since 1 January 2000. [AMP
                            states] that the first issue of GLAMOUR magazine had been published more
                            than 60 years ago in May 1941. Since then [AMP states] that the GLAMOUR
                            magazine has been devoted to the reporting and portraying [of], among
                            other things, women’s fashion, beauty, careers, relationships,
                            sex/health, women’s issues, travel, food, home decorating, cars,
                            audio, film and more, all directed towards the contemporary working
                            woman.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">12    [AMP states] that [it has] secured registrations or
                            [has] pending registrations of the GLAMOUR mark in more than 100
                            countries. There are some copies of some of the Certificates of
                            Registration attached to the statutory declaration. There is also a
                            table listing the countries in which the GLAMOUR mark has been
                            registered or is pending registration. It should be noted that the
                            number of Certificates of Registration do not match the number of
                            countries where the GLAMOUR mark is listed as registered. I note that
                            [AMP has] made assertions that sought to prove that [AMP has] worldwide
                            reputation. However, to support such an important fact, [it has] only
                            submitted sample copies of the Certificates of Registration in the
                            various countries where [it] had claimed the reputation exists. The list
                            of countries includes 94 countries, whereas the exhibits to the
                            statutory declaration only show copies of Certificates of Registration
                            from 43 countries. This is only as far as I can tell; the next issue
                            that I have with the evidence is that most of it comes without a
                            certified translation. Since the certificates come from all over the
                            world, I am presented with a vast array of languages that I am afraid I
                            do not have the faculty to master. Where this is the case, the
                            Certificate of Registration shall do nothing more to substantiate the
                            assertions of [AMP] than if there was no copy submitted at all. It is
                            truly a pity that, for a fact that is as crucial as the completeness of
                            the worldwide reputation, there is only partial substantiation of the
                            assertions of [AMP]. That is not to say that the statement by Mr.
                            Bellando is of no weight; it was made under oath and the penalties of
                            being found to be untruthful while under oath strongly discourage any
                            untruthful statements. However, the case for the worldwide reputation
                            could have been made much stronger had all the Certificates of
                            Registration been presented, and accompanied by the certified
                            translation of the certificate. I have some understanding of the
                            difficulty that counsel faces when asking for and obtaining this
                            information, but parties who present a bare statement of worldwide
                            reputation without anything more will risk facing significant challenges
                            on their statement, or at least and have their statements bear much less
                            weight.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">13    [AMP states] that [its] GLAMOUR magazine is sold
                            and distributed in many countries worldwide. The total global
                            circulation has amounted to at least 2,376,096 copies per month (based
                            on the average circulation figure for September 2002). [AMP tenders]
                            into evidence a table of countries where the GLAMOUR magazine is
                            presently distributed and sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    In terms of domestic sales, [AMP states] that [it]
                            first commenced use of the GLAMOUR mark from at least as early as
                            September 1984. They provide the circulation numbers for Singapore for

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The numeric value of these figures was not challenged by [Ozone].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    [AMP states] that the magazine has won more than 59
                            major magazine awards since 1990 and reaches over 12 million readers
                            each month internationally. The magazine also outsells more than 98% of
                            all magazines on the newsstands. The GLAMOUR mark is also world famous
                            by way of the GLAMOUR websites that are accessible worldwide. By virtue
                            of this extremely substantial and extensive use of the GLAMOUR mark, the
                            mark has become distinctive of the Opponents both in Singapore and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       With respect to Ozone, the following background
                    facts were set out at [18]–[23] of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b><em>[Ozone’s] Evidence</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    [Ozone’s] evidence comes by way of a
                            statutory declaration declared in Japan on
                                5<sup>th</sup> December 2006 by Mr Noriyuki
                            Yamagani. He states that he is a brand manager of [Ozone] and has been
                            for the past 19 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    [Ozone is] a company based in Japan focused on the
                            design and retailing of fashion apparel and accessories for both men and
                            women. [Ozone is] the registered [proprietor] of the trade mark HYSTERIC
                            GLAMOUR in Japan, United Kingdom, United State[s] of America, Hong Kong,
                            Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea. The Certificates of Registration and the
                            certified copies of translation of certificates not in English were duly
                            presented as evidence of their goodwill and reputation. In particular,
                            [Ozone refers] to the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark in the UK in Class 16
                            covering <b><em>“Paper and cardboard; industrial
                                packaging containers of paper; towels of paper; table napkins of
                                paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns;

                                paintings and calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands;
                                playing cards; stationery and study materials”</em></b>.
                            [Ozone highlights] that this Class 16 mark co-exists on the UK
                            register with [AMP’s] GLAMOUR mark in the UK. [emphasis in
                            original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    [Ozone] had invented the mark HYSTERIC GLAMOUR for
                            use in connection with fashion apparel. [Ozone] had subsequently used
                            the mark in Japan since 1984 on clothing, bags, footwear and fashion
                            accessories. [Ozone] tendered evidence of advertisements in Japanese
                            magazines as well as extracts from [its] company website as evidence of
                            the fashion style of the products sold.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    [Ozone asserts] that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR brand has
                            become extremely famous as a fashion clothes label in Japan. [Ozone
                            submits] that a travel listing in the website Yahoo! Travel Listing as
                            well as the list of HYSTERIC GLAMOUR retail stores located throughout
                            Japan point to a significant reputation built by [Ozone] since
                            1984.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    [Ozone claims] that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR brand has
                            in recent years gained a business presence in countries apart from
                            Japan. HYSTERIC GLAMOUR stores have been set up in Hong Kong and in the
                            United States of America. [Ozone asserts] that [it has] two stores in
                            Hong Kong and 25 stores in the US. I note that, on a careful examination
                            of the exhibits before me, that the stores that [Ozone claims] are the

                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”
                    mark were “similar” within the meaning of s 8(2)(<em>b</em>) TMA. As correctly noted by the PAR, there are three
                    aspects to similarity, <em>viz</em>, visual similarity,
                    aural or phonetic similarity, and conceptual similarity.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Similarity of marks</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Visual similarity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The PAR found that Ozone’s
                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”
                    mark were visually <em>dissimilar</em> on a simple visual
                    analysis and that there was no dominant element in either of the word
                    marks:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">68    I have been assaulted [<em>sic</em>] with diametrically opposed arguments on which
                            element is the dominant element. But while [AMP tried] valiantly to
                            deflect attention from the visual aspects by advancing [its] argument
                            that the dominant element is GLAMOUR, and [AMP] advance[d] equally
                            trying arguments that the element HYSTERIC is not overshadowed, the
                            simple analysis in visual similarity is merely to look at the marks. In
                            this case, there are many visual differences between the marks. The
                            HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has 15 letters, GLAMOUR has 7 letters; the
                            HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has two words, the GLAMOUR mark has one. I do not
                            think that the language represented by the letters is so unusual or
                            descriptive that there should be any dominant element. I am of the
                            opinion that the marks are visually dissimilar. …</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Aural or phonetic similarity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The PAR also found that Ozone’s
                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”
                    mark were aurally <em>dissimilar</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">69    I still cannot help but find that a simple analysis
                            is all that is required of the test of aural similarity. The simple
                            analysis here is that the complete sound of [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark
                            is different from [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark. The simple
                            facts are that [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark is made up of five
                            readable syllables in two words with a pause in between, whereas
                            [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark is two syllables in one word. Three of the
                            syllables in [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark are not duplicated as
                            sounds in [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark. This basic analysis shows that
                            there is a fair bit of dissimilarity between the two marks in terms of
                            syntax. The question is whether the repetition of two common syllables
                            that form a common word ‘glamour’ will cause these two
                            marks, as a whole, to be considered as aurally similar. My answer is no,
                            and here again I do not think that [<em>Matratzen Concord
                                GMBH v OHIM, Case T-6/01, Judgment of the Court of First Instance
                                (fourth Chamber)</em>] can apply to swing the decision the
                            other way. The case of Matratzen decided (at para XLIII) that, as
                            between the elements ‘Matratzen’ and ‘Concord’,
                            the element Matratzen was an invented word with hard to pronounce
                            consonants and appeared more likely to be remembered by the public. I do
                            not have this distinction before me in the present case, I only have
                            before me the words HYSTERIC and GLAMOUR, and I am hard pressed to say
                            that one is more pronounceable than the other so much so that the public
                            is more likely to remember it. Consequently, and bearing in mind my
                            earlier basic analysis of the two marks, I am of the opinion that the
                            marks are aurally dissimilar.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Conceptual similarity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Having found that Ozone’s
                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”
                    mark were visually <em>and</em> aurally <em>dissimilar</em>, the PAR then found that the words marks were however
                    conceptually <em>similar</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">70    The area of conceptual similarity is the hardest
                            element to determine in this case. The [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR]
                            mark and [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark both bear the word GLAMOUR. The crux
                            of the decision lies in whether the word GLAMOUR has been modified by
                            the term HYSTERIC. I note the arguments from both sides relating to the
                                [<em>sic</em>] whether I should treat the word
                            HYSTERIC as distinctive or laudatory. I am of the opinion that the word
                            HYSTERIC does not modify the word GLAMOUR in a similar way as
                            the…case [in <em>Itochu Corporation v Worldwide
                                Brands Inc</em> [2007] SGIPOS 9]. The word HYSTERIC does
                            modify the concept of GLAMOUR in a way that is described by [Ozone at
                            [51] above] to a certain point. However, the main concept is still
                            ‘glamour’. The concept has not been completely reversed, as
                            it has been in [<em>Itochu Corporation v Worldwide Brands
                                Inc</em> [2007] SGIPOS 9], where the ruggedness of the Camel
                            concept was essentially reversed by the addition of the prefix
                            ‘sweet’. In this case, the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark still
                            relies on the concept that they are ‘glamorous’, albeit
                            injecting the new element of being ‘hysterically glamorous’.
                            From another point of view this should still hold true; [Ozone’s
                            concept] cannot be that the clothes do not look glamorous at all,
                            otherwise it would frustrate the purpose of their mark, which is to sell
                            designed clothes at a premium price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71    I am of the view that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark is
                            in some way conceptually similar to the GLAMOUR mark in that both use
                            the ‘glamour’ concept, one mark appeals to [the] orthodox
                            meaning of ‘glamour’ while the other mark gives a spin to it
                            but still is based on ‘glamour’. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On the basis of such conceptual similarity
                        <em>alone</em>, the PAR concluded that Ozone’s
                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”
                    mark, though visually and aurally dissimilar, were nevertheless
                    “similar” within the meaning of s 8(2)(<em>b</em>) TMA. The PAR then proceeded to consider whether the goods
                    bearing Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s
                    “GLAMOUR” mark were “similar”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Similarity of goods</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The PAR found that there was similarity in
                    respect of <em>only</em> the Class 16 goods specified
                    by Ozone (<em>ie</em>, Ozone’s goods: see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a> above) and AMP (<em>ie</em>, AMP’s goods: see <a href="#p1_2">[2]</a> above):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73    … In relation to [AMP’s] goods in
                            Classes 9, 35, 41 and 42, there is no similarity in terms of the
                            goods. In relation to [AMP’s] Class 16 goods, [Ozone]
                            conceded that there may be an overlap with the goods that they are
                            applying for. Even without this concession, it is clear to me that the
                            scope of [AMP’s] description of goods (<b><em>“Magazines, books and publications”</em></b>) is
                            clearly a sub-set of [Ozone’s goods](in particular the mention of

<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Likelihood of confusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The PAR then considered whether there was a
                    likelihood of confusion on the part of the public in respect of AMP’s and
                    Ozone’s Class 16 goods. He noted at [74] of the GD, referring to [66]
                    of the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>McDonald’s
                        Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd</em> [2005] 1 SLR 177
                        (“<em>McDonald’s (CA)</em>”)
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The lack of similarity as between the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark and the
                        GLAMOUR mark is only one factor in the determination of the likelihood of
                        confusion, since the element of likelihood of confusion takes into account a
                        lot more than just the similarity of marks and of the goods. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Following that, the PAR identified the
                    relevant segment of the public to be “the entire group of women who read
                    magazines for leisure and [who] are fashion conscious”. As Ozone had
                    “not submitted very much on the intended use of the goods other than the
                    specifications” (see [76] of the GD), the PAR considered notional use by
                    Ozone of the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark in assessing the likelihood
                    of confusion. In this aspect, the PAR noted that given the similarity of goods
                    (see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above) and because it was
                    “reasonable to speculate” (since Ozone had not submitted any
                    evidence of the actual or intended use of its goods) that any use by Ozone of
                    the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark would not fall far from their core
                    business of “design and retailing of fashion apparel and accessories for
                    both men and women”, this “may result in a situation where both
                    the marks will be used on similar goods”. The PAR rejected AMP’s
                    submission that the public would see Ozone’s “HYSTERIC
                    GLAMOUR” mark as a subsidiary or spin-off of AMP’s
                    “GLAMOUR” mark purely by the application of the conceptually
                    similar marks onto similar goods and was of the view that there was no
                    calculated attempt to deceive because Ozone’s and AMP’s
                    “advertising retain their own special flavour, with no attempt to copy
                    each other’s style” (see [78] of the GD). Nevertheless, the PAR
                    concluded at [79] of the GD:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">79    Having considered all the above factors, I believe
                            that there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the relevant
                            public, in this case the members of the public who are female who read
                            magazines for leisure and are fashion conscious. Although there are some
                            differences between the [AMP’s “GLAMOUR”] mark and
                            [Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”] mark in terms of visual
                            and aural similarity, there are similarities in concept. This similarity
                            could give rise to a likelihood of confusion in the relevant segment of
                            the public if the marks were affixed on similar goods, especially since
                            [Ozone’s and AMP’s businesses] overlap. Where this is the
                            case, this ground of opposition will succeed as all the essential

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Under this section, the PAR first observed, at
                    [96] of the GD, that to succeed in an action for passing off under s 8(4)
                    TMA, AMP had to satisfy three criteria, <em>viz</em>,
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_a"></a>(a)     AMP’s goods and services had
                        acquired a goodwill or reputation in the market and are known by some
                        distinguishing feature;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_b"></a>(b)     there was a misrepresentation by Ozone (whether or not
                        intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or
                        services offered by Ozone were goods or services of AMP;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_21-p2_c"></a>(c)     AMP had
                        suffered or was likely to suffer damage as a result of the erroneous belief
                        engendered by Ozone’s misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Goodwill or reputation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     With regard to the first element of goodwill
                    or reputation, the PAR observed that although AMP claimed that its use of the
                    “GLAMOUR” mark in Singapore started from 1984, apart from a table
                    and random invoices that did not date beyond the year 2000, there was no
                    “good evidence” that AMP’s magazine started selling in
                    Singapore from 1984. The PAR also noted that the highest circulation of
                    AMP’s magazine at 903 copies in Singapore was unimpressive and was a
                    “number that [was] disproportionately low for the population of Singapore
                    that [was] around 3 million at that time” (see [88] of the GD). The PAR
                    then concluded that the circulation numbers however indicated that AMP had
                    “some goodwill and reputation in Singapore”. Since the further
                    point as to whether the goodwill rested in AMP or the distributor of its
                    magazine was not argued before the PAR, he concluded that the goodwill should
                    belong to AMP in the absence of any challenge (see [98] of the
                GD).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Misrepresentation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     On misrepresentation, the PAR noted that the
                    mere fact that a likelihood of confusion was found under s 8(2) TMA (see
                        <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>–<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above) did not automatically lead to the finding that there
                    would be misrepresentation under passing off (see [99] of the GD); the element
                    of misrepresentation “require[d] more than just a likelihood of confusion
                    in the sense understood under trade mark law” (see [100] of the GD).
                    Relying on his earlier observation (see <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>
                    above) that there was no evidence that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC
                    GLAMOUR” mark was a subsidiary or spin-off of AMP’s
                    “GLAMOUR” mark and that Ozone’s and AMP’s advertising
                    retained their own special flavour, with no attempt to copy each other’s
                    style, the PAR concluded that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">101    … This evidence also goes to show that
                            there is clearly no misrepresentation here, as there is no attempt [by
                            Ozone to try] to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the
                            goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Damage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Having found that the second criteria of
                    “misrepresentation” was not made out (see <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a> above), the PAR then considered it “natural that
                    there cannot be any case to damage that has occurred or that is likely to
                    occur” (see [102] of the GD). However, the PAR also considered the
                    alternative position where “confusing similarity” under
                    s 8(2) TMA may be seen as a misrepresentation. In this aspect, he noted
                    that he was unconvinced by AMP’s argument that its magazine was a
                    “class publication” to prove damage:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">103    … I am unconvinced that the mere mention
                            [of or] association with [Ozone’s business] will bring about the
                            ‘devastating’ damage that [AMP claims] will happen. The use
                            of tattooed individuals and of vulgar words on a T-shirt design that
                            will appear on the pages or cover of another magazine is too remote a
                            cause that can be linked to the damage in the goodwill of [AMP’s]
                            GLAMOUR magazine.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">104    Further, I would think that advertisers are only
                            likely to leave the magazine if the magazine itself is falling from
                            being a ‘class publication’, and that is only if the
                            magazine carrying the advertisements themselves are actively carrying
                            out actions (to use the quoted examples, using heavily tattooed models
                            and vulgar words) that will cause the magazine to be seen as a
                            publication that is not a class publication. To say that advertisers
                            will remove advertisements from one magazine because of the association
                            of that one magazine with another offending publication, or because of
                            the association of that one magazine with an offending entity is a
                            tenuous argument, especially since the advertisers’ advertisement
                            does not come anywhere near the offending publication.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">105    In any event, I note that the ‘class
                            publication’ principle originated from [AMP’s] own
                            literature. There are also no other proofs of damage that were tendered
                            before me.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Accordingly, the PAR concluded that because
                    the elements of passing off were not made out, AMP’s ground of opposition
                    under s 8(4) TMA failed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Having set out the grounds for the PAR’s
                    decision, I now proceed to summarise the parties’ main contentions in the
                    appeal before me (see <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a>–<a href="#p1_28">[28]</a> below), before elaborating further on the
                    parties’ arguments in my decision below.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Ozone’s arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Ozone raised five arguments to contend that
                    the PAR had erred in holding that its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was
                    “confusingly similar” to Ozone’s “GLAMOUR”
                    mark pursuant to s 8(2)(<em>b</em>) TMA (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>–<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a> above), <em>viz</em>, that the PAR had
                    erred in:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_a"></a>(a)     finding that its “HYSTERIC
                        GLAMOUR” mark was conceptually similar to Ozone’s
                        “GLAMOUR” mark (see <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>
                        above);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_b"></a>(b)     finding
                        that its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was “similar”
                        to Ozone’s “GLAMOUR” mark on the basis of conceptual
                        similarity <em>alone</em>;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_c"></a>(c)     not considering the lack of distinctiveness of
                        AMP’s earlier “GLAMOUR” mark (see <a href="#p1_64">[64]</a> below);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_d"></a>(d)     finding that Ozone’s goods, <em>excluding</em> “printed matter” (<em>viz</em>, “paper and cardboard; industrial
                        packaging containers of paper; towels of paper; table napkins of paper; hand
                        towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns; tailors’

                        were similar to AMP’s goods (<em>viz</em>,
                        “magazines books and publications”) ( see <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a> above); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_27-p2_e"></a>(e)     finding that there was a likelihood of confusion
                        between its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s
                        “GLAMOUR” word mark (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a>–<a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">AMP’s arguments on appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     On its end, AMP submitted that the PAR had not
                    erred except in three respects, <em>viz</em>, that the PAR
                    had erred in holding that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_a"></a>(a)     its “GLAMOUR” mark was
                        not <em>visually</em> similar to Ozone’s
                        ”HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark (see <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a> above);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_b"></a>(b)     its “GLAMOUR” word mark was not <em>aurally</em> similar to Ozone’s ”HYSTERIC
                        GLAMOUR” word mark (see <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>
                        above); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_28-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        law of passing off would not prevent Ozone’s use of the
                        “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark pursuant to s 8(4) TMA (see
                            <a href="#p1_20">[20]</a> –<a href="#p1_25">[25]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of this court</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     As stated above at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a>, the parties’ contentions before me related only to
                    the PAR’s decision on the applicability of ss 8(2)(<em>b</em>) and 8(4) TMA. Before elaborating on the law and the
                    parties’ respective arguments, it would be useful to first examine the
                    standard of review applicable in the present proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The role of an appellate tribunal</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In <em>Future Enterprises Pte

                        (“<em>Future Enterprises</em>”), the
                    Court of Appeal was of the view that appeals from a decision of the PAR
                    “are not in the nature of a rehearing” and the PAR’s
                    findings of fact should be disturbed only where there is a “material
                    error in principle”, <em>ie</em>, a
                    “significant departure from a proper assessment of the law or the
                    facts” (see [5]–[7] of <em>Future

                            disturb the dual findings of fact by the PAR and the trial judge of
                            similarity and likelihood of confusion between the two word marks
                            “MacCoffee” and “McCAFÉ”. In <em>Reef Trade Mark</em> [2003] RPC 5, Robert
                            Walker LJ considered the function of an appellate tribunal in
                            relation to appeals from the UK Trade Mark Registry, and concluded (at
                            [28]) that <em>“an appellate court should …
                                show a real reluctance, but not the very highest degree of
                                reluctance, to interfere in the absence of a distinct and material
                                error of principle”</em>. In <em>SC

                            EWHC 2756 (Ch), Laddie J expressed the same sentiments (at
                            [19]) as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">It is not the duty of this court to overturn a decision of the Trade
                            Mark Registry simply because it comes to the conclusion that it might
                            have decided the case differently had it, that is to say the High Court,
                            been the court of first instance. <em>It has to be
                                demonstrated that the decision at first instance was wrong in a
                                material way; that is to say there must be some significant
                                departure from a proper assessment of the law or the
                                facts</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">6    This prudent approach has been unequivocally

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">26    … The Court of Appeal in Future Enterprises
                            did not appear to have considered the effect of this provision.
                            Nevertheless, the fact that such proceedings are “by way of
                            rehearing” [as stated in O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC] does
                            not necessarily mean that the appeal court’s decision is
                            unfettered. An appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal is
                            similarly by way of rehearing under O 57 r 3(1) of the ROC.
                            However, the Court of Appeal will be slow to upset an exercise of
                            discretion by the trial judge (Golden Shore Transportation Pte Ltd v UCO
                            Bank [2004] 1 SLR 6 at [44]). Further, with respect to finding
                            of facts, the Court of Appeal is generally reluctant to interfere
                            because the trial judge is in a better position to assess the veracity
                            and credibility of the witnesses (Seah Ting Soon trading as Sing Meng Co

                            rule 4(2) of the [ROC] provides that an appeal from the Registrar
                            of Trade Marks shall be by way of “rehearing”. At
                            para 87/3/7 of Singapore Civil Procedure 2007 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell
                            Asia, 2007 ) (“Singapore Civil Procedure”), it iterates
                            that appeals to the court from the decision of the registrar [of trade
                            marks] is governed inter alia, by O 55 and that the procedure is
                            “by way of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">10    On

                            tribunal or person, para 55/1/2 of Singapore Civil Procedure notes
                            that O 55 r 2(1) stipulates that the appeal is by way of rehearing.
                            Order 55, it suggests, confers upon the Court wider powers than those so
                            conferred under O 53 which deals with, inter alia, judicial review.
                            Hence, O 55 r 6(5) provides that the appellate court can make
                            any order which should have been made by the tribunal. The appellate
                            court is thus not confined to merely determining whether the decision
                            below was compliant with rules of natural justice or reached honestly
                            (Ling Uk Choon v Public Accountants Board [2004] 3 SLR 517 at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11    “By way of
                            rehearing” in my view means that the Court is not constrained to
                            determine only whether the tribunal’s decision was proper and/or
                            contained manifest errors of fact and law. If it wishes to, the Court in
                            its discretion may consider the entire ream of evidence before it and
                            venture beyond determining the propriety of the tribunal’s
                            decision or inquiring into whether there had been manifest errors of
                            fact or law. However, I do not think that it places an irrevocable
                            burden upon the Courts to hear the matter anew so that the substantive
                            merits fall to be determined afresh. As para 57/3/1 of Singapore
                            Civil Procedure observes with regard to the phrase “by way of
                            rehearing”, albeit in relation to appeals to the Court of
                            Appeal:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">These words do not mean that the witnesses are heard afresh. They
                            indicate the appeal is not limited to a consideration whether the

                            trial has taken place, so that a new trial should be ordered. They
                            indicate that the court considers (so far as may be relevant) the whole
                            of the evidence given in the court below and the whole course of the

                        for goods identical with or similar to those for which AMP’s earlier
                        “GLAMOUR” word mark is protected (

                        that there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public by
                        virtue of the similarity of the marks (<em>ie</em>,
                        Condition 1) and of the goods (<em>ie</em>,

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    … While we can see some link and overlap

                            different. The fact that a sign is similar to a registered mark does not
                            automatically mean that there will be a likelihood of confusion on the
                            part of the public. That is a question of fact to be determined by the
                            court, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. Moreover, the
                            question of similarity is really a matter of degree. In a broad sort of
                            sense, the greater the similarity between a mark and a sign, the greater
                            will be the likelihood of confusion. <em>However, if
                                either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there will not

                                there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does it mean that if
                                the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on similar
                                goods, that there will ipso facto be confusion in the minds of the

                            have been phrased differently. As presently worded, there is no
                            presumption of confusion once the two aspects of similarity are present.

<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   VISUAL, AURAL AND CONCEPTUAL SIMILARITY</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> above, there are three aspects to similarity, <em>viz</em>, visual similarity, aural or phonetic similarity and
                    conceptual similarity (see <em>The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)</em>
                    at [10]). Whether there is a similarity of marks in these three aspects of
                    similarity is essentially a question of fact (see <em>Johnson
                        &amp; Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm Corp)</em>
                    [2007] 1 SLR 1082 (“<em>Johnson &amp;
                        Johnson</em>”) at [9]). The law does <em>not</em> however require <em>all</em> three
                    similarities to be made out before the finding that the two marks are similar
                    can be made (see <em>MediaCorp</em> at [32]). In this
                    aspect, the observations of Bently and Sherman in <em>Intellectual Property Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed,
                    2009) (“<em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em>”) at
                    pp 863-866 are also apposite (footnotes omitted):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Visual, aural and conceptual similarity</em>. The
                        marks should be assessed from the point of view of their visual, aural and
                        conceptual similarities. T<em>ypically, tribunals consider
                            each in turn, before reaching an overall conclusion. In so doing, they
                            have observed that a trade-off can occur: visual and conceptual
                            differences, for example, can offset aural
                        similarities</em>.</p>

                        the ECJ has ruled [in <em>Lloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen
                            Handel BV</em>, Case C-342/97 [1999] 2 <em>CMLR </em>1343] that, <em>in an appropriate

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In other situations, conceptual dissimilarity, as for

                    authors of <em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em> note at footnote
                    51, pp 864-865 that although the:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Accordingly, the relative importance of each
                    type of similarity will thus vary with the circumstances in hand, in particular
                    the goods and the types of mark. The fact that one type of similarity is made
                    out does <em>not</em> necessarily mean that the marks are
                    similar. Also, regard should be had to the <em>type</em> of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>[21.5.12]</b> The distinctiveness in the earlier
                        trade mark is one important factor. <em>Where a common word
                            is included in the earlier trade mark, the tribunal should be wary of
                            granting a monopoly in its use. This translates into a reluctance to
                            hold that two marks which contain a common word are similar
                            marks</em>.</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Distinctiveness</em>. The question of whether
                        marks are similar will often be dependent on the inherent or acquired
                        distinctiveness of the mark (for the goods or services for which it is
                        registered). This has a number of effects</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">First, <em>the less distinctive the earlier trade mark, the
                            less literal or visual alteration is necessary to ensure that the later
                            mark is not similar</em>. For example, the CFI comparing two words
                        CASTELLANI and CASTERLLUCA for wine from the point of view of a German
                        consumer found the two marks to be dissimilar, because the
                        ‘castel’ element is a common descriptive component in wine names
                        and the applicant’s suffix ‘luca’ would be seen as the
                        Italian name and thus sufficient to differentiate the marks. In <em>Reed Executive plc v Reed Business Information Ltd</em>
                        [[2004] RPC (40) 767], Jacob LJ stated that <em>‘where
                            a mark is descriptive small differences may suffice to avoid
                            confusion’</em>, giving an illustration from the law of
                        passing-off concerning the terms OFFICE CLEANING ASSOCIATION and OFFICE
                        CLEANING SERVICES. <em>Where the distinctiveness of the
                            earlier trade mark is very low, the later mark will have to be in close
                            proximity for it to be similar</em>, as with THERMAWEAR and
                        THERMAWARM. <em>The same principle applies to common names
                            which intrinsically have a low level of
                        distinctiveness</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Second, if the earlier mark is highly distinctive, then a mark that has
                        been substantially modified might nonetheless still be similar.

                            terms of visual similarity, it is clear that the mark and the sign share
                            one common denominator: the word “POLO”. <em>In cases where there is a common denominator, it is
                                important to look at the differences between the mark and the sign

                                registered mark. In order to decide this, I first have to consider

                        (<em>ie</em>, that the consumer may not be able to
                    remember a mark perfectly) (see <em>Nautical Concept Pte Ltd v
                        Jeffrey Mark Richard</em> [2007] 1 SLR 1071 at [30]). The
                    average consumer only rarely has the chance to make a direct comparison between
                    the marks, and so must place his trust in the “imperfect picture of [the

                    appear to be dissimilar, when the possibility of imperfect recollection is taken
                    into account, the two marks may in fact be similar (see <em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em> at p 865). Hence, the court will not

                        <em>The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the present instance, although the word
                    marks of Ozone and AMP share one common denominator, <em>viz</em>, the word “GLAMOUR”, I agreed with the
                    PAR’s observation that there were:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… many visual differences between the marks. The HYSTERIC GLAMOUR
                        mark has 15 letters, GLAMOUR has 7 letters; the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has
                        two words, the GLAMOUR mark has one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Furthermore, given that the word “HYSTERIC”, which
                    appears at the beginning of Ozone’s word mark, is almost of equal length
                    to the word “GLAMOUR”, I could not see how it would be entirely
                    overlooked or overshadowed by the word “GLAMOUR”. That
                    Ozone’s word mark has two words was to my mind a visual difference. Thus,
                    even if “GLAMOUR” is the more common word of the two (<em>ie</em>, “HYSTERIC” and
                    “GLAMOUR”) and may come to mind more quickly than
                    “HYSTERIC”, the consumer with an imperfect recollection (see
                        <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a> above) would still remember that
                    Ozone’s word mark has an additional word to “GLAMOUR”. In
                    these circumstances, I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s finding that
                    Ozone‘s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was visually <em>dissimilar</em> to AMP’s “GLAMOUR”
                    mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Aural similarity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     I have already set out at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a> above the PAR’s reasons for holding
                    that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s
                    “GLAMOUR” mark were aurally <em>dissimilar</em>. It is worth noting that in <em>Aristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld</em> (1943) 60 RPC 87, Luxmoore LJ’s
                    dissenting judgment stated, at 108:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[t]he answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too
                        nearly the sound of another …
                        <em>must nearly always depend on first impression</em>,
                        for obviously a person who is familiar with both words will neither be
                        deceived nor confused. It is the person who only knows the one word and has
                        perhaps an <em>imperfect recollection</em> of it who is
                        likely to be deceived or confused. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">This statement was cited with approval in the House of Lords by
                    Viscount Maugham in <em>Aristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld</em> (1945)
                    62 RPC 65 at 72.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     In <em>Bently &amp;
                        Sherman</em> at p 865, the learned authors noted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">When comparing marks aurally, tribunals have tended to carry out a
                        quantitative assessment: do the two signs have more syllables in common than
                        not?</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In these circumstances, I was of the view that the PAR’s
                    approach in dealing with the question of aural similarity was entirely
                    consistent with the foregoing approach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In this case, both “HYSTERIC”
                    and “GLAMOUR” were English words, although the latter could be
                    said to be the more common English word. However, it must be borne in mind that
                    Ozone’s word mark <em>starts</em> with the entirely
                    separate word “HYSTERIC” preceding the word
                    “GLAMOUR”. Also, Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”
                    word mark would be read and pronounced as two separate and distinct words, in
                    the order of “HYSTERIC” and “GLAMOUR”. AMP’s
                    “GLAMOUR” word mark, on the other hand, would be read as a single
                    word. The comparison in this case was between a two-word mark and a single word
                    mark, so that even if the actual word “HYSTERIC” was forgotten, it
                    would not be forgotten that there was an additional word in Ozone’s word
                    mark. While I did not agree entirely with the reasons of the PAR, I also
                    concluded that the words marks were aurally <em>dissimilar</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(4)   Conceptual similarity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     With regard to the requirement of conceptual
                    similarity, <em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em> note at
                    p 866 (footnotes omitted):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Because similarity is assessed conceptually as well as visually and
                        phonetically, in thinking about whether marks are similar, it is necessary
                        to take account of the ideas that lie behind or inform the earlier mark.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark in the present case
                    clearly relied on the orthodox meaning of “glamour”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In this instance, the PAR had held that
                    Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s
                    “GLAMOUR” mark were conceptually <em>similar</em>. Ozone contended that the PAR, who had found the word
                    marks both visually and aurally <em>dissimilar</em>, had
                    then subsequently erred in his finding that the word marks were similar on the
                    basis of conceptual similarity <em>alone</em>. To this end,
                    it referred to the following passage in the decision of the High Court in
                        <em>McDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises Pte
                        Ltd</em> [2004] 2 SLR 652 (<em>McDonald’s (HC)</em>) (an appeal against which was dismissed by
                    the Court of Appeal in <em>McDonald’s
                    (CA)</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">43    As to the visual and
                            aural similarities of the marks, I do not consider them to be
                            confusingly similar. There are indeed significant visual differences
                            between them – the depiction of an eagle as opposed to the golden
                            arches forming the letter “M” – and aural
                            differences – “McChicken”,
                            “McNuggets”, “Egg McMuffin” and
                            “Sausage McMuffin” compared to “MacTea”,
                            “MacChocolate” and “MacNoodles”. Below the
                            word component “MacTea”, for example, the legend
                            “3-in-1 Instant Hot Tea” appears. Other than the letter
                            “M” in “MacTea”, there is no mark similar to
                            the opponents’ “M” logo anywhere on the packaging.
                            The word marks are also different in appearance in terms of colour, font
                            and typeface. The second and third syllables of the application marks
                            are different in sound from the opponents’. The differences leave
                            different impressions on people’s
                            minds.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">44    Is there a conceptual
                            link between the two in that the common use of the first syllable
                            “Mac” or “Mc” means that both are likely to
                            be taken as indicative of a common identity? The use of the first
                            syllable “Mac” in the applicants’ range of products
                            is not unlike the case of the opponents in that TWC has admitted to the
                            use of the same naming system as McDonald’s. But it does not, in
                            my view, override the other differences mentioned earlier and, when
                            viewed as a whole, <em>I do not believe there will be

<p class="Judg-1">also merits closer scrutiny. This observation was made by the Federal
                    Court in <em>Sports Café</em> after reviewing an extract
                    from the earlier decision of <em>Cooper Engineering Co Pty Ltd v
                        Sigmund Pumps Ltd</em> (1952) 86 CLR 536 (“<em>Cooper Engineering</em>”). In <em>Sports Café</em>, the Federal Court stated at 556-557 that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>The idea behind the mark</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Cooper Engineering</em> the application was
                        for registration of the words “Rain King”. The
                        opponent’s mark was RAINMASTER.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">After pointing out the differences between the suffix
                        “master” and the word “King” in appearance and
                        sound [Dixon, William and Kitto JJ] continued (at 538-9):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">The two words are so unlike to the eye and to the ear that counsel for
                            the appellant was forced to rely on the likelihood of deception arising
                            from the two words conveying the same idea of the superiority or
                            supremacy of the article as a mechanism for making a spray similar to
                            falling rain or artificial rain as it was called during the argument.
                            But it is obvious that trade marks, especially word marks, could be
                            quite unlike and yet convey the same idea of the superiority or some
                            particular suitability of an article for the work it was intended to do.
                            To refuse an application for registration on this ground would be to
                            give the proprietor of a registered trade mark a complete monopoly of
                            all words conveying the same idea as his trade mark. The fact that two
                            marks convey the same idea is not sufficient in itself to create a
                            deceptive resemblance between them, although this fact could be taken
                            into account in deciding whether two marks which really looked alike or
                            sounded alike were likely to deceive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Thus the fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevant only if
                        the marks themselves look or sound alike. Commonality of idea might then tip
                        the balance in favour of a finding that the likeness is deceptive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     I could not agree with the narrow approach in
                        <em>Cooper Engineering</em>. While I agreed that one
                    should be slow to refuse registration of a mark simply on the basis of
                    conceptual similarity alone, I was also of the view that it would be wrong to
                    say that conceptual similarity would be relevant only if there was visual or
                    aural similarity. As mentioned (at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>
                    above), the relative importance of each type of similarity must necessarily vary
                    with the circumstances in hand, in particular the goods and the types of mark
                    being compared. The fact that one type of similarity is made out also does
                        <em>not</em> necessarily mean that the marks are
                    similar. To adopt an overly generalised and restrictive principle that
                    conceptual similarity is <em>only</em> relevant to
                    determining similarity between marks when either visual or aural similarity has
                    been made out would be to ignore the fact that each aspect of similarity can
                    vary in different degrees <em>vis-à-vis</em> each other
                    depending on the circumstances, and trade-offs are entirely possible between the
                    three aspects of similarity – for example, conceptual similarity can
                    offset visual and aural dissimilarities. A similar approach was also adopted in
                        <em>Lloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer &amp; Co GmbH v Klijsen
                        Handel BV</em> [2000] FSR 77 (a decision which was followed by
                    the High Court in <em>Richemont International SA v Goldlion
                        Enterprise (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR 401) at

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     The PAR’s reasons for holding that
                    Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s
                    “GLAMOUR” mark were conceptually <em>similar</em> have already been set out above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>. Against this, Ozone contended however that
                    the two marks were conceptually <em>dissimilar</em>. It
                    pointed out that while the word “GLAMOUR” was defined in the
                    online <em>Merriam-Webster</em> dictionary as “an
                    exciting and often illusory and romantic attractiveness”, the usage of
                    the word “HYSTERIC”, which was defined in the <em>Longman Dictionary of the English Language</em> as “someone
                    suffering from hysteria”, changed the complexion of the word
                    “GLAMOUR”. According to it, although the concept of
                    “GLAMOUR” was still present in “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”,
                    the concept had varied because one does not associate “HYSTERIC”
                    with “GLAMOUR”. To support its position, it cited the case of
                        <em>Itochu Corporation v Worldwide Brands, Inc</em>
                    [2007] SGIPOS 9 (“<em>Itochu</em>”), where
                    the marks under comparison were “CAMEL” and
                    “SWEETCAMEL”, as being “closely analogous” to the
                    present factual matrix. In holding that these marks were conceptually <em>dissimilar</em>, the PAR in that case made the following
                    observations at [37]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">37    Bearing in mind the Opponents’ argument that
                            the average consumer normally perceives the mark as a whole without
                            analysing its various details - a principle which has also been relied
                            on by the Applicants - and that marks should not be compared side by
                            side as marks are generally remembered by general impressions rather
                            than by recollection of the whole; <em>I find that there
                                is no conceptual similarity between the Opponents’ and the
                                Applicants’ marks. The Applicants’
                                “SWEETCAMEL” mark does not convey the same idea and
                                impression as the Opponents’ marks. The Opponents’
                                “CAMEL” marks evoke the sense of ruggedness, adventure
                                and masculinity whereas the Applicants’ mark which is preceded
                                by the adjective “sweet” projects a totally opposite

<p class="Judg-1">The decision in <em>Itochu</em> was upheld on
                    appeal by the High Court.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In the present instance, while the PAR was of
                    the view that the word “HYSTERIC” did modify the concept of
                    “GLAMOUR” to a “certain point”, the main concept of
                    “GLAMOUR” had <em>not</em> been
                    “completely reversed” as in <em>Itochu</em>.
                    In this aspect, the PAR observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">70    … In this case, the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark
                            still relies on the concept that they are ‘glamorous’,
                            albeit injecting the new element of being ‘hysterically
                            glamorous’. From another point of view this should still hold
                            true; the concept of [Ozone] cannot be that the clothes do not look
                            glamorous at all, otherwise it would frustrate the purpose of their
                            mark, which is to sell designed clothes at a premium
                        price.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71    I am of the view that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark is
                            in some way conceptually similar to the GLAMOUR mark in that both use
                            the ‘glamour’ concept, one mark appeals to orthodox meaning
                            of ‘glamour’ while the other mark gives a spin to it but
                            still is based on ‘glamour’. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s
                    holding that the word marks in this case were “in some way” (as
                    opposed to completely or to a large extent) conceptually similar. As Ozone
                    conceded, the concept of “GLAMOUR” was still present in
                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     The inquiry however does not stop here. The
                    distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark must also be

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In these circumstances, I was of the view that
                    the PAR had erred in failing to go <em>further</em> after
                    considering the visual, aural and conceptual similarity of the word marks to
                    consider the level of distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR”
                    word mark in his inquiry into the similarity between the marks under
                        s 8(2)(<em>b</em>) TMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     In the present instance, there was no evidence
                    before me to show that the word “GLAMOUR”, which is an ordinary
                    English word (see <a href="#p1_62">[62]</a> above) and not an
                    inventive word, is inherently distinctive. The word “GLAMOUR”, the
                    title of AMP’s magazine, in fact <em>describes</em>
                    the very nature of the content in AMP’s magazine, which is described, on
                    its website, as a magazine for young women interested in fashion, beauty and a
                    contemporary lifestyle and which contains a number of photographs and
                    advertisements displaying fashionable clothing and accessories. In my view, the
                    word “GLAMOUR” is <em>not</em> inherently
                    distinctive.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     Has the word mark “GLAMOUR” then
                    acquired distinctiveness through use in Singapore? To my mind, based on the
                    limited and unsatisfactory evidence tendered by AMP which did little to support
                    its claim that the “GLAMOUR” mark was extensively used in
                    Singapore, this question must be answered in the negative. As evidence in
                    support of its circulation figures between 1990 - 2002 (see [14] of the GD), AMP

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     It may readily be observed that these nine
                    invoices related only to sales in <em>specific</em> months
                    in the <em>limited</em> period from 2000 to 2002. They did
                    not reflect a monthly distribution from 1984 (the year AMP claimed its use of
                    the “GLAMOUR” mark in Singapore started) and neither did they
                    correspond to the total distribution figures submitted by AMP (see [14] of the
                    GD). For example, although the invoice dated 24 August 2001 reflected only
                    the sale of 30 copies of the September 2001 edition of the
                    “GLAMOUR” magazine to TIMES, AMP claimed a distribution figure of
                    823 in September 2001. The nine invoices adduced supported only a fraction of
                    the distribution figures claimed by AMP. Furthermore, the nine invoices related
                    only to the distribution of the “GLAMOUR” magazine to <em>one</em> branch of TIMES (<em>viz</em>,
                    the Centrepoint outlet) and <em>a</em> single supermarket.
                    There was nothing in evidence to support the promotion and/or subsequent sale of
                    the “GLAMOUR” magazine to the Singapore public. In these
                    circumstances, given the paucity of AMP’s evidence, I was of the view that
                    it could not be said that the “GLAMOUR” mark had acquired
                    distinctiveness through use in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     AMP sought to argue, without raising any
                    relevant authority, that its “GLAMOUR” word mark was distinctive
                    by virtue of the fact that it was a registered trade mark under the Act. However
                    such a line of argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal in <em>The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">23 …Thus, the question of distinctiveness must be determined in the
                        light of all the circumstances of the case. No authority has been cited to
                        substantiate the assertion that the fact of registration is conclusive as to
                        the distinctiveness of a mark. Neither does it follow that the incorporation
                        of an entire registered word mark would automatically lead to infringement.

                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s
                    “GLAMOUR” word mark was visually and aurally <em>dissimilar</em>, but conceptually <em>similar</em>, and that “GLAMOUR” was merely descriptive
                    and neither inherently distinctive nor distinctive by use, I was of the view
                    that there was <em>no</em> similarity between the marks
                    under s 8(2)(<em>b</em>) TMA. Strictly speaking,
                    having arrived at this conclusion, it was not necessary, for the purposes of

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<em>British Sugar</em>] illustrates how the courts

                        desserts was similar to a sweet-flavoured spread. Jacob J concluded
                        that the goods were not similar, explaining that the goods were used
                        differently (the spread could be used on desserts but generally would not
                        be); were not in direct competition; were located in different places in
                        supermarkets (the spread with jams, the dessert sauce with desserts); were
                        physically different (the spread was more viscous than the sauce); and were
                        treated differently by market researches. In contrast in <em>Balmoral Trade Mark</em> [[1999] RPC 297,302], whisky and wine
                        were held to be similar goods: although the two products have very different
                        producers, it is common to find them being bought and sold by the same

<p class="Judg-1">In the course of the hearing before me, Ozone pointed out that its
                    concession of an overlap with AMP’s “magazines, books and
                    publications” was <em>only</em> limited to
                    “printed matter” and did <em>not</em> extend
                    to “paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels
                    of paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper;
                    paper patterns; tailors’ chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper;
                    banners of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags…paintings and calligraphic
                    works; photographs, photographs stands; playing cards; stationery and study
                    materials” (“Ozone’s other goods”), which according
                    to Ozone were “very different” from “magazines, books and
                    publications”. Ozone submitted that Ozone’s other goods could
                    “be broadly classified into stationery, hygiene paper products
                    labels/banners/blinds made of paper and photographs” and that applying
                    the <em>British Sugar</em> test, Ozone’s other goods
                    were different in function from “magazines, books and
                    publications”. Ozone contended that the parties’ respective target
                    consumers were also different as people buying magazines would not be purchasing
                    “stationery, hygiene paper products labels/banners/blinds made of paper
                    and photographs” as alternatives and accordingly the compared goods were
                    not in competition. The trade channels were also different. While AMP’s
                    “magazines, books and publications” were likely to be sold at
                    newsstands and bookstores, Ozone’s other goods would be sold at
                    supermarkets, furniture stores or bookstores and that even if Ozone’s
                    other goods were sold in the same stores, they would be placed at different
                    sections of the store as “magazines are not usually placed together with
                    stationery, hygiene paper products labels/banners/blinds made of paper and

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     I found Ozone’s arguments and the
                    approach in <em>Marlow Foods</em> practical and sensible.
                    In these circumstances, I was of the view that although “printed
                    matter” in Ozone’s goods were <em>similar</em>
                    to AMP’s goods (<em>viz</em>, “magazines,
                    books and publications”), Ozone’s other goods were <em>dissimilar</em>. Accordingly, I was of the view that the PAR
                    had erred in finding that Ozone’s other goods were similar to AMP’s
                    goods (<em>viz</em>, “magazines books and
                    publications”). Accordingly, I was of the view that Condition 2 was
                    thus satisfied <em>only</em> to the extent as described. I
                    now move on to examine Condition 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Condition 3: Likelihood of confusion on the part of the
                public</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     As stated above at <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a>, <em>even</em> where the marks are
                    similar <em>and</em> the goods are similar, this does not
                    mean that there will <em>ipso facto</em> be confusion in
                    the mind of the public. There is <em>no</em> presumption of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The learned authors of <em>Bently &amp; Sherman</em> elaborate at p 872 (footnotes omitted)
                    as to what the public must be confused about:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>2.3.3 Likelihood of confusion</b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">What must the public be confused about? The next question to consider is
                        what is meant by ‘likelihood of confusion’ in [s 8(2)(b) TMA]?
                        In its ‘classic form’, <em>consumers must be
                            confused about the source or origin of the goods or services –
                            that is, they must be confused as to the designer, manufacturer,
                            selector or supplier of the goods or services. In other words, classic
                            confusion is concerned with the situation where consumers believe that
                            the goods or services emanate from one organization, but they, in fact
                            come from a different independent organization</em>. This classic
                        form of confusion has been extended to accommodate broader understandings of
                        the source of goods or services. Consequently, a <em>person
                            will be confused for the purposes of [s 8(2)(b) TMA] if they incorrectly
                            assume that there is some broader kind of economic connection between
                            the users of marks, for example, that the goods are being provided by a
                            subsidiary or licensee of the trade mark owner</em>.

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>In considering whether there is a likelihood of
                            confusion, the tribunals must consider whether there is a genuine and
                            properly substantiated likelihood of confusion: it is not enough that
                            confusion is hypothetical and remote. The term ‘likelihood’

                    outside the mark and the sign, as well as the articles, to assess whether there
                    exists a likelihood of confusion. This proposition was in fact extracted from
                        <em>The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)</em> (which was a trade
                    mark <em>infringement</em> action under
                        s 27(2)(<em>b</em>) TMA), which had, in turn,
                    relied on <em>Kellogg Co v Pacific Food Products Sdn
                        Bhd</em> [1999] 2 SLR 651 and <em>McDonald’s (CA)</em>, both of which were trade mark <em>registration</em> oppositions pursuant to s 15 of the
                    Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed). The Court of Appeal in
                        <em>The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)</em> stated that:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the
                            public.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">8    In our opinion, having examined the express wording
                            of s 27(2)(<em>b</em>), the step-by-step
                            approach adopted in <em>British Sugar</em> is
                            conceptually more appropriate and is in line with the structure of the
                            provision. It seems to us that there will be infringement under that
                            provision only if three conditions are present. First, the alleged
                            offending sign must be shown to be similar to the registered mark.
                            Second, both the sign and the mark must be used in relation to similar
                            goods or services. Third, on account of the presence of the first two
                            conditions, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the
                            public. As the judge rightly pointed out, s 27(2)(<em>b</em>) does not make it an infringement if the
                            likelihood of confusion is caused by some other factor. While we can see
                            some link and overlap between the first and the third conditions, it is
                            clear that they are different. The fact that a sign is similar to a
                            registered mark does not automatically mean that there will be a
                            likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. That is a question of
                            fact to be determined by the court, taking into account all the relevant
                            circumstances. Moreover, the question of similarity is really a matter
                            of degree. In a broad sort of sense, the greater the similarity between
                            a mark and a sign, the greater will be the likelihood of confusion.
                            However, if either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there
                            will not be any need to go into the third question of determining
                            whether there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does it mean
                            that if the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on similar
                            goods, that there will <em>ipso facto</em> be
                            confusion in the minds of the public. If that was intended,
                                s 27(2)(<em>b</em>) would have been
                            phrased differently. As presently worded, there is no presumption of
                            confusion once the two aspects of similarity are present. <em>To determine the existence of confusion, the court is
                                entitled to look outside the mark and the sign, as well as the
                                articles, to assess whether there exists a likelihood of confusion:
                                see Kellogg Co v Pacific Food Products Sdn Bhd [1999]
                                2 SLR 651 and McDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises
                                Pte Ltd [2005] 1 SLR 177. While these two latter cases
                                related to opposition proceedings under s 15 of the then Trade
                                Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed), there is no reason why
                                the concept of “likely to cause confusion” under that
                                provision should be any different from the concept of
                                “likelihood of confusion” under the present
                                s 27(2)(b)</em>. As we see it, the global assessment test
                            is likely to confound the final issue of confusion with the first two
                            prerequisite conditions. Accordingly, we endorse the <em>British Sugar</em> approach which was adopted by
                            Lai J.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Ozone also referred to the decision of
                    Kitchin J in the English High Court decision of <em>Julius
                        Sämaan Ltd v Tetrosyl Ltd</em> [2006] FSR 42 (“<em>Julius Säamaan</em>”), which involved, <em>inter alia</em>, a trade mark infringement action. The
                    relevant portion of the decision, at 872, reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    There is one further general principle which is
                            important to have in mind at the outset in considering infringement. The
                            court must consider the likelihood of confusion arising from the use by
                            the defendant of the offending sign, discounting added matter or
                            circumstances. <em>If the sign and the mark are
                                confusingly similar then the defendant cannot escape by showing that
                                by something outside the actual mark itself he has distinguished his
                                goods from those of the proprietor</em>. In the present case
                            this is important. <em>Looking at the box in which the
                                Christmas Tree product is sold, the use of the words “Lumber
                                Jack Flashing air freshener” must be ignored, as must the
                                particular circumstance in which the product is sold. The comparison
                                to be made is between, on the one hand, the Tree marks and, on the
                                other, the Christmas Tree product itself, and the picture of it
                                which appears on the box</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     As may be seen, the approach advocated in
                        <em>Julius Säamaan</em> to determining the likelihood
                    of confusion, which does <em>not</em> look outside the
                    marks, is <em>different</em> from that adopted in <em>The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)</em> which “look[s] outside
                    the mark and the sign, as well as the articles, to assess whether there exists a
                    likelihood of confusion”. This difference was in fact noted at [18]-[20]
                    of <em>The Polo/Lauren Co (HC)</em>, with reasons offered
                    as to why the latter approach (<em>ie</em>, that adopted in
                        <em>The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)</em>) should be
                    favoured:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">18    However, while the
                            global assessment test should be rejected, I am equally uncomfortable
                            with a strict adherence to old English jurisprudence. In particular,
                            both parties appeared to agree that <em>the test for the
                                likelihood of confusion under this approach is an exceedingly narrow
                                one. Once a mark is shown to offend, the user “cannot escape
                                by showing that by something outside the actual mark itself he has
                                distinguished his goods from those of the registered
                                proprietor”</em>: [<em>Saville Perfumery
                                Ld v June Perfect Ld and F W Woolworth &amp; Co Ld</em> (1941)

                            If this is a correct interpretation of the case, I would decline to
                            follow this lead for the following
                            reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">19    Firstly, it is
                            worthwhile to note that even the English cases appear to differ on
                            whether this is the correct approach. In <em>June
                                Perfect</em> itself, Sir Wilfrid Greene MR, at
                            161–162, went on to remark that the degree of similarity required
                            for a likelihood of confusion to be caused depended on, for example, the
                            goods in question. Where the customers of the goods in question were not
                            the sort who would be too careful about the details of the mark and
                            would only remember some distinguishing feature, it would require very
                            little for the likelihood of confusion to be caused. If, on the other
                            hand, this is not the case, then it would require “nothing short
                            of a degree of resemblance apparent to the eye” for there to
                            exist a likelihood of confusion. Thus, the court is allowed to look
                            outside the marks in order to assess how similar the marks must be for
                            there to exist a likelihood of confusion. <em>Origins
                                Natural Resources Inc v Origin Clothing Limited</em> [1995]
                            FSR 280 (“<em>Origins</em>”) is of no
                            use because the remark there that external added matter or circumstances
                            should be discounted was made in relation to the defendant’s claim
                            that since it and the plaintiff were trading in different markets and in
                            different countries, the likelihood of confusion could never arise.
                            Jacob J, in that case, rightly held that the courts must assume
                            that the mark would be used in a normal and fair manner. Plaintiffs do
                            not need to show that there is actual confusion: <em>Compass Publishing BV v Compass Logistics Ltd</em>
                            [2004] RPC 41; <em>In the matter of an
                                Application by Edward Hack for the Registration of a Trade Mark
                                (</em>1941) 58 RPC 91. It is also important to note
                            that in both these cases, there was no discussion of an earlier case,
                                <em>In the matter of an Application by the Pianotist
                                Company Ld for the Registration of a Trade Mark</em> (1906)
                            23 RPC 774 (“the <em>Pianotist</em>
                            case”), which was affirmed in <em>Sime Darby
                                Edible Products Ltd v Ngo Chew Hong Edible Oil Pte Ltd</em>
                            [2000] 4 SLR 360 (“<em>Sime
                                Darby</em>”). In the <em>Pianotist</em> case, Parker J, at 777, having reviewed
                            the decisions that came before, summarised the position of the law as
                            such:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">You must take the two words. You must judge of them, both by their
                            look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are
                            to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who
                            would be likely to buy those goods. … If, <em>considering all those circumstances</em>, you come to the
                            conclusion that there will be a confusion … then you must refuse
                            the registration in that case. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In <em>Wagamama</em> (<a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> <em>supra</em>), the court also did not consider the
                            <em>Pianotist</em> case. Nonetheless, Laddie J
                        was equivocal about whether the court was to find a likelihood of confusion
                        notwithstanding that the alleged infringer had taken steps to differentiate
                        his products from the plaintiff’s. For instance, he remarked, at
                        720–721, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">If … the marks were too similar, <em>usually</em> infringement would be found even if in the
                            market place the infringer took steps to prevent confusion in fact
                            occurring ... To this extent therefore, <em>a registered
                                trade mark created a monopoly which might sometimes go beyond what
                                was strictly necessary to protect the proprietor’s goods and
                                his reputation</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am in agreement with this observation. <em>The protection
                            that the law offers to a registered proprietor of a trade mark is wide
                            but it is not infinite. The ambit of that protection should be guided by
                            the underlying aim of a trade marks regime, which is to ensure that
                            consumers do not confuse the trade source of one product with another.
                            For instance, where the consideration of other matters can assist the
                            court in drawing the line at cases where the likelihood of confusion is
                            merely imaginary, there is no reason not to do so. Otherwise, the law
                            will end up extending protection where none is needed</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">20    Secondly, the
                            Singapore cases deciding on the question of the likelihood of confusion,
                            although mostly involving an opposition to the registration of a sign,
                            have been much clearer and more consistent in allowing the consideration
                            of these extraneous factors. In <em>Sime
                            Darby</em>, Lim Teong Qwee JC quoted and applied
                            Parker J’s summation of the law on the issue of confusion
                            which I quoted at [19] above. In <em>Kellogg Co v Pacific
                                Food Products Sdn Bhd</em> [1999] 2 SLR 651
                                (“<em>Kellogg</em>”), the Court
                            of Appeal considered an opposition to the registration of a mark under
                            s 15 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed). It
                            was held, at [30] and [33],that the likelihood of confusion was to be
                            determined on the basis of several factors, including the actual use of
                            the mark, the reputation of the earlier mark and the packaging of the
                            goods. More recently, in [<em>McDonald’s
                                (CA)</em>] ([14] <em>supra</em>), the
                            Court of Appeal held, at [66], that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">[T]he question whether a proposed mark will likely give rise to
                            confusion on account of some similarity with an existing mark is a
                            question of fact depending on all the circumstances of the case. Besides
                            comparing the marks, also germane are the extent of the reputation of
                            the existing mark, how the proposed mark is to be used, the nature of
                            the goods to which the mark will be put, how the goods are to be sold
                            and who the target customers are: see <em>In the Matter
                                of an Application by the Pianotist Company Ltd</em> (1906)
                            23 RPC 774 at 777. Obviously, these considerations are not
                            exhaustive.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am not convinced by the plaintiff’s submission that these cases
                        should be distinguished simply because they dealt with unregistered marks.
                        Under the relevant statute being considered by the courts in those cases was
                        a requirement of the mark being “likely to deceive or cause
                        confusion”. Surely it cannot be argued that this is any different
                        than the requirement of a “likelihood of confusion” under
                            s 27(2)(<em>b</em>) of the current TMA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">21    Finally, <em>turning to the plain
                                words of s 27(2)(b) of the TMA, I find that a proper
                                construction of the provision does not reject the court’s
                                discretion in assessing so-called extraneous factors when deciding
                                whether there is a likelihood of confusion. The only thing that the
                                statute calls for is that the likelihood of confusion arises from
                                the similarity. But where the user of a potentially infringing sign
                                has taken pains to distinguish his products from the registered
                                proprietor’s good</em> [<em>sic</em>] <em>and services, the effect may be
                                that the likelihood of confusion, if any, is merely hypothetical or
                                speculative</em>. This is significant because unlike
                            s 27(1) TMA, s 27(2)(<em>b</em>) does not
                            presume that there is a likelihood of confusion. If there is no
                            likelihood of confusion, there can be no infringement: <em>Pan-West (Pte) Ltd v Grand Bigwin Pte Ltd</em> [2003]
                            4 SLR 755 at [12]. Section 27(2)(<em>b</em>) TMA <em>also does not forbid the court
                                taking into account various factors in deciding the degree of
                                similarity required in order to find that there exists a likelihood
                                of confusion</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">22    Having reviewed the cases, and confining myself
                            strictly to what is required to decide the present case, I am of the
                            opinion that <em>there are two ways in which factors
                                extraneous to the mark come into play. One is to establish the
                                strength of the similarity required in order to decide the question
                                of whether there exists a likelihood of confusion</em>.
                            …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The court cannot know what degree of similarity causes
                            confusion unless it is able to assess, for instance, the trading
                            circumstances of the goods in question and therefore the standard of
                            care that the ordinary consumer will exercise in that particular case.
                            The other is this. Where the court finds that there is a likelihood of
                            confusion by reason of the similarity, the court must go on and enquire
                            whether this likelihood is a real one or whether it is merely
                            speculative or hypothetical. Where the infringer has taken sufficient
                            steps to distinguish his goods from the plaintiff’s such that the
                            likelihood of confusion becomes a mere possibility, there is no
                            infringement</em>. Of course, there is no need for plaintiffs to
                        demonstrate that there is actual confusion. However, the courts are not to
                        hold that there is a likelihood of confusion on the basis of “highly
                        speculative eventuality”: <em>McDonald’s</em>, at [59]…</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    It is of interest to

                            the same party as the appellant in the present case. The relevant
                            English statutory provision read:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">A trade mark shall not be registered if because —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(b)    it is similar to an earlier trade mark and
                                    is to be registered for goods or services identical with or
                                    similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is

<p class="Judg-Quote-2">there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public,
                            which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade
                            mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It would be noted that the material part of the wording of this English
                        provision (except for the last phrase “which includes the likelihood
                        of association with the earlier trade mark”) is identical to our
                        s 8(2) of the Act. It is also similar to our s 27(2)(<em>b</em>) (except again for the last phrase). <em>Of course, this English provision (as our s 8(2)) relates
                            to refusing the registration of a mark, rather than the infringement of
                            an existing mark. However, we do not think this distinction should mean
                            that the meaning to be given to s 27(2)(b) should be any different
                            from that ascribed to s 8(2) or the equivalent English provision
                            considered in Royal Berkshire</em>. In addition, we also do not
                        think that the inclusion of the ending phrase in the English provision in
                        any way enlarges its meaning. Confusion as to trade origin is already
                        encompassed in the earlier part of the provision: see Christopher Morcom,
                        Ashley Roughton &amp; James Graham, <em>The Modern Law of
                            Trade Marks</em> (Butterworths, 1999 Ed) at

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Nevertheless, where, as in the present case, there was not much
                    evidence as to how Ozone intends to apply its mark or to distinguish its goods
                    from AMP’s in Singapore, the consideration of factors other than the marks
                    themselves would be limited, although the consideration of other factors was in
                    principle permissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In the course of the hearing before me, AMP
                    produced a copy of a magazine, which was a “25th anniversary book”
                    bearing the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark, which had been purchased
                    from a bookstore in Singapore in September 2009. However, in my view, this
                    itself did not constitute much evidence about Ozone’s intentions in
                    Singapore with its mark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     As stated above at <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>, the PAR had identified the relevant segment of the public

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">36. Magazines are primarily obtained by self-selection, which makes the
                        visual appearance of the title (or trade mark) of primary importance. They
                        are usually displayed alongside other magazines, grouped according to
                        subject matter. It is possible that a women’s magazine could be
                        displayed alongside, or in the proximity of one for teenagers and young
                        women, which would afford a side-by-side comparison. I cannot, however say
                        that that would necessarily be the case, particularly in circumstances where
                        the magazine is obtained by subscription. There are circumstances when oral
                        use, such as a consumer making an enquiry regarding the availability of a
                        publication will be of relevance. <em>Although magazines are

                            to glance through its contents prior to making the decision to

                    mark under s 8(2)(<em>b</em>) TMA (see <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> above), and bearing in mind the

                    the view that even for “printed matter”, let alone Ozone’s

<em>Titles of magazines by their nature tend to make
                            varying degrees of reference to their subject matter or target
                            readership, and consequently many have a low level of distinctiveness.
                            The word GLAMOUR is no exception. It is an ordinary and well known word
                            in the English language which readily conveys the idea of clothing,
                            make-up, etc, and given that the opponents say that their magazine sold
                            under the GLAMOUR trade mark is well known for its features relating to
                            fashion and related topics I consider that it falls into the category of
                            a mark with a low degree of distinctiveness</em>. I make this
                        observation only insofar as to say that as it is <em>not the
                            strongest of marks this is likely to impact on customer perception of
                            the mark and the issue of confusion</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I should add that this observation was made even though the opponents
                    in that case, AMP, had claimed, as in this case (see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a> above), that the “GLAMOUR” mark had been
                    registered in several other countries. Furthermore, it bears mention also that,
                    as stated at paras 10 and 11 of the statutory declaration declared in Japan on
                    5 December 2006 by Mr Noriyuki Yamagani (see <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above), that AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark in

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     As stated above at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>, AMP contended that the PAR had erred in holding that the
                    law of passing off would not prevent Ozone’s use of the “HYSTERIC

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     It is trite that for AMP to succeed in an
                    action for passing off, it had to prove the following classical trinity of

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_a"></a>(a)     a goodwill or reputation attached to
                        the goods and services it supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by
                        association with the identifying “get-up”, such that the
                        “get-up” is recognised by the public as distinctive
                        specifically of AMP’s goods or services;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_b"></a>(b)     a misrepresentation by Ozone to the public
                        (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_94-p2_c"></a>(c)     that it is likely to suffer damage by
                        reason of the erroneous belief engendered by Ozone’s misrepresentation
                        that the source of its goods is the same as the source of those offered by

                        these three elements were correctly identified by the PAR (see <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above), I needed only to examine whether
                        the PAR had erred in <em>applying</em> these three
                        elements to the facts of the present case.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     In the submissions before me, goodwill and
                    reputation were referred to interchangeably. For present purposes, I will refer
                    to goodwill only. The two essential features of goodwill, which is a question of
                    fact, were summarised recently in <em>City Chain</em> as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">62 In [<em>Amanresorts</em>] at [39], this court held
                        that <em>the two essential features of goodwill are that
                            “it is the association of a good, service or business on which
                            the plaintiff’s mark, name, labelling, etc … has been
                            applied with a particular source” and “this association is
                            an ‘attractive force which brings in custom’”.
                            Proving goodwill or distinctiveness is a question of fact. Relevant
                            factors include advertising, trading, volume of sales, and whether it
                            has been registered</em>. But the fact that the mark or indicia is
                        not novel does not mean that it cannot be distinctive of the
                        plaintiff’s goods or services (see <em>Halsbury Laws of
                            Singapore</em> vol 13(3) (LexisNexis Singapore) at
                        para 160.8172007). [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     It bears mention that where a case involves
                    indicia which are <em>descriptive</em> of the goods or
                    services in question (as in this case: see <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a> above), the law imposes a <em>higher</em> burden on the plaintiff (<em>ie</em>, AMP) when proving the existence of his goodwill. The leading
                    decision in this aspect is that of the Court of Appeal in <em>Lifestyle 1.99 Pte Ltd v S$1.99 Pte Ltd (trading as ONE.99 SHOP)</em>
                    [2000] 2 SLR 766 (“<em>Lifestyle
                    1.99</em>”). The facts of and principles stated in that case have
                    been helpfully summarised in <em>Law of Intellectual Property in
                        Singapore</em> at p 209 as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>[17.1.15]</b>… The plaintiff was the
                        owner of a chain of retail shops which operate under the mark <em>ONE.99 SHOP</em>. These outlets sold goods ranging from
                        snack and other foodstuff to cosmetics, fashion accessories, stationery and
                        common household items. The important characteristic of the
                        plaintiff’s business was that all these goods were priced at S$1.99.
                        The plaintiff was the first in Singapore to start a ‘one-price
                        store’ business. About 1-½ years later, the defendant opened its
                        retail outlets under the mark <em>Lifestyle 1.99</em>,
                        selling various goods sold at prices with 99 cents (S$1.99, S$3.99, to
                        S$9.99). On the question whether the plaintiff had acquired goodwill in the
                        mark <em>ONE.99 SHOP</em>, the Court of Appeal laid
                        down the legal principles as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    The law treats quite differently the mark of a
                            business depending on whether the mark is descriptive or
                            ‘fancy’.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    A mark which is <em>prima
                                facie</em> descriptive will only be protected if it can be
                            shown to have acquired a ‘secondary meaning’, that is, it
                            has becomes distinctive of the plaintiff’s business.
                            ‘Distinctive’ is a term of art in the law of passing off. In
                            relation to a mark, this means that the mark denotes the goods of the
                            plaintiffs to the exclusion of other traders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    The fact that a mark is descriptive does not mean
                            that it cannot become distinctive, although it would be difficult to
                            prove. A very great burden is placed on the plaintiff to prove that the
                            mark has acquired a secondary meaning.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In a similar vein, in <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson</em>, where the registered mark was
                    “Carefree” and the mark sought to be registered was
                    “Careree”, the court noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    
              <em>In regard to goodwill, it must
                                [be] borne in mind that “Carefree” is a descriptive
                                word and while it is possible for a descriptive word to become
                                associated with goodwill, the courts are slow to allow anyone to
                                claim a monopoly of descriptive words</em>: see <em>Nippon Paint (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v ICI Paint (Singapore)
                                Pte Ltd</em> [2001] 1 SLR 1 and <em>Super Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte
                                Ltd</em> [2000] 3 SLR 145. All the same, in
                            appropriate cases, the courts have held that descriptive words have
                            taken on a “secondary meaning” or become
                            “distinctive in fact”. An example is
                            “Mothercare”, which is synonymous with the company that
                            sells clothes for pregnant women and young children. … [emphasis

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     In the present case, bearing in mind the
                        <em>greater</em> burden of proof on AMP (in light of my
                    earlier finding that the “GLAMOUR” word mark is purely
                    descriptive: see <a href="#p1_69">[69]</a> above), I was of the
                    view that the PAR had <em>erred</em> in concluding that
                    there was goodwill (see <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a> above). Given
                    the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence tendered by AMP to show volume of
                    sales (<em>viz</em>, the nine invoices: see <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a> above) as elaborated above at <a href="#p1_71">[71]</a> and the lack of evidence of <em>any</em> promotions or advertisements undertaken by AMP in
                    Singapore, it cannot be said that the “GLAMOUR” word mark has
                    acquired a “secondary meaning”. As the PAR observed:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">88    [AMP claims] that the use in Singapore started from
                            1984, but there does not seem to be good evidence that the magazines
                            started selling in Singapore from that time, only a table and random
                            invoices that do not date beyond the year 2000. [Ozone states] that the
                            circulation numbers for Singapore are not impressive, 903 copies at its
                            highest only. The Opponents have submitted that this is high relative to
                            the numbers of other publications that are sold, as evidenced by the
                            invoices from their distributors. <em>However, the number
                                903 copies sounds to me like a number that is disproportionately low
                                for the population of Singapore that is around 3 million at that

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     The paucity of evidence in the present case
                    must be contrasted with the ample evidence in <em>Lifestyle

                    pp 210-211:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[<b>17.1.18</b>]    In [<em>Lifestyle 1.99</em>], the plaintiff succeeded in
                            discharging this higher burden of proof. The court was impressed with
                            the plaintiff’s sales turnover (S$10.4m in the first two years of
                            operation was substantial in the light of the very low price of each
                            item), the extensive advertisements and media coverage on the
                            plaintiff’s business, and the fact that some 48% of the people
                            surveyed were aware or had heard of the <em>One.99
                                Shop</em> and at least 40% knew where the outlets were
                            located. The court found that all this evidence pointed to some goodwill
                            in the plaintiff’s business. …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    In these circumstances, I was of the view
                    that AMP had failed to establish the element of goodwill (see [94(a)] above). In
                    the light of this conclusion, there was no need for me to set out my views on
                    the second element of misrepresentation (see [94(b)] above) but I shall do so

                                trying to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the
                                goods</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    The PAR had made his ultimate finding that
                    there was no misrepresentation on the basis that there was no attempt on the
                    part of Ozone to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the goods.
                    This basis of the PAR’s conclusion was incorrect because with regard to
                    the element of misrepresentation, what the courts are concerned with is the
                    effect of Ozone’s conduct on the actual and potential audience of AMP (see
                        <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a> above) and there can be a
                    misrepresentation even if it was made <em>innocently</em>
                    (see <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson</em> at [25]). On the other
                    hand, Ozone’s state of mind would have been a relevant consideration in
                    finding an increased likelihood of confusion if Ozone had been found (there was
                    no evidence of this in this case) to have had an intention to mislead or
                    deceive. As noted in <em>Law of Intellectual Property in
                        Singapore</em> at pp 230-231:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>[18.4.6]</b> Proof of an intention to deceive is
                        not a necessary ingredient in this second element, but if such an intention
                        is established, the burden on the plaintiff to show confusion is lessened.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    AMP contended that the PAR had
                    “committed a further material error of principle by restricting his
                    analysis to whether there was any confusion…to the origin of the goods as
                    evident from his conclusion that `there is no attempt where [Ozone was] trying
                    to mislead or deceive the public as to the <em>origin of the
                        goods</em>’. [emphasis added]. According to AMP, the
                    “PAR’s restriction of the analysis as such defies established law
                    that confusion under the law of passing off is not limited to confusion as to
                    the origin of [Ozone’s] goods”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    I accepted the <em>general</em> principle that the nature of the confusion may relate to
                    the trade source of the goods or services <em>or</em> to
                    the quality of the goods. As stated in <em>Law of Intellectual
                        Property in Singapore</em> at pp 226-228:</p>

                            form of a false representation that the defendant’s goods or
                            services are those of the plaintiff, or that the two parties are
                            connected in some way, for example, the defendant’s business is an
                            extension, branch or other agency of the

<em>Inherent within a misrepresentation as to the source of

                            defendant’s goods thinks that he is getting the quality that he is

                        the objection is that the defendant is making a misrepresentation about the
                            <em>quality of his own goods</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    At <a href="#p1_96">[96]</a>
                    above, I had stated that because the present case involved indicia which was
                    descriptive of the goods in question, a higher burden was imposed on AMP in
                    proving the existence of goodwill. This higher burden of proof is <em>also</em> extended to the element of misrepresentation, as
                    noted in <em>Law of Intellectual Property in Singapore</em>
                    at pp 230-231:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<b>[18.4.7]</b>
<em>When the plaintiff’s mark or get-up has descriptive
                            connotations or functional value, the principle that the plaintiff bears
                            a higher burden of proof to show goodwill is extended to the second
                            element: the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show confusion is also
                            heavier. The courts will readily regard a slight difference between the
                            plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s mark as being
                            sufficient to distinguish them</em>. [<em>Lifestyle
                            1.99</em>] is a classic illustration of this principle. …
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    In my view, it was clear however that
                    contrary to AMP’s contention (see <a href="#p1_106">[106]</a> above), the PAR had <em>not</em>
                    restricted his analysis to only whether there was any confusion to the origin of
                    the goods but had also considered and rejected AMP’s argument that there
                    had been a misrepresentation as to quality, albeit in the context of the third
                    element of “damage” (see [103]-[105] of the GD cited at <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above). Bearing in mind the higher burden of
                    proof on the shoulders of AMP and the PAR’s finding in this aspect, I was
                    of the opinion that there had been no misrepresentation as to quality. I now
                    move on to consider whether there had been a misrepresentation as to the trade
                    source of the goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    In this case, while I accepted that the
                    proximity of a defendant’s field of activity to a plaintiff’s is a
                    relevant consideration in deciding whether there is likelihood of confusion (see
                        <em>Law of Intellectual Property in Singapore</em> at
                    p 231, para 18.4.8 and <em>Amanresorts</em> at para
                    84), and that there was <em>some</em> proximity between
                    Ozone’s field of activity (<em>viz</em>, the design
                    and retailing of <em>fashion</em> apparel and <em>fashion</em> accessories for both men and women: see
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) and AMP’s field of
                    activity (<em>viz</em>, the “GLAMOUR” mark
                    primarily being used in conjunction with the “GLAMOUR” magazine
                    which is devoted to the reporting and portraying of, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, contemporary women’s <em>fashion</em> and beauty: see <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>
                    above) in that both relate to “fashion”, given that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_a"></a>(a)     the word marks of Ozone and AMP
                        were visually <em>dissimilar</em> (see <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a> above) and aurally <em>dissimilar</em> (see <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>
                        above);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_b"></a>(b)     “GLAMOUR” is merely descriptive and <em>not</em> inherently distinctive nor distinctive by use (see
                            <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> above);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_c"></a>(c)     a higher burden of proof is imposed
                        on AMP (see <a href="#p1_108">[108]</a> above);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_d"></a>(d)     Ozone’s
                        other goods were <em>different</em> from AMP’s
                        goods (<em>viz</em>, “magazines books and
                        publications”) (see <a href="#p1_80">[80]</a>
                        above),</p>
<p class="Judg-1">I was of the opinion that the element of
                    misrepresentation was also not satisfied <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    Ozone’s other goods.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    With regard to “printed
                    matter”, bearing in mind Ozone’s concession of an overlap between
                    “printed matter” and AMP’s “magazines, books and
                    publications” but taking into account [110(a)]-[110(c)], I was of the
                    view that, on balance, the element of misrepresentation was also not made
                    out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Element 3: Damage</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    With regard to the element relating to the
                    question of damage, this was accepted by Ozone if the first two elements were
                    made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Overall conclusion on AMP’s opposition under s 8(4)
                TMA</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    For all the foregoing reasons, I saw no
                    reason to disturb the PAR’s eventual conclusion that AMP’s ground of
                    opposition under s 8(4) TMA was not made out and must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Given my conclusion that AMP’s
                    opposition pursuant to ss 8(2)(<em>b)</em> and 8(4)
                    TMA must fail , I allowed Ozone’s appeal and reversed the PAR’s
                    decision dated 16 March 2009. In so doing, I ordered that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_a"></a>(a)     Ozone’s Trade Mark
