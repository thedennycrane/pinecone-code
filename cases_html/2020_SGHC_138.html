On 23 November 2017, at 1.46pm, in response to the Apex tender, Shin sent the Firm Bid to Park. It is not disputed that the Firm Bid constituted an <span class="font-italic">offer</span> by Wanxiang. This Firm Bid set out the various terms on which an agreement for the purchase of LCO by Wanxiang from Apex was to be made, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, delivery dates, terms of payment, pricing (with separate prices quoted for the First LCO Cargo and Second LCO Cargo), quantities (with the First LCO Cargo and Second LCO Cargo listed separately), laytime, loadport designation, demurrage (capped at US$17,500 per day) and quality. As an offer, it could either have been accepted or be subject to a counter-offer by Park.

</div> It seems to me that Shin knew that the Apex tender allowed for the separate treatment of the First and Second LCO Cargoes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Returning to the Firm Bid, to support the contention that it was an offer for both the LCO Cargoes, Wanxiang made much of the fact that the conjunctive word “<span class="font-italic">and</span>” was used in cl 3 of the Firm Bid (which set out the bid price for the LCO Cargoes) <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>“…[the Dec 2017 Indexed Price] with 1) 10~12 Dec: plus $12/bbl <span class="font-italic">and </span>2) 20~22 Dec: plus $11.5/bbl” [emphasis added]: see [10] above. Wanxiang submitted that had Shin intended to make an offer for either of the cargoes, he would have used the word “or”. Further, Shin would have used “and/or” to make an offer for either of or both the cargoes.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my view, this is according far too much weight on the sole word “and”. To begin with, the Firm Bid listed the First LCO Cargo and the Second LCO Cargo separately, quoted independent prices and quoted delivery dates for each one. The objective interpretation of Shin’s use of the word “and”, in my view, is that it was used to underscore the fact that cl 3 of the Firm Bid contained two different prices – one for each of the two LCO Cargoes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 If Shin had intended to use the word “and” to state that the Firm Bid was for both the LCO Cargoes, it would have made far more sense for him to have included the word “and” in respect of the LCO Cargoes as identified in cl 2 of the Firm Bid so that it would read as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Qty: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">1) 10-12 Dec: 300KB +/-5% at Operational Tolerance </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">and</span>] </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">2) 20-22 Dec: 300KB +/-5% at Operational Tolerance</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">However, Shin did not do so. Instead, he was content for cl 2 of the Firm Bid to follow the format set out in the Apex tender (which as I have found above permitted separate bids for the two parcels of LCO). In my judgment, therefore, the use of the word “and” in cl 3 of the Firm Bid was at best a neutral factor. The Firm Bid was capable of acceptance with regards to either of or both the LCO Cargoes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 While the Firm Bid was, in my view, capable of acceptance with regards to the Second LCO Cargo only (without the First LCO Cargo), it was not unconditionally accepted by Park. In this connection, I turn to the Deal Done messages <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>exchanged from 3.10pm to 3.17pm on 23 November 2017: see [12] above. From these, it seems to me that Park intended to close a deal with Shin at a price of US$11.90 per barrel for the Second LCO Cargo, for which Apex had placed a bid to S-Oil at a price of US$11.80 per barrel. As an aside, although the cargo was not specified in these messages, in my view, Park could not have been referring to anything other than the Second LCO Cargo. This was because the price quoted by him was higher than Apex’s original bid to S-Oil for the Second LCO Cargo (at US$11.70 per barrel), but lower than that for the First LCO Cargo (at US$12.30 per barrel). It would be absurd for Park to <span class="font-italic">reduce</span> the bid price of the First LCO Cargo as that would reduce, not increase, the competitiveness of its bid. On the other hand, it would make complete sense for Park to be referring to the Second LCO Cargo only, as he would have had to increase his original bid to S-Oil in order to secure it. In any event, it is not Wanxiang’s position that the text messages related to the First LCO Cargo or both the LCO Cargoes. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 More importantly, based on the Deal Done messages, I find that Park intended to <span class="font-italic">modify</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>the price quoted in the Firm Bid in relation to the Second LCO Cargo. By seeking Shin’s approval for the modified price, Park had effectively <span class="font-italic">counter-offer</span><span class="font-italic">ed </span>for<span class="font-italic"> </span>a deal to be done for the Second LCO Cargo on the terms of the Firm Bid, save as to price (which was changed to US$11.90 per barrel). This counter-offer had been accepted unequivocally by Shin, by his unqualified affirmative response (“Yes”) to Park’s “deal done” message quoting the revised price. In this connection, I note that an offer can be accepted in any manner that is a “final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer”: <span class="font-italic">Treitel on The Law of Contract</span> (Edwin Peel, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2015 Ed) at para 2-016. <span class="font-italic">A legally-binding, certain and complete agreement came into being at that point. </span>I shall refer to this as the “Apex-Wanxiang Contract”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 I address Wanxiang’s position that there was no agreement by way of the Deal Done messages. Wanxiang relied on Park’s alleged concession at trial that on 23 November 2017 at 3.17pm, all that had been agreed was the laycan and the price of the Second LCO Cargo and that the other terms in the Firm Bid had not been the subject of any discussion or agreement between the parties up to that point.

It appears to me that he was merely underscoring the fact that no deal could be concluded without agreement on those two terms and emphasising the significance of the parties having agreed on the same. This showed that Park was of the opinion that in order for a deal to be done, no agreement needed to be reached on the other terms. This, in fact, is the correct position in law. Parties may intend to be contractually bound as soon as they reach agreement on a set of terms (which are certain and complete), even though they go on to discuss and negotiate additional terms: <span class="font-italic">R</span><span class="font-italic">1 International </span>at [52].

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 In support of the finding that the Apex-Wanxiang Contract was formed by way of the Deal Done messages, I turn to the subsequent conduct of the parties. I note that at 4.54pm, Shin sent Park a text message requesting that “the deal that is done today” be kept private and confidential, and Park’s assent to the same: see [13] above. Shin’s reference to a “deal” being done clearly indicates the presence of the earlier agreement reached between both Park and Shin (and that the parties intended to be legally bound by it). Furthermore, subsequently, the Deal Recap prepared by Park to record the deal (before any hint of a dispute between the parties arose) materially mirrored the terms in the Firm Bid for the Second LCO Cargo only (save with the <span class="font-italic">modified </span>price as agreed by Shin). I pause to note that the Deal Recap varied the demurrage term downwards from US$17,500 per day as proposed in the Firm Bid to US$15,000 per day as contained in the Apex tender. I shall deal with the significance of this at [42] below.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Given my finding that there was a contract between the parties in respect of the Second LCO Cargo, I do not have to deal with Apex’s alternative cases. However, I should address the question of the legal effect, if any, of the Deal Recap (containing the changed demurrage cap) on the contract between the parties. To begin with, I reiterate that despite repeated reminders, the Deal Recap was not <span class="font-italic">confirmed</span> by Shin or Wanxiang. In <span class="font-italic">G-Fuel Pte Ltd v Gulf Petrochem Pte Ltd </span>[2016] SGHC 62 (“<span class="font-italic">G-Fuel</span>”), the High Court observed at [23]–[24] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 As with the first and second contracts under the sleeving arrangement, there was no written contract for the <span class="font-italic">Joaquim </span>cargo and no discussion between the parties as to whether a deal recap is required for there to be a binding contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 Often enough, an agreement is formed at an earlier stage and a deal recap merely recapitulates the terms of the agreement. In <span class="font-italic">TTMI Sarl v Statoil ASA (“The Sibohelle”) </span>[2011] EWHC 1150 (Comm); [2011] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 220, Beatson J pointed out (at [27]) in the context of shipping contracts that “<span class="font-italic">it is common for charterparties to be concluded by an exchange of emails or faxes, with the terms being recapitulated in a fixture recap, and they can be concluded orally and recapitulated” [emphasis added]</span>. In the present case, the deal recap sent by Gulf to G-Fuel for the first two contracts under the sleeving arrangement recapitulated the essence of what had already been agreed upon between James Lim and Gary Chew, namely that the sellers and buyers were G-Fuel and Gulf respectively, the quantity of MFO required and the unit price. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 There was no evidence before me that the parties had agreed that the issuance of a deal recap would be <span class="font-italic">necessary </span>to form a binding agreement. Certainly, there is no requirement in law for this. The parties’ failure to issue a “deal recap” which accurately reflects all the terms of the binding agreement, and <span class="font-italic">a fortiori</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>the failure of the confirming party <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>Wanxiang to do so, did not stand in the way of the formation of a binding agreement between them: <span class="font-italic">G-Fuel </span>at [37]. Indeed, Ong gave evidence that in the industry, a “recap” is “evidence of an earlier agreement made between the parties in respect of a trade”,

</div> Accordingly, the Deal Recap is nothing more than evidence of the Apex-Wanxiang Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 For these reasons, the fact that the Deal Recap contained a demurrage term different from that in the Firm Bid likely meant that the Deal Recap was an <span class="font-italic">i</span><span class="font-italic">naccurate </span>record of what was agreed between the parties in respect of the demurrage cap.

</div> Such an inaccuracy, however, did not detract from the legal validity of the Apex-Wanxiang Contract. In this connection, <span class="font-italic">Mena Energy DMCC v Hascol Petroleum Ltd (2017) </span>[2017] EWHC 262 (Comm) (“<span class="font-italic">Mena Energy</span>”) is instructive. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In that case, one of the disputed transactions concerned a contract for the sale of gasoil which the plaintiff, Mena, contended was concluded orally and confirmed in an email described as a “deal recap” on the same day. The defendant, Hascol, contended that no contract was ever concluded because the parties had failed to agree on the date by which a confirmed letter of credit financing the trade was to be opened. Males J (as he then was) observed, at [169], that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">I do not accept that it was necessary for the oral agreement reached on the telephone to be confirmed in writing. As in all the parties’ previous dealings, an oral agreement was binding. <span class="font-italic">The deal recap was a record of that agreement. It was of course important that it should be accurate and, if it had not been, it would have needed to be corrected. </span>But Mr Soomro’s recap was an accurate record in the case of the gasoil contract, just as it had been in every previous case …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The fact that the Deal Recap was not a fully accurate record of the agreement meant that it should have been corrected with regards demurrage. However, it did not mean that it was of no corroborative value to show that there was a deal struck between Park and Shin for the Second LCO Cargo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I should add that in my analysis, Shin’s further conduct (after receipt of the Deal Recap) is also corroborative of the fact that parties had arrived at a binding agreement. In <span class="font-italic">Mena Energy</span>, Males J observed, at [166], that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">If the issue [of the date by which a confirmed letter of credit was to be opened] had indeed been raised in the telephone conversation and the conversation had ended with no agreement being reached, it is inconceivable that Mr Soomro would have sent his deal recap, either in the terms which he did or at all. He and Mr Lavaro would have known that it had not been agreed that a letter of credit would “be issued at least 5 working days before first day of loading laycan” and that, as a result, no contract had been concluded. <span class="font-italic">To have stated that a contract had been concluded on these terms would have been both dishonest and pointless – dishonest because Mena would have known that it was not true and pointless because it would invite immediate contradiction</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 Thus, where a “deal recap” is sent to a contracting counterparty when no deal had in fact been concluded, some form of protest would be expected as to that fact, particularly in a situation (such as the present) where the parties remained in constant communication after the Deal Recap was sent. The fact that no protest was received from Shin would, in my view, be persuasive evidence in favour of the existence of such a deal.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In the present case, it was not disputed that the Deal Recap referred to the Second LCO Cargo only. Despite Shin having sight of this Deal Recap, it is telling that there is <span class="font-italic">no documentary evidence </span>of him ever having protested to Park that a deal could not have been struck on the Second LCO Cargo only. In this regard, Shin’s evidence was that he was “surprised and perplexed” by the Deal Recap because it only recorded a deal reached on the Second LCO Cargo.

</div> In my judgment, his evidence is unbelievable given his deafening silence on these points by way of text messages or emails. In particular, the lack of any text message to express any concern about the Deal Recap was significant, when juxtaposed against the stream of text messages exchanged between them at the material time. In my view, Shin fully understood that he <span class="font-italic">had </span>reached a deal with Park on the Second LCO Cargo only.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Of course, Shin explained that there were purported telephone calls between Park and himself around 2.45pm and between 8pm to 9pm on 23 November 2017. In these conversations, he had allegedly made it clear to Park that Wanxiang would only accept a deal on both the LCO Cargoes.

</div> It was undisputed that on 28 November 2017, Shin, referencing a “long discussion” that he had with Park, sent Park an email asking for his “stance” on the following matters:

Plainly, both Shin and Park were still trying to resolve the dispute by attempting to re-negotiate the terms. Park responded to Shin’s email on 29 November 2017 at 10.35am by purporting to accept the two conditions, with certain slight modifications to the second condition.

</div> Thereafter, however, Shin ceased to reply to Park’s email or his text messages. As mentioned above, shortly after, Xu sent Park an email formally denying that Wanxiang and Apex had entered into a contract for the Second LCO Cargo (see [17] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 The question, then, is whether Shin’s email, and Park’s purported acceptance of the same, varied the contract. For a variation to an existing contract to be effective, it must possess the characteristics of a valid contract: <span class="font-italic">Fiscal Consultants Pte Ltd v Asia Commercial Finance Ltd </span>[1981-1982] SLR(R) 149 at [14]. Thus, not only must there be an offer to vary the contract and unconditional acceptance of the same, the variation of the contract must be supported by fresh consideration: <span class="font-italic">S Pacific Resources Ltd v Tomolugen Holdings Ltd </span>[2016] 3 SLR 1049 from [13] to [17]; <span class="font-italic">Ma Hongj</span><span class="font-italic">in v SCP Holdings Pte Ltd and another </span>[2019] SGHC 277 at [99].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 The issue in play here is whether Shin had indeed offered to vary the Apex-Wanxiang Contract or had just requested for information regarding the potential variations to that contract which Apex would be willing to accept.

</div> In my view, the language used by Shin in his 28 November 2017 email was not capable of constituting an offer to vary the contract on the two conditions stated therein. He had simply written to Park to request Apex’s stance on those two conditions. This is simply a request for information which was exploratory in nature, not an offer to be bound by those two conditions. As such, I find that the Apex-Wanxiang Contract was not varied by these subsequent communications.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2: Whether Wanxiang breached the contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Having found that the Apex-Wanxiang Contract comprised of the terms of the Firm Bid save as to price, I agree with Apex’s contention that Wanxiang had breached the contract on 29 November 2017 by expressly denying that such a contract even existed.

It was undisputed that there was an available market for LCO and that there existed potential buyers for the Second LCO Cargo. The fact that Apex could make the Alternative Sale makes this clear. The mere fact that Apex and Wanxiang encountered difficulties in finding a firm buyer for the Second LCO Cargo on certain terms as to price, delivery, <span class="font-italic">etc</span> did not mean that there was no available market (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>demand) for the Second LCO Cargo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Thus, where, as here, there is an available market for the subject-matter of the contract, s 50(3) of the SOGA applies. The principal issue concerning the assessment of damages under s 50(3) of the SOGA is the market price of the goods. In this connection, Apex relied on <span class="font-italic">Bunge SA v Nidera BV (formerly Nidera Handelscompagnie BV) </span>[2015] Bus LR 987, [2015] UKSC 43 at [17], where Lord Sumption JSC (writing for the majority of the UK Supreme Court) said (with reference to s 51(3) of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979, which is <span class="font-italic">in pari materia </span>with s 50(3) of the SOGA):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]here there is an available market for the goods, the market price is determined as at the contractual date of delivery, <span class="font-italic">unless the buyer should have mitigated by going into the market and entering into a substitute contract at some earlier stage</span>: <span class="font-italic">Garnac Grain Co Inc v HMF Faure &amp; Fairclough Ltd </span>[1968] AC 1130, 1168 and <span class="font-italic">Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Kamsing Knitting Factory </span>[1979] AC 91, 102. Normally, however, the injured party will be required to mitigate his loss by going into the market for a substitute contract as soon as is reasonable after the original contract was terminated. <span class="font-italic">Damages will then be assessed by reference to the price which he obtained.

If that question is answered in the affirmative, the loss would be computed by reference to the difference between the amount which would have been recovered under the Apex-Wanxiang Contract and what was in fact recovered under the Alternative Sale. In effect, this question can be folded into the inquiry over the reasonableness of entering into the Alternative Sale. Indeed, Ong’s view was that “the industry norm” is to claim the “price difference between the disputed contract between Apex and Wanxiang and the [Alternative Sale]”.

</div> A further question, however, is whether entering into the Hedging Arrangement was reasonable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The Alternative Sale has been set out above. I now set out in detail the factual background for the Hedging Arrangement. Apex pleads that it had purchased the Second LCO Cargo from S-Oil at a price per barrel equal to the Dec 2017 Indexed Price plus a premium of US$11.80. Under the Apex-Wanxiang Contract, the sale of the Second LCO Cargo was on the basis of the Dec 2017 Indexed Price, plus a premium of US$11.90 per barrel. However, under the Alternative Sale, the Second LCO Cargo was sold based on the Jan 2018 Indexed Price plus a premium of US$9 per barrel. As I observed at [22] above, this meant that as a result of the Alternative Sale, Apex was exposed to potential adverse price movements in the MOPS GO 500p index from December 2017 to January 2018. To limit the impact of these price movements, Apex entered into the Hedging Arrangement with ICE.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 According to Apex, the Hedging Arrangement worked as follows.

</div> ICE contracted to purchase from Apex 70,000, 100,000 and 100,000 barrels of Singapore Gasoil at US$73.20, US$73.00 and US$73.20 per barrel respectively. In return, Apex would purchase the same back from ICE at the Jan 2018 Indexed Price. The cumulative effect of these six contracts is that Apex would incur a fixed loss of US$0.40 per barrel for 270,000 barrels of Singapore Gasoil (<span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic">, </span>a total of US$108,000) but would not be exposed to any price movements in the MOPS GO 500p index. On the other side, ICE would be obligated to purchase 270,000 barrels of Singapore Gasoil at the Dec 2017 Indexed Price and sell the same quantities of Singapore Gasoil at the Jan 2018 Indexed Price. ICE, and not Apex, therefore bore the risk and reward of the price movements in the MOPS GO 500p index. Ultimately, this meant that Apex had effectively paid US$108,000 to cap its potential loss, but also prevented itself from benefitting from any potential rise in the MOPS GO 500p index from December 2017 to January 2018. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 While not conceding its liability for the cost of the Hedging Arrangement, Wanxiang contended that there was a factual error in the above, and that there should be a reduction in the cost of hedging. Based on the relevant documents, Apex’s sale back to ICE was not based on the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-italic">Dec 2017 Indexed Price</span>. It was based on <span class="font-italic">the average of the daily published </span><span class="font-italic">gasoil prices from 6 to 31 December 2017 (</span>the<span class="font-italic"> “Balance Dec 2017 Price”).</span> The <span class="font-italic">Balance Dec 2017 Price</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>of US$75.632 per barrel<span class="font-italic"> </span>happened to be higher than the <span class="font-italic">Dec 2017 Indexed Price </span>of US$75.311 per barrel. This is because the market was on an upward trend. Thus, this “leg” of the Hedging Arrangement yielded a sum of US$20,420,640 for Apex, which is <span class="font-italic">more </span>than the sum of US$20,333,970 which Apex had to pay to S-Oil (which was based on the <span class="font-italic">Dec 2017 Indexed Price</span>)<span class="font-italic">. </span>Wanxiang should be given the benefit of the difference of US$86,670. Thus, the cost of hedging of US$108,000 should be reduced by the sum of US$86,670 to arrive at US$21,330.

</div> With that, I turn to the parties’ arguments on the reasonableness of Apex’s mitigating measures.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The reasonableness of mitigating steps taken by Apex</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The reasonableness of entering into the Alternative Sale and the Hedging Arrangement is disputed by Wanxiang on the following main grounds as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) That the Alternative Sale was unreasonable, as the price premium of US$9 per barrel was unreasonably low, and the mitigating sale should have been based on the Dec 2017 Indexed Price;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) In any event, Apex had unreasonably rejected the opportunity to pursue an alternative sale of the Second LCO Cargo to LinkOil on superior terms than what it eventually obtained with Youngor; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Hedging Arrangement was wholly unnecessary and unreasonable as an exercise in reducing the damages claimable from Wanxiang for its breach of contract because Apex could simply claim the unhedged loss from Wanxiang. Furthermore, Apex had not informed Wanxiang that it was hedging the loss. The Hedging Arrangement was therefore a deliberate speculation on the Gasoil market on Apex’s part.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The applicable law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Before considering the merits of Wanxiang’s contentions, I turn to the applicable law. In <span class="font-italic">The “Asia Star”</span> [2010] 2 SLR 1154 (“<span class="font-italic">The Asia Star</span>”), the three basic rules relating to mitigation are set out by the Court of Appeal as follows (at [24]): </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, the aggrieved party must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent on the defaulting party’s breach, and cannot recover damages for any loss which it could have avoided but failed to avoid due to its own unreasonable action or inaction (see Harvey McGregor, <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages</span> (Thomson Reuters (Legal) Limited, 18th Ed, 2009) at para 7-004 and <span class="font-italic">British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, Limited v Underground Electric Railways Company of London, Limited</span> [1912] AC 673 (“<span class="font-italic">British Westinghouse Electric</span>”) at 689). Second, the aggrieved party who goes beyond what the law requires of it and avoids incurring any loss at all will not be entitled to recover any damages (see <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages</span> at para 7-097 and <span class="font-italic">British Westinghouse Electric</span> at 689–690). In such a case, the aggrieved party’s efforts will in effect confer a gratuitous benefit on the defaulting party. <span class="font-italic">Third, the aggrieved </span><span class="font-italic">party may recover any expenses incurred in the course of taking reasonable steps to mitigate its loss</span> (see <span class="font-italic">McGregor on Damages</span> at para 7-091). <span class="font-italic">In short, the aggrieved party cannot recover avoidable or avoided loss; it may, however, recover expenses reasonably incurred in the course of taking mitigation measures. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added] </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 The third rule of mitigation as set out above <span class="font-italic">ie, </span>that a claimant can recover <span class="font-italic">expenses</span> reasonably incurred in the course of taking mitigation measures, is pertinent. Indeed, the recovery of expenses incurred in the course of mitigation is not controversial: see for example <span class="font-italic">Rapiscan Asia Pte Ltd v Global Container Freight Pte Ltd </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 701. From the above, it is plain that once the course of mitigation taken by Apex is found to have been reasonable, it is entitled to recover its <span class="font-italic">loss</span>, as well as its <span class="font-italic">expenses </span>incurred in the course of mitigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The reasonableness of mitigation is assessed objectively, taking into account subjective circumstances such as the aggrieved party’s financial position. Ultimately, the reasonableness inquiry reflects commercial and fact-sensitive fairness at the remedial stage of a legal inquiry into the extent of liability on the defaulting party’s part, and bars an aggrieved party from profiting or behaving unreasonably at the expense of the defaulting party. The court has considerable discretion in evaluating the facts of the case in arriving at a commercially just determination: <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>at [31]–[32]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Further, the evaluation of a claimant’s conduct in mitigation ought to start from the date of the defaulting party’s breach, and the burden of proving that the claimant has failed to fulfil its duty to mitigate falls on the defaulting party: <span class="font-italic">The Asia Star </span>at [24].

It is a question of fact, depending on the circumstances of the particular case, whether the plaintiff acted reasonably.

See also <span class="font-italic">Benjamin’s Sale of Goods </span>at p 853 para 17-025.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The inquiry, therefore, is not whether other transactions done at better prices exist, but whether the mitigating sale in question was a reasonable one in the circumstances. In my view, there are many factors influencing the price which may be obtained for goods, not least among which is the balance of the bargaining powers between the parties. It is not unreasonable for potential buyers to drive a hard bargain to extract lower prices from a seller (<span class="font-italic">especially </span>one in Apex’s position, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> a trader of commodities which generally plays an intermediate role) who has unexpected inventory. In the present case the premium of US$9 was not, in my opinion, so low that it would have been unreasonable for Apex to take it. The Alternative Sale to Youngor was made between two commercial parties dealing at arms’ length. Had Apex failed in the present suit, it would have had to bear the consequences of any below-market sale. There was therefore no reason for it to have taken the risk of agreeing to prices well below what it could reasonably get in the circumstances, and no such reason was put forward by Wanxiang. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 I now consider Wanxiang’s argument that the mitigating sale should have been based on the Dec 2017 Indexed Price,

As such, I do not think that Apex had deliberately entered into the Alternative Sale on the Jan 2018 Indexed Price with a view to speculating on the gasoil market. The pricing terms were a direct consequence of the possibility that the cargo might be delivered in January 2018. In any event, I do not think that closing the deal based on the Jan 2018 Indexed Price could be considered unreasonable (especially in light of the further efforts to address this issue by entering into the Hedging Arrangement).

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 Dealing with each of these points in turn, I do not find Wanxiang’s first contention relevant to the issue of mitigation. The reasonableness of mitigation does not depend on whether the defaulting party was aware, at or after the time of contract formation, that such steps would be taken. Taking Wanxiang’s arguments to their natural conclusion would lead to an untenable result. The mere fact that the parties did not contemplate any form of mitigation at all could not oust the common law duty to mitigate loss owed by the innocent party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 As for Wanxiang’s second contention, it is in my view wholly misconceived for Wanxiang to argue that Apex had sought to speculate in the market. The <span class="font-italic">only </span>benefit under the Hedging Arrangement that Apex could have derived was the <span class="font-italic">guaranteeing of a </span><span class="font-italic">fixed loss </span>of US$0.40 per barrel of gasoil hedged in exchange for avoiding the possibility of sustaining an even larger loss. There was no element of profit in Apex’s side of the Hedging Arrangement. This being the case, there is no conceivable way in which Apex’s actions can be characterised as “speculation” on the gasoil market. If anything, under the Hedging Arrangement, it was ICE, and not Apex, which took on the risk and reward of fluctuations in gasoil prices, and who, consequently, could have been said to be “speculating”. Apex did nothing more than to act out of an abundance of caution – the very opposite of speculating.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Wanxiang’s third contention is, in my view, flawed. There is no doubt that the Hedging Arrangement would have operated to limit the potential loss from adverse movements in the MOPS GO 500p index. In my judgment, it would have been reasonable for Apex to limit the possibility of such adverse movements. Historical data showing a rising trend in the MOPS GO 500p index did not automatically lead to the conclusion that the index would have inexorably risen from December 2017 to January 2018, such as to make Apex’s actions unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Lastly, Wanxiang’s fourth contention was untenable. The entire point of mitigation is so that the party in breach need not be made liable for the full extent of the loss occasioned by its breach of contract if that loss may be reasonably reduced by the innocent party. The mere fact that Wanxiang was able and willing to pay the full loss suffered by Apex did <span class="font-italic">not </span>in any way render Apex’s attempts at mitigation unreasonable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 For all of the above reasons, I am of the opinion that Wanxiang has failed to show that Apex’s efforts at mitigation, <span class="font-italic">viz </span>the Alternative Sale and the Hedging Arrangement, were unreasonable. I turn now to consider the quantum of damages claimed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Damages to be awarded </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Having found that the Alternative Sale and the Hedging Arrangement were reasonable mitigating steps taken by Apex, I return to the damages claimed. As enumerated at [56] above, Apex’s claim for US$1,211,778.60 comprises the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The sum of US$783,245.05. This is the difference in the price premium between the Apex-Wanxiang Contract and that under the Alternative Sale. This represents Apex’s expectation loss. Wanxiang did not challenge the computation, and I find that the amount is claimable in damages. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The sum of US$297,500. This is the freight cost incurred by Apex in performing the Alternative Sale. This is an expense incurred in Apex’s efforts to mitigate its loss which is recoverable in damages. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The sum of US$102,586.35, which represents the costs incurred by Apex of procuring extensions of the credit period in respect of the Letter of Credit which it had obtained to finance the S-Oil purchase. Such extensions would not have been necessary under the Apex-Wanxiang Contract. In my opinion, these costs were reasonably incurred by Apex in entering into the Alternative Sale, and are therefore claimable.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The sum of US$21,330. As set out at [63]—[64] above, this sum was incurred by Apex as the <span class="font-italic">net</span> cost of entering into the Hedging Arrangement to remove Apex’s exposure to the volatility in the MOPS GO 500p index. It was an expense incurred by Apex in its reasonable efforts to mitigate its loss and is recoverable.    </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) The commissions paid in respect of the Hedging Arrangement, comprising US$5,092.20 paid to BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Ltd and US$2,025 paid to Ginga Global Markets Pte Ltd. In my view, these were expenses incurred in respect of Apex’s mitigation of its loss by way of the Hedging Arrangement, and are therefore claimable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 For the above reasons, I grant judgment for Apex and order Wanxiang to pay damages in the sum of US$1,211,778.60 with interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum from the date of writ. Parties are to provide costs submissions within two weeks of the judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Hoo Sheau Peng<br/>Judge</div><div class="txt-body text-right">Sarbjit Singh Chopra, Lee Wen Rong Gabriel and Luis Inaki Duhart Gonzalez (Selvam LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="txt-body text-right">Eng Zixuan Edmund, Brinden Anandakumar, James Tan and Danica Gan (Fullerton Law Chambers LLC) for the defendant. </div><div class="txt-body text-center"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
