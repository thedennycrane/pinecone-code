<p class="Judg-Author">
        Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This is yet another case in a series of cases
                    arising from the Indonesian sand ban of 2007 (“the Sand Ban”). Not
                    surprisingly, the crux of the present appeal turns on the interpretation of a
                        <em>force majeure</em> clause. More generally, however,
                    it is important to note at the outset that, save where the relevant contractual
                    terms concerned in the case at hand are identical to the corresponding terms in
                    a previous decision, previous decisions would be of limited assistance. This is
                    however, subject to the situation where general points of legal principle are
                    involved. It follows that the court must pay particular regard to the specific
                    terms and the relevant context in question in arriving at its
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       This is an appeal by the Appellant against the
                    decision of the trial judge (“the Judge”) in <em>Precise Development Pte Ltd v Holcim (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 1083 (“the Judgment”). The present appeal centres,
                    in the main, on a specific term in the contract between the parties as well as
                    on a few crucial pieces of correspondence between the parties (all of which will
                    be set out in more detail at the appropriate junctures in the present
                    judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Briefly stated, the Appellant and the Respondent
                    had entered into a contract (“the Contract”) for the supply of
                    ready-mixed concrete (“RMC”) from the former to the latter. The
                    Contract was entered into before the Sand Ban came into effect on or about
                    6 February 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The Sand Ban created a shortage of sand and
                    aggregates (which constituted materials required for the manufacture of RMC).
                    The Appellant’s position was that, as a consequence of the Sand Ban, it
                    could no longer supply RMC at pre-Sand Ban prices. Citing the Sand Ban, the
                    Appellant informed the Respondent that it could supply RMC only if the
                    Respondent was willing to pay a price higher than the contract price. The
                    Respondent’s case was that the Appellant had breached the Contract by
                    evincing an intention not to supply concrete at the prices stipulated in the
                    contract. The Respondent sued the Appellant for breach of contract and asked for
                    damages in the sum of $5,074,411.43. The Appellant raised three defences, one of
                    which was based on the <em>force majeure</em> clause found
                    in the Contract (the two remaining defences will be dealt with below). The
                        <em>force majeure</em> clause was contained in
                    cl 3 of the Contract (“cl 3”), and provided as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Purchaser must provide sufficient advance notice in confirming each
                        order. The Supplier shall be under no obligation to supply the concrete if
                        the said supply has been <em>disrupted</em> by virtue
                        of inclement weather, strikes, labour disputes, machinery breakdowns, riots,
                        and <em>shortage of material</em>[, acts] of God or any
                        other factors <em>arising through circumstances beyond the
                            control of the Supplier</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Judge rejected all three defences and held
                    that the Appellant, in refusing to supply RMC to the Respondent at the contract
                    price, was in breach of the Contract. Interlocutory judgment was awarded in
                    favour of the Respondent, with damages for the Respondent to be assessed by the
                    Registrar.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The Appellant has not pursued the defence
                    relating to an alleged discharge of the Contract by mutual agreement in the
                    present appeal (see also below at <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>). We
                    find the Judge’s reasoning as well as decision in relation to the issue of
                    termination pursuant to cl 10 of the Contract (“cl 10”)
                    to be persuasive and correct (see also below at <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a>–<a href="#p1_34">[34]</a>). <em>In the circumstances, the only issue before this court centres on
                        whether or not cl 3 (the force majeure clause) applies in order to
                        afford the Appellant a defence against the Respondent’s
                        claim</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It should, however, also be noted that the
                    Appellant also sought, in the present appeal, to amend its defence to include an
                    alternative defence that the Contract had been frustrated. If the application is
                    allowed, this would constitute a second issue before this court. However, we are
                    not persuaded that the Appellant ought to be permitted to amend its defence, not
                    least because (as the Respondent argues) new evidence would be required (our
                    detailed reasons on this issue are set out below at <a href="#p1_102">[102]</a>–<a href="#p1_105">[105]</a>). We turn
                    then to the substantive issue in this appeal (centring on the interpretation of
                    cl 3). However, before proceeding to do so, we set out the relevant factual
                    (including documentary) matrix.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Factual background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Turning to the relevant factual background
                    (which is crucial to the interpretation as well as application of cl 3),
                    the Appellant entered into the Contract with the Respondent on 10 November
                    2006 for the supply of RMC for a warehouse project.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Respondent is the main
                    contractor for the project. The Appellant is in the business of manufacturing
                    and supplying RMC to construction companies, and it uses concreting sand and
                    aggregates as source materials to manufacture RMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Contract consists of a quotation dated
                    10 November 2006 and a page of Terms and Conditions. The Contract required
                    the Appellant to supply 90,000 cubic metres (+/- 15%) of concrete to
                    the Respondent for the project. Amongst the grades of concrete included in the
                    Contract was Grade 30, for which the Appellant quoted a price of
                    $65 per cubic metre. In the quotation dated 10 November 2006,
                    paragraph 3 states as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All prices fixed till 31<sup>st</sup> Dec
                        2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The salient clauses in the Terms and
                    Conditions of the Contract included cl 3 (set out above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>), and cl 10 and cl 15 which read as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 10</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The supplier reserves the right to terminate the contract giving one
                        month’s written notice to the Purchaser stating the reasons for the
                        termination.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Clause 15</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">For concrete order that exceed 100[cu m], two day[s] advance booking
                        is required. <em>All bookings are to be accepted by the
                            Supplier</em>. In no event shall the Supplier be liable for any
                        liquidated damages arising from any cause whatsoever loss of profits
                        consequential or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Announcement of the Sand Ban</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Indonesian government suddenly announced
                    on or about 23 January 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> that it would impose a Sand
                    Ban from 6 February 2007. This had an immediate impact on the availability
                    and prices of sand. The Appellant wrote to the Respondent on 26 January
                    2007 to inform it of the Sand Ban, and that this would lead to a shortage of
                    materials to manufacture RMC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Appellant stated that it was
                    meeting the Building &amp; Construction Authority (“the BCA”) to
                    discuss alternative options for the supply of sand. The Appellant stated that it
                    might have to cease the supply of concrete and advised the Respondent to seek
                    alternative avenues of supply.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Subsequently, in a Circular dated
                    1 February 2007,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> the BCA announced that it would
                    release sand from its stockpiles, priced at $25 per tonne. <em>However, only main contractors such as the Respondent</em>
                    would have access to the BCA’s sand stockpiles, and under which system the
                    BCA would supply sand directly to the main contractors (such as the Respondent)
                    for “onward delivery” to RMC suppliers (such as the Appellant).
                        <em>It is therefore common ground that the Appellant had no
                        access to the BCA’s stockpiles</em>. The same Circular stated
                    that the amount of concrete, grade of concrete, and <em>concreting sand</em> required for the February weekly demand would
                    have to be certified by the Professional Engineer of the project. It is
                    pertinent to note that there is <em>no mention of manufactured
                        sand in this Circular</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s Letter and Quotation of 1 February
                2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     The Appellant informed the Respondent by way
                    of a letter dated 1 February 2007 that: <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">the sudden announcement by Indonesia of the ban on sand, soil and topsoil
                        exports to Singapore resulted in an immediate scarcity of materials and
                        escalating prices that were totally beyond [the Appellant’s]
                        control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The letter also mentioned a meeting with the Minister of National
                    Development on 30 January 2007, where the Minister had apparently stated
                    that the Sand Ban was an abnormal situation that was beyond anyone’s
                    control. The Appellant stated that it had been notified by the BCA that sand
                    would be released from the BCA’s stockpile from 1 February 2007 and
                    that there should be <em>concreting sand</em> available,
                    albeit at higher prices.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The Appellant
                    informed the Respondent in this letter that it was unable to supply RMC at the
                    prices agreed upon in the Contract (“the contracted prices”) due
                    to the shortage of sand caused by the Sand Ban. In addition, the letter of
                    1 February 2007 stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In light of all the factors mentioned above that is beyond our control, we
                        have no alternative but to revise our concrete prices. Please find attached
                        our quotation for the supply of concrete effective 1 February 2007 for
                        your consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     The quotation referred to in this letter and
                    attached (“the 1 February Quotation”)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> quoted prices of RMC which were
                    30% to 50% higher than the contracted prices. The Respondent, however, did not
                    agree to the prices stated in the 1 February Quotation, and hence did not
                    sign the quotation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Events leading up to the implementation of the Sand Ban</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     On 5 February 2007, a day before the Sand Ban
                    came into effect, one of the Appellant’s sand suppliers, Huat Shua Company
                    Pte Ltd (“Huat Shua”), informed the Appellant that it was unable
                    to supply sand to the Appellant, and that the supply agreement between Huat Shua
                    and the Appellant had been terminated under its <em>force
                        majeure</em> clause with immediate effect.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It is noteworthy that the
                    Appellant’s other sand supplier, Bibright Shipping Pte Ltd
                    (“Bibright”), had informed the Appellant on 2 February 2007
                    that Bibright’s sand stockpile had been taken over by the BCA, and that
                    Bibright could only release their concreting sand supply based on the
                    BCA’s approval. Bibright also ceased its obligation to supply sand to the
                    Appellant based on the <em>force majeure</em> clause in
                    their supply agreement.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     By a letter dated 5 February 2007 from
                    the Respondent to the Appellant, the Respondent stated that there would be

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">However, as BCA would be releasing the government sand stock pile from

<p class="Judg-1">The Respondent insisted in this letter that the Appellant was

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s letter dated 9 February 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     By a letter dated 9 February 2007, the
                    Appellant informed the Respondent that it had no access to BCA’s sand

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… the Indonesian Government’s decision to ban sand exports to
                        Singapore was totally beyond our control resulting in an immediate scarcity
                        of materials and escalating prices. Our production was severely curtailed by
                        the immediate shortage of materials following the announcement [of the Sand

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In our effort to extend support to a good customer, we offered to try and

                        prices and we sent to your company a revised quotation … on
                        1 February 2007 [the 1 February Quotation (above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>)] for consideration but to date have not

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Even with the announcement by BCA on the release of national stockpiles

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     In that same letter, the Appellant explained
                    that the increase in the prices of concrete as stated in the 1 February
                    Quotation (see above at <a href="#p1_14">[14]</a>) was to allow
                    the Appellant to source for alternative supplies of sand at higher prices. It is
                    common ground that the Respondent did not reply to this letter. The Appellant
                    contended that this failure to reply demonstrates clearly that the Respondent
                    was not willing to help the Appellant procure sand from the BCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The BCA’s Circular dated 15 February 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     On 15 February 2007, the BCA announced
                    that the price of sand from the stockpile would be increased to $60 per
                    tonne from 1 March 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>
                    There was a <em>fixed limit</em> on the amount of sand that
                    could be released from the BCA’s stockpile because, as the BCA’s
                    Circular stated, there was a <em>weekly quota</em> for the
                    BCA’s sand stockists. The Circular stated that the sand would be released
                    on a “first come first serve” basis, and that once the weekly
                    quota of sand had been reached, the BCA would <em>stop</em>
                    releasing sand <em>immediately</em>. The Circular stated
                    that only main contractors of projects with concreting works to be carried out
                    in the month of February 2007 were allowed to request for sand to be released
                    from the stockpile from February. Again, there was no mention of manufactured
                    sand in this Circular.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     On 26 February 2007, the Appellant wrote
                    a letter to inform the Respondent that the supply of aggregates (another
                    material required to manufacture RMC) had stopped. Subsequently, the BCA
                    announced on 28 February 2007 that RMC companies (including the Appellant)
                    could purchase aggregates from the BCA’s stockpile at a fixed price of
                    $70 per tonne.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>

                    of RMC. The same letter informed the Respondent that the Appellant was willing
                    to credit back to the Respondent the cost incurred for procuring sand and
                    aggregates from the BCA, in the following terms:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_16" id="Ftn_16_1"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p>

                    Appellant. The Appellant would buy the sand from Buildmate <em>at

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In addition, Mr Peh Chong Eng, the
                    Respondent’s project manager, gave evidence that the Respondent had

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     There was no evidence adduced on the
                    commercial motivations for the Respondent to obtain RMC through Buildmate. It
                    was undisputed that there were common directors between the Respondent and
                    Buildmate. It was also revealed at the trial that Buildmate did not pay the

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The meeting of 19 March 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The Appellant and Respondent had a meeting on
                    19 March 2007. The Respondent’s position is that there was no
                    agreement arrived at between the parties at this meeting. The Appellant’s
                    original position was that the parties had agreed to discharge the Contract and
                    had entered into a new arrangement in which the Respondent would supply sand and
                    aggregates to the Appellant free of charge, and in which the Appellant would
                    supply RMC to the Respondent at a reduced price.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_28" id="Ftn_28_1"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Appellant contended that
                    the quotation dated 2 April 2007 (see below at <a href="#p1_28">[28]</a>) was sent to the Respondent pursuant to what had been
                    agreed to between the parties at the meeting of 19 March 2007. However, the
                    Appellant has since <em>shifted</em> from this position by
                    stating that “the meeting (of 19 March 2007) failed to resolve the
                    differences of the parties”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_29" id="Ftn_29_1"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Hence, it is now common ground
                    between the Appellant and the Respondent that there had been <em>no new agreement</em> arrived at between the parties during the
                    meeting of 19 March 2007. <em>In the circumstances, this

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     On 20 March 2007, the Respondent replied

                    was bound by the price agreed in the Contract. Nevertheless, the Respondent
                    accepted, <em>under protest</em>, the prices of concrete in
                    the 1 March Quotation in the following terms:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_31" id="Ftn_31_1"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p>

                    cl 2 of the Standard Terms &amp; Conditions of this particular

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The Respondent did not reply to the
                    2 April Quotation. Instead, the Respondent wrote to the Appellant a letter

                    which stated that Mr Oh Beng Hwa (one of the Respondent’s directors)
                    had proposed in the meeting of 19 March 2007 that the Respondent would
                    supply the sand and aggregates based on “the same old rate as that
                    agreed” for the Appellant to supply RMC at the contracted prices. The
                    same letter stated that, unless the Appellant agreed to this particular proposal
                    by 27 April 2007, the Respondent would hold the Appellant liable for all
                    damage suffered.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The Appellant replied on the same day (by a
                    letter dated 26 April 2007), and clarified that the meeting on
                    19 March 2007 was to discuss the possibility of the supply of <em>manufactured sand</em> (as opposed to concreting sand) and
                        aggregates.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_35" id="Ftn_35_1"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The Appellant did
                    not agree with the Respondent’s proposal and reiterated that the Sand Ban
                    was an abnormal situation covered by the terms of the Contract (pursuant to
                    cl 3, quoted above at <a href="#p1_4">[4]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The decision of the court below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The Appellant relied on three defences to the

                    been discharged by mutual agreement at the meeting of 19 March 2007.
                    Second, the Appellant claimed that cl 10 permitted it to terminate the
                    Contract upon giving one month’s written notice and that it had given such
                    notice by its letter to the Respondent dated 1 February 2007. Third, the
                    Appellant claimed that its obligation to supply concrete at the prices
                    stipulated in the Contract was discharged under cl 3 when the Sand Ban
                    disrupted its supply of raw materials.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     As also noted above (at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> and <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>),
                    there is no need to deal with the first defence. It is now common ground between
                    both parties that there had been no new agreement made at the meeting of
                    19 March 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     In so far as the second defence is concerned,
                    we have already noted, at the outset of this judgment (above at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a>), that we find the Judge’s reasoning as
                    well as decision in relation to the issue of termination pursuant to cl 10
                    to be persuasive and correct. Put simply, we agree with the Judge’s
                    finding that the Appellant’s letter of 1 February 2007 could not
                    amount to a notice of termination within the meaning of cl 10. The Judge
                    was clearly correct to find that the requirement of unequivocal communication
                    from the Appellant of its intention to terminate the Contract was not satisfied,
                    as the letter of 1 February 2007 had only made it known to the Respondent
                    that the Appellant had “no alternative but to revise [the] concrete
                    prices”. This phrase was ambiguous as it could have meant that the
                    Appellant was exercising its right to suspend the supply of RMC under cl 3,
                    and not cl 10. Indeed, the same letter of 1 February 2007 had used
                    language which parallels that in cl 3. Paragraph 1 of the letter dated
                    1 February 2007 (also reproduced in part above at <a href="#p1_13">[13]</a>) states as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_36" id="Ftn_36_1"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As we have notified you … the sudden announcement by Indonesia of
                        the ban on sand…resulted in an immediate <em>scarcity
                            of materials</em> and escalating prices that were totally
                            <em>beyond our control</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And, at paragraph 5 of the same letter, the Appellant stated, in
                    a similar vein, thus:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_37" id="Ftn_37_1"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In light of all the factors mentioned above that is <em>beyond our control</em>, we have <em>no
                            alternative but to revise our concrete prices</em>. [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The language just reproduced in the preceding
                    paragraph suggests strongly that the Appellant was, in fact, referring to
                    cl 3. The use of the phrase “scarcity of materials” parallels
                    the phrase “shortage of material” in cl 3, while the phrase
                    “beyond our control” is found in the language of cl 3 itself.
                    The use of the phrase “revise our concrete prices” suggests an
                    offer to vary contractual terms, not to terminate the contractual relationship.
                    A reasonable interpretation would be that the Appellant was, in fact, relying
                    upon the <em>force majeure</em> clause (<em>viz</em>, cl 3) to cease supplying RMC to the
                Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     This leaves us with the remaining defence
                    based upon cl 3 itself which, because of its vital importance to the
                    outcome of the present appeal, is reproduced again as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Purchaser must provide sufficient advance notice in confirming each
                        order. The Supplier shall be under no obligation to supply the concrete if
                        the said supply has been <em>disrupted</em> by virtue
                        of inclement weather, strikes, labour disputes, machinery breakdowns, riots,
                        and <em>shortage of material</em>[<em>,
                            acts</em>] of God or any other factors <em>arising
                            through circumstances beyond the control of the Supplier</em>.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The Judge was of the view that the Appellant
                    could only rely on cl 3 if the following two conditions had been
                    met:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Appellant’s ability to
                        supply concrete had been disrupted by any of the events mentioned in
                        cl 3; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_36-p2_b"></a>(b)     the event arose through circumstances beyond the Appellant’s
                        control.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Judge had no doubt that the Sand Ban was
                    beyond the Appellant’s control. The question that the Judge focused on was
                    whether there had been a “disruption” within the meaning of
                    cl 3. The Judge interpreted the word “disrupt’ by reference to
                    its ordinary meaning, as well as by considering the need to achieve a
                    commercially viable and reasonable result (see [34] of the Judgment). On this
                    basis, the Judge held (see [42] of the Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[T]here will be a “disruption” within the meaning of
                        clause 3 only when an event occurred that made it difficult for the
                        defendant to supply concrete to the plaintiff <em>but it
                            excluded a rise in the price of the raw materials used by the defendant
                            to produce concrete</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The Judge held that a price rise of raw
                    materials was immaterial to the issue whether the supply of concrete was
                    disrupted by a shortage of material (here sand) by reference to English case law
                    (which will be dealt with at <a href="#p1_51">[51]</a>–<a href="#p1_52">[52]</a>
                    below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The Judge further held on the evidence that it
                    was not difficult for the Appellant to supply concrete to the Respondent as it
                    did not ask the Respondent to assist it by requesting for sand from the BCA
                    stockpiles. In failing to make the request, the Appellant had failed to make
                    reasonable efforts to ensure that the supply of concrete would not be disrupted.
                    In other words, the proximate cause of the disruption in the supply of concrete
                    was not the Sand Ban but the Appellant’s own failure to source the supply
                    of sand from or through the Respondent. Accordingly, there was no disruption
                    beyond the control of the Appellant within the meaning of
                cl 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The Judge found that the Respondent had been
                        <em>willing to assist</em> the Appellant in this regard
                    based on two facts, <em>viz</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_a"></a>(a)     the Respondent knew that, as between
                        the parties, only it had access to BCA’s
                    stockpiles;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_40-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        Respondent had stated in its letter (to the Appellant) dated 5 February
                        2007 (see above at <a href="#p1_16">[16]</a>) that there was
                        no disruption of supply because sand was available from the BCA
                        stockpiles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The Judge found that the fact that the
                    Respondent had reminded the Appellant that sand was available from the BCA
                    stockpile despite knowing that the Respondent had access to the BCA sand, and
                    not the Appellant, demonstrated that the Respondent was willing to help the
                    Appellant procure sand from the BCA. Further, the Judge found that the Appellant
                    had not taken any steps to ask the Respondent to request for sand from the BCA.
                    In the circumstances, the Judge found that the Appellant could not (unlike the
                    Singapore High Court decision in <em>Holcim (Singapore) Pte Ltd v
                        Kwan Yong Construction Pte Ltd</em> [2009] 2 SLR(R) 193
                        (“<em>Kwan Yong</em>”) which related,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, to an identical clause) rely on
                    cl 3, and therefore held that the Appellant was in breach of the Contract
                    when it failed to supply RMC to the Respondent at the contracted
                prices.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Issues raised</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     There is one main – or umbrella
                        - issue in respect of the present appeal, <em>viz</em>, whether or not the Appellant can avail itself of
                    cl 3 in order to defeat the Respondent’s claim against it for breach
                    of contract. The interpretation of cl 3 – as well as its application
                    to the facts of the present case - raise (in turn) two
                    sub-issues, both of which must be satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The first sub-issue is whether any of the
                    events stated in cl 3 had “<em>disrupted</em>” the supply of concrete. The meaning of the word
                    “disrupted” has to be ascertained before the first sub-issue can
                    be fully determined by applying that meaning to the facts of the present
                    proceedings.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The second sub<em>-</em>issue is whether the event (or events concerned) were
                        “<em>beyond the control</em> of” the
                    Appellant. This raises the question of whether the Appellant is required to take
                    all reasonable steps to avoid the operation of cl 3. The Appellant bears
                    the burden of proof with respect to both sub-issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     We will commence by setting out the <em>general legal principles</em> relating to the construction
                    and interpretation of <em>force majeure</em> clauses in
                    relation to each of the two sub-issues set out above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     We will then proceed to apply the general
                    legal principles to both the construction and interpretation of the language of
                    cl 3 itself as well as its application to the specific facts at hand. For
                    ease of analysis and understanding, we will apply the relevant general legal
                    principles to the specific facts in <em>two stages – which
                        correspond to the two sub-issues, respectively</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">A preliminary point – the need to adopt a holistic
                interpretation of both sub-issues</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     This preliminary point arises, in no small
                    part, because the Appellant had sought to argue that the last part of cl 3
                    (centring on the phrase “arising through circumstances beyond the control
                    of the Supplier”) ought to be read <em>separately</em> from the rest of that particular clause so that a
                    disruption of supply because of shortage of material whether within the control
                    of the Appellant or not would bring cl 3 into operation. If the phrase was
                    indeed to be read separately from the rest of cl 3, no issue would arise
                    with regard to whether the Appellant is required to take all reasonable steps to
                    avoid the operation of that particular clause (which, it will be recalled, is in
                    fact the second sub-issue (see above at <a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     With respect, we are unable to accept the
                    Appellant’s argument as it is not only inconsistent with a plain reading
                    of cl 3 itself but is also contrary to the general intent of that clause as
                    well (reference may also be made to the English High Court decision of <em>Frontier International Shipping Corp v Swissmarine Corporation Inc
                        (The “Cape Equinox”)</em> [2005] 1 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 390 as well as <em>Chitty on Contracts</em>
                    vol 1 (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008)
                        (“<em>Chitty on Contracts</em>”) at
                    para 14-138). In this last-mentioned regard, it flies against all notions
                    of commercial intent as well as commonsense to interpret cl 3 in the manner
                    that the Appellant has just argued because it would mean that the parties
                    intended, <em>inter alia</em>, even a
                    “disruption” that was created by the Appellant itself to permit
                    the Appellant to avail itself of the benefit of cl 3. It would take only a
                    moment’s reflection to conclude that this could not, objectively speaking,
                    have been the intention of the parties at the time they entered into the
                    Contract. In the circumstances, therefore, a <em>holistic</em> interpretation ought to be adopted with regard to both
                    sub-issues.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The governing or umbrella principle relating to the construction and
                interpretation of force majeure clauses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Stripped to its essence, the <em>governing</em> legal principle in the context of the
                    construction and interpretation of <em>force majeure
                        clauses</em> is a simple – albeit not simplistic
                        - one that is embodied within the following statement of
                    principle by this court in <em>RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo
                        (S) Pte Ltd</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (“<em>RDC Concrete</em>”) as follows (at [54]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The most important principle with respect to <em>force
                            majeure</em> clauses entails, simultaneously, a rather specific
                        factual inquiry: the <em>precise construction</em> of
                        the clause is paramount as it would define the <em>precise
                            scope and ambit</em> of the clause itself. The court is, in
                        accordance with the principle of freedom of contract, to give full effect to
                        the intention of the parties in so far as such a clause is concerned.
                        [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first sub-issue: whether or not any of the events stated in
                cl 3 itself had “disrupted” the supply of RMC within the meaning
                of that clause</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Interpretation of the word
                “disrupted”</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     In order to invoke cl 3, the Appellant
                    must demonstrate that the supply of concrete has been “<em>disrupted</em>” by the shortage of material. In the
                    circumstances, therefore, the meaning of the word “disrupted” must
                    first be ascertained. Although there is, to the best of our knowledge, no case
                    law in the Commonwealth (apart from the decision in the court below) with
                    respect to the meaning of the word “disrupted”, it is nevertheless
                    useful to have regard to prior decisions which have interpreted <em>similar</em> words used in the context of <em>force majeure</em> clauses (for example, the word
                    “hindered”). These decisions are helpful in so far as they furnish
                    guidance on the <em>general meaning</em> not only of the
                    word itself but also of <em>other</em> words (in this
                    latter respect, from a comparative perspective). The ascertainment of such
                    general meaning itself is <em>not</em>, of course,
                    conclusive simply because the <em>application</em> of that
                    meaning to the <em>overall language</em> of the <em>force majeure</em> clause <em>as well as to
                        the precise factual context</em> is of signal
                importance.</p>

                    due to any matter which in the appellant’s reasonable opinion

                    endorsed the House of Lords decision of <em>Tennants
                        (Lancashire), Limited v C S Wilson and Company, Limited</em>
                    [1917] AC 495 (“<em>Tennants</em>”).
                    Ribeiro PJ cited with approval (at [82]) a passage from <em>Tennants</em> to the effect that “‘[p]reventing’
                    delivery means ... rendering delivery impossible” and
                    “‘hindering’ delivery means something less than this, namely,
                    rendering delivery more or less difficult, but not impossible” (<em>per</em> Lord Atkinson, at 518). Ribeiro PJ further
                    observed that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[a]s a matter of language, it is clear that the word
                        “hinders” sets a substantially lower threshold than the word
                        “prevents” (with the word “obstructs” occupying
                        a position perhaps somewhere in between)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">(See also <em>Goldlion Properties</em> at [94]).
                    Ribeiro PJ did, however, also refer (at [82]) to the observations of
                    Earl Loreburn in <em>Tennants</em> (at 510), observing
                    that the learned law lord “put the bar somewhat higher, interpreting
                    ‘hindering’ to mean “interposing obstacles which it would be
                    really difficult to overcome”; however, the learned judge proceeded to
                    observe (also at [82]) that, nevertheless, “‘hindering’ was
                        <em>on any view not</em> a concept requiring the
                    supplier to show that some contingency had <em>prevented</em> delivery” [emphasis added]. We agree that the
                    word “prevented” connotes a much higher degree in relation to
                    obstacles to performance of the contract compared to the word
                    “hindered”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     We also note that <em>Tennants</em> also laid down the (related) general principle to the
                    effect that even a great or huge increase in price would <em>not</em>, in and of itself, constitute a “hindrance”.
                    It is not, however, altogether irrelevant. As Lord Dunedin observed in
                        <em>Tennants</em> (at 516):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Price may be evidence, but it is only one of many kinds of evidence as to
                        shortage. If the appellants had alleged nothing but advanced price they
                        would have failed. But they have shown much more. They have shown a total
                        failure of what after all was the main source of supply to their business
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1">All these principles were also endorsed and applied in another English
                    decision that has often been cited together with <em>Tennants</em>, <em>viz</em>, the English Court
                    of Appeal decision of <em>Peter Dixon &amp; Sons, Limited v
                        Henderson, Craig &amp; Co, Limited</em> [1919] KBD 778
                        (“<em>Peter Dixon</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     We pause to observe, in this regard, that
                    whilst a mere increase in price is generally insufficient (in and of itself) to
                    constitute a “hindrance” or “prevention”, we leave
                    open the issue as to what the legal position would be if the increase in price
                    is <em>astronomical</em> (<em>cf</em>
                    the reference by Denning LJ in the English Court of Appeal decision of
                        <em>Brauer &amp; Co (Gt Britain), Ltd v James
                        Clark (Brush Materials), Ltd</em> [1952] 2 Lloyd’s
                    Rep 147 at 154 (“<em>Brauer</em>”) to
                    the fact that, if in that case, the price increase was <em>one
                        hundred times</em> as much as the contract price, then “that
                    would be a “fundamentally different situation” which had
                    unexpectedly emerged, and he [the seller] would not be bound to pay [for the
                    licence concerned]”). Indeed, the general legal principle in relation to
                    a mere increase in price in the context of whether or not a
                    “hindrance” or “prevention” has occurred <em>vis-à-vis</em> a <em>force majeure</em>
                    clause mirrors the general principle in relation to the common law doctrine of
                    frustration (under which, generally speaking, a mere increase in price will
                        <em>not</em> constitute a frustrating event (<em>cf</em> also <em>RDC Concrete</em> (at
                        [70]-[74])). Indeed, even in so far as the latter general
                    principle is concerned, at least two judges in the House of Lords decision of
                        <em>Tsakiroglou &amp; Co Ltd v Noblee Thorl
                        GmbH</em> [1962] AC 93, <em>viz</em>,
                    Lord Reid and Lord Hodson, appeared to at least briefly hint that
                    increased costs might constitute a possible ground for frustration where they
                    were so extreme as to be “astronomical” (at 118 and 128–129,
                    respectively) – a proposition that, in fact, appears to find some support
                    in the local context in the decision of this court in <em>Glahe
                        International Expo AG v ACS Computer Pte Ltd</em> [1999]
                    1 SLR(R) 945 (especially at [24]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     As mentioned above, the crucial word in the
                    context of the present proceedings is “disrupt”. From linguistic
                    as well as logical and contextual perspectives, it is clear, in our view, that,
                    like the word “hinder”, the word “disrupt” does
                        <em>not</em> mean “prevent”. In the same
                    vein, an increase in costs alone will not constitute a
                    “disruption”. More specifically, however, what (general) meaning
                    ought to be attributed to the word “disrupt”, bearing in mind the
                    fact that the particular factual matrix and context will also need to be
                    considered by the court before arriving at a final decision in any given
                    case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     
          <em>The Oxford English
                        Dictionary</em> (2nd Ed, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1989)
                        (“<em>OED</em>”) defines the word
                        “<em>disrupt</em>” (at p 832) as
                    follows: “To break or burst asunder; to break in pieces, shatter; to
                    separate forcibly”. The same work defines the word “<em>hinder</em>” (at p 242) in various ways,
                    including the following: “To put or keep back”; “To do harm
                    to; to injure, impair, damage”; and “To keep back, delay, or stop
                    in action; to put obstacles in the way of; to impede, deter, obstruct,
                    prevent”. Although there is, in the last-mentioned phrase, a reference to
                    the word “<em>prevent</em>”, that word itself
                    is defined in the <em>OED</em> quite differently (as is to
                    be expected since the presumption is that no word in the English language ought
                    to be redundant) and, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows (at
                    p 445): “To forestall, balk, or baffle by previous or precautionary
                    measures”; “To cut off beforehand, debar, preclude (a person or
                    other agent) <em>from</em>, deprive <em>of</em> a purpose, expectation, etc.”; and (perhaps, most
                    appropriately, having regard to the legal context as well as case law considered
                    above) “To frustrate, defeat, bring to nought, render void or nugatory
                    (an expectation, plan, etc.)” [emphasis in original].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     The definitions of the words
                    “disrupt” and “hinder” are – at a general
                    level at least – not dissimilar. Both words connote a lower degree of
                    negativity compared to the word “prevent”. And, perhaps more
                    importantly, both words suggest a datum measure of difficulty that interferes
                    with the successful completion of the transaction concerned. However, unlike a
                    situation involving “prevention”, the “disruption”
                    or “hindrance” does not render further performance by one party
                    (or both parties) impossible (which would be akin to a situation of (legal)
                    frustration). It is also clear that difficulty that manifests itself in the form
                    of an increase in costs is – in and of itself – insufficient to
                    result in a finding of “disruption” or “hindrance”.
                    However, the level of guidance at this point is, unfortunately, not very
                    helpful. One can explain this, in part, by the fact that there are myriad
                    situations of “disruption” or “hindrance”.
                    Nevertheless, we are of the view that a further (if minimal) attempt at defining
                    what might constitute a “disruption” or “hindrance”
                    would be helpful. In this regard, where a <em>commercial
                        transaction</em> is involved, the process of ascertaining whether or
                    not a particular set of circumstances constitutes a “disruption”
                    or “hindrance” within the meaning of the <em>force
                        majeure</em> clause concerned ought to be informed by considerations
                    of <em>commercial practicability</em> (bearing in mind, of
                    course, the particular <em>context</em> in which the
                    contract had been entered into (<em>including any relevant
                        commercial practice in the trade and/or resultant dislocation in the
                        trade</em>)). Hence, if, for example, events occurred which, whilst
                    not preventing <em>literal</em> performance of the contract
                    as such, were such as would render continued performance commercially
                    impractical, there would, in our view, generally be a “disruption”
                    or “hindrance” within the meaning of the <em>force
                        majeure</em> clause in question. Still less would those events need to
                    render further performance of the contract <em>impossible</em>, which would be more akin to a situation of
                    “prevention” (as explained above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     The following observations by
                    Earl Loreburn in <em>Tennants</em> (at 510–511)
                    may also be usefully noted:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>To place a merchant in the position of being unable to

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my view this hindered delivery. It did not prevent delivery or make it
                        impossible, but it hindered delivery within the meaning of the contract now
                        under consideration ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     In a similar vein, we would also note the
                    following observations by Swinfen Eady MR in <em>Peter
                        Dixon</em> (at 785):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I] think in substance the question is this: Having regard to the facts as
                        set out in the award, was there evidence upon which the arbitrators as
                        reasonable men could come to the conclusion at which in fact they arrived?
                            <em>Having regard to the general dislocation of trade, to
                            the need for entering into fresh contracts to obtain tonnage, to the
                            fact that all standing contracts by all parties in the trade were no
                            longer able to be carried out, I am of opinion that upon these facts
                            much more than merely an increase in price was proved</em>, and
                            <em>it is no answer to say to the sellers: “It was
                            possible to carry out your contract and you could have got rid of the
                            obstacle or difficulty by obtaining tonnage at an increased price, or by
                            paying Beckers an increased sum for them to supply
                            you</em>.<em>”</em> In my judgment
                        there was ample evidence before the arbitrators on which they could arrive
                        at the conclusion, at which they did in fact arrive, that the sellers were
                        hindered in the delivery of the pulp within the meaning of the contract.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">And the following observations by Bankes LJ in the same case (at
                    786) are also helpful:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I think two rules were certainly laid down in that case [<em>viz</em>, <em>Tennants</em>]. One
                        was that <em>a rise in price would not in itself constitute a
                            hindrance</em> to delivery within the meaning of such a contract
                        as this; <em>and</em> I think the <em>second rule may be gathered from the language of Lord
                            Dunedin</em> [in <em>Tennants</em>; see also
                        above at [52]], where, in speaking of the judgment of Neville J., <em>he says … that the learned judge read the word
                            “hinder” “in the general sense of in any way
                            affecting to an appreciable extent the ease of the usual way of
                            supplying the article…..”</em> [emphasis
                        added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Another illustration may be found in the House
                    of Lords decision of <em>Owners of Steamship Matheos v Louis
                        Dreyfus and Company</em> [1925] AC 654 (“<em>Louis Dreyfus</em>”). Although this particular decision
                    related to a prohibition clause, the same general points of principle would be
                    applicable. In <em>Louis Dreyfus</em>, the plaintiff
                    shipowner brought a claim against the defendant charterer for demurrage. The
                    charterer was unable to load goods onto the vessel owing to a severe frost which
                    had caused the dock to be completely frozen over. The charterer relied upon a
                    clause in the charterparty which effectively suspended the charterer’s
                    obligation to load goods under circumstances where there had been
                    “detention by frost or ice”. The shipowner argued that that clause
                    could not be invoked by the charterer as it was still possible to load the goods
                    onto the vessel by the use of <em>manual labour</em>. The
                    House rejected this argument. In particular, Viscount Cave LC was of the
                    view (at 660) that, given the icebound conditions, “loading by hand
                    during the frost was in the commercial sense impracticable”. Indeed, the
                    expenses of manual loading were prohibitive, the charterers would run the risk
                    of losing the goods and no insurer would have been willing to cover such a
                    dangerous method of loading. More generally, however, this is merely an
                    illustrative situation and much would (as was already alluded to above) depend
                    upon the precise factual matrix. However, the <em>general
                        principle</em> as such seems to us to be not only sound but also just
                    and fair.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Whether the present circumstances, seen in its commercial
                context, present sufficient difficulty to constitute a “disruption”
                within cl 3</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     The circumstances in the present case did
                    present considerable difficulties for the Appellant. First, it is undisputed
                    that, since the Indonesian Government announced the Sand Ban, the BCA had
                    implemented a system that only entitled contractors (such as the Respondent) to
                    have access to the BCA’s sand stockpiles (see also above at <a href="#p1_12">[12]</a>). The Appellant had <em>no</em> access to these stockpiles. Secondly, when the Sand Ban came
                    into effect, the Appellant’s own sand suppliers, Bibright and Huat Shua,
                    stopped supplying sand to the Appellant and relied upon the <em>force majeure</em> clauses found in their respective supply contracts
                    (see above at <a href="#p1_15">[15]</a>). The situation was
                    exacerbated by the fact that Bibright’s sand stockpile at the Tuas
                    Aggregate Terminal had been <em>taken over by the
                        BCA</em>,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> with the result that Bibright
                    Shipping could only release sand with the BCA’s approval and could no
                    longer supply sand to the Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Thirdly, even if the Respondent were to help
                    procure sand from the BCA’s sand stockpiles, there was <em>no guarantee</em> that the Respondent would have received the
                    requisite quantities of sand. This was confirmed by Mr Ng Cher Cheng, the
                    deputy director of procurement policies department at the BCA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_39" id="Ftn_39_1"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Further, there was a <em>fixed limit</em> on the amount of sand that could be released from
                    the BCA’s sand stockpiles. The BCA’s circular dated 16 February
                        2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_40" id="Ftn_40_1"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> stated
                    that there was a <em>weekly quota</em> for the BCA’s
                    sand stockists. The circular stated that the sand would be released on a
                    “first come first serve” basis, and that once the weekly quota of
                    sand had been reached, the BCA would <em>stop</em>
                    releasing sand <em>immediately</em> (see also above at
                        <a href="#p1_19">[19]</a>). In addition, the BCA circular
                    dated 1 February 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_41" id="Ftn_41_1"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>
                    stated that only projects with concreting works to be carried out in the month
                    of February 2007 were allowed to request sand to be released from stockpile from
                    February.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Given the above circumstances, there can be no
                    doubt that there were sufficient difficulties to constitute a
                    “disruption” within the meaning of cl 3. The
                    Appellant’s traditional sources of sand from Indonesia were effectively
                    cut off by the system implemented by the BCA as well as by the reliance by its
                    own suppliers upon the <em>force majeure</em> clauses in
                    their respective contracts with the Appellant (noting that the BCA had in fact
                    taken over one of the supplier’s sand stockpiles). Given that the BCA only
                    granted access of sand supplies to main contractors, these contractors
                    (including the Respondent) would be in a “monopolistic” position.
                    The Respondent could take advantage of its position to charge an exorbitant
                    price for its services in assisting to procure sand from the BCA. Under these
                    circumstances, the Appellant was faced with two stark choices. If it had chosen
                    to stop performing the Contract, it would have been liable for damages to the
                    Respondent (assuming that cl 3 did not apply). If it had chosen to perform
                    the Contract by supplying concrete at the contracted prices, it would have
                    fallen prey to any potential exorbitant demands of main contractors who had
                    access to sand supplies. This left the Appellant in the unsatisfactory situation
                    in which the Respondent could insist that the Appellant adhere to the Contract
                    (thus obtaining RMC at pre-Sand Ban prices) and, at the same time, earn a profit
                    for its services of procuring sand from the BCA. If the Appellant was to adhere
                    to its contractual obligations, it would have had no choice but to seek sand
                    supplies from the Respondent for whatever price the Respondent might have
                    charged for it. Such a commercially impracticable situation constituted, in our
                    view, a “disruption” within the meaning of cl 3. It must be
                    cautioned that this analysis is not focused on the prices of sand but, rather,
                    on the difficulties faced by the Appellant in the present overall commercial
                    context. Further, it did not matter whether the Respondent did in fact seek
                    exorbitant prices for its services in procuring sand (in this regard, and as
                    will be seen below, the Respondent did not even offer to help procure sand from
                    the BCA for the Appellant). It was sufficient that the Appellant was placed in a
                    commercially impracticable situation, as explained above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     The Respondent did contend (in passing and
                    without argument or evidence)<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_42" id="Ftn_42_1"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>
                    that the Appellant <em>could have</em> obtained sand from
                    countries other than Indonesia. Although it can be said that it was <em>possible</em> for the Appellant to procure sand from
                    non-traditional sources, it would have been commercially impracticable to do so,
                    given that cl 15 of the Contract (“cl 15”) (see above at
                        <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>) envisaged orders exceeding 100
                    cubic metres of concrete to be delivered <em>within two
                        days</em> after the order has been placed, and the Appellant would not
                    have been able to do so if it had had to seek supplies of sand from
                    non-traditional sources. This commercial impracticability is reinforced by the
                    fact that cl 15 provided that the Appellant must accept all orders for
                    concrete. Indeed, the present situation may have gone beyond that of commercial
                    impracticability. Given that it would be <em>impossible</em> to deliver concrete to the Respondent within two days
                    even if the Appellant had sought alternative sources of sand from
                    non-traditional sources, a case of frustration would have been made out had it
                    been pleaded and argued in the Court below. We surmise that this was perhaps why
                    the Appellant sought to amend its pleadings to include an alternative defence in
                    frustration (although this has not been allowed for the reasons stated in
                        <a href="#p1_103">[103]</a>–<a href="#p1_105">[105]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     We are therefore, of the view that the clear
                    shortage of sand resulting from the Sand Ban had created genuine difficulties so
                    as to constitute a “disruption” within the scope and meaning of
                    cl 3. However, as already noted above, this is not an end to the matter in
                    so far as the present appeal is concerned. We need now to turn to consider
                        <em>the second sub-issue</em>, <em>viz</em>, whether or not the event (or events concerned) were
                        “<em>beyond the control</em> of” the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second sub-issue: whether or not the event was “beyond the
                control of” the Appellant</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Is there an independent legal principle <b><em>inherent in all</em></b><em>force majeure</em> clauses to the effect that the affected
                party, in order to avail itself of the benefit of the <em>force
                    majeure</em> clause, must have taken all reasonable steps to avoid the
                    <em>force majeure</em> effects of the event in
                question?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     An interesting legal issue that arises in the
                    context of the present proceedings in general and the second sub-issue in
                    particular is whether or not there is, as Ribeiro PJ put it in <em>Goldlion Properties</em> (at [98]), “a free-standing
                    legal principle” to the effect (as counsel for the respondents argued,
                    relying on the English decision of <em>Channel Island Ferries Ltd
                        v Sealink UK Ltd</em> [1988] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 323
                        (“<em>Channel Island Ferries</em>”))
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... there is <b><em>inherent</em></b> in the concept of a
                            <em>force majeure</em> clause the principle that
                        the person who seeks to rely upon it must prove that, even if a qualifying
                        event had occurred which could materially impede or hinder completion,
                            <em>such person had taken all reasonable steps to
                            avoid</em> the force majeure effects of that event. [emphasis
                        added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The learned judge was of the view – in no uncertain terms
                    – that such a legal principle did <em>not</em> exist;
                    as he observed (at [99]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I am unable to accept that argument. I see no juridical basis for positing
                        any free-standing legal principle of the type urged. What conditions must be
                        satisfied for a party to bring himself within a force majeure clause depends
                        simply on its construction and, properly understood, <em>Channel Island Ferries</em> says nothing different.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     We agree with these observations of
                    Ribeiro PJ in <em>Goldlion Properties</em> that there
                    cannot be any blanket principle to the effect that there is a requirement to
                    take all reasonable steps before the <em>force majeure</em>
                    clause can be relied on (which language embodies the intention of the parties
                    themselves). In this regard, we note that the proposition stated in <em>Chitty on Contracts</em> (at para 14-140) supports such
                    a blanket principle:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is for a party relying upon a force majeure clause to provide the facts
                        bringing the case within the clause ... He must further prove ... that there
                        were no reasonable steps that he could have taken to avoid or mitigate the
                        event or its consequences.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In our view, this proposition is too wide. Whether the affected party
                    must have taken all reasonable steps before he can rely on the <em>force majeure</em> clause depends, in the final analysis, on
                    the precise language of the clause concerned. Nevertheless, it might well be the
                    case that, <em>at least where the clause in question relates to
                        events that must be beyond the control of one or more of the parties, then
                        the party or parties concerned ought to take reasonable steps to avoid the
                        event or events stipulated in the clause</em>. In such a situation (as
                    is in fact the case in the present proceedings), there is, in our view, a
                    persuasive case for requiring the affected party to take reasonable steps to
                    avoid the effects of the event in question. The rationale for this approach is a
                    simple and commonsensical one: <em>to the extent that the party
                        or parties concerned do not take reasonable steps to avoid the event or
                        events in question, it cannot be said that the occurrence of the event or
                        events was beyond the control of the party or parties concerned – in
                        which case the clause would not apply</em>. In this regard, it is
                    pertinent to note that in cases where it was held that the affected party was
                    required to take reasonable steps to avoid the effects of the event in question
                    before it could rely on the <em>force majeure</em> clause
                    (see, for example, <em>RDC Concrete</em> at [64]; <em>Channel Island Ferries Ltd v Sealink UK Ltd</em> [1987]
                    1 Lloyd’s Rep 559 at 570; and the English Court of Appeal
                    decision of <em>B &amp; S Contracts and Design Ltd v
                        Victor Green Publications Ltd</em> [1984] ICR 419), the legal issue
                    that arose centred on <em>force majeure</em> clauses which
                    related to events specified therein that were <em>beyond the
                        control of the party concerned</em>. It should also be noted that
                    these cases were also decided with respect to the precise factual matrix
                    concerned in general and on the construction of the precise language of each
                        <em>force majeure</em> clause in particular. We would
                    observe, parenthetically, that there are resonances here with the principle
                    under the doctrine of frustration that there can be <em>no
                        self-induced frustration</em>. Indeed, the proscription against
                    self-induced frustration has a similar rationale inasmuch as it is necessary, in
                    order for the doctrine of frustration to operate, that <em>neither</em> contracting party is at fault.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     However, the focus ought to be on the
                    substance as opposed to the form. Hence, in the English High Court decision of
                        <em>Trade and Transport Incorporated v Iino Kaiun Kaisha Ltd
                        (The Angelia)</em> [1973] 1 WLR 210, for example, the court held,
                        <em>inter alia</em> (and, as it turned out, by way of
                        <em>obiter dicta</em>), that the party concerned ought
                    to have taken steps to ascertain (and therefore discovered) the non-availability
                    of vehicles before the contract was concluded and could not avail itself of the
                        <em>force majeure</em> clause as a consequence. The
                        <em>force majeure</em> clause itself referred,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, to “<em>unavoidable</em> hindrances” as well as to “hindrances
                    happening <em>without the fault of the charterer</em> [the
                    party seeking to rely on the <em>force majeure</em> clause
                    in this particular case]<em>, shippers or suppliers of
                        cargo</em>” [emphasis added] (reference may also be made to the
                    English High Court decision of <em>Bolckow, Vaughan, and Co v
                        Compania Minera de Sierra Manera</em> (1916)
                    114 LT 758).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     In so far as the exception referred to above
                    (at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>) is concerned, one might argue that
                    it is <em>inherent</em> within the meaning of concepts such
                    as “hinder” and “prevent” in the context of
                        <em>force majeure</em> clauses that such concepts would
                    only operate in a situation where the event or events concerned are <em>beyond the control</em> of the party or parties concerned.
                    Alternatively, it might be argued that the requirement to take reasonable steps
                    ought to be established based on the <em>interpretation of the
                        precise language of the clause itself</em> (<em>cf</em>, for example, <em>Brauer</em>). The
                    former is analogous (albeit not identical to) a “term implied in
                        <em>law</em>”, whilst the latter is analogous
                    (albeit, again, not identical to) a “term implied in <em>fact</em>” (and see generally the local decisions of <em>Forefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Private
                        Ltd</em> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 (at
                    [29]-[44]) and <em>Jet Holding Ltd v Cooper
                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> [2006] 3 SLR(R) 769 (at
                        [89]-[91]) with regard to the relationship between these
                    two categories of implied terms). Indeed, the latter argument is consistent with
                    the more general approach adopted by Ribeiro PJ in <em>Goldlion Properties</em> (see above at <a href="#p1_65">[65]</a>). However, we do not need to express a concluded view on
                    the former argument in the present appeal, particularly in the light of the view
                    we have just expressed – in the preceding paragraph -
                    with regard to the <em>narrower</em> situation (where there
                        <em>is</em> an <em>express</em>
                    reference to the event or events concerned being <em>beyond the
                        control</em> of the party or parties concerned). It is interesting,
                    however, to note that Ribeiro PJ, in <em>Goldlion
                        Properties</em>, was of the view (at <a href="#p1_100">[100]</a>) that <em>Channel Island Ferries</em>
                    was distinguishable on the basis that that case related to the “<em>prevention</em>” – and <em>not</em> the “<em>hindrance</em>”
                    - of the contractual performance; in the learned
                    judge’s words (at [102]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One can readily accept that if the wording of a force majeure clause makes
                        it operative only if the qualifying event has prevented performance it is
                        necessarily implicit that the clause does not apply if performance could in
                        fact have been rendered by the taking of reasonable steps. Such a clause
                        justifies a construction which places an obligation on the party relying on
                        it to show that he has taken all reasonable steps to render performance. But
                        no such obligation is implicit in the proposition that a particular matter
                        has materially <em>hindered</em> performance. [emphasis
                        in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     With respect, although the above reasoning is
                    not unpersuasive, we are of the view that such an approach is too narrow and
                    that, even in a situation where there is merely “hindrance” of
                    performance, the party relying on the <em>force
                        majeure</em> clause concerned ought also to be required to show that
                    it has taken all reasonable steps to avoid the event or events concerned
                        <em>if</em> there is the requirement that the event or
                    events must be “<em>beyond the control</em>”
                    of that particular party.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     We pause to observe – parenthetically
                    – that it might well be the case that the majority of <em>force majeure</em> clauses would incorporate (in substance and/or
                    form) the requirement that the event or events concerned must be <em>beyond the control</em> of the party or parties concerned. If
                    so, then the requirement to take reasonable steps might well be the rule rather
                    than (as alluded to above at <a href="#p1_66">[66]</a>) the
                    exception. However, whatever the <em>actual</em> position,
                    the <em>general principle</em> is, in our view, clear. To
                    reiterate, <em>where the clause in question relates to events
                        that must be beyond the control of one or more of the parties, then the
                        party or parties concerned ought to take reasonable steps to avoid the event
                        or events stipulated in the clause. However</em>, absent this
                    particular situation, this requirement to take reasonable steps is <em>not</em> a <em>blanket</em> one as such
                    and whether or not such a requirement obtains in the particular situation at
                    hand would depend on the precise language of the clause itself (which language
                    embodies the intention of the parties themselves).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Where the affected party seeking to rely upon
                    the <em>force majeure</em> clause must take <em>reasonable steps</em> to avoid the event or events stipulated
                    in the <em>force majeure</em> clause, whether he has done
                    so will, of course, be <em>a question of fact</em>; it is
                    also <em>not</em> an <em>absolute
                        duty</em> as <em>only reasonable steps</em> need
                    to be taken. We are here in the sphere of the <em>application</em> of the law to the precise factual matrix concerned.
                    Hence, in the Singapore High Court decision of <em>Magenta
                        Resources (S) Pte Ltd v China Resources (S) Pte Ltd</em> [1996]
                    2 SLR(R) 316, for example, it was held that there was no duty to
                    mitigate; as S Rajendran J observed (at
                    [96]-[97]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">96    The present case is clearly one where arrangements
                            by a supplier higher up the string to ship the goods had already been
                            made when the delay by reason of <em>force
                                majeure</em> happened. There was, therefore, no obligation on
                            the part of the plaintiffs to try and obtain the requisite urea through
                            an alternative source.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">97    But even apart from the fact that this was a case
                            where the contract with the suppliers higher up the chain had been
                            entered into at the time of the <em>force
                                majeure</em>, this was not a contract under which the sellers
                            were at liberty to buy goods afloat. The plaintiffs here were not merely
                            obliged to deliver prilled urea of USSR origin but were in addition
                            required to (a) mark the goods with specific shipping marks
                            provided by the defendants; (b) ship the goods only in certain
                            vessels not specifically prohibited by the contract; and (c) ship the
                            goods from a specified port. I agree with the submission of the
                            plaintiffs that, in such a situation, there was no question of buying
                            goods afloat. This is further reinforced by the fact that the contract
                            here was not a CIF contract since, by the contract, the defendants were
                            to provide insurance for the goods from the port of
                        loading.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   Application to the facts of the present appeal</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(A)   The Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The issue is, in essence, a simple one. Given
                    the fact that cl 3 expressly stipulates that the shortage of material
                    (here, sand to manufacture concrete) must have arisen through circumstances
                    beyond the Appellant’s control in order for the clause to operate, the
                    burden is on the Appellant to show that it had taken all reasonable steps to
                    avoid the operation of cl 3. We are of the view that there is sufficient
                    evidence to demonstrate that the Appellant had, on the balance of probabilities,
                    taken reasonable steps to avoid the operation of cl 3. Let us
                    elaborate.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(B)   Reasonable steps taken by the Appellant but rejected by the
                Respondent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     It is common ground that when the Sand Ban
                    came into effect, the BCA implemented a mechanism in which only main contractors
                    (such as the Respondent) would have access to BCA’s sand stockpiles. The
                    Appellant had no access to the BCA’s sand stockpile. The Appellant took
                    the effort to notify the Respondent of this fact, by way of its letter dated
                    9 February 2007 (reproduced above at <a href="#p1_17">[17]</a>),<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_43" id="Ftn_43_1"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> which clearly
                    informed the Respondent that the mechanism implemented by the BCA meant that the
                    Appellant could not have access to the BCA’s stockpiles. However, the
                    Respondent’s lack of willingness to assist the Appellant is demonstrated
                    by the fact that the Appellant’s letter of 9 February 2007 was
                    ignored. It is undisputed that there was no response to this letter. If the
                    Respondent had been willing to help procure sand from the BCA, it would have
                    replied to this letter. This is in stark contrast to the mechanism implemented
                    by the BCA in which it had encouraged contractors to assist in the procurement
                    and supply of sand to RMC companies, by way of its “onward
                    delivery” mechanism as stated in the BCA’s Circular dated
                    1 February 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     In addition, the Appellant had written a
                    letter dated 1 March 2007 (see above at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a>) in which it had offered to credit back to the Respondent
                    the cost of the sand, calculated at $63 per tonne of sand in accordance to
                    the BCA price, if the Respondent was able to provide the Appellant with sand
                    (“the Appellant’s offer”).<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_44" id="Ftn_44_1"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> This was, <em>in
                        substance, as good as a request</em> for the Respondent to help
                    procure sand from the BCA stockpiles. However, the Respondent simply ignored the
                    Appellant’s request.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The Judge, however, was unconvinced that the
                    Respondent’s rejection of the Appellant’s offer meant that the
                    Respondent was unwilling to help supply sand to the Appellant. In particular,
                    the Judge was concerned that the Appellant’s offer to credit back the
                    costs of procuring sand had a catch – the offer included a rise in the
                    price of concrete found in the 1 March Quotation.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_45" id="Ftn_45_1"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> In this regard,
                    the Judge observed as follows (see the Judgment at [50]–[52]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">50    ... the [Appellant] claimed that it had made an
                            offer to the [Respondent] on 1 March 2007 indicating that it would
                            credit back to the [Respondent] the cost of any sand and aggregates that
                            the [Respondent] was able to provide at $63 per ton and
                            $73 per ton respectively. The gist of the [Appellant’s]
                            argument seemed to be that the [Respondent’s] rejection of its
                            offer showed that the [Respondent] was unwilling to help the [Appellant]
                            apply for BCA sand for the manufacture of concrete.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">51    I reject the [Appellant’s] argument. The
                            [Appellant’s] offer of crediting back the cost of any sand and
                            aggregates provided by the [Respondent] was premised on the assumption
                            that the [Respondent] would obtain the supplies from the BCA, since its
                            offer price of $63 and $73 tracked the BCA price ($60 and $70
                            respectively excluding the cost of delivery). Had this been a standalone
                            offer which the [Respondent] rejected, I would have regarded it as
                            strong evidence that the [Respondent] was unwilling to help the
                            [Appellant] apply for sand from the BCA stockpile. <em>However, the [appellant’s] offer had a catch – it
                                included a rise of almost 200% in the price of concrete as compared
                                to the prices stated in the Contract</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">52    
              <em>The [Appellant] had no right to
                                impose higher prices of concrete on the [Respondent]. The common
                                thread that ran through the cases cited earlier is that a rise in
                                the price of raw materials is not sufficient to trigger a force
                                majeure clause like clause 3. If the [Respondent] was willing to
                                assist the [Appellant] by applying for BCA sand (where the
                                [Appellant] pays for the BCA sand)</em>, the [Appellant] was
                            obliged to accept the sand and perform the Contract without imposing
                            further conditions ....</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In our view, and with respect, we find (from
                    the Judge’s observations quoted in the preceding paragraph, in particular,
                    those portions that have been emphasised) that the Judge <em>conflated</em> several questions. There are in fact three separate
                    questions raised in the Judge’s observations:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_a"></a>(a)     Whether the Appellant has the right
                        to impose higher prices for concrete;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_b"></a>(b)     Whether a rise in the price of sand is sufficient to
                        trigger a <em>force majeure</em> clause;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_76-p2_c"></a>(c)     Whether the
                        Respondent had demonstrated its willingness to assist the Appellant to
                        procure sand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As we will elaborate upon in a moment, the
                    only question that ought to have been addressed by the Judge was the one in (c)
                    above.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     In our view, whether the Appellant <em>has the right</em> to impose higher prices for concrete (see
                    [76(a)] above) is irrelevant at this particular stage. This question is only
                        <em>consequential</em> upon the <em>real</em> inquiry, which is whether the Appellant can invoke
                    cl 3 in the first place (see [76(b)] above). If the Appellant can invoke
                    cl 3, the Respondent and Appellant are discharged from performing their
                    contractual obligations under the Contract and are free to form a new contract
                    with new prices. Hence, whether the Appellant has a right to impose higher
                    prices for concrete cannot assist us in determining whether the Appellant can
                    avail itself of the benefit of cl 3, for that is the very question which
                    the present inquiry seeks to answer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     As explained earlier (at <a href="#p1_42">[42]</a>–<a href="#p1_44">[44]</a>), whether the Appellant can avail itself of the benefit of
                    cl 3 is dependent on whether the circumstances constituted a
                    “disruption” within the meaning of cl 3, <em>and</em> whether the shortage of material was beyond the
                    appellant’s control. We have already explained (at <a href="#p1_50">[50]</a>–<a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>) that a mere increase in price is insufficient to trigger
                    cl 3 in so far as it is ordinarily insufficient to constitute a
                    “disruption”. We have, however (at <a href="#p1_53">[53]</a>), left open the issue as to what the legal position would
                    be if the increase in price was <em>astronomical</em>. In
                    addition, we have determined earlier (at <a href="#p1_60">[60]</a>–<a href="#p1_64">[64]</a>) that the
                    present circumstances were sufficiently difficult to constitute a
                    “disruption” within the meaning of cl 3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     In so far as the second sub-issue as to
                    whether the shortage of material was beyond the Appellant’s control is
                    concerned, a vital question would be whether the Appellant had taken reasonable
                    steps to avoid the effects caused by the shortage of material. In this regard,
                    one specific question is whether the Respondent was willing to assist the
                    Appellant to procure sand from the BCA (see [76(c)] above). As is evident from
                    the Judge’s observations above (at <a href="#p1_75">[75]</a>), the Judge was concerned that the Appellant’s offer
                    had included a 1 March Quotation with increased prices of concrete. We
                    would be inclined to agree with the Judge if the Respondent had rejected
                        <em>both</em> the increased prices offered in the
                    1 March Quotation <em>as well as</em> the
                    Appellant’s offer to credit back the cost of obtaining sand. If the
                    Respondent had indeed rejected the 1 March Quotation, it would have been
                    consistent with the Judge’s concern that the Respondent did not agree to
                    the Appellant’s offer because it would have been forced to accept the
                    increased prices in the quotation. <em>However</em>, the
                    Judge did <em>not</em>, with respect, consider the fact
                    that the Respondent had <em>indeed accepted</em> the prices
                    in the 1 March Quotation as evidenced in the Respondent’s letter
                    dated 20 March 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_46" id="Ftn_46_1"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> in which the Respondent agreed
                    to pay the increased prices set out in the 1 March Quotation. Even though
                    the Respondent had accepted the increased prices, it <em>did not
                        respond</em>to the Appellant’s offer in the 1 March 2007
                    letter to <em>credit back</em> the Respondent the costs of
                    procuring sand from the BCA. The 1 March Quotation was <em>attached to</em> the 1 March 2007 letter which contained the
                    Appellant’s offer.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_47" id="Ftn_47_1"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Having accepted the
                    prices offered in the 1 March Quotation, the only reason why there was no
                    response to the Appellant’s offer, read together with the similar
                    “silence” from the Respondent after receiving the
                    Appellant’s letter of 9 February 2007,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_48" id="Ftn_48_1"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> is
                    that the Respondent had been unwilling to help the Appellant procure sand from
                    BCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     It is important to emphasise that the
                    Appellant’s offer to credit the cost of obtaining the sand from BCA at the
                    price of $63 per tonne of sand back to the Respondent, demonstrates the
                    lengths to which the Appellant was prepared to go in order to ensure its
                    continued ability to manufacture RMC. The price of $63 per tonne of sand
                    was <em>$3 more</em> than the price at which the
                    Respondent could obtain sand from the BCA. This means that for every tonne of
                    sand that the Respondent procured for the Appellant, the Respondent would obtain
                    an extra $3.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     Further, since the price of Grade 30 RMC
                    quoted by the Appellant was $185 per cubic metre (see above at <a href="#p1_22">[22]</a>), the effective selling price of RMC was
                    $182 per cubic metre (<em>viz</em>, the quoted price
                    of $185 - $3 reimbursement to the Respondent for procurement
                    of sand). This is <em>below</em> the cost price of the RMC
                    which was $183.85 per cubic metre (the cost price was revealed at a meeting
                    between the Construction Industry Joint Committee and the BCA held on
                    25 April 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_49" id="Ftn_49_1"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>). This again emphasises the
                    efforts that the Appellant was willing to make in order to meet its obligation
                    to manufacture and supply RMC to the Respondent. This also demonstrates that the
                    Appellant was not attempting to profiteer from the shortage of sand caused by
                    the Sand Ban.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     The above analysis is also reinforced by
                    further evidence which will be dealt with in detail below (at <a href="#p1_83">[83]</a>–<a href="#p1_90">[90]</a>).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;"> (C)   The Respondent had been unwilling to supply sand to the
                Appellant </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     There was no documentation evidencing the fact
                    that the Respondent had offered to help supply sand to the Appellant. Whilst the
                    Respondent had obtained sand from the BCA from as early as February 2007, it had
                    chosen, instead, to give the sand to a third party – an entity known as
                    “Group Industries at Sungei Kadut”. The director of the
                    Respondent, Mr Peh Chong Eng, admitted in the court below that
                    “somewhere [<em>sic</em>] in February”, the
                    Respondent had applied for sand from the BCA and <em>had indeed
                        obtained some supply of sand</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_50" id="Ftn_50_1"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Since the Respondent had
                    known that, as between the parties, <em>only it</em> had
                    access to the BCA’s stockpiles, it ought to have informed the Appellant
                    that it had obtained sand from the BCA. Instead of thus informing the Appellant,
                    the Respondent ignored the Appellant’s letter of 9 February 2009, in
                    which (as we have seen) the Appellant made it clear that it could not obtain
                    sand from the BCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     It was further revealed in the court below
                    that Respondent had supplied sand to Buildmate. Mr Peh, Buildmate’s
                    director, revealed that the Respondent would supply sand to Buildmate, and
                    Buildmate would (in turn) supply sand to the Appellant at the same price as that
                    offered by the Appellant to the Respondent (see above at <a href="#p1_23">[23]</a>) at $63 per tonne. The Appellant would
                    use the sand to manufacture RMC and sell it to Buildmate, whereupon Buildmate
                    would (in turn) supply the same RMC to the Respondent. Unfortunately, it was not
                    placed on record as to what the commercial reasons were behind this strange and
                    roundabout way for the Respondent to obtain RMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     There was however, some hint that Buildmate
                    was used as an entity to obtain RMC from the Appellant without payment: it was
                    revealed that Buildmate did not pay the Appellant for the RMC supplied to
                        it<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_51" id="Ftn_51_1"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> (which RMC was, in
                    turn, supplied by Buildmate to the Respondent). Buildmate owed the Appellant
                    approximately $600,000 for RMC supplied<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_52" id="Ftn_52_1"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> and, instead of making payment,
                    Buildmate had offered to supply sand to the Appellant as substitute
                        payment,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_53" id="Ftn_53_1"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> which the Appellant
                    refused to accept. Since only contractors such as the Respondent could have
                    access to sand at that particular point in time, and Buildmate had offered to
                    use sand as substitute payment for the RMC, there is a suggestion that the
                    Respondent had been using Buildmate to obtain RMC without payment. At the same
                    time, the Respondent refused to supply sand to the Appellant and had chosen to
                    supply it to Buildmate instead; the Appellant’s hands were tied inasmuch
                    as it could not manufacture RMC pursuant to the Contract. If so, the Respondent
                    would be having its cake and eating it: by obtaining RMC without payment, and by
                    insisting on claiming against the Appellant for its breach of contract for
                    failure to provide RMC under its contract. Given that this is not a pleaded
                    issue, and in view of the fact that the prior dispute between Buildmate and the
                    Appellant has been settled, we shall, however, refrain from making any
                    determination on this matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     Notwithstanding the above, one thing remains
                    clear from this puzzling arrangement. It reinforces the finding that the
                    Respondent was unwilling to assist in supplying sand to the Appellant. This is
                    because Mr Peh Chong Eng, the Project Manager, revealed that the Respondent
                    had purchased Grade 40 Normal Mix Concrete and Grade 50 Normal Mix
                    Concrete from Buildmate at the unit price of S$190.00 and S$199.00,
                    respectively; these were <em>exactly the same prices</em>
                    for RMC as those offered by the Appellant in the 1 March Quotation. Since
                    the Respondent had accepted the prices offered by the Appellant, there is no
                    explicable reason why it had chosen to supply sand to a third party (Buildmate)
                    and not to the Appellant, except for the fact that the Respondent had been
                        <em>unwilling</em> to supply sand to the Appellant,
                    whatever the underlying commercial motivations might have been.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Apart from supplying sand to “Group
                    Industries at Sungei Kadut” and Buildmate (instead of the Appellant),
                    Mr Peh Chong Eng actually gave evidence that the Respondent did not inform
                    the Appellant that it was willing to help because it believed that the Appellant
                    was already sourcing for alternative supplies of sand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_54" id="Ftn_54_1"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> This demonstrates, in fact,
                    that the Respondent had <em>thought</em>, rightly or
                    wrongly, that there was <em>no need</em> to help the
                    Appellant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     The Respondent also sought to argue that it
                    had, by virtue of its letter to the Appellant dated 26 April
                        2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_55" id="Ftn_55_1"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> (see
                    also above at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>), offered to supply sand
                    to the Appellant. The letter stated that Mr Oh Beng Hwa (the
                    Respondent’s director) had proposed <em>during the meeting
                        of 19 March 2007</em> that the Respondent would “supply
                        <em>the sand</em> and aggregate” to the
                    Appellant at pre-sand ban prices in exchange for the Appellant to supply RMC at
                    contracted prices. The material parts of the Respondent’s letter of
                    26 April 2007 are reproduced below, as follows:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_56" id="Ftn_56_1"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">On <em>19<sup>th</sup> Mar[ch]
                            2007</em>, our Mr Oh [Beng Hwa] met with your Mr Leong
                        and Mr Soh …to discuss the matter of your demand for increase in
                        price of concrete mix …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Our Mr Oh [Beng Hwa] proposed, without prejudice, that to resolve the
                        matter, we supply <em>the sand</em> and aggregate to
                        you based on the same old rate as that agreed by you, for you to supply the
                        concrete mix at the same fixed price as in the aforesaid contract contained
                        in [the] quotation dated 10 November 2006 …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     However, this letter does not advance the
                    Respondent’s case in this particular regard simply because it was
                    conditional on the Appellant supplying concrete to the Respondent at the
                    contracted prices. Indeed, this particular letter was no more than an ultimatum
                    issued by the Respondent to the Appellant, which the latter rejected (see also
                        <a href="#p1_30">[30]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     Even more crucially, the Respondent’s
                    purported offer to supply sand was in fact only an offer to supply <em>manufactured sand</em>. There was no offer to supply
                        <em>concreting</em> sand. This was confirmed by
                    Mr Oh Beng Hwa when he gave evidence that the Respondent had proposed at
                    the 19 March 2007 meeting (referred to in the Respondent’s letter
                    dated 26 April 2007) to supply manufactured sand, as opposed to concreting
                        sand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_57" id="Ftn_57_1"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> The Respondent
                    re-confirmed this position that it had offered the Appellant manufactured sand
                    at the meeting of 19 March 2007 in its closing submissions.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_58" id="Ftn_58_1"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(D)   The Respondent had offered to supply manufactured sand to
                the Appellant but this was not a viable alternative</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     The Appellant did not accept the
                    Respondent’s offer to supply sand. In a letter dated 26 April 2007,
                    the Appellant highlighted that the Respondent’s offer was confined only to
                    the supply of <em>manufactured sand</em>.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_59" id="Ftn_59_1"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> We note
                    that the Judge did not consider this a material aspect of the Appellant’s
                    letter of 26 April 2007 (see [18] of Judgment); neither was there any
                    discussion on the issues relating to manufactured sand in the Judgment. In our
                    view, if manufactured sand had been a viable alternative to concreting sand
                    available to the Appellant for use in the manufacture of RMC, and there was no
                    good or justifiable reason why the Appellant did not accept the
                    Respondent’s offer to supply this viable alternative, it cannot be said
                    that the Appellant had taken reasonable steps to avoid the operation of
                    cl 3. <em>However</em>, the <em>undisputed</em> evidence adduced in the proceedings in the court
                    below demonstrates that the Respondent’s <em>offer</em> to supply manufactured sand was a contrived one. There was
                    in fact, at the time when the offer was made on 19 April 2007 (which was
                    reiterated in the Respondent’s letter of 26 April 2007), no approval
                    granted to use manufactured sand as part of the sand component to produce RMC.
                    In any event, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that it has never been the
                    case that manufactured sand could constitute 100% of the sand component to
                    manufacture RMC. This means that <em>concreting sand would still
                        be required in any event</em>. In so far as the offer to supply
                    manufactured sand simply evades the pertinent questions of how and from where
                    the Appellant could obtain <em>concreting</em> sand,
                    without which the Appellant is <em>unable</em> to produce
                    RMC, we are of the view that the Respondent’s offer to supply only
                    manufactured sand cannot be said to be a genuine offer. We now turn our
                    attention to the specific evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     First, the evidence from the <em>Respondent’s own witnesses</em> shows that there was,
                    in fact, <em>no approval</em> to use <em>manufactured</em> sand. The Respondent’s Project Manager,
                    Mr Peh Chong Eng, gave evidence that approval of the Qualified Person had
                    to be obtained before manufactured sand can be used to manufacture
                        RMC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_60" id="Ftn_60_1"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> As such, it follows that such
                    approval to use manufactured sand <em>should</em> have been
                    obtained at the very latest by the meeting of 19 March 2007 when the
                    Respondent had offered to supply manufactured sand to the Appellant. On the
                    contrary, the evidence shows that no such approval had been obtained at the
                    material time. When Mr Oh Beng Hwa (the Respondent’s director) was
                    asked whether the use of manufactured sand was approved only in <em>December 2007</em>, he at first answered that he was
                        unsure,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_61" id="Ftn_61_1"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> after which he made reference
                    to the concrete mix design dated 22 November 2006 exhibited in his
                        AEIC.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_62" id="Ftn_62_1"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> However, Mr Oh Beng Hwa admitted
                    that the words “manufactured sand” were not found in that
                        design.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_63" id="Ftn_63_1"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> As such, the reference to
                    that design is of no relevance to show that there had been approval to use
                    manufactured sand before the meeting of 19 March 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Second, the Respondent’s offer to supply
                    sand on 19 March 2007 (reiterated in the Respondent’s letter dated
                    26 April 2007) was made <em>more than eleven weeks before
                        approval was granted</em> to use <em>manufactured</em> sand. Mr Oh Beng Hwa admitted, in
                        cross-examination,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_64" id="Ftn_64_1"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> that the request for approval to
                    use manufactured sand was actually found in the concrete mix design proposal
                    dated <em>1 June 2007</em> attached with a letter
                    dated <em>8 June 2007</em>,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_65" id="Ftn_65_1"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> which had been sent to the Qualified Person,
                    Mr Lai Kin Sin. Clearly, this request for approval to use manufactured sand
                    came too late; there was no such approval to use manufactured sand at the time
                    when the Respondent had made an offer to supply manufactured sand at the meeting
                    of 19 March 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Third, <em>even if</em>
                    there was approval to use manufactured sand, it was common ground that the
                    approved use of manufactured sand was <em>only up to
                        50%</em> of the sand component in RMC, as shown in paragraphs 5.5
                    and 5.6 of the concrete mix design proposal dated 1 June 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_66" id="Ftn_66_1"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> In
                    other words, there was no approval for manufactured sand to be used as the 100%
                    sand component to manufacture RMC. There was therefore still a need to obtain
                    concreting sand to make up the other 50% of the sand component required to
                    manufacture RMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Fourth, there is substantial undisputed
                    evidence that, although the industry did use manufactured sand even before the
                    Sand Ban, it was <em>never used as a 100% sand
                        component</em> to produce RMC. Concreting sand would still be required
                    in any event. In other words, manufactured sand has never been used as a
                        <em>full</em> substitute for concreting sand. In
                    particular, Dr Ghosh (the Appellant’s Chief Executive Officer with a
                    Canadian PhD degree in concrete technology and civil engineering
                        materials<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_67" id="Ftn_67_1"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>) testified that the
                    quality of the RMC suffers when a greater percentage of manufactured sand is
                    used in its production. Dr Ghosh’s evidence is that as a general
                    practice in the construction industry, in manufacturing RMC, the use of
                    manufactured sand would not exceed 20% to 30% of the sand component; it was
                    never used as a 100% substitute for concreting sand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_68" id="Ftn_68_1"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Dr Ghosh’s evidence is
                    strongly corroborated by the supporting evidence, not least of which was
                    Mr Oliver Ong Yan Wah’s (the Project Director’s) revealing
                    evidence that at the material time, it was “<em>unknown</em>” whether the use of manufactured sand as a 100%
                    sand component for RMC was allowed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_69" id="Ftn_69_1"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>
                    Further, it is clear that the two BCA Circulars dated 1 and 15 February
                    2007, released after the news of the Sand Ban was made known, make <em>no</em> mention of manufactured sand. Before the Sand Ban was
                    announced, the BCA encouraged the construction industry to use alternative
                    materials to <em>reduce the need</em> for concreting sand,
                    in its media release dated 29 January 2007 (“BCA’s media
                    release”), in the following terms:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_70" id="Ftn_70_1"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… we [the BCA] strongly encourage the [construction] industry to
                        adopt alternative construction materials to <em>reduce the
                            need</em> for concreting sand. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     The BCA’s media release shows that
                    alternative construction materials were not meant to be full substitutes for
                    concreting sand, but had played the role of reducing the need for concreting
                    sand. This supports Dr Ghosh’s evidence that manufactured sand has
                    not been used as a full replacement of concreting sand to manufacture RMC. The
                    contents of BCA’s media release have been confirmed by Mr Ng Cher
                    Cheng, the Deputy Director of procurement policies department at the
                        BCA.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_71" id="Ftn_71_1"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> We are also aware
                    that the letter dated 13 June 2007 by the materials specialist,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_72" id="Ftn_72_1"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> MAPEI, stated that at that particular
                    point in time, all commercial RMC suppliers were using only <em>approximately 50%</em> of manufactured sand to manufacture concrete.
                    The other 50% required concreting sand, which the Respondent had failed to offer
                    to procure from the BCA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     In view of the evidence set out above, it is
                    clear that <em>manufactured</em> sand was <em>not</em> a viable alternative. Put simply, the Appellant
                    simply <em>could not have used</em> manufactured sand to
                    produce RMC without the requisite approval to do so. The Respondent’s
                    offer to supply manufactured sand was therefore a mere <em>empty
                        gesture</em> as there was in fact no approval for the use of
                    manufactured sand at the time of the offer, and, even assuming that approval had
                    been granted, <em>concreting</em> sand was still required
                    in any event for about 50% of the sand component to produce RMC. The Respondent
                    was presumably more than aware of the futility of its own offer as it kept
                    silent and did not reply to the Appellant’s letter dated 26 April
                    2007.We conclude this part of the judgment by observing that there was a
                    disingenuous attempt by the Respondent to utilise the pleadings in a
                    “creative” fashion in order to bolster its case on this particular
                    issue. In particular, the Respondent made averments in paras 9 and 11 of
                    its statement of claim that created the misleading impression that a proper
                    offer to supply (<em>concreting</em>) sand had been made to
                    the Appellant, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">9. To persuade the Defendant to honour its obligations under the Contract,
                        the Plaintiff’s Peh Chong Eng <em>proposed to the
                            Defendant’s Messrs Leong and Soh to supply sand</em>and
                        aggregate to the Defendant. This proposal was communicated to the Defendant
                        at a meeting on 19 March 2007. The Defendant did not agree to this
                        proposal.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">11. By <em>a letter dated 26 April 2007</em>,
                        the Plaintiff <em>reiterated its previous proposal to supply
                            sand</em>and aggregate to the Defendant. The Plaintiff gave the
                        Defendant until 2pm 27 April 2007 to accept the proposal, failing which
                        it would accept its repudiation of the Contract ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     The averments made in the statement of claim
                    (set out in the preceding paragraph) are obviously very different from the
                    actual proposal (as is the Respondent’s present argument) to supply
                        <em>only manufactured</em> sand. Indeed, we surmise
                    that the Judge was (unfortunately) under the (erroneous) impression that the
                    Respondent was making an argument based on the former (as opposed to the
                    latter), as it was stated in the Judgment that the Respondent had offered to
                        <em>supply sand</em> to the Appellant (see [17] and
                    [53] of the Judgment), in which <em>no mention</em> was
                    made of manufactured sand. We add here, parenthically, that the Respondent had
                    not pleaded that an offer of manufactured sand constituted a fair and reasonable
                    offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(E)   The Appellant took other reasonable steps to avoid the
                operation of Cl 3</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     Before the BCA has made the announcement under
                    which the Appellant would be denied access to the BCA sand stockpiles, the
                    Appellant had, in fact, met other concrete suppliers and the BCA to discuss
                    alternative supplies of sand.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_73" id="Ftn_73_1"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> On 30 January 2007, the
                    Appellant had a meeting with the Ministry of National Development to discuss the
                    sand ban situation. In addition, the Appellant stated in its letters to the
                    Respondent dated 9 February 2007 and 1 March 2007 that the Appellant
                    had been sourcing for supplies of sand and aggregates.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-5" style="font-variant: small-caps;">(F)   Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Based on the totality of the evidence, we
                    conclude that Appellant <em>had</em> taken reasonable steps
                    to avoid the operation of cl 3. In the final analysis, it is important to
                    emphasise that the reasonable steps that the Appellant could have taken to avoid
                    the operation of cl 3 were limited, in the particular context, to a
                    situation where only the Respondent had access to the BCA’s sand
                    stockpiles. The Appellant had done what it could in the difficult circumstances
                    it found itself placed in: it had informed the Respondent of its inability to
                    procure sand from the BCA and it had offered to credit back to the Respondent
                    the price of sand at a price higher than the cost of procuring sand from the
                    BCA. However, time and again, the Respondent had been unwilling to assist to
                    procure sand from the BCA. In addition, the Respondent did not adduce any
                    evidence that there were alternative supplies of concreting sand from local or
                    overseas sources (apart from its failed contention with regard to manufactured
                    sand). Since the Appellant’s inability to perform the Contract was due
                    largely to the Respondent’s unwillingness to assist, it follows that the
                    triggering of cl 3 is not insubstantially due to the Respondent’s own
                    actions. As such, it does not lie in the Respondent’s mouth to insist that
                    the Appellant is unable to rely upon cl 3. In the circumstances, cl 3
                    applies in the context of the present proceedings as we had earlier found that
                    there had indeed been a “disruption” within the meaning of the
                    clause itself. Consequently, the Appellant is not in breach of contract as
                    cl 3 discharged the Appellant from its obligation to supply RMC to the
                    Respondent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    We would like conclude with the following
                    observation. This case illustrates the importance of drafting contractual
                    clauses in general and <em>force majeure</em> clauses in
                    particular with clarity and precision. Although <em>force
                        majeure</em> clauses often take the form of
                    “boilerplate” clauses, lawyers and their clients would do well to
                    pay more attention to the precise language used in drafting the clause(s)
                    concerned. In the present case, for example, cl 3 was phrased too
                    generally; the dispute between the Appellant and Respondent could have been
                    efficaciously resolved if there had been a more specific clarification of its
                    terms found in cl 3, not least with regard to the meaning of the word
                    “disrupted”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellant’s application to amend its pleadings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    As mentioned above (at <a href="#p1_7">[7]</a>), the Appellant sought to amend its pleadings
                    (by way of SUM 697/2010) in order to raise – for the first time
                    before this court - the argument that, in any event, the
                    Contract had been <em>frustrated</em>. Given our decision
                    with regard to the two sub-issues, the Appellant need not in fact have made this
                    application.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    The legal principles governing an
                    application of this nature have been set out in a number of recent local
                    decisions. In particular, in the recent decision of this court in <em>Review Publishing Co Ltd v Lee Hsien Loong</em> [2010]
                    1 SLR 52, Chan Sek Keong CJ, delivering the judgment of the
                    court, set out a comprehensive overview of this area of the law, as follows (at
                    [110]–[114]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">110    … O 20

                            Ed) gives the court a wide discretion to allow pleadings to be amended
                            at any stage of the proceedings on such terms as may be just.
                            Order 20 r 5(1) reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">Subject to Order 15, Rules 6, 6A, 7 and 8, and this Rule,

                                proceedings</em> allow the plaintiff to amend his writ, or any
                            party to amend his pleading, <em>on such terms as to
                                costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it
                                may direct</em>. [emphasis added]</p>

                                Keong</em>”), this court said at [101]:</p>

                                and otherwise of the High Court”).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">113    The guiding
                            principle is that amendments to pleadings ought to be allowed if they
                            would enable the real question and/or issue in controversy between the
                            parties to be determined… However, an important caveat to
                            granting leave for the amendment of pleadings is that it must be just to
                            grant such leave, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.
                            Thus, this court held in <em>Asia Business
                                Forum</em> that the court, in determining whether to grant a
                            party leave to amend his pleadings, must have regard to “the
                            justice of the case” (at [12]) and must bear in mind (at least)
                            two key factors, namely, whether the amendments would cause any
                            prejudice to the other party which cannot be compensated in costs and
                            whether the party applying for leave to amend is “effectively
                            asking for a second bite at the cherry” (at [18]). These two key
                            factors were endorsed recently again by this court in <em>Susilawati</em> at
                            [58].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">114    It cannot be
                            over-emphasised that all the relevant circumstances of the case at hand
                            should be considered by the court in deciding whether or not to allow an
                            amendment to pleadings, and that delay in bringing the application for
                            leave to amend <em>per se</em> does not constitute
                            prejudice to the other party. As this court stated in <em>Wright Norman</em> at [23]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... In our opinion, at the end of the day, the most important question
                            which the court must ask itself is, are the ends of justice served by
                            allowing the proposed amendment. Pleadings should not be used as a means
                            to punish a party for his errors or the errors of his solicitors. All
                            relevant issues should be investigated, provided the other party will
                            not be prejudiced in a way which cannot be compensated by costs. All
                            relevant circumstances should be considered by the court before it
                            exercises its discretion [as to] whether it would allow an amendment.
                                <em>While the time at which an amendment is made is a
                                relevant consideration it is not necessarily decisive. Delay per se
                                does not equal prejudice or injustice</em>. We do not think
                            any rigid rule should or can be laid down on this. [emphasis
                            added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Reference may also be made to the decision
                    of this court in <em>Hwa Lai Heng Ricky v DBS Bank Ltd</em>
                    [2010] 2 SLR 710, which cited and applied the abovementioned
                    principles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Having regard to the principles set out in
                    the preceding paragraphs, we are of the view that the Respondent’s
                    argument to the effect that, if the doctrine of frustration had been canvassed
                    in the court below, more evidence would need to have been called and that it
                    would now be prejudiced if the Appellant’s application were to succeed, is
                    persuasive. The principles as well as rationale governing <em>force majeure</em> clauses on the one hand and the doctrine of
                    frustration on the other are – notwithstanding possible overlaps
                        - quite different. And, when we add to this the fact that
                    it would appear that the Appellant has a strong <em>prima
                        facie</em> case in the context of the doctrine of frustration (see
                        <em>Kwan Yong</em> (especially at [76]–[77])), it
                    is clear, in our view, that it would be unfair to the Respondent to grant the
                    Appellant’s application to amend its pleadings at this late stage. That
                    having been said, the Appellant did not need (in the light of our decision on
                    both sub-issues above) to rely upon the doctrine of frustration. In the event,
                    we dismiss the Appellant’s application with costs.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    For the reasons stated above we allow the
                    appeal with costs and with the usual consequential orders. However, we reject
                    the application in SUM 697/2010 with costs.</p>
