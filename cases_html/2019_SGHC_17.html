Instead of “six (06) blocks” and “1562.97 grams of cannabis” as stated in the original charge, the charge should be amended to “three (03) blocks” and “394.87 grams of cannabis”.

Faizal confirmed that these three smaller blocks were E4, E5 and E6, which he admitted to knowledge and ownership of. Faizal’s sole defence is that E1, E2 and E3 were not part of the four storybooks that he had collected. Therefore, what is left for me to determine is whether Faizal had actual possession and knowledge of E1, E2 and E3.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 In my view, the objective and circumstantial evidence when taken together, lead to the irresistible inference that Faizal was also in possession and had knowledge of E1, E2 and E3.

</div> However, I do not think that any weight should be given to the 10 June Statement for the following reasons. In the 10 June Statement, Faizal claims at para 40 that he had completely made up paras 27 to 29 of his 21 February Statement. Specifically, he stated that he did not know what these items E1, E2, E3, E4, E5 and E6 were and that he had “never seen them before in [his] life”.

</div> Therefore, I do not accept the Defence’s argument that the accuracy of the 21 February Statement is put into doubt simply because of its apparent contradiction with the 10 June Statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In any event, the rest of the circumstantial evidence corroborates Faizal’s admission in his 21 February Statement that E1, E2 and E3 are three of the four storybooks that he had collected.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The number and weights of the blocks of cannabis discovered match that of the storybooks</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 First, the number of blocks of cannabis that were discovered exactly coincides with the number of storybooks that were collected and subsequently divided and repackaged. Faizal had admitted to collecting four storybooks, and that he subsequently divided one of the storybooks and repackaged it into three smaller blocks. This would mean that, based on Faizal’s own admission, there would be three large blocks (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the three remaining storybooks) and three relatively smaller blocks (which were repackaged from one of the storybooks), for a total of six blocks. Indeed, Ong had discovered six blocks in the drawer of the Unit’s master bedroom, comprised of three large blocks and three relatively smaller blocks (see [9] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Second, the weights of the six blocks of cannabis also corroborate to some extent the fact that E1, E2 and E3 are part of the four storybooks that Faizal had collected.

</div> From the table at [9] above, it can be seen that E1, E2 and E3 weigh 836.7g, 891.3g and 860.9g respectively. Given that the weights of these three blocks fall within the range of weights for a storybook as described by Faizal, this helps to indicate that these three blocks found in the Unit form part of the four storybooks referred to by Faizal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Further, the combined weight of E4, E5 and E6 of 951.7g is not too far out from the estimated weight of each storybook that was provided by Faizal. This lends support to Faizal’s admission that E4, E5 and E6 originated from one of the storybooks that he had collected and brought back to the Unit. The combined weight of E4, E5 and E6 is also consistent with what Faizal had stated in his 21 February Statement that “E6 is half a storybook which is around 500 gram”

This suggests that E4, which was repackaged from one of the storybooks, is linked to E1, E2 and E3. The inference that can be drawn is that the blue foil used to wrap E4 was the same blue foil that was originally used to wrap the fourth storybook which Faizal had repackaged. Upon dividing and repackaging the fourth storybook, Faizal had probably recycled the blue foil and used it to wrap E4. Therefore, it is likely that E1, E2 and E3, which were all wrapped in the blue foil, are in actual fact the three remaining storybooks which Faizal had collected.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 This inference is buttressed by the fact that Faizal could not provide a satisfactory explanation on the origins of the blue foil.

If Faizal is to be believed, there are two gaping holes in the evidence to which no satisfactory explanation was provided. First, it is unclear what happened to the other three storybooks given that Faizal had admitted to bringing all four storybooks to the Unit. Second, it is also unclear where E1, E2 and E3 came from and how they ended up in the same drawer which contained E4, E5 and E6. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 To my mind, there are only a few possible scenarios that can explain how the three storybooks in the refrigerator had disappeared, and three allegedly different blocks of cannabis (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, E1, E2 and E3) had appeared in the drawer in the master bedroom.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) One or more of the three other occupants of the Unit (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Serena, Leo and Arab) had removed the three storybooks from the refrigerator and brought it somewhere else.

It is thus unlikely that any of them had taken away the three storybooks (brought back to the Unit by Faizal) and then placed a different three blocks of cannabis of approximately the same weight in the drawer. Therefore, scenarios (a) and (b) described above are unlikely to have occurred. If Serena, Arab and Leo were not involved with the drugs at all, then some unknown person must have taken away the three storybooks originally brought back to the Unit by Faizal and for no good reason, replaced them with another three blocks of cannabis each of approximately the same weight as those collected by Faizal. There is no sensible explanation for why this unknown person would do such a thing. Therefore, scenario (c) is also unlikely to be true. It would be even more implausible for there to have been <span class="font-italic">two</span> different unknown persons gaining entry into the Unit and committing the acts described above. Therefore, scenario (d) should also be discounted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 What I have done here is to take Faizal’s version of events to its logical extremes.

</div> I do not propose to evaluate which opinion is correct and if it is really better to store cannabis in the refrigerator. However, even if I take the source quoted by the Defence at face value, it still states that the cannabis can be stored in the refrigerator <span class="font-italic">if </span>it is stored in an airtight container. However, Faizal testified that he placed the storybooks into the refrigerator wrapped only in newspaper and cling wrap. At no point did he state that he had first placed the storybooks in an airtight container before putting it into the refrigerator. In the circumstances, I have serious doubts as to whether Faizal had in fact stored the storybooks in the refrigerator as he claims.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I would point out that even if I have found that the storybooks were originally stored in the refrigerator, it will not affect my finding that Faizal had possession and knowledge of all six blocks of cannabis. Given that Faizal had admitted to knowledge and possession of E4, E5 and E6, if indeed these blocks had originally been in the refrigerator, someone must have moved them into the drawer in the master bedroom. The most logical inference is that it was Faizal who had moved the blocks. Given that E1, E2 and E3 were found with E4, E5 and E6, the further inference to be drawn is that it was also Faizal who had moved the other storybooks from the refrigerator into the drawer along with E4, E5 and E6.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In my view, the most likely explanation is that Faizal had been the one to place all six blocks (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, E1 to E6) in the drawer of the television console. However, due to his arrest on 14 February 2016, he was unable to remove the six blocks from the Unit before the rental period was over, which led to Ong’s discovery. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the master bedroom was an ideal location to store the cannabis because it was rarely used and therefore would be the most inconspicuous. Serena had testified that she had not seen anyone sleeping in the master bedroom apart from the time that Leonard was in there for two hours.

In my view, the <span class="font-italic">absence</span> of DNA evidence in itself does not lead to the inference that the accused was never in possession of these three blocks. In any event, there was also no evidence to suggest that the absence of DNA on an item necessarily means that a person had not touched it. As for E4, E5 and E6, Faizal had admitted to dividing and repackaging the fourth storybook, which would have required a substantial amount of handling. Therefore, it is unsurprising that his DNA was left on those blocks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Considering the totality of the evidence, I find that Faizal had actual possession and knowledge of all six blocks of cannabis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Faizal possessed the six blocks of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 For the reasons stated below, I agree with the Prosecution that the evidence shows that Faizal had possessed the six blocks of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking. Even if the evidence is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Faizal had possessed the six blocks of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking, he has failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the MDA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Faizal’s admission in his 21 February Statement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Faizal had admitted in his 21 February Statement that the storybooks were for sale.

However, the excuses or exculpatory portions need not carry the same weight. Indeed, an accused person would be incentivised to pepper an otherwise incriminating statement with portions of exculpatory evidence in an attempt to reduce his criminal liability. Therefore, it would indeed be sound practice for the court to approach such evidence with caution. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 The part of the 21 February Statement which I have reproduced above is incriminating in so far as it states that the storybooks were for sale, and exculpatory in so far as it suggests that the other storybooks belonged to the three other occupants of the Unit. Therefore, I am inclined to placing greater weight on the fact that Faizal had admitted that all the four storybooks were for sale, and less weight on what was stated in relation to the storybooks being jointly owned by Serena, Arab and Leo. This is especially so given my finding at [19] above that Serena, Arab and Leo did not have knowledge or possession of the six blocks of cannabis.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Faizal had dealt with the storybooks in a manner indicating that he intended to traffic</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Faizal had also dealt with the cannabis in a manner consistent with someone intending to traffic in it.

</div> When I asked him why he had to ensure that the subdivided portions were equal in weight given that it was for his own consumption, his answer was that it would be easier for him to keep the cannabis in the refrigerator, and so that he would know that those blocks were his. I did not accept his explanation. If the entire storybook was for Faizal’s own consumption, it would have sufficed for him to weigh the entire storybook to ensure that he received the correct amount. Further, if he intended for the cannabis to be more easily identifiable, he could have made a mark on each bundle as opposed to having to weigh each bundle again each time he wanted to make sure that the bundle was his. In my view, Faizal had weighed the subdivided portions because he had to ensure that their weights were correct in order to facilitate their future sale or distribution.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The cannabis could not have been for Faizal’s own consumption</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 It is unlikely that the cannabis was meant for Faizal’s own consumption, which leads to the inference that such a large quantity of cannabis must have been for the purpose of trafficking. Faizal had consistently stated across his 21 February Statement, his examination-in-chief and in cross-examination that he had never smoked cannabis before.

</div> I found it incredible that someone who had never tried cannabis before would have spent so much money and purchased such a large amount for his personal consumption. Even if I accept that Faizal only had ownership of one storybook, that would still be about 950g of cannabis worth about $9,500.
