<font color="#000080" size="4">Judgment</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font color="#800000"><strong><u>GROUNDS OF DECISION</u></strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">          By virtue of the

consent interlocutory judgment, the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants are liable for first, the

breach of the non-solicitation term with respect to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants and/or

Globalcom, and second, the breach of the confidential information term and breach of

confidence. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant is liable for breach of confidence only. I deal

first with damages for breach of the non-solicitation term.</p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(I)        Damages for breach of the

non-solicitation term</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2        In arriving at the amount

of damages for breach of the non-solicitation term in the one year period from the date of

the termination agreement (ie 31 August 1999), I took into account the following factors:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p>(a)    total number of terminated customers</p>
<p>(b)    percentage of customers who stay active</p>
<p>(c)    average loss of usage per day</p>
<p>(d)    average number of business days per month</p>
<p>(e)    number of months which each customer remains as a customer with

    the plaintiffs</p>
<p>(f)    profit margin</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3        The damages to be awarded

to the plaintiffs should be the loss of profits which the plaintiffs suffered as a result

of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants’ breach in this regard. I agreed with the

plaintiffs’ submission that the quantum of damages to be awarded should be based on

the following formula:</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">[Total number of terminated customers] x [Percentage of customers who

stay active] x [Average loss of usage per day] x [Average number of business days per

month] x [Number of months which each customer remains as a customer with the plaintiffs]

x [Profit margin]</p></i>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">I looked into each of the factors in turn.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4        With respect to (a), after

considering all the evidence, I found that, on a balance of probabilities, the most

accurate figure to use was 173. It is incontrovertible evidence that the attached schedule

to the termination agreement of 31 August 1999 set out the plaintiffs’ customers,

which stood at 322 according to the agreement (or more accurately, 321). This agreement,

together with the schedule, was an agreement between the parties, and the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendants cannot recant from admitting the veracity of the contents of that agreement,

unless very clear and unequivocal evidence is presented to the contrary. This, I failed to

find. I accepted Anthony Khoo’s evidence that the attached scheduled was prepared by

the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants, as opposed to the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants’

contention that it was prepared by the plaintiffs. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant’s

evidence was inconsistent. He could not clearly ascertain when the termination of the 17

customers (which the defendants contended were the only customers who terminated the

plaintiffs’ services as a result of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants’ breach) took

place. I accepted Simon Har and Craymond Ching’s evidence that the database of the

plaintiffs’ customers was handed to the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants after the date of

the termination agreement. Having established that as at 31 August 1999, 322 customers

were the plaintiffs’ customers, I accepted the plaintiff’s evidence and found

that 173 of those had terminated the plaintiffs’ services (190 minus 17 who

re-subscribed to the plaintiffs’ services). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5        Factor (b) is crucial as

not all 173 customers who terminated the plaintiffs’ services could have done so

because of the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants’ breach of the non-solicitation term. This

is because the customers who would have terminated the services in the normal course of

the plaintiffs’ business would have to be taken into account. After evaluating the

plaintiffs’ expert witness, Chee Yoh Chuang’s, evidence as to the accurate

percentage of attrition in the normal course of business, I found that the best figure to

use was 57.2%, based on Scenario 1 of his report and the findings in paragraphs 2.15 to

2.17 therein. Although there was some evidence that some customers used the

plaintiffs’ services after a lapse of more than six months, that was not, in my view,

sufficient to establish such a trend as to render this selected pool of customers

"active". As such, I did not rely on the premises set out in Scenario 2 of the

report. On the other hand, the defendants did not proffer any cogent evidence to rebut the

figures put forth by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6        With respect to factor (c),

I accepted the plaintiffs’ calculation that each customer used the plaintiffs’

fax forwarding service at an average of 14.03 minutes per day. The defendants did not

submit any cogent evidence to contradict this. Factor (d) is not in contention. With

respect to factor (e), I accepted Chee Yoh Chuang’s method of calculation in arriving

at a period of 2.5 years, or 30 months, as set out in paragraphs 2.21 and 2.22 of his

report (taking the premises in Scenario 1). I did not agree with the defendants’

submission that one should deem customers who were "inactive" for more than six

months as customers who had terminated the services with the plaintiffs. First, there was

evidence that some of these customers used the plaintiffs’ services after being

"inactive" for more than six months. Second, the contractual terms in the

plaintiffs’ standard agreement with their customers provided that termination would

have to be effected in writing. With respect to factor (f), I accepted the

plaintiffs’ estimated figure of between $0.45 to $0.64 per minute. On the other hand,

the defendants did not produce substantiated evidence as to why these figures should be

rejected. They submitted a figure of $0.30 per minute without explaining clearly how that

figure was arrived at. I arrived at a figure of $0.45 per minute, taking Anthony

Khoo’s estimate. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7        As such, the damages

awarded to the plaintiffs payable by the 1<sup>st</sup> defendants as a result of the

breach of the non-solicitation term are:</p>
<i xmlns="">
<p align="justify">173 (customers) x 0.572 (percentage of customers who stay active) x

14.03 (average loss of usage per day in minutes) x 20 (working days per months) x 30

(months in which each customer stays as a customer of the plaintiffs) x $0.45 (profit

margin per minute) = $374,855.20</p></i>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">(II)        Damages for breach of

the confidential information term and breach of confidence</p></b>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8        There is an overlap in the

damages suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the breach of the non-solicitation term,

and the breach of the confidential information term and breach of confidence. The

plaintiffs contended that the calculation for such a loss was either loss of profits or

the value of the information (which in this case was the database of customers). I was of

the view that calculating the loss to the plaintiffs on account of the value of the

database was not accurate; although there was some evidence that the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendants were trying to sell the 3<sup>rd</sup> defendants the database for $120,000, no

agreement was reached. There was no definitive "price" which could be affixed to

the database. As for loss of profits suffered by the plaintiffs, it was difficult to

attribute what portion of the terminated accounts was as a result of the breach of the

non-solicitation term, and what portion was as a result of the breach of the confidential

information term and breach of confidence. Neither the plaintiffs nor defendants brought

up any evidence towards this end. Hence, I could only calculate damages on the basis that

the loss of profits would be calculated as a result of all the three types of breaches as

a whole and not apportion the damages to each type of breach.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9        For all the above reasons,

I awarded the plaintiffs damages in the sum of $374,855.20 to be payable by the 1<sup>st</sup>

and 2<sup>nd</sup> defendants. Interest on the judgment sum would be at a rate of 6% per

annum from the date of the issue of the writ to the date of judgment. The costs of the

assessment and the action are to be paid by the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendants to the plaintiffs, the quantum of which are to be agreed or taxed.</p>
