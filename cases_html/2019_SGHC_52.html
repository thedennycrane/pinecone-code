</div> According to the plaintiff, the key features of the plan were as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) From 1 October 2014, the first defendant would appoint a managing director designate for the second defendant, to take over from the plaintiff as the second defendant’s managing director from 1 April 2015.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) For the two-year period from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2017, the plaintiff would cease to be the second defendant’s managing director. Instead, he would be employed under a new contract as the second defendant’s Executive Chairman. He would no longer have day-to-day management responsibilities for the second defendant. His pay and working hours were also to be reduced. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The first defendant would purchase the plaintiff’s 25% shareholding in the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On the third element of the succession plan, the plaintiff’s evidence is that it was agreed that the first defendant would buy the plaintiff’s shares in the second defendant and it was understood that the first defendant would do so before the plaintiff’s employment as its Executive Chairman came to an end. The defendants deny that the third element was agreed in any sense. I make no finding on any of the points relating to the third element, as that is wholly irrelevant to the matter which I have to decide on this application. But it is fair to say that the parties did agree to engage in negotiations with a view to reaching terms for the first defendant’s purchase of the plaintiff’s shares in the second defendant in anticipation of his employment with the second defendant ceasing on 31 March 2017.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Implementing the succession plan</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 As agreed in the succession plan, on 1 October 2014, the plaintiff began the six-month transition period. At the end of those six months, on 1 April 2015, the plaintiff retired as managing director of the second defendant. He was given a two-year employment contract with the second defendant as its Executive Chairman.

Instead, the plaintiff attempts to draw out the directorship right as an express term of the Agreement through what is said to be a contextual construction of cl 4.1.3.2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The first issue therefore turns on the contextual construction of cl 4.1.3.2 of the Agreement. The parties are on common ground when it comes to the principles I am to apply in carrying out the contextual construction. Those principles can be summarised as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Contracts are to be construed by applying the contextual approach. That approach places the court “in the best possible position to ascertain the parties’ objective intentions by interpreting the expressions used by the parties in the relevant instrument in their proper context” (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal </span>[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span>”) at [72]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The contextual approach is neither a licence to admit all manner of extrinsic evidence nor a licence to rewrite the terms of a contract based on the subjective intentions of the parties (<span class="font-italic">Y.E.S. F&amp;B Group Pte Ltd v Soup Restaurant Singapore Pte Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> (formerly known as Soup Restaurant (Causeway Point) Pte Ltd) </span>[2015] 5 SLR 1187 (“<span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant</span>”) at [32]; <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine </span>at [72]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thus, even under the contextual approach, the text of a contract ought always to be the “first port of call for the court” (<span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant</span> at [32]). That places a limit on what the court can do when interpreting a contract because “absent the text, the contract cannot be constructed out of context alone” (<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On v Ding Pei Zhen </span>[2017] 1 SLR 219 (“<span class="font-italic">Yap Son On</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [39] citing <span class="font-italic">Lucky Realty Co Pte Ltd v HSBC Trustee (Singapore) Ltd </span>[2016] 1 SLR 1069 at [2]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) It is always the case, even when construing a contract contextually, that the “meaning imputed by the court [must] be one which ‘the words are reasonably adequate to convey’” (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v B-Gold Interior Design &amp; Construction Pte Ltd </span>[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [122] citing <span class="font-italic">Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) Ltd v Wee Ah </span><span class="font-italic">Kee </span>[1997] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [63]). </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Ambiguity, absurdity or the existence of an alternative technical meaning to a contractual provision are not prerequisites for extrinsic evidence to be admissible (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>at [114] and [130]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) There are two broad steps to the contextual approach (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance</span> at [124]; <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On </span>at [28]). First, the court has to consider whether the extrinsic evidence sought to be adduced in aid of interpretation is admissible. Second, the court interprets the contract, taking into account the admissible evidence;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Extrinsic material is admissible if it is relevant, reasonably available to all the contracting parties and relates to a clear or obvious context (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>at [125] and [128]–[132]; <span class="font-italic">Yap Son On </span>at [42]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(h) The nature, particulars and effect of the extrinsic evidence sought to be relied on must be pleaded with specificity (<span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [73]; <span class="font-italic">Yap Son </span><span class="font-italic">On </span>at [46]);</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(i) Where extrinsic evidence is in the form of subsequent conduct, such evidence is likely to be inadmissible for non-compliance with the above requirements even though there is no absolute prohibition against its admissibility (<span class="font-italic">Zurich Insurance </span>at [132(d)]; <span class="font-italic">Soup Restaurant </span>at [39]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I make two general points on these statements of general principle. First, other than the subsequent conduct of the parties, the plaintiff does not rely for his argument on the proper construction on cl 4.1.3.2 on evidence extrinsic to the contract. The bulk of the plaintiff’s case on construction is built upon indicators as to the meaning of cl 4.1.3.2 to be gleaned from the other terms of the contract itself.  Second, because the plaintiff commenced these proceedings by originating summons, there are no pleadings to speak of, only affidavits. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Analysis of cl 4</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Applying these principles, the plaintiff argues that cl 4.1.3.2, properly construed, expressly confers upon him the directorship right, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> a right to hold office as a director of the second defendant so long as he remains a shareholder of the second defendant.

</div> The other construction – and the one which the defendants rely on – is that cl 4.1.3.2 sets out a one-off obligation to be performed only upon completion. On that construction, cl 4.1.3.2 confers upon the plaintiff only the right to be <span class="font-italic">appointed</span> a director of the second defendant upon completion. It says nothing about the future. In in particular, it says nothing about whether the plaintiff has a right continuing into the future to hold office as a director so long as he remains a shareholder of the second defendant. Thus, the defendants argue, his application must fail. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 I reject the plaintiff’s submission on the proper construction of cl 4.1.3.2 and accept the defendants’ submission. For the reasons which follow, I find it impossible to construe an express directorship right out of cl 4.1.3.2 of the Agreement, either when its words are interpreted alone or when its effect is construed in context.

Clause 4 bears the prominent heading “Completion”. Like all of the headings in the agreement, this heading is entirely in capital letters. That is an indicator, though perhaps not very weighty, of the importance which the parties attached to the heading. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Immediately below cl 4’s heading appears cl 4.1 and its introductory words. Clause 4.1 is then broken down into three principal limbs: cl 4.1.1, cl 4.1.2 and cl 4.1.3. After the third limb, there is no cl 4.2. Thus, cl 4.1 represents the entire textual and contractual content of cl 4. In other words, all of cl 4 is subject to the introductory words of cl 4.1. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The introductory words to cl 4.1, and thus to cl 4 as a whole, read: “On Completion Date”. “Completion Date” is defined in cl 1.1 of the Agreement as 21 April 2003, subject only to contrary agreement. There is no evidence of any contrary agreement. The natural construction of cl 4, then, is that its purpose is to govern “completion” (as stated in its heading) and to set out the rights and obligations of the parties “On Completion Date” (as stated in its introductory words). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 The first limb of cl 4, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> cl 4.1.1, certainly fits in with that purpose. That limb sets out the first defendant’s obligation upon completion to sell its shares in the second defendant to the management team in the stipulated percentages and at par value.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The second limb of cl 4, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> cl 4.1.2, also fits in with that purpose. That limb gives the parties the power upon completion to relax the management team’s obligation under cl 4.1.1 by permitting the team to acquire less than 40% of the second defendant, with the purchase price to be adjusted accordingly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The difficulty in this case is that the third limb of cl 4, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> cl 4.1.3, does not fit in easily with that purpose. It cannot easily be said that, as a matter of language, cl 4.1.3 sets out the parties’ rights upon completion. The plaintiff relies on this point heavily to argue that, despite the references to “completion” in the heading to cl 4 and in the introductory words of cl 4, cl 4.1.3 is not intended to govern the parties’ rights upon completion alone, but is also intended to and does govern the parties’ rights and obligations post-completion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 The plaintiff points in particular to cl 4.1.3.6. That limb of cl 4.1.3 sets out the parties’ right post-completion to remove and replace the bank signatories whom they nominated upon completion under cl 4.1.3.5. The parties’ right to remove signatories <span class="font-italic">post</span>-completion is clearly nothing to do with their rights <span class="font-italic">upon</span> completion. This supports the plaintiff’s argument that cl 4.1.3 was intended to address <span class="font-italic">both</span> rights upon completion <span class="font-italic">and</span> rights post-completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 Thus, as the plaintiff correctly points out, cl 4.1.3 deals both with the appointment of bank signatories upon completion and with the appointment of directors upon completion. As the plaintiff also correctly points out, cl 4.1.3 expressly provides for the parties to have a right post-completion to remove the bank signatories so appointed while making no equivalent express provision for the parties to have a right post-completion to remove the directors so appointed.

</div> Because of the absence of an equivalent express provision conferring a post-completion right to remove the directors so appointed, the plaintiff argues that cl 4.1.3.2 must be construed in context as expressly having excluded any such right of removal. The plaintiff concedes, however, that his construction cannot mean that he has a right to hold office as a director of the second defendant in perpetuity. He accepts that the express right which he draws out of cl 4.1.3.2 in this way continues only so long as he remains a shareholder of the second defendant.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  The plaintiff’s written submissions dated 30 July 2018, paragraph 40.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> That is because the acquisition of those shares was the fundamental reason for the parties entering into the Agreement the first place.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 For the reasons which follow, I reject the plaintiff’s submission on the significance of cl 4.1.3.6 in construing cl 4.1.3.2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Clause 4.1.3.6 is the sixth limb out of the seven limbs of cl 4.1.3. The plaintiff’s submission fails to give any weight to a critical distinction between the first four limbs of cl 4.1.3 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> cll 4.1.3.1 to 4.1.3.4) and the last three limbs of that clause (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> cll 4.1.3.5 to 4.1.3.7). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The first four limbs of cl 4.1.3, just like cl 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, do unambiguously set out the parties’ rights and obligations upon completion. If the introductory words to the seven limbs cl 4.1.3 are derived by running together the introductory words found in cl 4.1 and cl 4.1.3, the introduction to the seven limbs of cl 4.1.3 read: “On Completion Date … [the first defendant] shall procure [the second defendant] to …”. Thus, if the objective of cl 4 is to deal with the parties’ rights upon completion, as I have found, cl 4.1.3 deals as a subset of that objective with the state of affairs which the first defendant is obliged to bring about upon completion by exercising its control over the second defendant to that end. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 This objective makes perfect sense for the first four limbs of cl 4.1.3. Thus, each of those four limbs is a sentence fragment beginning with a verb in lower case. Each of these four limbs neatly completes a sentence commencing with the introductory words found in both cl 4.1 and in cl 4.1.3: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Clause 4.1.3.1: Upon Completion Date, the first defendant shall procure the second defendant to increase its paid up capital;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Clause 4.1.3.2: Upon Completion Date, the first defendant shall procure the second defendant to appoint the named persons to be directors of the second defendant;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Clause 4.1.3.3: Upon Completion Date, the first defendant shall procure the second defendant to appoint a Chairman of the second defendant; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Clause 4.1.3.4: Upon Completion Date, the first defendant shall procure the second defendant to open a current account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 Read this way, it is clear that each of the first four limbs of cl 4.1.3 specifies a one-off act which the first defendant is obliged to procure the second defendant to carry out. And the introductory words make clear that the first defendant is obliged to procure these acts <span class="font-italic">upo</span><span class="font-italic">n completion</span>. There is nothing in the express language of these first four limbs which evinces an intention by the parties that these limbs are to govern their rights for the future, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> post-completion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 The <span class="font-italic">last</span> three limbs of cl 4.1.3 are quite different from the first four limbs. The last three limbs <span class="font-italic">do</span> evince an intention by the parties to govern their rights post-completion. But the last three limbs of cl 4.1.3 (cll 4.1.3.5 to 4.1.3.7) are significantly different in nature from the first four limbs. The last three limbs do not specify an act which the first defendant is obliged to procure the second defendant to carry out upon completion. The last three limbs are not dependent in any way for their meaning on the combined introductory words found in cl 4.1 and of cl 4.1.3. Indeed, the last three limbs of cl 4.1.3 are not in any way drafted as sentence fragments capable of being read together with those introductory words. Instead, each of these three limbs is a complete sentence which stands alone, independent of all the introductory words. That is why none of these three limbs begin mid-sentence with a verb and are instead self-contained sentences beginning with a capital letter. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 As a result, it is quite impossible to read any of the last three limbs together with the introductory words found in cl 4.1 and cl 4.1.3. Carrying out the same exercise as in [69] above on these three limbs yields the following nonsensical provisions: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.1.3.5  On Completion Date … [the first defendant] shall procure [the second defendant] to … In relation to the said bank account, it is hereby agreed that [the first defendant] shall have the right to appoint 4 authorised signatories under Group A and the [management team] shall be entitled to appoint 3 authorised signatories, one of whom shall be a Group A signatory. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.1.3.6  On Completion Date … [the first defendant] shall procure [the second defendant] to … Each of the parties hereto shall be entitled at any time and from time to time to remove their appointees and appoint other persons in their place as signatories.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">4.1.3.7  On Completion Date … [the first defendant] shall procure [the second defendant] to … Unless superseded by later board resolution, the said bank account shall be the operated in the same manner as that of the C&amp;E Business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The textual and conceptual distinctions between cl 4.1.1, cl 4.1.2 and the first four limbs of cl 4.1.3 on the one hand and the last three limbs of cl 4.1.3 on the other hand suggest to me that those last three limbs were inserted at a time after the remainder of the Agreement had been drafted and, in particular, after cl 4 had been drafted with the first four limbs of cl 4.1.3 in place. In contrast to the first four limbs, the sole purpose of the last three limbs is to deal specifically and only with the post-completion operation of the second defendant’s bank account. These three limbs were inserted immediately below cl 4.1.3.4, no doubt, because cl 4.1.3.4 is the very provision which obliges the first defendant to procure the second defendant to open a bank account upon completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 I do not consider that the drafting choice which the parties made by inserting the textually and conceptually distinct last three limbs of cl 4.1.3 into that clause is capable of affecting in any way the clear and express intent of the first four limbs to require the first defendant to procure the second defendant to carry out certain acts upon completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 In that sense, therefore, I do accept the plaintiff’s argument that the last three limbs of cl 4.1.3 govern the parties’ rights and obligations post-completion. But I do not consider that that difference of purpose provides any relevant context to the proper construction of the first four limbs of cl 4.1.3 and, in particular, to the proper construction of cl 4.1.3.2. Reading cl 4.1.3.2 in the context provided by cl 4, it appears to me to be, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, a provision intended to deal with the first defendant’s obligations upon completion and not post-completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I now consider the plaintiff’s arguments on other provisions in the Agreement and on the available extrinsic evidence to see whether that casts any further light on the proper construction of cl 4.1.3.2 in context. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Recital C</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 The plaintiff relies on Recital C to the Agreement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The [management team] are desirous of participating as shareholders of [the second defendant] with effect from 21 April 2003 (“the Completion Date”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 The plaintiff’s submission is that the context supplied by Recital C shows that the management team’s desire to participate as shareholders of the second defendant underpinned the entire Agreement.

</div> The context supplied by Recital C therefore requires cl 4.1.3.2 to be construed as conferring upon the plaintiff a right to hold that office until he ceases to be a shareholder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 I reject this argument. There is nothing in the phrase “participation as shareholders” which casts any light on the plaintiff’s right to participate in the management of the second defendant. Further, the argument which goes from the manifestation of that desire in Recital C to supplying an enduring temporal scope to the rights conferred by the Agreement is based on a <span class="font-italic">non sequitur</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 “Participating as shareholders” in Recital C means just that: the plaintiff, together with the other members of the management team, were desirous of acquiring the status of and enjoying the fruits of holding the bundle of rights associated with being a shareholder of the second defendant. They realised that desire by acquiring shares in the second defendant, by receiving from time to time the information about the second defendant’s business and financial affairs to which shareholders are entitled, by attending and voting at general meetings, and by participating in the profits of the second defendant’s business through dividends. The management team’s desire to participate as shareholders in the second defendant says nothing about the existence, let alone the enduring nature, of any other rights which the parties might enjoy under the Agreement, <span class="font-italic">eg</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>a right to participate in management of the second defendant post-completion by continuing to hold the office of a director. It therefore does not follow that the desire of the parties that the plaintiff should participate as a shareholder of the second defendant which they manifested in Recital C supplies a context which is relevant to a proper construction of cl 4.1.3.2 and which requires the right conferred upon the plaintiff by that clause to be construed as a right which endures so long as he participates as a shareholder in the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 This approach is entirely consistent with the parties’ collaboration and the legal form in which they chose to embody it. The parties chose to embody their collaboration in the corporate form, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> in the form of a limited liability company. A key feature – and one of the key innovations – of the limited liability company is the separation of ownership from management. Recital C refers only to “shareholding”. It shows no intention to link the concept of participation in ownership to the quite distinct concept of participation in management, whether in cl 4.1.3.2 or elsewhere in the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 Contrary to the plaintiff’s submission, I am wholly unable to use Recital C to find, by the process of construction, that cl 4.1.3.2 is an express term linking the plaintiff’s status as a director (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> as a manager of the second defendant) to his status as a shareholder (<span class="font-italic">ie</span> as a part-owner of the second defendant). Recital C is simply incapable of casting any contextual light on the proper construction of cl 4.1.3.2 insofar as the directorship right is concerned.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Immediate removal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The plaintiff also relies on Recital C to argue that the defendants’ construction makes no commercial sense. His argument is that, if cl 4.1.3.2 properly construed confers upon the plaintiff only a right to hold office as a director upon completion, that undermines the entire commercial purpose of the Agreement as manifested in Recital C. Upon completion, the first defendant transferred 25% of the second defendant to the plaintiff, took his money in exchange and appointed him a director of the second defendant and its managing director. If the defendant’s construction is correct, an instant after completion, without breaching any provision of the Agreement, the first defendant could have removed the plaintiff as a director.

</div> The plaintiff argues that this construction does not result in the plaintiff participating as a shareholder of the second defendant within the meaning of Recital C. It renders the first defendant’s obligation to the plaintiff under cl 4.1.3.2 illusory, devoid of all contractual content and bereft of all commercial utility. The plaintiff argues that the result of the defendants’ construction is especially absurd bearing in mind that cl 4.1.3.2 also obliges the first defendant to procure the plaintiff’s appointment as managing director of the second defendant upon completion.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I reject this argument. It is clear that, throughout the 30-year relationship between the plaintiff and the first defendant, their incentives have been largely aligned. That is no doubt why the parties have, throughout those 30 years, enjoyed a remarkably good relationship based on a high degree of mutual trust and confidence and an enduring spirit of good faith. That is why the first defendant transferred its C&amp;E division to the second defendant in 2002, even before the parties had agreed the terms on which the management team would participate as shareholders in the second defendant. That is why the management team accepted the transfer of their employment to the second defendant and paid $200,000 to the first defendant in 2002 as a deposit against the price of the shares to be transferred to them, even though the terms on which they would acquire those shares were still being negotiated. That is why the first defendant appointed the plaintiff a director of the second defendant and its managing director in April 2002, even though it undertook no obligation to do so until the parties entered into the Agreement in April 2003. That is why the Agreement treats the management team as having had an entitlement to participate in the profits of the second defendant from April 2002 even though they did not become shareholders of the second defendant until completion under the Agreement in April 2003. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 It is true that the defendant’s construction of cl 4.1.3.2 leaves the plaintiff exposed to the risk of the first defendant using its unqualified and unilateral power to remove a director under Article 79 of the second defendant’s corporate constitution in a way wholly contrary to the spirit of the Agreement and the parties’ collaboration. However, it appears to me that that risk was either a risk which it did not occur to the plaintiff to guard against in the Agreement or one which the plaintiff was willing to take when he entered into the Agreement because of the relationship of trust and confidence which prevailed between the parties at all times, until perhaps very recently, and because of the close alignment of their incentives and objectives. That risk is not a basis on which to conjure out of cl 4.1.3.2 by a process of construction an express term connecting the plaintiff’s status as a director to his status as a shareholder, which has no basis in the language of that clause.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 Indeed, the point on commercial absurdity which the plaintiff makes about cl 4.1.3.2 is equally true of other limbs of cl 4.1.3. The first defendant could have procured the second defendant to appoint a Chairman upon completion under cl 4.1.3.3 and then, an instant later, procured the second defendant to remove the Chairman. The first defendant could have procured the second defendant to open a current account upon completion under cl 4.1.3.4 and then, an instant later, procured the second defendant to close the current account. All of this serves to illustrate the point made in the paragraph above. The commercial absurdity which the plaintiff argues is a consequence of the defendants’ construction arises only if one ignores the relationship of trust and confidence and the alignment of incentives and objectives which prevailed when the parties entered into the Agreement and indeed, it appears, right up until July 2017.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Clause 16.2</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The next argument which the plaintiff raises relies on cl 16.2 of the Agreement:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As to any of the provisions of this Agreement remaining to be performed or capable of having effect after the Completion Date this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding Completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">The plaintiff relies on cl 16.2 not as an aid to construing cl 4.1.3.2 in context but as a contractual provision which has the effect of extending the temporal scope of cl 4.1.3.2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 The plaintiff argues that cl 4.1.3.2, when read with cl 16.2, means that the plaintiff’s express right to hold office as a director of the second defendant upon completion remains in full force and effect even after completion, ceasing only when the plaintiff ceases to participate in the second defendant as a shareholder.

</div> This would give effect to the parties’ stated intention in Recital C that the purpose of the Agreement was for the plaintiff to participate as a shareholder in the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 I reject this argument. The purpose of cl 16.2 is indeed to extend the temporal scope of clauses in the Agreement. But cl 16.2 operates only on two types of clauses: (i) clauses which remain to be performed after completion; and (ii) clauses which are capable of having effect after completion. Only those clauses which fall within one or other of those two categories are to “remain in full force and effect notwithstanding Completion”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Clause 4.1.3.2 is in neither of those categories. Clause 4.1.3.2 is not within the first category. Appointment of the plaintiff as a director of the second defendant was not an obligation which remained to be performed after completion. Indeed, the first defendant procured the second defendant to appoint the plaintiff as a director and its managing director a year <span class="font-italic">before</span> completion, on 1 April 2002. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Likewise, cl 4.1.3.2 is not within the second category. The language of cl 4.1.3.2 obliges the first defendant to exercise its control of the second defendant upon completion to ensure that those persons named in cl 4.1.3.2 are appointed directors of the second defendant. For the reasons I have already given, cl 4.1.3.2 on its proper construction does not attempt to regulate the parties’ rights and obligations post-completion. It is simply not expressed as a clause which is capable of having effect after completion. Further, I do not consider it legitimate to use cl 16.2 to write into cl 4.1.3.2 words which have the effect of bringing cl 4.1.3.2 within the second category of clauses whose temporal scope is extended by cl 16.2.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Clause 16.2 does not assist the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The defendants allowed the plaintiff to exercise powers as a director</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 The plaintiff also relies on the fact that, after he stepped down as the second defendant’s Executive Chairman on 31 March 2017, he continued to exercise his powers as a director of the second defendant. He signed board resolutions in writing and also sent emails in that capacity. The defendants did not oppose or object to any of this. The plaintiff submits that the defendants’ failure to object then is inconsistent with their position now that they can remove the plaintiff as director at any time

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 I reject this argument. The first defendant’s open offer is also, of course, subsequent conduct in relation to the Agreement. As I have already pointed out, subsequent conduct is generally not a legitimate aid when construing a contract, even under the contextual approach (see [96] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 In any event, I do not accept that the first defendant is taking inconsistent positions. I say that on two levels: the temporal and the modal. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 First, when looked at temporally, seeking to bring an end to a director’s status as a director when he ceases to be a shareholder is not logically inconsistent with the position that the director has no entitlement to hold the status of a director even before he ceases to be a shareholder. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Second, when looked at modally, a shareholder asking a director to resign is not inconsistent with the shareholder having the power to remove the director. Resignation is ostensibly voluntary. Removal is obviously involuntary. There are many good reasons why a majority shareholder may ask a director to resign even though the majority shareholder considers that it has the unqualified right to remove him as a director. Indeed, as a practical matter, I would have been very surprised if a company which had had a 30-year relationship of trust and confidence with a director would remove him without first inviting him to resign voluntarily. That is all that the first defendant did. That does not mean that they did not have the unqualified right to do so. Equally, it does not mean that they did not believe that they had the unqualified right to do so. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiff’s counterarguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 The remainder of the plaintiff’s submissions are not positive arguments why the directorship right exists under the Agreement.

</div> I have no difficulty in accepting that point. As matter of construction, cl 4.1.3.2 does not connect the plaintiff’s status as a director of the second defendant to his status as an employee of the second defendant. But accepting that point does not assist the plaintiff in establishing his case that cl 4.1.3.2 is an express term of the Agreement which connects his right to hold office as a director of the second defendant legally and permanently to his status as a shareholder of the second defendant. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Second, the plaintiff rejects as disingenuous the defendants’ argument that the plaintiff seeks to be a director of the plaintiff in perpetuity.

</div> I likewise have no difficulty in accepting that the plaintiff does not, in these proceedings, assert a right to remain a director of the second defendant in perpetuity. But, once again, accepting that point does not assist the plaintiff’s case. Clause 4.1.3.2 construed in context does not give the plaintiff an express right to hold office as a director post-completion. Incorporating a temporal limitation into his formulation of that right does not assist the plaintiff in establishing his case that the directorship right exists as an express contractual right under cl 4.1.3.2 of the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The cases</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I turn now to consider the three principal authorities which the defendants cite. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 The defendants rely on the case of <span class="font-italic">Paillart</span><span class="font-italic"> Philippe Marcel Etienne and another v Eban Stuart Ashley and another</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 132 (“<span class="font-italic">Paillart</span>”).

</div> The plaintiff also points out that, unlike the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Paillart</span>, the plaintiff’s shareholding in the second defendant has not changed since he acquired his shares in April 2003. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 I accept the defendants’ submissions on <span class="font-italic">Paillart</span> and reject the plaintiff’s. The plaintiff cannot establish the directorship right by pointing out that there is no minimum shareholding specified in cl 4.1.3.2 of the Agreement whereas there was such a minimum shareholding specified in <span class="font-italic">Paillart</span>. That ground of distinction assumes what it sets out to prove, <span class="font-italic">ie</span> that cl 4.1.3.2 confers upon the plaintiff an express directorship right.

In that case, a shareholders’ agreement specified expressly that the office of chief executive officer “shall <span class="font-italic">initially</span>” be held by the plaintiff. The shareholders’ agreement also expressly provided both for a right of appointment and a right of removal of the chief executive officer (at [149]). The defendants submit that <span class="font-italic">Ng Sing King</span> supports their position because cl 4.1.3.2 likewise provides that the persons named in that clause are to hold office as directors only upon completion, and makes no provision post-completion. The plaintiff’s response again turns the defendant’s argument on its head. He submits that <span class="font-italic">N</span><span class="font-italic">g Sing King</span> supports the plaintiff’s position because cl 4.1.3.2: (i) does not expressly provide that the persons named in the clause are the “initial” directors of the second defendant; and (ii) makes no provision as to how directors may be removed.

Once again, the plaintiff assumes that which he is attempting to prove. The plaintiff is indeed correct that the word “initially” is absent from cl 4.1.3.2. But the critical point is that cl 4.1.3.2, properly construed, is static. That is the effect of the introductory words of cl 4.1 read together with the introductory words of cl 4.1.3. Those introductory words taken together mean that the first defendant’s obligation to procure the second defendant to appoint the persons named in cl 4.1.3 to be directors of the second defendant was to be performed upon completion. The plaintiff’s second argument is that the absence of a clause in cl 4.1 specifying how directors can be removed means that directors cannot be removed so long as they remain shareholders. That amounts to using the process of construction to fill what is said to be a gap in cl 4.1 by supplying far too much positive content. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The final case that the defendants rely on is <span class="font-italic">Cosmic Insurance </span><span class="font-italic">Corp Ltd v Khoo Chiang Poh </span>[1979–1980] SLR(R) 703 (“<span class="font-italic">Cosmic Insurance</span>”). In that case, the contract provided that the director “shall be the managing director <span class="font-italic">for life </span>unless he resigns, dies or commits an offence under the Companies Act …” [emphasis added] (at [8]). The defendants argue that what is missing in cl 4.1.3.2 is this sort of express language extending the director’s right to hold office into the future. The plaintiff, in contrast, emphasises that the <span class="font-italic">absence </span>in cl 4.1.3.2 of any restriction on the duration of the plaintiff’s appointment and the <span class="font-italic">absence</span> of any procedure for the plaintiff’s removal both suggest that the parties intended his appointment to continue throughout the term of the Agreement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>so long as he remains a shareholder.

Indeed, the plaintiff submits that not only does cl 16.3 stipulate that the directorship right under cl 4.1.3.2 must prevail over Article 79, the clause obliges the parties jointly to amend Article 79 to remove the inconsistency.

It does not. The directorship right is simply unsupported by any reasonable interpretation of the language of cl 4.1.3.2 and by any reasonable construction of that clause in the context of the Agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 As a matter of interpretation, cl 4.1.3.2 takes effect upon completion. As a matter of construction, Recital C and cl 4.1.3.6 are of no assistance to the plaintiff in drawing the directorship right out of cl 4.1.3.2 as an express right. Clause 16.2 does not apply to cl 4.1.3.2 and cannot extend its temporal scope post-completion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 It is true that cl 4.1.3.2 is completely silent as to whether a director appointed under that clause upon completion is entitled to continue to hold office post-completion. It is also completely silent on how a director appointed under cl 4.1.3.2 may be removed. The plaintiff seeks to fill that silence by rewriting cl 4.1.3.2 through an open-ended process of contextual construction in order to confer the directorship right upon him. That stretches the contextual approach beyond its legitimate limits. If the Agreement is silent on these aspects, the contextual approach cannot assist the plaintiff. These aspects of the parties’ bargain fall to be governed by the second defendant’s corporate constitution.
