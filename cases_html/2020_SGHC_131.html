</div>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 I make the following observations:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) With respect, there appeared first of all to be a considerable amount of confusion in the defendants’ pleadings.  The best understanding I could glean from these pleadings was that insofar as it was asserted that D2 had sole beneficial ownership of the Property on a “common intention constructive trust”, this was also a proposition that the Property was a partnership asset.  In other words, insofar as D2 was concerned, the claim advanced on its behalf was that the Property was a partnership asset, either because it was held on a common intention constructive trust in D2’s favour, or because it was purchased with partnership funds.  In either instance, it would be the beneficial interest in the Property which D2 claimed – because a partnership, not being a separate legal entity, cannot hold in its name the legal title to partnership land, and such legal title would have to vest in the names of one or more of the partners and/or any other persons (in this case, in the names of the then partners Father and D1, as well as P1): <span class="font-italic">Chiam</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Hsien</span> at [121]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, insofar as D2 claimed that the Property was a partnership asset, strictly speaking it would be the partners of D2 who were (on the defendants’ case) collectively entitled to such partnership asset (<span class="font-italic">Chiam</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Hsien</span> at [116] and [123]).  In other words, if the Property was indeed a partnership asset, the beneficial interest in the Property would vest in the partners of D2 (Father and D1).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Third, if the Property was indeed a partnership asset, the nature of the partners’ beneficial interest would be as follows.  During the continuation of the partnership, Father and D1 would collectively have an undivided share in the Property, but once D2 was dissolved, Father and D1 would each be entitled to a proportionate share in the net proceeds of sale of the Property after D2’s liabilities were paid for (see <span class="font-italic">Cham Heng Hsien</span> at [116]–[117]). It follows that Father and D1 had no divided shares in the Property <span class="font-italic">in specie</span>. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Following from the above, if upon D2’s dissolution each partner would be entitled to a proportionate share in the net proceeds of the Property, Father’s share in these net proceeds – being personalty – would go to his estate (see <span class="font-italic">Chiam</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Hsien </span>at [125]). It should be noted that the doctrine of non-survivorship between partners applies in respect of their beneficial interests in the partnership assets, and that in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, there is a strong presumption against partnership assets accruing to the surviving partner(s) beneficially upon the death of one partner (see <span class="font-italic">Chiam</span><span class="font-italic"> Heng Hsien </span>at [119]). In other words, if the Property was indeed a partnership asset, then upon Father’s death and D2’s dissolution, there would be a strong presumption against Father’s share in the net proceeds of the Property accruing to D1; and this presumption would only be rebutted if there was an agreement to the contrary.  Such an agreement was never pleaded, nor did the defendants adduce any evidence to this effect. In the circumstances, if the Property was indeed a partnership asset, Father’s share in the net proceeds of the Property would go to his estate.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The legal framework </span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The general approach </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The general approach to be taken in considering claims for the recognition of beneficial interests in a property was laid down in <span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan v See Fong Mun </span>[2014] 3 SLR 1048 (“<span class="font-italic">Chan Yuen Lan</span>”) at [160]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In view of our discussion above, a property dispute involving parties who have contributed unequal amounts towards the purchase price of a property and who have not executed a declaration of trust as to how the beneficial interest in the property is to be apportioned can be <span class="font-italic">broadly</span> analysed using the following steps in relation to the available evidence:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) Is there sufficient evidence of the parties’ respective financial contributions to the purchase price of the property? If the answer is “yes”, it will be presumed that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the presumption of resulting trust arises). If the answer is “no”, it will be presumed that the parties hold the beneficial interest in the same manner as that in which the legal interest is held.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) Regardless of whether the answer to (a) is “yes” or “no”, is there sufficient evidence of an express or an inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in the property in a proportion which is different from that set out in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with that common intention instead, and not in the manner set out in (a). In this regard, the court may not impute a common intention to the parties where one did not in fact exist.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) If the answer to both (a) and (b) is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in the same manner as the manner in which they hold the legal interest.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) If the answer to (a) is “yes” but the answer to (b) is “no”, is there nevertheless sufficient evidence that the party who paid a larger part of the purchase price of the property (“X”) intended to benefit the other party (“Y”) with the entire amount which he or she paid? If the answer is “yes”, then X would be considered to have made a gift to Y of that larger sum and Y will be entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(e) If the answer to (d) is “no”, does the presumption of advancement nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust in (a)? If the answer is “yes”, then: (i) there will be no resulting trust on the facts where the property is registered in Y’s sole name (ie, Y will be entitled to the property absolutely); and (ii) the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property jointly where the property is registered in their joint names. If the answer is “no”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in the property in proportion to their respective contributions to the purchase price.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(f) Notwithstanding the situation at the time the property was acquired, is there sufficient and compelling evidence of a subsequent express or inferred common intention that the parties should hold the beneficial interest in a proportion which is different from that in which the beneficial interest was held at the time of acquisition of the property? If the answer is “yes”, the parties will hold the beneficial interest in accordance with the subsequent altered proportion.

Nor do I believe that Father’s decision to include D1 as a joint tenant had anything do to with UOFL’s perception of whom the Mortgage Loan was taken out for.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 I have earlier noted (at [26(b)]–[26(c)] above) that legally speaking, it is inaccurate to say that “<span class="font-italic">D2</span> is the beneficial owner of the Property”. A partnership has no separate legal personality – so when one speaks of D2 being beneficially interested in a property, one really means that the partners of D2 are beneficially interested in the property.  More accurately, one really means that the partners of D2 have a beneficial interest in the net proceeds of sale of the property upon dissolution. Nevertheless, I accept that it was factually possible for Father and P1 to have intended for <span class="font-italic">D2</span> to be the beneficial owner of the Property, without being cognisant of the legal nuances.  The point is that even if the defendants could prove the existence of the Defendants’ Agreement, any beneficial interest arising from the ensuing common intention constructive trust would not actually be in the form of beneficial ownership by D2 of the Property <span class="font-italic">in specie</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 To prove the existence of the Defendants’ Agreement, the defendants had to adduce sufficient and compelling evidence to that effect (see [33] above).

My reasons are as follows.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Father’s communications and conduct</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 From the outset, P1 has denied the existence of the Defendants’ Agreement; and the defendants have not been able to point to any evidence that P1 had intended for D2 to have sole beneficial ownership of the Property.  Quite apart from P1’s denial that he had entered into the Defendants’ Agreement with Father, the greatest difficulty with the defendants’ case is that insofar as Father is concerned, they have also been unable to point to any objective evidence which shows Father’s alleged intention for D2 to have sole beneficial ownership of Property.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 As stated in [35] above, the Property was always held in joint names up until Father’s death. Apart from having apparently contemplated at one point removing P1’s and D1’s names from the Property in 2005, Father took no step to effect any change in the ownership of the Property. Without more, no intention on Father’s part for D2 to have the Property can be divined.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Father’s communications to the defendants’ witnesses</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The defendants’ witnesses asserted that Father’s conduct and communications to them showed such an intention. These were bare assertions made without any corroborating evidence.

</div> This would be contrary to the defendants’ case about the alleged Defendants’ Agreement, since it is not disputed that P1 was never a partner of D2, and the Defendants’ Agreement was supposedly to give D2 sole beneficial ownership of the Property at all times, with P1 having no beneficial interest at all.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Father’s attempt to remove D1 as legal joint tenant of the Property</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 The defendant’s case is also contradicted by the evidence of Father’s attempt (though aborted) to remove P1 and D1 as legal joint tenants of the Property in 2005.

</div> Taking the defendants’ case at the highest and assuming that <span class="font-italic">all </span>of D2’s profits remained “money belonging to” D2 and were applied by Father towards discharging the Mortgage Loan, Father would still have paid at least $167,135 of his own money (being $570,800 - $326,865 - $76,800) towards discharging the loan. Indeed, I find it more probable that Father would have used considerably less than all $326,865 of D2’s profits – and considerably more than $167,135 of his own money.  This is because based on D1’s own evidence, part of the money D2 made would have gone towards paying D1 and his Wife their regular allowances. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 Given that a substantial amount of Father’s personal funds was applied towards the discharge of the Mortgage Loan, it seems to me most doubtful whether the presumption under s 21 Partnership Act is still applicable.  When property is financed by a partner’s personal funds, the inference is that the purchasing partner intended for the property to be his alone (see <span class="font-italic">Chua </span><span class="font-italic">Kwee Chen </span>at [72]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 Second, P1’s involvement in the acquisition of the Property also militates against the finding that the Property is D2’s partnership asset. If Father had intended for the Property to be a partnership asset, it was highly unlikely that he would have asked P1 – who was not a partner of D2 – to become a legal joint tenant of the Property. Likewise, it was highly unlikely – and in fact downright peculiar – that P1 would have forked out $76,800 of his own money to pay for a property that would belong solely to D2. I have already found that there was no objective evidence to show that the $76,800 was in the nature of a loan (see [64] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Third, if the Property was intended to be a partnership asset, it was anomalous that Father should have contemplated removing D1’s name, since D1 was a partner of D2. Logically, if Father had intended for the Property to be D2’s partnership asset, he would only ever have contemplated removing P1’s name.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Fourth, the Property was not listed as a partnership asset in D2’s balance sheets in 2012 and 2013.

</div> This would surely indicate that the Property was never intended to be a partnership asset. The defendants have argued that the exclusion of the Property from D2’s balance sheet was a neutral factor, claiming that the person who prepared these balance sheets had merely “mechanically carried forward information” from balance sheets from previous years, which did not list the Property as D2’s asset.

</div> I do not see how this argument helps the defendants. Even if D2’s balance sheets in 2012 and 2013 were merely “mechanically” prepared by “carrying forward information”, it remained the case that the Property was not listed as D2’s asset in the years preceding 2012. This again points to the conclusion that the Property was never intended to be a partnership asset (see <span class="font-italic">Kelly v Kelly </span>(1990) 92 ALR 74 at 80). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 Lastly, the defendants say that D2 appears to have been paying for the Property’s outgoings up until 2014.  However, I do not think this leads necessarily to the inference that such payments were made because “D2 is sole beneficial owner” of the Property.  It is equally possible that payments of these outgoings were made from D2’s coffers because it was enjoying the (otherwise gratuitous) use of the Property (see <span class="font-italic">N B Menon v Abdullah </span><span class="font-italic">Kutty </span>[1974] 2 MLJ 159 at 161).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In sum, for the reasons set out in [72] to [79], I do not accept that the Property was acquired with partnership funds, and I find that the Property is not a partnership asset.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">D1's claim to sole beneficial ownership</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 As an alternative to the claim that D2 has sole beneficial interest in the Property, the defendants also pleaded that D1 is the sole beneficial owner by virtue of the “presumption of advancement”.

</div>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 I find this claim clearly baseless.  In the first place, the reference to D1’s capacity as “the surviving partner of [D2]” in this context is puzzling.  The presumption of advancement, if it applies in this context, would operate between Father and D1 in their respective capacities as father and son.  D1’s position as a partner of D2 has nothing to do with the operation of the presumption of advancement.  In this connection, it should be remembered that P1 too was Father’s son; and no reason has been shown by the defendants why the presumption of advancement should operate only as between Father and D1 but not as between Father and P1.  Moreover, the defendants have not in any event managed to explain how Father would have been in a position  to make a gift to D1 of the <span class="font-italic">entire</span> beneficial ownership in the Property.  The defendants appear to ignore completely the fact that P1 contributed $76,800 towards the purchase of the Property – and P1 certainly never had any intention to make D1 a gift of his contribution.

I reiterate that there was no evidence to show that the $76,800 withdrawn by P1 was in the nature of a loan (see [64] above), and thus P1’s contributions cannot be seen as “bridging finance”.

</div> In the DCS, it was argued that Father’s 85.7% contributions were “funded by profits from [D2]’s provision shop business and/or Father’s monies in his capacity as a partner of [D2]”.

</div> Therefore, the defendants’ position seemed to be that Father’s contributions must be treated as D2’s, and accordingly only D2 was entitled to the 85.7% (as opposed to both D1 and D2). With respect, this again ignored basic principles of partnership law; in particular, that beneficial interest in the Property cannot vest in D2. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 However, this potential legal conundrum did not even need to be confronted, because there was simply no evidence anyway to support the contention that Father’s contributions must be treated as D2’s. First, there has been no evidence adduced before me to justify treating Father’s personal money as money spent in his capacity as partner of D2.  As such, Father’s personal money should be assumed to have been spent for his personal benefits (see [75] above).  Second, as noted earlier, there has been no evidence adduced anyway as to how much of D2’s profits were distributed to Father, and/or how much of D2’s profits were used to discharge the Mortgage Loan (see [72] above). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Accordingly, neither the plaintiffs’ case nor the defendants’ case in relation to the resulting trust analysis is sustainable. Based on the material presented, there was no evidence of an <span class="font-italic">overt agreement</span> between the parties as to how the Mortgage Loan was to be paid.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Clearly, the matter does not simply end there.  In one of their final prayers for relief, the plaintiffs have prayed in the alternative for a declaration “that [P1] (or… [P1] and the Father’s estate) and [D1] have beneficial interests in [the Property] in such proportion to be determined by [the Court]”

</div>.  At the end of the day, the court has, necessarily, to draw an inference as to the parties’ agreement, or failing that, intention as to how the Mortgage Loan was to be repaid (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon </span>at [153]).  In my view, the actual repayments made in this case can be said to be the manifestation of the parties’ intention as to the sources from which the Mortgage Loan was to be repaid and the extent to which each source would make payment (<span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon </span>at [160]).  As I noted earlier, case law has established that this process of inference is legitimate because subsequent conduct can be used to shed light on the parties’ intention at the time the Mortgage Loan was taken out (<span class="font-italic">Su</span><span class="font-italic"> Emmanuel </span>at [90]).  Based on the actual repayments made, the parties would have intended for Father to bear 85.7% of the mortgage liability, and P1 14.3%. Accordingly, on a purchase-price resulting trust analysis, it would seem that the Property should be held for Father, P1 and D1 as beneficial tenants-in-common in the ratio of 85.7:14.3:0.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 Again, however, this is not where the matter ends. In my view, since Father was the parent of P1 and D1, the presumption of advancement should apply so as to displace the presumption of resulting trust. The presumption of advancement means that Father is presumed to have intended his contributions to the acquisition of the Property to be a gift to his children – P1 and D1 – and that he did not intend to retain any interest in the Property (<span class="font-italic">Lau</span><span class="font-italic"> Siew Kim </span>at [56] and [62]). The presumption of advancement applies even in a relationship between a parent and an adult child (<span class="font-italic">Neo Hui Ling v An</span><span class="font-italic">g Ah Sew </span>[2012] 2 SLR 831 at [44]). There is nothing on the evidence to rebut this presumption.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I note that the presumption of advancement in this case applies two ways: as between Father and P1, and as between Father and D1. Applying the maxim “equality is equity”, it would be presumed that Father intended to benefit P1 and D1 equally. I note that although D1 was an adoptive son, the evidence shows that Father treated him as though he were a natural son and did not discriminate as between him and his natural sons.  Accordingly, Father’s contributions towards the acquisition of the Property will be apportioned to P1 and D1 in equal measures.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 As between P1 and D1, no presumption of advancement exists (see <span class="font-italic">Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Gek Yong v Chan Gek Lan </span>[2008] SGHC 167 at [17]).  In fact, insofar as his contributions to the acquisition of the Property are concerned, P1 is clear that he never intended to make a gift of his contributions to D1.  Accordingly, taking into account the equal apportionment between them of Father’s contributions to the Property, P1’s and D1’s contributions towards the acquisition of the Property would be in the ratio of (14.3 + 85.7/2):(85.7/2), or 57.15:42.85. The Property is thus held on a purchase price resulting trust with P1 and D1 as the beneficial tenants-in-common in the ratio of 57.15:42.85 between P1 and D1, respectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 For completeness, I note that D1 attempted to effect severance of the legal joint tenancy in the Property.
