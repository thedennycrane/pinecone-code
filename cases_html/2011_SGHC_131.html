<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Leave Application</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This was an application for leave under
                    O 53 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)
                    (“ROC”) to apply for:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">a Quashing Order against the decision of the
                            Singapore Medical Council (“SMC”) to appoint a

                            disciplinary proceedings relating to the purported overcharging of fees

                        fees.</div>
<p class="Judg-1">It should be noted that the Applicant has also applied, in the same
                    originating summons, for a Declaration that the Medical Registration (Amendment)
                    Regulations 2010 (S 528/2010) (“Amendment Regulations”) are
                    void.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The Court of Appeal in <em>Public
                        Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda</em> [2001] 1 SLR(R) 133
                    explained that the requirement of seeking the leave of court (at [23])
                    was:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… intended to be a means of filtering out groundless or hopeless
                        cases at an early stage, and its aim is to prevent a wasteful use of
                        judicial time and to protect public bodies from harassment (whether
                        intentional or otherwise) that might arise from a need to delay implementing
                        decisions, where the legality of such decisions is being challenged.
                        …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Leave is not granted unless the court is
                    satisfied that: (a) the matter complained of is susceptible to judicial review;
                    (b) the applicant has sufficient interest in the matter; and (c) the material
                    before the court discloses an arguable or <em>prima
                        facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the
                    public law remedies sought by the applicant. Additionally, as these orders are
                    discretionary remedies, the court has a discretion to refuse leave where the
                    circumstances warrant a refusal (see <em>Singapore Civil
                        Procedure 2007</em> (G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet &amp;
                    Maxwell Asia, 2007) at para 53/8/22).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       I noted the guidance provided by the Court of
                    Appeal in <em>Pang Chen Suan v Commissioner of Labour</em>
                    [2008] 3 SLR(R) 648 at [56]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We should like to add by way of guidance to judges who hear <em>ex-parte</em> applications for leave for judicial review
                        that the purpose of requiring leave is to enable the court to sieve out
                        frivolous applications. A case such as the present which clearly raises
                        issues which require more than a cursory examination of the merits should
                        have been heard as a substantive application. There is no reason why an
                            <em>ex-parte</em> application such as [the
                        applicant’s] could not have been heard <em>inter
                            partes</em> and disposed of on the merits as a substantive
                        application. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Both parties agreed that I could hear the leave application as well as
                    the substantive application in order to expedite the process and leave the
                    parties to file any appeal to the Court of Appeal thereafter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The only question before me at this leave stage
                    was whether the material before me disclosed an arguable or <em>prima facie</em> case in favour of granting the public remedies. I
                    noted what the Court of Appeal, in <em>Chan Hiang Leng Colin v
                        Minister for Information and the Arts</em> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 294,
                    had to say on the meaning and scope of the phrases ‘a <em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion’ and ‘what
                    might on further consideration turn out to be an arguable case’ (at
                    [22]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This passage appears susceptible to two slightly different
                        interpretations. One is that the court should quickly peruse the material
                        put before it and consider whether such material discloses “what
                        might on further consideration turn out to be an arguable case”. The
                        other is that the applicant had to make out a “<em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion”. In our
                        view, both tests present a very low threshold and it is questionable whether
                        there is really any difference in substance between the two
                        interpretations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Court of Appeal (at [25]) then ruled that what is required is not
                    a <em>prima facie</em> case, but a <em>prima
                        facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion (see also <em>Teng Fuh Holdings Pte Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue</em> [2007]
                    2 SLR(R) 568).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       That the decisions of the SMC, a creature of
                    statute engaged in the performance of public acts and duties, are susceptible to
                    judicial review and that the Applicant has sufficient interest in the matter
                    were not disputed. Accordingly, it was only necessary to consider if the
                    material before me raised a <em>prima facie</em> case of
                    reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the public law remedies
                    sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The Applicant averred that the decision of the
                    SMC in appointing the 2nd DC was illegal, irrational and procedurally
                    improper (see <em>Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for
                        the Civil Service</em> [1985] AC 374 at 411 <em>per</em> Lord Diplock, approved in <em>Chng Suan
                        Tze v Minister of Home Affairs, Singapore</em> [1988]
                    2 SLR(R) 525). I will elaborate on each ground for judicial review
                    before considering if the material placed before me met the low threshold of a
                        <em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion in
                    favour of granting the public law remedies sought.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       At the outset, it should be clarified that the
                    events in relation to this application are governed by the Medical Registration
                    Act (Cap 174, 2004 Rev Ed) (the “MRA”), excluding, for the
                    most part, the amendments enacted by the Medical Registration (Amendment) Act
                    (Act 1 of 2010).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Illegality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The Applicant averred that the SMC erred in law
                    as it did not appoint the 2nd DC in accordance with s 41(3) of the
                    MRA. Further, the SMC acted illegally in excess of its jurisdiction under the
                    MRA when it considered itself bound by the terms of s 41(3) of the MRA and
                    appointed the 2nd DC irrespective of the merits of doing so. She averred
                    that the SMC wrongly fettered its discretion over whether to appoint another
                    disciplinary committee (“DC”) by concluding that it had no
                    discretion over the matter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     The Applicant averred that under s 38(1)
                    of the MRA, the SMC must establish a Complaints Panel from which the Chairman of
                    the Complaints Panel may appoint the Complaints Committees (“CC”)
                    and the SMC may appoint DCs. She argued that it follows from this that there is
                    no obligation on either the Chairman of the Complaints Panel or the SMC to
                    establish particular CCs or DCs. They each possess discretion. In this case, she
                    argued that the SMC upon receiving the complaint must exercise its discretion in
                    determining whether the complaint in question is a complaint involving an
                    allegation of professional misconduct or conduct bringing the profession into
                    disrepute such as to bring it within s 39(1) of the MRA. Only after so
                    determining, may the SMC refer the complaint to the Chairman of the Complaints
                    Panel. It is further argued that where the CC orders a formal inquiry to be
                    held, s 41(3) of the MRA required that the SMC shall immediately appoint a
                    DC which shall hear and investigate the complaint. It is argued that there is no
                    power for the SMC to appoint more than one DC in respect of a single order of
                    the CC. Thus, as the CC had determined that it was necessary for a formal
                    inquiry by a DC on or before 17 November 2008, and in light of s 41
                    which requires the SMC to act in respect of the order of the CC within a three
                    month window, “it is far from clear that such necessity prevailed in
                    September 2010 given the differential evidential basis post the 1st DC
                    proceedings”. In short, it is argued that the SMC was obliged in law to
                    refer the complaint afresh to another CC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Irrationality</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The Applicant argued that this court should
                    determine the question of whether it would be <em>Wednesbury</em> irrational for either the SMC, a fresh CC or a DC to
                    conclude that the complaint and charges amounted to allegations of professional
                    misconduct within s 39(1) of the MRA where there was a patient agreement on
                    the fees and there had been no operative prescribed schedule of fees. It was
                    argued that if the correct procedure of referring the complaint afresh to a CC
                    had been made, such CC would have resolved pursuant to s 41(1)(a) of the
                    MRA that no formal inquiry was necessary. This argument is being run in order to
                    avoid such CC ordering a formal inquiry and the appointment of a fresh DC. It is
                    argued that the court should so rule in order that the CC would be guided that
                    it should confine its decision to either the issue of a letter of advice, the
                    issue of a warning or a dismissal of the complaint. The CC should not proceed to
                    order a formal inquiry by a DC, because that would in the circumstances be
                        <em>Wednesbury</em> irrational, and would avoid yet
                    another round of challenge before the courts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Procedural Impropriety or Fairness / Natural Justice</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The Applicant averred that there existed bias
                    or a reasonable suspicion of bias such that the SMC’s decision to appoint
                    the 2nd DC ought to be quashed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     On the issue of procedural impropriety or
                    fairness / natural justice, the Applicant referred, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, to the role and participation of the Director of Medical
                    Services of the Ministry of Health who is, by virtue of s 18 of the MRA,
                    the Registrar of the SMC, in (i) the SMC’s decision to refer the complaint
                    to the Chairman of the Complaints Panel, (ii) in the appointment and
                    constitution of the 1st DC and (iii) the subsequent constituting of the
                    2nd DC. Given these multiple roles, and in the light of his prior role in
                    the genesis of this complaint and charges, it is submitted that he has a
                    conflict of interests and there is bias or a reasonable apprehension of bias on
                    the part of the SMC.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Whether the material before me raised a <em>prima
                    facie</em> case of reasonable suspicion in favour of the public law
                remedies sought</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Based on what was presented and submitted to
                    me for the purposes of the leave application, without making any decision
                    relating to the substantive legal issues and certainly without making any
                    comments relating to the merits of each party’s position in the underlying
                    professional disciplinary proceedings, I decided to grant leave for a
                    substantive judicial review hearing as I was of the view that the low threshold
                    of an arguable or a <em>prima facie</em> case of reasonable
                    suspicion in favour of the public law remedies sought had been made out by the
                    Applicant.</p>

                    statement in support, as prescribed by O 53, r 1(3) of the ROC,
                    appeared before me and disclosed that the Attorney-General, Mr Sundaresh
                    Menon, had advised and represented the Applicant as her private legal counsel in
                    connection with the proceedings before the disciplinary committees. Since then,
                    Mr Menon has been appointed Attorney-General, and he has, in the light of

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The Attorney’s counsel then applied for
                    the AGC to intervene as a party to represent the Ministry of Health, Singapore
                    (“MOHS”) for the following purposes: (a) on the construction and
                    history of reg 42 of the Amendment Regulations; (b) the construction of the
                    MRA provisions; and (c) to put on record the circumstances why MOHS was duty
                    bound to refer the complaint to the SMC in the light of the Applicant’s
                    submissions as to bias.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The Applicant had submitted that reg 42
                    and the Amendment Regulations were contrary to natural justice and were directed
                    at her. I was of the view that the AGC would be able to assist the court in the
                    legislative history and timing of reg 42 and the Amendment Regulations.
                    However, recognising that this is a judicial review hearing based entirely on
                    the record, whilst the MOHS may have an interest in these proceedings, I did not
                    see any public interest arising from the construction of the MRA and its policy
                    and purposes to support allowing the AGC to intervene in these proceedings on
                    behalf of MOHS on the construction of the MRA. The courts regularly construe
                    legislation and Parliament’s intention without the further need for the
                    AGC to intervene as a party to the proceedings on behalf of the relevant
                    department or ministry in cases where that department or ministry is not a party
                    to the court proceedings. With respect to the Applicant’s submissions on
                    bias, in this judicial review hearing on the record, the court makes no factual
                    findings or determinations on the underlying substance or merits. The limited
                    scope of these proceedings is whether there had been illegality in the process,
                        <em>Wednesbury</em> irrationality or procedural
                    impropriety / a natural justice breach.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Therefore, I did not fully grant the
                    AGC’s application to intervene as a party in the substantive judicial
                    review hearing. I granted only its application to intervene in the substantive
                    judicial review hearing in respect of the Applicant’s application to
                    declare that reg 42 and the Amendment Regulations are void.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     I gave leave to the Applicant to apply for the
                    remedies described above (see <a href="#p1_1">[1]</a>). I ordered
                    that the costs of this application were to be costs in the cause.</p>
