The first judgment followed from an eight days’ trial to determine liability that took place before this court in July 2019 (“the first trial”).

The acquisition was completed on 26 March 2014. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 Ong appealed against the first judgment. In Civil Appeal No 78 of 2020 (“the Appeal”), the Court of Appeal partially allowed Ong’s appeal and varied the first judgment. It held that Ong was only liable for breach of what it termed the Land Warranty under the SA, namely that Borneo’s subsidiary Sutera Harbour Golf &amp; Country Club (“SHGCC”) was the sole legal and beneficial owner of 236.18 acres (or 95.58 hectares) of land in Sembulan (“the Sembulan Land”) including a portion measuring 1.459 acres (“the Subject Land”) when it was not. Ong had sold the Subject Land to one of his companies Omega Brilliance Sdn Bhd (“OBSB”) for RM1,000 consideration without the knowledge of Borneo. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 The Court of Appeal disallowed the injunction that this court had granted restraining Ong from transferring the land to OBSB and held at [80] that damages would be an adequate remedy for Ong’s breach of the Land Warranty.

This would have been the amount that would have been deducted from the acquisition price if GSH had been properly apprised of the fact that the Subject Land was not part of the deal. The award of damages should also have regard to any tax liability incurred by SHGCC on account of the S&amp;P, and any tax penalties that SHGCC would be required to pay due to the S&amp;P. Based on the figure so arrived at, Ong should only pay to Borneo Ventures 77.5% of the same, as under the SA, Borneo Ventures only acquired 77.5% of the shares of SH Group and the remaining still belong to Ong. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 This court was tasked with assessing damages due to Borneo based on the above extract from the CA judgment.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The assessment </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 There were four witnesses for the assessment.

</div> and realised that in the subdivision of the whole piece of land, the Subject Land  was to be an individual lot without being subject to the restrictions that it may only be transferred to Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd (“SESB”) or surrendered to the Sabah State government.

However, that did not mean that the change of use in October 2014 was cast in stone and could not be changed subsequently.

The physical assets not only included buildings, plant and machinery in the Sutera Harbour Resort, but also land. As a developer, GSH would look at the redevelopment potential of land it acquires and add value to it to earn a return. Clearly, whatever GSH buys must have development potential.

No valuation was provided for “Mixed Use”.

</div> prepared by the Town and Regional Planning Department. He ascertained therefrom that in or around 2010, the Subject Land was zoned for “Mixed Use” (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, tourism, resort, retail, commercial, residential). The KK Draft Plan was released for public consultation from 26 September to 16 December 2011. Although to-date it has not been gazetted. Wong said it has nonetheless been used as the basis for planning decisions under the interim planning powers provided under the Sabah Town and Planning Ordinance.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 Wong opined that conversion of the Subject Land from Industrial to “Mixed Use” is almost certain since the co-gen station ceased operations in 2014. The authorities are unlikely to permit industrial use of the Subject Land in the city centre in order to avoid issues such as noise, smell and traffic. It was also part of the Sembulan land and Sutera Harbour site that is zoned for tourist complex use. Even if a piece of land is zoned for a specific purpose such as industrial, Wong was of the view that rezoning would be reasonably attainable. He cited examples of properties that had been rezoned from industrial to mixed/commercial use in KK’s CBD. He added that since a premium had already been paid for approval of the SH Resort site for commercial use (under tourism), no additional premium would be levied for the Subject Land.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Wong’s report contained five comparable transactions that were used in arriving at Wong’s valuation (referred to respectively as “Wong’s Comparable No 1–5”), and these are as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Wong’s Comparable No 1 is a town lease for hotel use in an area dominated by old shophouses and warehouse and is located in a fringe area of the city area in a standalone position with poor connectivity to the city area. The transaction for the vacant land zoned for commercial city centre at RM9,810,788, or RM225 per sq ft, took place on 11 July 2014; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Wong’s Comparable No 2 is also a town lease and is a piece of vacant land in an old shophouse precinct where a number of shophouses have been converted to budget hotels. Its road frontage is a six-lane carriageway in the city centre. Planning proposal for a hotel was submitted after the transaction and its zoning is also commercial city centre. It was transacted at RM21,912,000, or RM550 per sq ft, on 8 July 2014;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Wong’s Comparable No 3 is a town lease located in the city centre’s Central Business District fronting and across a four-lane road. It is zoned for commercial city centre with commercial use and was transacted on 20 January 2014 at RM83m, or RM792 per sq ft; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Wong’s Comparable No 4 is a plot of vacant land with a country lease located at the south end of the city centre and is diagonally across and on the opposite side of Jalan Coastal from the Subject Land. Jalan Coastal is the main thoroughfare leading into and out of the city centre, at the south end. Hence, the plot of land enjoys prime advertising frontage. Its locality is dominated by shopping malls, offices and hotels which are a short drive away. However, the remnants of the Sembulan water village which is in a squalid state is at its rear. It is zoned for commercial city centre and was transacted on 28 August 2018 at RM10,713,129 or RM420 per sf ft; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Wong’s Comparable No 5 is an old bungalow with a country lease situated next to the Kota Kinabalu Golf Club in Tanjong Aru in a tourism belt and is a stone’s throw away from the Yacht Club and the five-star Shangri-La Resort. It fronts Jalan Aru. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In cross-examination, Wong was questioned on the definition of market value set out under clause 1.3.1 of the 2011 MVS. The clause states:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-italic">Market value</span> is defined for the purpose of these Standards as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Market value is the estimated amount for which a property should be exchange (sic) on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 Wong was also taken to para E

Despite Ong’s repeated denials, the court accepts as valid Ms Teh’s surmise that either Ong or his lawyers must, in the interval between 28 January and 1 October 2014, have spoken to the addressee of the 28 January letter to ask for the restriction to be removed and it was. Removal of the restriction on transfer of the Subject Land only to SESB was crucial as it meant that the plot could be transferred to any party for good consideration or, it could be redeveloped by the owner for any commercial “Mixed Use” purpose, subject to change of use.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 Ong had admitted

Questioned further by the court, he added that his July 2019 answer was hence qualified. He then changed his testimony from “I really don’t know” to “We would get the approval but I don’t know what condition they are going to put on”.

For the same illogical reason, Ong claimed it was not necessary for change of use to be effected for the Subject Land. His further testimony that the Subject Land “is very strategic for power plant” rings hollow against his own admission that the plant is no longer in operation since April 2015, regardless of whether it is on standby (indefinitely) according to him or dormant/defunct according to Borneo.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 The undisputed evidence before the court shows clearly that the Co-Gen Plant on the Subject Land is no longer in use and will not be revived in the future to generate electricity because that purpose is now academic since SESB generates enough electricity for the whole of KK including the SH Resort.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The court moves next to consider the evidence of Ms Yen, Ong’s expert.  Her valuation could not be more different from Wong’s. She valued the Subject Land at RM3.4m (“Ms Yen’s valuation”) as at 26 March 2014 as well as at 30 December 2013, a far cry from Wong’s figure of RM35m. The date 30 December 2013 was the date of the SA. Ms Yen’s valuation was roundly criticised by Borneo in its closing submissions. The court will return to those criticisms in the later part of this judgment.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 Ms Yen is from VPC Alliance (Sabah) Sdn Bhd (“Alliance”) and according to her letter dated 20 July 2021 addressed to Ong (which was attached to her AEIC), her brief from him was “to exclude the Co-Gen Plant and other improvements on the site and to assess the subject property as vacant land”. Like Wong, Ms Yen’s valuation was based on the 2011 MVS. Ms Yen inspected the Subject Land on 21 June 2021 for purposes of her valuation exercise. During her site inspection

She used the comparison method approach by considering three transactions as guidelines. Two of the three transactions were zoned for general industrial use and the third, although described by Ms Yen as being zoned for industrial use, was actually zoned for agricultural use.  Ms Yen considered the three comparables to be appropriate as they had similar land use to the Subject Land which was intended for industrial use

The Letter of Offer dated 1 October 2014 from LSDS requested payment from SGHCC of an annual rent of RM31,800 for the use of the land as Industrial Co-Gen Plant. Since the usage of the Subject Land remained unchanged, there was no amendment of change of use. What did change was that the restriction on transfer and sublease of the title only to SESB was removed from the 1 October 2014 letter.

Both counsel and the court pointed out to Ms Yen (who disagreed) that LSDS is in charge of change of use, not zoning. There was no rational basis for her to rely on a letter which did not deal with zoning but reduced the quantum of annual rent in its original offer letter dated 27 July 2007 listed at [69(b)].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 Borneo had taken, via Google Street View, a photograph of the road leading to the entrance to Ms Yen’s Comparable No 3 in October 2014

In this regard, the court rejects as unjustified, Ong’s criticisms of Wong’s testimony and valuation set out at [120] to [124] above or that he was biased merely because his firm Azmi &amp; Co had carried out valuations for SHGCC and or its associated companies which Wong disclosed in his curriculum vitae attached to his valuation
