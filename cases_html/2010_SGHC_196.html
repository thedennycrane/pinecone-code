        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The three accused persons, Azman bin Mohamed
                    Sanwan “Azman”), Tamil Salvem (“Tamil”, who is also
                    known as “Rocky”) and Balasubramaniam s/o Murugesan
                    (“Bala”), were prosecuted before me on a charge that they:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">on the 28<sup>th</sup> day of April 2007 at or about 8.20
                        a.m., at the carpark in front of Block 108 Yishun Ring Road, Singapore, in
                        furtherance of the common intention of the three of [them], did traffic in a
                        controlled drug specified as a Class “A” Controlled Drug
                        listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185), to
                        wit, by having in [their] possession for the purpose of trafficking, 1525.7
                        grams of cannabis, in motor vehicle bearing the registration number SGT
                        809 X, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations
                        made thereunder, and [they] have thereby committed an offence under section
                        5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, read with section
                        34 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, and punishable under section 33 of the
                        Misuse of Drugs Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       By the consent of all parties, there was a joint
                    trial of the accused persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Some of the facts of the events leading to the
                    arrest of the accused persons were not in dispute. On 27 April 2007, the
                    first and second accused Azman and Tamil drove into Johor in a blue Mitsubishi
                    Lancer motor car SGT 809 X which Azman had rented for his daily
                    use.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The third accused Bala also went to Johor Baru
                    on that day. He went in another car, a black Honda Civic SCQ 143 X with
                    Sundrammurthy s/o Vellasammy, (“Sundram” who is also known as
                    “Murthy”), Kumaranathan s/o Silvasamy (“Kumar”), and
                    Sundram’s brother, Kumaran s/o Vellasamy
                (“Kumaran”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The six of them had arranged to make that trip.
                    Tamil had asked Sundram to fetch Bala and Kumar for drinks and karaoke, and
                    Sundram brought his brother Kumaran along. Tamil also told Sundram and Kumar
                    that he will be going with Azman, who had some business to settle
                there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       When Azman and Tamil entered Johor Baru in SGT
                    809 X, they did not proceed immediately for drinks and karaoke. They went
                    to several places, met several persons, and picked up a Malay couple before they
                    went to the carpark of the karaoke lounge and met up with Bala, Sundram, Kumar
                    and Kumaran. Sundram’s evidence was that Azman took the key of
                    SCQ 143 X from him and drove off in SGT 809 X with the Malay
                    couple, and this was corroborated by Kumaran.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The remaining five of them then went into the
                    karaoke lounge. Sundram and Kumaran remembered that Azman joined them about an
                    hour later, and Kumar recalled that Azman joined them after some time.
                    Tamil’s evidence was that Azman went to the karaoke lounge about fifteen
                    minutes to half an hour later, whereas Bala had no clear recollection of his
                    arrival. Azman, however, denied that he had taken the key of
                    SCQ 143 X, or that he went to the karaoke lounge after the
                    others.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       The six of them were at the karaoke lounge until
                    the next morning. Before they left, Azman paid the bill for their entertainment,
                    and returned the key of SCQ 143 X to Sundram, and the three accused
                    persons left in SGT 809 X while the other three of them left in
                    SCQ 143 X.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       The two cars were driven from Johor Baru back to
                    Singapore with Azman driving SGT 809 X and Sundram driving
                    SCQ 143 X. When they were in Singapore, Azman called Sundram’s
                    mobile phone and spoke with Kumaran. Azman directed them to drive SCQ 143 X
                    to Tamil’s house in Yishun Ring Road because Tamil and Bala wanted the car
                    urgently. Although Sundram had intended to drive SCQ 143 X to his home in
                    Bishan, he drove to the carpark of Block 108, Yishun Ring Road (“the
                    Yishun carpark”). Sundram, Kumaran and Kumar met Tamil there and handed
                    the key of the car to him. While they were walking towards the main road to
                    catch a taxi to continue on their way, Azman came in SGT 809 X and offered
                    to take them to the main road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Bala was also in Azman’s car, as Azman
                    was going to send him to his girlfriend’s home. When Sundram, Kumaran and
                    Kumar were dropped off at the main road, Azman drove SGT 809 X back to the
                    Yishun carpark with Bala. It was on their return at about 8.05am that the events
                    unfolded which lead to the arrest of the three accused persons at about
                    8.20am.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Events at the carpark</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     Unbeknownst to the accused persons, officers
                    of the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) were mounting an operation
                    on Azman and his car and had kept SGT 809 X and SCQ 143 X under
                    surveillance from the time they re-entered Singapore in the morning of
                    28 April 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The officers kept observation individually.
                    The observations and evidence of some of them were of particular relevance and
                    significance to the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Staff Sergeant Tan Ang Kiat (“SSgt
                Tan”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     SSgt Tan saw SGT 809 X return to the
                    carpark. He observed the three accused persons at SCQ 143 X. Azman was
                    revving the car’s engine (i.e. to raise the running speed of the engine),
                    Bala was standing at the back of the car and Tamil was standing at its side.
                    SSgt Tan then heard over his radio set that Azman drove SCQ 143 X next to
                    SGT 809 X. At this stage, SSgt Tan saw Azman carrying an umbrella standing
                    near the side of SCQ 143 X. Azman was revving the engine of the car again,
                    and Bala and Tamil were at the rear of the car. SSgt Tan then heard that
                    Azman had taken a paper bag from the back of SGT 809 X and placed it
                    near to the rear of SCQ 143 X. Shortly after that, he saw Azman place a
                    blue paper bag into the boot of SGT 809 X and close both its boot and the
                    boot of SCQ 143 X. Azman then hugged the other two accused persons in
                    turn before he entered SGT 809 X. Upon receiving instructions, SSgt
                    Tan moved in and arrested Tamil.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Staff Sergeant Michael Seet (“SSgt
                Seet”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     SSgt Seet saw SGT 809 X return to the
                    carpark. Azman went out of that car and went into SCQ 143 X, then drove and
                    parked it next to SGT 809 X. He then saw Azman revving the engine of SCQ
                    143 X whilst carrying an umbrella. When Azman did that, smoke was seen
                    emitting from the exhaust pipe. Then Azman, Bala and Tamil went to the rear of
                    SCQ 143 X and they were observed to be meddling with the boot and bumper of
                    the car. After that, Azman went to SGT 809 X, opened the boot of the
                    car, took out a blue paper bag and placed it inside the boot of SCQ 143 X.
                    Then, SSgt Seet saw Tamil try to pry open the bumper of SCQ 143 X while
                    Bala bent down and took a big black bundle from beneath the bumper and placed it
                    in the blue paper bag in SCQ 143 X. Azman then took the paper bag from SCQ
                    143 X, brought it to SGT 809 X, and closed the boot of both cars.
                    Azman then hugged the other two accused persons, one after the
                other.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Sergeant Peter Loong Tean Huat (“Sgt
                Loong”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Sgt Loong saw the three accused persons
                    standing behind the two cars. He then saw Azman open the boots of the cars.
                    Azman then went to the driver’s side of SGT 809 X, took out an
                    umbrella, opened it, went to SCQ 143 X, and revved the engine. After doing
                    that, Azman went to the rear of SCQ 143 X and joined Bala and Tamil. At
                    that time, Bala was squatting down. After a while, Azman went back to
                    SCQ 143 X, revved the engine once more before going back to the rear
                    of the car again and squatting there with Bala. Azman then stood up, handed the
                    umbrella to Tamil, walked to SGT 809 X, took a blue paper bag from the
                    boot, brought it to the rear of SCQ 143 X and remained there with Bala and
                    Tamil. A while later, all three of them stood up and Azman carried a blue paper
                    bag he had taken to SCQ 143 X, brought it back to SGT 809 X and
                    closed the boot. Then he collected the umbrella from Tamil, and kept it in
                    SGT 809 X. After that Azman closed the boot of SCQ 143 X, hugged
                    the other two accused persons in turn, and went into SGT 809 X. At
                    that point, the three of them were arrested.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Station Inspector Yon Boon Ngiap (“SI
                Yon”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     SI Yon saw the two cars parked side by side,
                    and when Azman revved the engine of SCQ 143 X, SI Yon saw smoke emitting
                    from its exhaust pipe. Azman then went to the back of the car with Bala and
                    Tamil where they appeared to SI Yon to be “meddling” (in SI
                    Yon’s words) with the boot and the bumper. They then stood up and Azman
                    went to SGT 809 X, opened the boot, took a blue paper bag and placed it in
                    the opened boot of SCQ 143 X. The three of them bent their backs and
                    resumed meddling with the bumper of the car. Azman then stood up, took a blue
                    paper bag from SCQ 143 X, brought it to SGT 809 X, and closed the
                    boots of both cars. Azman then hugged Bala and Tamil, one at a
                time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Evidence of Sergeant Loh Teck Seng (“Sgt
                Loh”)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     When Sgt Loh arrived at the carpark, SGT
                    809 X and SCQ 143 X were already there, parked side by side with their
                    boots open. Bala and Tamil were squatting behind SCQ 143 X, Tamil was
                    pulling the car’s bumper and Bala was looking underneath the car, and
                    Azman was squatting behind them holding an umbrella. Then all three stood up,
                    and Azman went to the driver’s seat of SCQ 143 X and stepped on
                    the accelerator. After that, he went to the boot of SGT 809 X, took a
                    blue paper bag, brought it to SCQ 143 X and placed it in the boot.
                    Then he went to the driver’s seat of SCQ 143 X again, and pressed on
                    the accelerator again, after which he went to the back of that car, and joined
                    Bala and Tamil, and the three of them were squatting down. Sgt Loh explained
                    that he knew Azman had stepped on the accelerator because he heard the engine
                    rev up, and he saw smoke come out of the exhaust pipe. Sgt Loh then saw Bala
                    stretch his hand under the car and retrieve something which looked like a dark
                    bundle which he put in the paper bag in the boot of SCQ 143 X. When Bala
                    made the retrieval from beneath the car, Tamil was pulling the bumper. Sgt Loh
                    then saw Azman take a paper bag similar to the one he saw before from the boot
                    of SCQ 143 X, place the bag inside the boot of SGT 809 X, and
                    then close the boots of both cars. At that point, Azman was not holding the
                    umbrella.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     The evidence of the surveillance officers did
                    not make a seamless narration of the activities at the carpark. There were gaps
                    in the individual accounts, and inconsistencies between the different accounts.
                    On a review of all the evidence, these shortcomings are explicable and
                    acceptable. The officers were not keeping continuous observation from fixed
                    spots, but moved about during that time; the subjects were out of view whilst
                    they went to new positions; and the accounts were from observations made from
                    different positions and times. The officers had made records of their
                    observations. Some of the records which were produced at the request of counsel
                    corroborated their evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     When trained law enforcement officers are
                    instructed to keep surveillance during an operation, and to keep notes of their
                    observations, their observations are not casual or accidental. Due weight should
                    be given to their evidence unless there is reason to doubt their integrity or
                    competence. After listening to the officers’ evidence, I find that they
                    were recounting in good faith what they saw and remembered, and were forthcoming
                    in accepting that there were aspects of the events that they did not take note
                    of or could not recall. I am unable to agree with counsel’s accusation
                    that they had fabricated evidence against the accused persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Events following the arrest</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     After the three accused persons were arrested,
                    the boot of SGT 809 X was opened, and a blue paper bag was found there.
                    There were two wrapped bundles inside the bag, one being bigger than the other.
                    The accused persons were kept at the carpark and the exhibits were preserved
                    until the arrival of another team of CNB officers from the Special Task Force.
                    This team of officers then took over custody of the three persons and the
                    exhibits. On the instruction of the leader of the party, Station Inspection Ngo
                    Hing Wong (“SI Ngo”), the three accused persons and the two
                    cars were brought to the carpark of Yishun Stadium (“the Yishun Stadium
                    carpark”) for further investigations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     At the Yishun Stadium carpark, SI Ngo recorded
                    two statements from Azman. Mr Sudheesan, counsel for Azman, objected to the
                    admission of these statements on the ground that they were not recorded in
                    compliance with s 121(2) and s 121(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code
                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     The marginal notes to s 121 state
                    “Examination of witnesses by police”. However, this provision
                    applies to CNB officers through s 32 of the Misuse of Drugs Act
                    (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). Section 32(1)
                    provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In any case relating to the commission of an offence under this Act, an
                        officer of the Bureau shall have all the powers of a police officer under
                        the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) in relation to an investigation into a
                        seizable offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">When CNB officers are given the powers conferred on police officers by
                    the CPC, those powers are to be exercised in compliance with the empowering
                    provisions of the CPC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Section 121 of the CPC provides
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1) A police officer making a police investigation under this Chapter may
                        examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and
                        circumstances of the case and shall reduce into writing any statement made
                        by the person so examined.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) Such person shall be bound to state truly the facts and circumstances
                        with which he is acquainted concerning the case except only that he may
                        decline to make with regard to any fact or circumstance a statement which
                        would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or
                        forfeiture.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3) A statement made by any person under this section shall be read over
                        to him and shall, after correction if necessary, be signed by him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The first complaint was that SI Ngo did
                    not inform Azman that under s 121(2), he may decline to make any statement
                    that would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or
                    forfeiture. The second complaint was that the two statements were not read over
                    to Azman as required by s 121(3). The prosecution accepted that SI Ngo
                    had not advised Azman of his rights under s 121(2), but contended that
                    SI Ngo had read the statements over to Azman before he signed
                them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Both issues have been considered and
                    determined by the Court of Appeal. In <em>Public Prosecutor v
                        Mazlan bin Maidun and another</em> [1992] 3 SLR(R) 968, the
                    Court ruled in [37(a)] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a suspect or an accused need not be expressly informed of a right to
                        remain silent whenever any statement is recorded from him pursuant to s
                        121(2) of the CPC;</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     In <em>Vasavan Sathiadew &amp;
                        2 Ors v Public Prosecutor</em> [1992] SGCA 26, the Court
                    stated that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… a non-compliance with s 121 of the [CPC] does not render the
                        statement inadmissible under s 122(5) of the[CPC]. It affects the
                        weight to be given to such statement in that it may give rise to questions
                        whether such statement was in fact made, and if it had been made why it was
                        not signed by the accused as required under s 121(3).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… a non-compliance with s 121(3) does not result in the
                        statement being inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In <em>Panya Martmontree and others v Public
                        Prosecutor</em> [1995] 2 SLR(R) 806 it was held at [6] that
                    a statement that was neither read back nor signed was admissible in
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Counsel accepted that the decisions of the
                    Court of Appeal on the separate non-compliances bind me, but argued that the
                    effect of the cumulative non-compliance of s 121(2) and s 121(3) is
                    still an open question. I was not persuaded by the logic of the submission. In
                    the cases referred to, the Court of Appeal had held that each deficiency may
                    affect the weight to be accorded to the contents of the statement, but not its
                    admissibility. It is inconsistent with the reasoning of the Court’s
                    rulings to conclude that where there are two failures of compliance in the
                    recording of a statement, the admissibility of the statement rather than its
                    weight is affected.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     SI Ngo gave evidence that he recorded the
                    first statement from Azman in a CNB vehicle at the Yishun Stadium carpark at
                    about 9.25am. He commenced by asking Azman if he could speak English. When Azman
                    confirmed that he could speak English, SI Ngo commenced recording
                    Azman’s statement in English in his pocket book. He recorded his questions
                    and Azman’s replies in his pocket book. After the statement was recorded,
                    he read the questions and answers back to Azman and asked him if he wished to
                    make any amendments or alterations, but Azman declined. Then Azman signed on
                    each page of the pocket book on which his statement was recorded and wrote down
                    his identity card number on the statement beside his signatures. SI Ngo
                    made some corrections to the statement in the course of recording, and Azman
                    also signed against those corrections. The whole recording process took about
                    half an hour.</p>

                    examined at the Narcotics Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The cautioned statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Adam Tan, an officer of the CNB (but who had
                    left the Bureau by the time of the trial), was appointed as the investigation
                    officer. On 28 April 2007, he recorded cautioned statements from each of the
                    accused persons on similar charges of trafficking in 2091.5g of cannabis i.e.
                    the weight of the two blocks of vegetable matter before analysis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     These cautioned statements were admitted in
                    evidence without objection. In their cautioned statements, Azman stated:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">and Bala stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is true that I went to JB. I went there and enjoy in a pub. I went
                        there in a black colour car. After enjoying in the pub, I came back in a
                        green and blue colour car. When we came to Singapore, the customs checked
                        the car thoroughly. After that we went to Yishun to drop Tamil Salvem. The
                        car was parked besides his block. Tamil, Azman and I went to buy cigarettes.
                        On the way to buy the cigarettes, we walked pass the front of the car. At
                        this point of time, the officers came and we were handcuffed. We did not
                        know why. I was short of sleep and I also have to go to work at 10 am. The
                        officers asked the three of us whose car is the black car and whose car is
                        the black coloured car was. Then the officers opened the boot of the green
                        and blue car and found the paper bag with the things inside. I do not know
                        what the thing was. The officers asked the three of us what this is. I told
                        the officers I got inside the green and blue car outside the pub in Johor
                        and only alighted in Yishun. I was asleep in the car and it was at Woodlands
                        Checkpoint I was awaken by my friend, the driver, Azman. After this, I
                        continued to sleep again until Yishun. I was tired and short of sleep. The
                        customs people checked and they could have found the bag. How is it that it
                        was only found at Yishun. After that I was arrested. That is
                            all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Azman’s disputed statements</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Adam Tan recorded other statements from Azman.
                    The prosecution sought to produce two of them, one recorded on 20 August
                    2007 and another recorded on 16 October 2007, but Azman objected that he
                    had not make them voluntarily and they were therefore not admissible in
                    evidence. In view of the dispute, a <em>voir dire</em> was
                    conducted for each statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     The onus is on the prosecution to prove that a
                    statement of an accused person is admissible in evidence. A sub-trial would in
                    the normal course proceed with the recording officer and other officers such as
                    interpreters affirming that the statement was made and recorded without any
                    inducement, threat or promise. Then the evidential burden would shift onto the
                    accused to show that the statement was not made voluntarily and this is done by
                    cross-examining the prosecution witnesses, and leading evidence of the accused
                    and his supporting witnesses, if any.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Statement of 20 August 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     On 20 August 2007, Adam Tan went with
                    interpreter Sofia binte Sufri (“Sofia”) to see Azman at the
                    Queenstown Remand Prison to serve on him a charge for trafficking of the drug
                    Ecstasy and to record a cautioned statement from him. Adam Tan’s evidence
                    was that after he served Azman with the charge and recorded his cautioned
                    statement, Azman told him in English that he had some things to say to him.
                    Azman then spoke to him, and broke into tears. Adam Tan asked him if he was
                    willing to have what he said reduced into a written statement for his signature,
                    but Azman was not willing to do that. That conversation took place in the
                    presence of the interpreter but she did not take part in it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     After that exchange, Adam Tan and the
                    interpreter left, and went their separate ways. Adam Tan went to his car parked
                    outside the prison and recorded in his field book of what Azman had told him. He
                    did not set that out verbatim, but made a summary of it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Counsel cross-examined Adam Tan and
                    established that he had seen Azman on 9 May 2007, and that Azman spoke to
                    him about his wife and family. When counsel put to him that he told Azman that
                    there was a note book which implicated his wife with the drugs, and that he
                    asked him to think about it, Adam Tan denied that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Counsel then moved to the events of
                    20 August 2007 and put to Adam Tan that</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_i"></a>(i)     Azman had argued with him when the
                        additional charge was served on him;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     he accused Azman of not cooperating with the
                        investigations;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     he told Azman that he could not escape because he was the
                        driver;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     he
                        asked Azman why he did not admit his involvement with the drugs, and Azman
                        said that he did not do it;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_v"></a>(v)     he told Azman that he really wanted the other two accused
                        and he could help Azman; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_44-p2_vi"></a>(vi)     he told Azman that a note book will implicate his wife,
                        but if he co-operated, he could avoid the death penalty and save his
                        wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Adam Tan did not agree with any of
                that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Counsel also put to Adam Tan that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_i"></a>(i)     he did not ask Azman if he was
                        willing to make a written statement. Adam Tan’s response was that
                        after Azman spoke, he asked him if he was willing to have that reduced into
                        a written statement but Azman declined,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     at the end of the conversation, before he left
                        the prison, he asked Azman to think about it, but Adam Tan disagreed with
                        that. Adam Tan added that after Azman declined to give a written statement,
                        but wanted to make a bargain for him to plead guilty in exchange for a
                        lighter sentence, but he told Azman that he was not in a position to make a
                        decision on that, and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_45-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Azman actually agreed to co-operate with Adam Tan
                        because Adam Tan told him that he could avoid the death penalty and his wife
                        could be saved. Adam Tan denied making those
                representations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The interpreter Sofia also gave evidence in
                    the <em>voir dire</em>. She confirmed she went to the
                    Queenstown Remand Prison with Adam Tan on 20 August 2007. Unfortunately her
                    evidence was unclear in parts as she had not kept notes of the events and was
                    relying on her memory. For example, in examination-in-chief, she said that when
                    she and Adam Tan entered the interview room, Azman’s family told Adam Tan
                    that Azman had something to say about the charge he was facing and in
                    cross-examination, she said that she could not remember whether Azman’s
                    conversation with Adam Tan took place before or after the charge was served,
                    although she also said that she and Adam Tan left after the
                conversation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Her evidence was that she acted as the
                    interpreter in recording of a cautioned statement from Azman on the charge that
                    was served on him. She was not involved in the conversation between Azman and
                    Adam Tan. When she was asked the language Azman spoke in, her initial response
                    was he might have spoken in English and then she subsequently said that the
                    conversation took place in English. She also remembered that Adam Tan asked
                    Azman whether he was prepared to make a signed statement, and Azman declined
                    because when he asked Adam Tan for help to reduce his charge to a non-capital
                    charge, Adam Tan had told him that he could not make such a
                decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     In cross-examination, several questions were
                    put which Sofia disagreed with including:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(i)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Azman and Adam Tan were discussing Azman’s
                            role in the series of events;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(ii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Azman told Adam Tan that he was not

<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(vi)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Adam Tan mentioned to Azman that he could save
                            Azman from the death penalty and also save Azman’s wife;
                            and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(vii)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">before leaving, Adam Tan told Azman to think
                            over the matters.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     Interpreters can be of greater assistance as
                    witnesses if they have more to rely on than their memories. If they take and
                    keep brief notes of the events they are involved in, the notes would enable them
                    to recall events better and with greater reliability when they give
                    evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Azman also gave his account on the events of
                    9 May and 20 August 2007. He recounted that on 9 May 2007 Adam
                    Tan saw him and told him about a charge relating to Ecstasy, but no charge was
                    served on him. Adam Tan also mentioned a book bearing entries in his
                    wife’s handwriting. Adam Tan told him that book showed her involvement
                    with drugs. He told Adam Tan that his wife had nothing to do with drugs, and she
                    only helped him to record his money-lending transactions in that book. Adam Tan
                    advised him to think about that, and informed him that he would be returning to
                    see him again.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     On the events of 20 August 2007, Azman
                    recounted that Adam Tan and Sofia saw him in an interview room. He was served
                    with a charge relating to Ecstasy and had made a statement in response to it.
                    After he had given and signed that statement, he and Adam Tan talked about the
                    case. Adam Tan told him that he was involved and was being very stubborn. Adam
                    Tan added that he wanted information on the two other accused persons, and that
                    the book bearing his wife’s handwriting was proof that she was involved.
                    Adam Tan then said that if he co-operated, he would not face the death penalty
                    and his family would be left alone. Adam Tan then asked him questions about the
                    case, and he answered them. This covered his involvement in the events, the two
                    co-accuseds and his brother-in-law. He could not remember if Adam Tan recorded
                    anything in writing. However, he was emphatic that Adam Tan did not ask him if
                    he was willing to give a written statement. He only remembered that before Adam
                    Tan left, Adam Tan asked him to think over the matter further.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     In the course of cross-examination, Azman
                    confirmed that on 9 May 2007, he did not think that the book will link
                    his wife with the drugs and he was not worried about it and he was still not
                    worried when he made his statement on 20 August 2007. However, when he
                    made his statement on 16 October 2007, he was concerned. The reason
                    for the change was that a few days before that date, his wife informed him that
                    Adam Tan wanted to see her, and he became anxious that she would be charged in
                    connection with the drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     When I reviewed the evidence, it was clear
                    that defence counsel did not elicit any admission from Adam Tan or Sofia that
                    any inducement, threat or promise was issued or made which led Azman to make the
                    statement which Adam Tan recorded in his field book.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     Azman’s evidence, on the other hand, was
                    that Adam Tan had warned him on 9 May 2007 that his wife may be involved
                    with the drugs because she made entries in the book that was seized, and Adam
                    Tan advised him to think about that. When Adam Tan saw him again on
                    20 August 2007 with Sofia, Adam Tan told him that if he co-operated and
                    gave information against the two co-accused, he may not have to face the death
                    penalty and his wife will not be charged and he co-operated with Adam Tan by
                    telling him about his involvement and that of the co-accused and his
                    brother-in-law. He went on to add that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_i"></a>(i)     Adam Tan did not ask him to give a
                        written statement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     he did not believe that the accounts book will link his wife to the
                        drugs and he was not worried over that; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_54-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     he believed that if he co-operated, he would
                        not face the death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     His evidence that after he co-operated and
                    gave Adam Tan the information, Adam Tan did not ask him to give a written
                    statement challenged belief. If Adam Tan wanted his co-operation and he
                    co-operated, it would be natural and logical for Adam Tan to ask him to make a
                    signed statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     I found that there was no credible evidence
                    that Azman had made the oral statement to Adam Tan as a result of the alleged
                    threat and promise. I therefore ruled that the statement was a voluntary
                    statement and admitted it in evidence. Adam Tan recorded in his field
                    book:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">B1 stated that he has things to say. B1 was not willing to commit in a
                        statement. He told me and Sofia verbally about his arrest.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">He said he was willing to plead guilty but he wants lighter sentence. B1
                        also indicated that his Malaysian supplier is one “Mamin”. B1
                        stated that he was doing this to get his brother-in-law out from prison. His
                        brother-in-law is someone in Johor Bahru prison currently for drug
                        trafficking. B1 indicated that he was the one who coordinated everything.
                        Mamin informed him that the drugs were in the car while he was driving back.
                        B3 then removed the drugs while B1 carried the paper bag to put the drugs.
                        B2 and B3 are involved in smuggling the drugs. B4, B5, B6 are innocent. His
                        car wash helper, Amran is also involved. <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1">B1 referred to Azman, B2 and B3 to the second and third accused
                    persons, and B4, B5 and B6 to Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran
                respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Statement of 16 October 2007</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     This statement was recorded by Adam Tan, with
                    Sofia as the interpreter, in the Queenstown Remand Prison, and was signed by
                    Azman. According to Adam Tan, he had received a DNA analysis report from
                        HSA<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> which he wanted to
                    clarify with Azman. He explained to Azman that the report showed that DNA on the
                    string of the paper bag containing the drugs matched Azman’s DNA profile,
                    and he asked Azman why his DNA was on the string. Azman then began to repeat in
                    English what he had previously narrated to him on 20 August
                2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Adam Tan asked Azman whether he was willing to
                    have the statement reduced into writing. After thinking for a while, Azman
                    agreed, and he started to record Azman’s statement in a narrative form.
                    When the statement was completed, Adam Tan instructed Sofia to read it back to
                    Azman in Malay, after which Azman read the statement himself before he signed
                    it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Adam Tan recalled that besides making the
                    statement, Azman had told him that he was very worried about his wife and
                    family. He was worried about their safety as they may be under threat by some
                    people, and Adam Tan advised him to have his family make a police
                report.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Under cross-examination by counsel, Adam Tan
                    agreed that on 20 August 2007, Azman had already acknowledged that he had
                    carried the blue paper bag and that was recorded in his field book. Counsel put
                    to Adam Tan that</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_i"></a>(i)     he did not bring or explain any DNA
                        report to Azman on 16 October 2007;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     he had gone to see Azman because Azman’s
                        wife had informed him that Azman wanted to see him;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Azman had asked him “why
                        pull in wife?” and he told Azman that it was because he was not
                        co-operating, and that if he co-operated by giving information on the other
                        two co-accused persons, his wife will not be charged, and he will not face
                        the death penalty;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     Azman also said “Whatever you want to write, you write,
                        don’t disturb my family”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_v"></a>(v)     he told Azman that his statement must be convincing
                        because “The Judge is not stupid, must be convincing”;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_60-p2_vi"></a>(vi)     the
                        statement was not read back to Azman who had signed it after Adam Tan
                        assured him “You do your part and I’ll do my
                        part.”</p>
<p class="Judg-1">but Adam Tan did not agree with any of
                    that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     Counsel then cross-examined Adam Tan on events
                    after 16 October 2007, in which it was alleged that Adam Tan and Azman had
                    referred to the bargain made on 16 October 2007. Adam Tan agreed that he
                    had seen Azman in Queenstown Remand Prison on 9 November 2007 because Azman
                    wanted to see him. He went together with Sofia, and Mr Sudheesan was also there,
                    but he left when Azman stated that his presence was not required. It was put to
                    Adam Tan that Azman then told him that he was worried because his lawyer had
                    scolded him, and that Azman asked Adam Tan why he told his wife that he had
                    confessed. Adam Tan denied that this took place, and denied that he advised
                    Azman to instruct his lawyer to write to get the charges reduced. Adam
                    Tan’s evidence was that Azman wanted to see him to provide him with some
                    information which was not related to this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     Adam Tan also agreed that he saw Azman again
                    on 19 December 2007 to collect a DNA specimen from him. Counsel put to him
                    that after the specimen was taken, he told Azman “I come today as a
                    friend, not as an IO, you stick to what we agree and you’ll be safe and
                    don’t worry” and that if he co-operated with him he would leave his
                    wife alone and there will be no death penalty for him but Adam Tan denied saying
                    that, and explained that he had asked Azman how he was doing in Queenstown
                    Remand Prison as his wife had informed him that he was under duress
                    there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Sofia confirmed that Adam Tan brought her on
                    16 October 2007 to Queenstown Remand Prison to record a statement from
                    Azman. Adam Tan told Azman about the DNA report and asked him whether he had
                    anything to say and whether he was willing to give a statement, and Azman agreed
                    to give a statement. Azman then gave a statement in English and Adam Tan
                    recorded it. After that, she read the statement to Azman in Malay and handed the
                    statement to Azman for him to read before he affixed his signature and initials
                    on the statement. Neither she nor Adam Tan had offered any inducement, threat or
                    promise to Azman before or during the recording of the statement. She also
                    confirmed that she was present at the meeting between Adam Tan and Azman on 9
                    November 2007 but she did not play an active role.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Counsel put to her that in the meeting of
                    16 October 2007:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_i"></a>(i)     Azman asked Adam Tan why his wife
                        was pulled in;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     Adam Tan told Azman that it was because he did not
                    co-operate;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     Azman denied his involvement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     Adam Tan told Azman that if he co-operated, he will not
                        disturb his wife, and there will be no death penalty;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_v"></a>(v)     Azman told Adam Tan that he can write
                        what he wanted if he will not disturb his family; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_64-p2_vi"></a>(vi)     Adam Tan told Azman that his story
                        must be convincing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">but Sofia did not agree that any of
                    these. She also denied that she did not read the statement back to Azman, or
                    that Adam Tan told Azman after he had signed the statement that he need not
                    worry about the death penalty because he had co-operated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     With regard to the meeting on 9 November
                    2007, Sofia did not remember that Azman spoke to Adam Tan about his wife or that
                    Adam Tan advised Azman to get his lawyer to write for the charge to be
                    reduced.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     When Azman gave his evidence, he said that
                    although he did not believe on 20 August 2007 that his wife would be
                    implicated with the drugs, he subsequently believed that because his wife was
                    asked to report to Adam Tan. He was unhappy over that, and he asked to see Adam
                    Tan. When Adam Tan and Sofia saw him on 16 October 2007, there was no
                    discussion of DNA findings. He asked Adam Tan why he wanted to implicate his
                    wife and Adam Tan told him that it was because he was not co-operating, but if
                    he co-operated, his wife will not be implicated and he would not face the death
                    penalty. When he heard that, he felt he had no choice, and he told Adam Tan that
                    he can write what he liked. Adam Tan asked questions and he answered, with Adam
                    Tan guiding him. When he disagreed with Adam Tan, his answer was not recorded,
                    and Adam Tan told him that his story has to be convincing. After the statement
                    was recorded, it was not read back to him in Malay and he did not read it
                    himself before he signed it because Adam Tan assured him that if he signed the
                    statement, he need not worry about the gallows.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     After he signed the statement on
                    16 October 2007, his wife went to see Adam Tan. She subsequently told him
                    that Adam Tan informed her that he had confessed on 16 October. She was
                    angry at him for confessing and he told her that Adam Tan had promised that she
                    will not be implicated and he will not face the death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     He then met Adam Tan again on 9 November
                    2007 after his wife had told Adam Tan that he wanted to meet him because Adam
                    Tan had not followed up on their agreement. When Adam Tan saw him that day he
                    told him that his lawyer was told about the agreement, and his lawyer was angry
                    about it. Adam Tan reassured him and told him to get his lawyer to write in, and
                    he will not face the death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     On 19 December 2007, Adam Tan saw him
                    again to take his DNA specimen. On this occasion, Adam Tan assured him that he
                    came as a friend, and advised him to stick to his statement when he attended
                    court, and there will be no death penalty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     The prosecution sought to discredit
                    Azman’s evidence by arguing that as Azman knew that the book with his
                    wife’s handwriting was not related to the drugs, he should not be affected
                    by the alleged threat. There was a flaw in that line of argument in that even if
                    Azman was convinced that his wife was not involved with the drugs, he could be
                    concerned that Adam Tan was determined to have her charged and
                    prosecuted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     Azman was also asked if he had signed the
                    statement on 16 October 2007 with no knowledge of its contents, and he
                    confirmed that he did it because of the agreement. However, he also said that he
                    did not sign the statement because he trusted Adam Tan but because he had no
                    choice, and that he did not ask to read it although he knew that parts of the
                    statement were put in by Adam Tan to make the statement
                convincing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     The defence did not call Azman’s wife or
                    his lawyer as witnesses in the second <em>voir dire</em>.
                    Consequently, the evidence that she had informed Adam Tan that Azman wanted to
                    see him, and the evidence that Azman had told his wife about Adam Tan’s
                    promise were hearsay in the first instance and uncorroborated in the
                    second.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Azman’s contention that by
                    16 October 2007, he believed that his wife may be implicated with the drugs
                    because Adam Tan had requested his wife to see him did not further his claim
                    that Adam Tan had threatened to implicate his wife. All Azman had said was that
                    his wife told him of that request, and he feared that Adam Tan was going to take
                    action against her. By Azman’s own evidence no threat issued by Adam Tan.
                    With no fresh threat, we are left with the original threat to implicate his wife
                    and the promise not to implicate her, and to reduce the charge against him if he
                    co-operated.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_74"></a>74     There were substantial differences in the
                    narrations of the events of 16 October 2007. The prosecution’s case
                    was that Adam Tan wanted to inform Azman of the DNA findings. While Adam
                    Tan’s evidence was corroborated by Sofia, Azman’s evidence was not
                    backed up by his wife or his lawyer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     The prosecution’s evidence was that
                    after the statement was recorded, it was read back to Azman in Malay, and he
                    also read it himself. Azman’s evidence was that it was not only not read
                    back to him, he did not have the opportunity to read it himself, he did not ask
                    to read it, and he was content to sign it without knowing its contents. I find
                    this difficult to understand and accept. If he had signed the statement as his
                    part of the bargain with Adam Tan, there was no reason for Adam Tan not to have
                    the statement read to him or to allow him to read it. In each of the five
                    earlier signed statements he made to Adam Tan<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> it was recorded that the statement was
                    read back to him, and Azman had not denied that.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     On a review of the evidence, I found the
                    evidence of Adam Tan and Sofia consistent and credible, but not the evidence of
                    Azman. Accordingly, I found that the statement Azman made was voluntarily
                    without any inducement, threat or promise, and I admitted it in
                evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     The statement<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> reads:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">70.    My brother-in-law, Kannan s/o Subramaniam, was in
                            Sepang Regum Prison for suspected drugs and guns. His case went to court
                            in Johor. I visit my brother-in-law quite often about once a week. I
                            sometime go alone or with my wife. He got out from CPC in
                        2005.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">71.    I knew Rocky through my brother-in-law and I got
                            to know Bala through Rocky.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">72.    In early this year, January or February, I was at
                            Kannan’s house in JB celebrating my mother-in-law’s
                            birthday. We left that night. The next morning or afternoon my
                            brother-in-law, sister-in-law (Hairun Be) and Khalid Selvam were
                            arrested. They were arrested for drug and arms offence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">73.    I wanted to get my brother-in-law and
                            sister-in-law out. I know that it can be done using money to pay the
                            lawyers and the authorities. Mamin, a Malay Singaporean who is wanted in
                            Singapore and who is now currently in JB, and Siva, an Indian Malaysian
                            were the ones who introduced me to drugs. They gave me the connection to
                            buy the drugs and sell it in Singapore. They also give me the clients in
                            Singapore. Mamin introduced me to heroin clients. Rocky got me the
                            cannabis clients.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">74.    I got my heroin from Mamin and I got the cannabis
                            from Siva. I got my Ecstasy tablets from a Chinese man named Richard at
                            Taman Sentosa. Richard is wanted in Singapore. He is a
                            Singaporean.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">75.    I do not have to pay upfront for the Ecstasy
                            tablets and heroin. Mamin and Richard gave them to me on credit. I have
                            to pay Siva the money for the cannabis on delivery. I do not know the
                            cost of the heroin as I have not paid Mamin yet. The cannabis cost $2500
                            ringgit for one ‘book’. I was arrested with 2
                            ‘books’. One ‘book’ is about one kilogram. I
                            also do not know the cost of the tablets.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">76.    For the controlled drugs I was arrested with,
                            Mamin will plant the drugs. My job is to bring the drugs into Singapore
                            and sell them in Singapore. Mamin will tell me who to pass and sell the
                            heroin to in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">77.    Mamin, upon successfully crossing of the causeway,
                            will tell me the names of 2 persons I am suppose to deliver the drugs
                            to. I do not know who these 2 persons are.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">78.    I have brought in drugs a few times. The previous
                            occasions were not big deliveries. After I brought the drugs into
                            Singapore, Rocky will distribute the cannabis. Amran will distribute the
                            heroin for me.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">79.    Rocky and Bala assist me to distribute the drugs.
                            The also help me bring the drugs across. That is all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     At the conclusion of the two <em>voir dires</em>, it was agreed by all the parties, (including
                    Mr Tiwary, counsel for the second and third accused who did not participate in
                    the <em>voir dires</em>), that the evidence given in the
                    sub-trials was to be regarded as evidence in the main trial. As a result of the
                    agreement, the witnesses did not have to repeat their evidence in the <em>voir dires</em>, although Adam Tan and Sofia were recalled as
                    witnesses in the main trial and were examined further by the prosecution and
                    both defence counsel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Statements were taken from the second and the
                    third accused at the Yishun Stadium carpark after they were brought there
                    following their arrest. They were admitted in evidence without objection. These
                    statements did not add to the prosecution’s case against
                them.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     At the close of the prosecution case, defence
                    counsel did not submit that there was no case for the accused persons to answer.
                    In the face of the evidence of the surveillance officers, Sundram, Kumar and
                    Kumaran, the statements made by Azman, the undisputed analysis reports of the
                    seized blocks, and the presumptions under s 18(1) and (2) and s 21 of
                    the MDA, it was clear that the prosecution had produced sufficient evidence for
                    the accused persons to be called upon to enter their defences. Both of them
                    elected to enter his defence, but neither of them called any witnesses to give
                    evidence on his behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defences</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The first accused Azman</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     Azman is 38 years old, married with two
                    children. His counsel referred him to the five statements that he had made
                    between 30 April and 8 May 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_17" id="Ftn_17_1"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> and recorded by Adam Tan
                    and had them admitted in evidence. Azman confirmed and elaborated on the
                    contents of the accounts of events set out in those statements. I will not set
                    out the full text of the statements which run to 54 paragraphs. In these
                    statements, Azman</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_i"></a>(i)     recounted the arrival of his party
                        of six at the carpark of the karaoke lounge in Johor Baru:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">30.    We then drove to the karaoke. I know about this
                            karaoke first. One of my loanshark worker there introduced the place to
                            me. I had been there before with this group of friends. We have been
                            there a couple of times. We parked our cars at the carpark outside the
                            karaoke. I locked my car. The karaoke is a shophouse. We parked infront
                            of the shop house. We have to walk by the back lane. The karaoke is very
                            secretive. We have to enter from the back. All six of us were together.
                            The Chinese man from the karaoke will lead us to the entrance. After
                            going into the maindoor, we walked up the staircase. We entered a room.
                            Rocky, Murthy, Kumar and Murthy’s brother ordered one bottle of
                            Chivas. Bala and I had a jug of coke. We reached the karaoke at about
                            2am plus to 3 am,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     explained why he and Bala returned
                        to the Yishun carpark in SGT 809 X after they had driven to the
                        main road and dropped Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran off:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">38.    I then drove out to the main road. I dropped
                            Murthy, Kumar and Murthy’s brother at the main road. It took only
                            a few minutes. In the car, the three spoke in Tamil. They said something
                            like the car not being able to start. I know that because they said
                            “fifteen minute cannot start the car” in English. I then
                            wanted to send Bala back. Rocky called me on my phone and said
                            “Where are you?”. I told him, “I am going to send
                            Bala back.”. He asked me, “Come back, cigarettes
                            don’t have.” I told him ok that I will go back. I thought
                            Rocky meant that he left his cigarettes in the car.” I did not
                            look around to see whether I can find Rocky’s cigarettes as I was
                            driving. I drove back to the carpark. Rocky was at the carpark. Bala was
                            beside me in the car. I parked into a parking lot. Bala had said to me
                            something like the car is spoilt. I asked Rocky whether his car is
                            spoilt. He asked me to check. He then passed me the key. The car,
                            SCQ 143 X, was in a parking lot opposite my car. I took the
                            key to the SCQ 143 X. I opened the door of SCQ143 X and tried
                            to start the car. The car was very hard to start. I then drove the car
                            as I had wanted to go for one round. When I drove the car out of the
                            parking lot, I realized that there was a lot of smoke coming out of the
                            exhaust pipe. I saw this from the rear view mirror. I then ram the car
                            so that the engine will not die. I then reverse the car and parked it
                            into the lot next to my car. I did not park back into the same lot as a
                            vehicle was coming from the back. Rocky was next to SCQ143 X when I
                            was testing the car. Bala was outside of the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     described the activities with
                        the car at the carpark at Yishun after they returned to
                    Singapore:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">39.    I then came out of the car and went to check on
                            the exhaust pipe. Rocky was with me when I checked the exhaust pipe. I
                            saw the exhaust pipe and the bumper touching. I told Rocky that all he
                            needs to do is to bend the exhaust pipe straight so it would not touch
                            the bumper. Bala, who was already with us, at the back of the car said
                            the smoke was not from that but came from inside the exhaust pipe. I
                            then went to step on the accelerator and came back immediately to take a
                            look. The smoke came from inside the exhaust pipe. I then told them to
                            bend the exhaust pipe straight so that the smoke will not come up as
                            much. I used my leg to try to bend the exhaust pipe. They were next to
                            me to try to step on the pipe to make it straight. I went to my car to
                            take an umbrella as it was drizzling.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">40.    We realize that we cannot bend the pipe. We
                            finally give up. I then walked to my car. I entered my car. Bala also
                            came to my car. Rocky was just outside the car. We were then arrested as
                            officers moved in. I was sitting in the car when I was
                        arrested.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id=""></a>and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_82-p2_iv"></a>(iv)     declared:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">60.    I do not know why the drugs got into my car. I was
                            not the one who put the drugs there. I am innocent. I have not seen the
                            two bundles wrapped in black plastic bag before.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     Azman’s counsel also went through the
                    prosecution’s evidence with him. Azman denied Sundram’s evidence
                    that he took the key of SCQ 143 X from Sundram and had driven off with the
                    Malay couple after the other car arrived at the car park of the karaoke lounge
                    and maintained that he had gone to the karaoke lounge at the same time with the
                    other members of the group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     He also denied that he had called Sundram when
                    the cars had returned to Singapore and requested Sundram to drive SCQ 143 X
                    to Yishun. His evidence was that after the two cars arrived at the car park at
                    Yishun, Sundram, Kumar, Kumaran and Bala got into his car SGT 809 X and he
                    drove Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran to the main road and had intended to send Bala
                    home. While they were in the car, he heard them mention that SCQ 143 X
                    could not start. He also received a call from Tamil who asked him to return
                    because Tamil did not have cigarettes, and so he returned to the car park with
                    Bala after dropping off the other three persons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     At the car park, he asked Tamil if there was
                    any trouble with SCQ 143 X, and Tamil told him to check it (Tamil denied
                    that he had asked Azman to test the car). He took the car key from Tamil and
                    tried to start the car. He had difficulty starting the car, and when he drove
                    it, there was a lot of smoke and a vibrating sound. He revved the engine to
                    prevent it from stalling, and drove the car to the parking lot next SGT
                    809 X, and parked it there.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     After parking the car, he went to the rear of
                    the car with Bala and Tamil, and noticed that the exhaust pipe was in contact
                    with the bumper. Bala thought that was the source of the smoke, but he believed
                    that the smoke was from the exhaust pipe. There was a proposal to separate the
                    pipe from the bumper. He tested the engine again and then went to his car,
                    opened the boot and took out an umbrella because it was drizzling at that time,
                    and rejoined his two friends at the rear of SCQ 143 X. He handed the
                    umbrella to Tamil, he bent down to check the exhaust pipe and found that it was
                    out of position. All three of them took turns to step on the exhaust pipe, and
                    the bumper was separated from the car. He went to rev the engine again, and
                    found that the smoke continued, although the vibration was reduced. He told the
                    other two that they cannot do more and the car should be sent to a
                    mechanic.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     He then hugged Tamil to bid him goodbye. He
                    then went back to his car and placed the umbrella next to the driver’s
                    seat. While he was waiting for Bala to enter the car, CNB officers came and
                    arrested them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     After he was arrested, he was taken to the
                    rear of his car and someone came with the blue paper bag which he had received
                    when he bought shoes previously. He was shown the contents inside the bag. He
                    saw two bundles in the bag, but he did not know what they were.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Subsequently, when he was at the Yishun
                    Stadium carpark, SSgt Mohd Affendi Ideris (“SSgt Mohd Affendi”)
                    showed him the blue bag, took out the two bundles and asked him what they were.
                    He told SSgt Mohd Affendi that he did not know, and was abused in vulgar
                    language. He was upset by that, and was reduced to tears. (SSgt Mohd Affendi
                    agreed that he had questioned Azman about the bundles and received the negative
                    replies, but denied that he abused him.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     After the exchange with SSgt Mohd Affendi, he
                    was brought into a car and questioned by SI Ngo which resulted in a statement
                    set out at <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a>. When his counsel brought
                    him to the questions and answers recorded, Azman remembered that when SI Ngo
                    asked him Question 8, he shook his head. Then SI Ngo asked him what was inside
                    the bag, and he replied that there was a big and a small bundle, as he had been
                    shown them earlier.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     He could not remember SI Ngo asking him
                    Question 9. Instead he testified that SI Ngo accused him of putting the bag into
                    the boot of the car and that he had denied that. SI Ngo then asked if his
                    friends had done that and he replied that he did not suspect that. After that
                    statement was recorded, it was not read back to him and he was not asked if he
                    wanted to make amendments, and was just instructed to sign the
                statement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Azman also gave evidence in the second
                    statement recorded by SI Ngo<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_18" id="Ftn_18_1"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> which is set out in <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a>. He confirmed that Question 12 was asked and
                    Answer 12 was given. He also remembered that when Question 13 was asked, he did
                    not give the answer that was recorded. He explained to SI Ngo that they were
                    trying to separate the exhaust pipe from the bumper. SI Ngo retorted that they
                    put the big bundle and the small bundle into the car. He denied that. Then SI
                    Ngo asked another officer who had taken the bundles, and was told that it was
                    not Azman.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     After that exchange, SI Ngo asked Question 14
                    (about the contents of the bundle), and he answered that he did not know. SI Ngo
                    then asked if Rocky (i.e. Tamil) instructed him to put the bundles into his car
                    boot, and he denied that, then he was shown a photograph and he identified
                    Rocky. It was only later when they returned to Police Cantonment Complex that he
                    was invited to make amendments and asked to sign the statement which was not
                    read back to him. (This was not put to SI Ngo as defence counsel explained that
                    Azman was unsure where the statement was signed.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_19" id="Ftn_19_1"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     Azman then gave evidence on the statements of
                    20 August 2007 and 16 October 2007 recorded by Adam Tan. With regard
                    to the statement of 20 August 2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_20" id="Ftn_20_1"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> set out in <a href="#p1_56">[56]</a>, Azman recounted that after Adam Tan served the additional
                    charge on him on 20 August 2007, he did not talk to Adam Tan about his
                    arrest or tell him that he was willing to plead guilty to a lesser charge, or
                    that his drug supplier was Mamin. He confirmed he told Adam Tan about his
                    brother-in-law, but only that his brother-in-law was suspected of being involved
                    with drugs. He also denied saying that Mamin informed him that drugs were in the
                    car or that Bala retrieved the drugs and he carried the paper bag to put the
                    drugs.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Moving on to the statement of 16 October
                        2007<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_21" id="Ftn_21_1"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> set out in
                        <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a>, Azman stated that Adam Tan had not
                    gone to discuss DNA findings or the blue paper bag with him. After his wife told
                    him that Adam Tan had asked to see her, he wanted to see Adam Tan as he thought
                    Adam Tan was going to get her involved with the drugs. When Adam Tan went to see
                    him, he asked Adam Tan why he was asking his wife to see him, and then they had
                    the exchange that he narrated in the <em>voir
                    dire</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     Azman was then brought through the statement.
                    He agreed that the contents of the statement were discussed, but claimed that
                    the contents, particularly those parts referring to his dealings with drugs,
                    were not true, and had been made up by him with occasional prompting from Adam
                    Tan to implicate his two co-accuseds. The completed statement was not read back
                    to him, and he did not read it himself.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     Azman reiterated that he was not involved in
                    any drug trafficking activities on 27 or 28 April 2007, and that he did not know
                    if Bala and Tamil were involved.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The second accused Tamil</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     Tamil is 41 years of age and is single. He ran
                    a drink stall at the hawker centre in Tekka with Bala, and the two of them also
                    shared the use and upkeep of SCQ 143 X.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     His evidence was that on 27 April 2007, he
                    accompanied Azman to Johor Baru to collect money, and the plan was for the six
                    of them (he, Azman, Bala, Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran) to go to a pub after that.
                    He had gone to Johor Baru with Azman in SGT 809 X. After arriving at
                    Johor Baru, they went to a money changer, and then to a McDonald restaurant
                    where they met a Malay couple. From the McDonald restaurant they and the Malay
                    couple went to a restaurant known as ‘Sri Alam’, where they met
                    Bala, Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran. They went to the carpark of the karaoke lounge
                    in the two cars and then to the lounge. He remembered that Azman did not enter
                    the lounge with them, but went 15 to 30 minutes later, and the Malay couple did
                    not go to the lounge at all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    They were in the lounge until the next
                    morning. On the return journey to Singapore, he was in SGT 809 X which
                    was driven by Azman, and Bala joined them. He slept in the car, and when they
                    arrived at the Yishun carpark to drop him off, he asked Bala for a cigarette.
                    Bala replied that he had no cigarettes and promised to get him
                some.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    After that, Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran came
                    in SCQ 143 X. Sundram parked the car and handed the key to him. As
                    those three persons were about to leave, Azman offered them a lift in his car,
                    and Bala was also in the car. After the five persons left in Azman’s car,
                    Tamil waited at the void deck for Bala to come back with the cigarettes. Before
                    SGT 809 X returned Tamil had telephoned Azman to ask if he was returning
                    and Azman replied that he had already re-entered the carpark.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    When Azman had come back to the carpark, he
                    told Tamil that Sundram had said SCQ 143 X had starting difficulties
                    and asked for the car key. Azman then went to start the car. Azman moved the car
                    from its parking lot, and the car emitted a lot of smoke on being revved. Azman
                    parked SCQ 143 X next to SGT 809 X, and revved the engine
                    again.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Tamil and Bala went to the back of the car
                    and Bala kicked the exhaust pipe which was in contact with the bumper. Bala
                    asked Tamil to lift the bumper, but he was unable to lift it when he tried.
                    However, the two of them managed to separate the bumper from the exhaust pipe.
                    Azman came with an umbrella and handed it to Tamil. Azman took a look and said
                    that the car had to be sent to a workshop.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Tamil hugged Bala and Azman, and then they
                    were arrested. Tamil concluded by saying that he had not helped Bala or Azman to
                    remove anything from SCQ 143 X and he had no knowledge that there was
                    cannabis in SCQ 143 X or SGT 809 X. Tamil did not call any
                    witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The third accused Bala</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    Bala is 30 years old and he runs a drink
                    stall with Tamil. On 27 April 2007, he went to Johor Baru in
                    SCQ 143 X with Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran. They went to a restaurant
                    called “Sri Alam” first.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    Subsequently Azman met up with them and they
                    decided to go to a karaoke lounge. They were in the lounge till the following
                    morning. He came back to Singapore with Azman and Tamil in SGT 809 X
                    because they stayed in Yishun.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    When they arrived at the Yishun carpark
                    Tamil asked him for a cigarette, but as he did not have any cigarettes he
                    promised to go and buy some for him. He saw SCQ 143 X entering the
                    carpark with smoke coming out from the rear of the car. Sundram, Kumar and
                    Kumaran came out of the car. Azman offered to take them to the main road and
                    they got into SGT 809 X. Bala also joined them, telling Azman that he
                    was going to buy cigarettes for Tamil. The five of them drove off from the
                    carpark, and Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran were dropped off at the main
                    road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    Bala and Azman returned to the Yishun
                    carpark in SGT 809 X without buying any cigarettes. Azman parked
                    SGT 809 X, walked over to SCQ 143 X, started the car and,
                    drove it out of its parking lot and parked it next to
                    SGT 809 X.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    Bala noticed that SCQ 143 X was
                    emitting a lot of smoke. He went to the car and saw that the exhaust pipe was in
                    contact with the bumper. He stepped on the exhaust pipe to press it down and he
                    asked Tamil to pull the bumper upwards at the same time, but Tamil was unable to
                    raise the bumper. At that point he told Tamil that the car should be sent to the
                    workshop. He remembered hugging Tamil, but not Azman. Then the three of them
                    were arrested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    He concluded his evidence by saying that he
                    did not know that there were drugs in SCQ 143 X, and that he did not
                    touch its bumper.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    When he was cross-examined by Mr Sudheesan,
                    Bala clarified that he told Azman about buying cigarettes when
                    SCQ 143 X arrived at the Yishun carpark. He did not recall any
                    discussion about SCQ 143 X when Azman sent Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran
                    to the main road.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    He was unable to say whether Azman had taken
                    anything from SCQ 143 X or SGT 809 X because he was
                    concentrating on the bumper and exhaust pipe of SCQ 143 X, but he was firm that
                    Azman did not step on the exhaust pipe.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Review of the evidence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Azman had initiated and financed the trip to
                    Johor Baru for the party of six. The prosecution lead evidence from Sundram and
                    Kumaran that when the two cars eventually arrived at the carpark of the karaoke
                    lounge, Azman took over the key to SCQ 143 X from Sundram. It was also
                    the evidence of Sundram, Kumar, Kumaran and Tamil that Azman was not with them
                    when they went to the karaoke lounge, and had joined them later. (Azman denied
                    taking the key or going to the lounge after the others.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    The prosecution argued that there was no
                    reason for Sundram and Kumaran to lie about the key, but that was not strictly
                    correct. Sundram and Kumaran had been travelling in SCQ 143 X and they
                    were aware of the allegation that the cannabis was retrieved from that car. They
                    have reason to say that Azman had taken the key to the car while they were in
                    the karaoke lounge to distance themselves from the car and the cannabis. Having
                    said that, I must make clear that the fact that a witness may have a reason to
                    lie does not mean that the witness lied. In any event, it was not the
                    prosecution’s case that Azman had driven SCQ 143 X or that the
                    key was needed to lodge the bundles into the hollow of the bumper of
                    SCQ 143 X.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    However I am satisfied that Azman had
                    entered the karaoke lounge after the others. That was the evidence not only of
                    Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran who had travelled in SCQ 143 X, but also of
                    Tamil who was never in the car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    On the reason for Azman and Bala returning
                    to the Yishun carpark, there was the evidence of Tamil and Bala of the
                    latter’s intention to buy cigarettes. The prosecution pointed out that
                    there was no reason for Azman and Bala to return to the carpark without having
                    purchased the cigarettes. Azman’s explanation was that when Tamil called
                    and spoke to him after they left the carpark with the three others, he thought
                    that Tamil had left his cigarettes in SGT 809 X. This was difficult to
                    accept in the face of Bala’s clear evidence that they were going to buy
                    cigarettes. Furthermore, Tamil’s evidence that when he called Azman, Azman
                    said he had already entered the carpark was not disputed. If that was right,
                    Azman could not have returned to the carpark because of anything that Tamil said
                    to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    Azman’s actions in the carpark also
                    called for examination. He had gone to SCQ 143 X, started it, driven
                    it, parked it next to SGT 809 X and attempted to cure the smoking.
                    SCQ 143 X was not his car. He was not responsible for maintaining it,
                    and Tamil or Bala said that they had not asked him to fix it. They had just had
                    a night out and had intended to return to their homes. Nevertheless, Azman
                    tested the car and tried to repair it with Tamil and Bala. The surveillance
                    officers confirmed that the engine was revved and that smoke emitted from the
                    exhaust pipe.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    There were tests done of the car in the
                    course of the investigations. An engineer was engaged to examine and test the
                    car on 28 August 2007, and he reported that there was no exhaust smoke when
                    the engine was started and the car was taken for a short drive. The test,
                    undertaken months after the event, without replicating the conditions of
                    28 April 2007, cannot be taken to mean that the accused persons and
                    the CNB surveillance officers were mistaken or untruthful when they said that
                    they saw smoke from the exhaust. Adam Tan constructed replicas of the two
                    bundles and used them to test if they could be put into and extracted from the
                    cavity between the bumper and the rear of SCQ 143 X, and he found that
                    it could be done.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    I accept the evidence of SSgt Seet, Sgt
                    Loong, SI Yon and Sgt Loh that Azman opened the boot of SGT 809 X,
                    took out a blue paper bag and place it in the boot of SCQ 143 X, and
                    that Bala retrieve a black bundle from the bumper of SCQ 143 X and
                    placed it in the blue paper bag, and Azman brought the blue paper bag to
                    SGT 809 X. I do not accept Azman’s protestations that their
                    evidence was wrong or false.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    I also accept the evidence of the
                    surveillance officers that Bala bent down at the rear bumper of
                    SCQ 143 X and retrieved a bundle from the bumper and placed it in the
                    blue paper bag in SCQ 143 X.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Azman’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    Azman’s defence was that he had not
                    brought the blue paper bag from SGT 809 X to SCQ 143 X, and
                    then from SCQ 143 X to SGT 809 X after the bundles were
                    retrieved by Bala, and he denied any knowledge of or dealing with the bag and
                    its contents. However, given that the cannabis was recovered from
                    SGT 809 X and that he was in possession and control of the car, there
                    is a presumption under s 18(1) of the MDA that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or
                        custody or under his control —</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a) anything containing a controlled drug;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a
                            controlled drug is found; or</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other
                            document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in
                        his possession.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and under s 21 where:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If any controlled drug is found in any vehicle, it shall be presumed,
                        until the contrary is proved, to be in the possession of the owner of the
                        vehicle and of the person in charge of the vehicle for the time
                        being.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">There is also a presumption that he knew of the nature of the drugs as
                    s 18(2) provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his
                        possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known
                        the nature of that drug.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and both presumptions were not rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    Azman did not offer any consistent
                    explanation for the presence of that blue paper bag in the boot of his car (that
                    was the only blue paper bag there). In his first statement to SI Ngo set out in
                        <a href="#p1_29">[29]</a> he said that he suspected that it
                    had come from SCQ 143 X; in his second statement set out in <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> he went on to say that Tamil had requested
                    him to put the two bundles into the boot of his car; and he admitted in Answer
                    13 that he put the big bundle and the small bundle in his car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    When he made the five statements that were
                    admitted in evidence on his initiative, he did not repeat his suspicion or the
                    allegation that Tamil had asked him to put the two bundles into his car. At the
                    trial, Azman did not repeat what he had said to SI Ngo, and that was not brought
                    up in his counsel’s cross-examination of Tamil. That suspicion and the
                    allegation were apparently abandoned, and no other explanations were offered for
                    the presence of the bundles in his car.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    His disputed statements to Adam Tan
                    explained the presence of the cannabis. On 20 August 2007, he said that a
                    person named Mamin had placed the drugs in a car and that Bala had recovered the
                    drugs. This was expanded on in the signed statement of 16 October set out
                    in <a href="#p1_77">[77]</a> where he stated that he obtained
                    heroin, cannabis and Ecstasy tablets, and that Mamin had planted the drugs that
                    he was arrested with, and that his job was to bring the drugs into Singapore and
                    to sell them in Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    I find that Azman had not only made these
                    statements voluntarily, he did not make them to implicate Tamil and Bala, and he
                    made them without Adam Tan’s request to make them more
                convincing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    In the final analysis, there was an
                    abundance of evidence against Azman. They came in the way of direct evidence and
                    presumptions. The direct evidence was in the surveillance officers’
                    evidence that he took the blue paper bag to his car and his
                        admission<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_22" id="Ftn_22_1"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>
                    that his job was to sell the drugs in Singapore. This was proof of his
                    possession of the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    In addition to that, there is also a
                    presumption under s 17 of the MDA that he had the cannabis in his
                    possession for the purpose of trafficking, which was not rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    I should add that I find him to have
                    committed the offence of trafficking by being in possession of the cannabis on
                    his own, and not in furtherance of a common intention with Tamil and Bala as
                    alleged in the charge against them.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    I am mindful that in his statements of
                    20 August 2007 and 16 October 2007, he had stated that Tamil and
                    Bala were involved in smuggling and distributing the drugs. However, it should
                    be noted that those assertions do not connect Tamil and Bala with the cannabis
                    seized on 28 April 2007 which were smuggled into Singapore in
                    SCQ 143 X without any involvement of Tamil and Bala and were not
                    distributed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    There was nothing to show that the
                    allegation that the cannabis in question was in the possession of Azman, Tamil
                    and Bala for the purpose of trafficking in pursuance of a common intention of
                    the three of them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Tamil’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    There is little direct evidence that links
                    Tamil with the cannabis. Unlike Azman, he had not made any admissions during the
                    investigations and had maintained his innocence, and there was no allegation
                    that he handled the bundles which contained the cannabis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    The primary evidence against him was his
                    involvement in pulling on the rear bumper of SCQ 143 X. His evidence
                    was that when they saw the smoke coming from the exhaust pipe, Bala asked him to
                    lift the bumper, and he tried, but could not do it. Eventually Azman said the
                    car needed to be sent to a workshop. The prosecution asserted that that he
                    pulled the bumper to facilitate the retrieval of the bundles in the hollow
                    cavity of the bumper, but the prosecution was unable to elicit from the accused
                    persons, Sundram, Kumar and Kumaran any evidence of Tamil’s connection
                    with the cannabis.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    Tamil may be culpable if he had assisted in
                    the retrieval of the bundles knowing that they contained cannabis. As there was
                    no evidence that Tamil had handled the bundles, or, in the words of s 18(1)
                    of the MDA, had them in his possession or in custody or under his control, the
                    rebuttable presumptions in s 18(1) and (2) that he was in possession of the
                    drugs and that he was aware of the nature of the drugs did not operate. Of
                    course knowledge can be established without presumptions. Is it established in
                    Tamil’s case?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    The first issue to be addressed is the
                    requisite level of knowledge, ie how much knowledge must a person have of the
                    drug he is involved with. The Court of Appeal in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng v PP</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 1 (“<em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>”) after a thorough review of the question
                    arrived at the view (albeit non-conclusive as the issue was not fully argued
                    before the Court) that the required knowledge goes beyond knowledge that it is a
                    controlled drug, and is knowledge that it is the specific controlled drug in
                    question. In the present case, the prosecution submitted that the required
                    knowledge should be pegged at the level of a controlled drug and not the
                    specific controlled drug. As the submissions did not introduce anything that was
                    not considered by the Court, I do not see any reason to depart from the
                    Court’s view.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    That does not mean that a person must have
                    actual knowledge of the specific controlled drug. A person who avoids actual
                    knowledge through wilful blindness is in the same position as a person with
                    actual knowledge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    Wilful blindness was discussed at length in
                        <em>Tan Kiam Peng</em>, and for the present purposes,
                    it suffices for me to refer to that case, and to some of the cases referred to
                    therein.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    In the earliest case referred to, <em>Jones v Gordon</em> (1877) 2 App Cas 616, Lord Blackburn
                    explained at 629 the mental elements necessary to support a finding of wilful
                    blindness:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If he was (if I may use the phrase) honestly blundering and careless, and
                        so took a bill of exchange or a bank-note when he ought not to have taken
                        it, still he would be entitled to recover. <em>But if the
                            facts and circumstances are such that the jury, or whoever has to try
                            the question, came to the conclusion that he was not honestly blundering
                            and careless</em>, <em>but that he must have had
                            a</em> suspicion <em>that there was something
                            wrong, and that he refrained from asking questions, not because he was
                            an honest blunderer or a stupid man, but because he thought in his own
                            secret mind - I suspect there is something wrong, and if I ask questions
                            and make farther inquiry, it will no longer be my suspecting it, but my
                            knowing it, and then I shall not be able to recover - I think that is
                            dishonesty</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    This has been elaborated on in more recent
                    judgments. Lord Denning MR stated in <em>Compania Maritima San
                        Basilo S A v Oceanus Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda)
                        Ltd</em> [1977] 1 QB 49 at 68 that:</p>

                            <em>-</em> so that he should not know it for
                        certain <em>- then he is to be regarded as knowing the truth.
                            This "turning a blind eye" is far more blameworthy than mere negligence.

                    Lord Clyde held at [3] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Blind-eye knowledge in my judgment requires a <em>conscious
                            reason for blinding the eye</em>. <em>There must be

                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough added at [25] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>The illuminating question therefore becomes "why did he

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    The Court in <em>Tan Kiam
                        Peng</em> laid down three central principles in wilful

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">123   The first is that wilful blindness is treated, in
                        law, as being the equivalent of actual knowledge. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">125   The second central principle is that suspicion is
                        legally sufficient to ground a finding of wilful blindness provided the
                        relevant factual matrix warrants such a finding and the accused deliberately
                        decides to turn a blind eye. [emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">and at [127]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">wilful blindness, being … the equivalent of actual knowledge, is
                        distinct from recklessness …</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    Against the background of these authorities,
                    we can say that wilful blindness will be found against a person if he has a
                    suspicion of the truth and intentionally refrains from doing anything to allay
                    his suspicion so as to avoid the truth. In such a situation, although it is
                    recognised that he has no actual knowledge, his wilful blindness will be
                    regarded as the equivalent of, actual knowledge, but carelessness or
                    thoughtlessness without the suspicion and the intention is not wilful
                    blindness.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    In the case against Tamil, there was no
                    evidence that he suspected that there were drugs in the car’s bumper, or
                    that he intentionally refrained from making enquiries (which in the
                    circumstances would be difficult as the driver and passengers of the car have
                    departed), or to examine the bundles (because they were not in his
                    possession).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    As Tamil did not have actual knowledge or
                    equated knowledge of the cannabis and was not in possession of the drugs, he is
                    not guilty of the offence he is charged with.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Bala’s defence</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    Bala had not made any admissions after his
                    arrest. He was mentioned in Azman’s statements, but the observations I
                    made to the references to Tamil also apply to Bala.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    However, there is evidence which I accept
                    that Bala had taken the bundles of cannabis from the bumper and placed them in
                    the blue paper bag in the boot of SCQ 143 X and had possession of them
                    during that short period of time. This brings on the presumption in
                    s 18(1), and the question whether the presumption was
                rebutted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    There was no evidence that he had actual
                    knowledge that the bundles contained drugs, or cannabis in particular. Was there
                    wilful blindness and equated knowledge? One can say that he should have
                    suspected that there were illicit contents in the bundles, but can it be said
                    that he should have suspected that the contents were drugs or cannabis? Did he
                    have the opportunity to allay his suspicions? The events from the retrieval of
                    the bundles in bag to the arrest took place too quickly for him to make
                    enquiries or to examine the bundles.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    A finding of wilful blindness is portentous
                    in that a person with no actual knowledge is equated with having knowledge. Such
                    a finding should be made only when it is clear that the person had intentionally
                    and deliberately maintained his ignorance, in circumstances when a reasonable
                    person would have suspicions and would have made enquires or take other steps to
                    allay his suspicions. There must be suspicion and intention; carelessness or
                    thoughtlessness will not suffice. Against this backdrop, I do not find wilful
                    blindness against Bala because it cannot be said that he had suspected that the
                    bundles contained cannabis and had deliberately suppressed his
                    suspicions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    The prosecution has not shown that Bala had
                    actual or equated knowledge that there was cannabis in the bundles, or that he
                    was in possession of the cannabis for the purpose of trafficking, and therefore
                    he is also not guilty of the offence.</p>
