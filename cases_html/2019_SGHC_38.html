In a nutshell, the co-founders of a company seek leave to commence a derivative action against two directors appointed by the majority shareholder for not sufficiently protecting the company’s “trade secrets” – its key product’s software source code and algorithm.  The co-founders allege that the directors have thereby breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

Aside from claiming the proposed derivative action has no merits, the company and the directors also argue that the co-founders are bringing this application for collateral purposes – retaliation for their removal as directors of the company and an attempt to wrest back control over the company.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Factual background </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 The first defendant, HealthSTATS International Pte Ltd (“Healthstats”), is a Singapore incorporated company.

In this regard, I accept counsel for Mr Chang’s submission that Mr Tan should be in a position to state whether Mr Phua was the true investor, and not Mr Chang, but Mr Tan never stated so despite having filed an affidavit in support of the plaintiffs’ case.

Parties in these proceedings have referred to this as the “API Strategic Alliance”, as explained below.

</div>  In short, the Trade Secrets will have to be disclosed to PI for the purposes of the Real Time Strategic Alliance so that they can be worked upon.  For completeness, Dr Ting also refers to the modification and re-programming of the BPro device to include the capability to “live-stream” blood pressure readings every five to ten minutes, which he describes as being “very similar to” or “aligned” with the goals of the Real Time Strategic Alliance.

</div>  On 28 February 2018, Mr Tan told him to step down with effect from 1 March 2018 and that he would take over as CEO.  It appears that this was a result of Mr Lian having “irreconcilable differences” with Dr Ting, Mr Chua and Mr Tan in Healthstats.

</div>  According to Mr Lian, he then sought Tupai’s and Mr Chang’s approval for his resignation.  But, after Mr Chang learnt from Mr Lian how Dr Ting and Mr Chua had allegedly mismanaged the company (see [33] below), Mr Chang did not want him to resign and insisted that he should stay on as the CEO to safeguard the interests of Healthstats.  Mr Chang also told Mr Lian that he intended to ask Mr Tan to step down from Healthstats.  This was because Mr Chang wanted to sever his working and business relationship with Mr Tan due to certain differences that had arisen between them, mostly in connection with other investments that were unrelated to Healthstats.

</div>  As such, I shall say no more about it.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues to be determined</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 The parties’ submissions for the leave application focused on the well-known requirements under s 216A of the CA: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) first, whether the plaintiffs are acting in good faith in applying for leave to bring the derivative action in respect of the Collaboration with PI claim and the Hard Disk claim (s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CA); and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) secondly, whether the bringing or prosecution of the derivative action for these two claims will be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of Healthstats (s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CA). </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The applicable legal principles – s 216A(3)(</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">b</span><span class="font-weight-bold">) and (</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">c</span><span class="font-weight-bold">)</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Good faith </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The starting point in relation to the “good faith” requirement is that there is no presumption of good faith, and the onus is on the applicant to establish that he is acting in good faith: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee v Low Hian Chor </span>[2013] 2 SLR 340 (“<span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [23].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 There are two main facets to the “good faith” requirement: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [29]–[30]; <span class="font-italic">Maher v Honeysett and Maher Electrical Contractors </span>[2005] NSWSC 859 at [28]. The first relates to the merits of the proposed derivative action.  The applicant must honestly or reasonably believe that a good cause of action exists for the company to prosecute.  It follows as a corollary that an applicant may be found to lack good faith if it is shown that no reasonable person in his position, and knowing what he knows, could believe that the company had a good cause of action to prosecute: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [29].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The merits of the proposed derivative action are also relevant to the requirement of “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company” under s 216A(3)<span class="font-italic">(c)</span> of the CA, as will be explained below.  But, it must be stressed that, for the requirement of “good faith”, the consideration here is not an objective determination of the merits of the claim that the company can bring.  Rather, the question is whether the applicant could be said to honestly or reasonably believe that the company has a claim that should be brought.  If this question cannot be answered affirmatively, the applicant’s purpose for bringing the derivative action must be carefully scrutinised.  As the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>observed at [29], the “conceptual integrity of the good faith requirement demands that any considerations of legal merits under this head must be yoked to the intents and purposes of the applicant who is seeking to initiate a derivative action”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Secondly, an applicant may be found to be lacking in good faith if it can be demonstrated that he is bringing the derivative action for a collateral purpose: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [30].  The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that he or she is “genuinely aggrieved”, and that any collateral purpose is sufficiently consistent with the purpose of “doing justice to a company” so that he or she is not abusing the statutory remedy and, by extension, also the company, as a vehicle for the applicant’s own aims and interests: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [31], citing <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock </span><span class="font-italic">and another v PKS Contracts Services Pte Ltd </span>[2004] 3 SLR(R) 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [19].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 As regards this second facet of the good faith requirement, it will not suffice to show dislike, ill-feeling or personal animosity between the parties as hostility between warring factions within a company is commonplace.  However, if it can be shown that the applicant is “so motivated by vendetta, perceived or real, that his judgment will be clouded by purely personal considerations”, then this would constitute a lack of good faith:<span class="font-italic"> Pang Yong Hock </span>at [20].  A history of grievances against the majority shareholders or the board would make it easier to characterise the derivative action as having been brought for no other purpose other than the satisfaction of the applicant’s private vendetta: <span class="font-italic">Swansson v R A Pratt Properties Pty Ltd </span>(2002) 42 ACSR 313 at [41], cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [13].  An applicant’s good faith will also be in doubt if he appears set on damaging the company out of sheer spite or for the benefit of a competitor: <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock </span>at [20]; <span class="font-italic">Wong Kai Wah v Wong Kai Yuan and another </span>[2014] SGHC 147 (“<span class="font-italic">Wong Kai Wah</span>”) at [70].  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 In addition, any lack of good faith must relate to the commencement of the derivative action and not all past conduct of the applicant in general: <span class="font-italic">Fong Wai Lyn Carolyn v Airtrust (Singapore) Pte Ltd </span>[2011] 3 SLR 980 (“<span class="font-italic">Fong Wai Lyn Carolyn</span>”) at [75] and [79]; <span class="font-italic">IGM Resources Corp v 979708 Alberta Ltd </span>[2004] AJ No 1462 at [36].  In <span class="font-italic">Fong Wai Lyn Carolyn</span>, Judith Prakash J, as she then was, rejected the argument that the plaintiff lacked good faith because the plaintiff herself had allegedly committed breaches of fiduciary duties owed to the company.  Even if it was assumed that the breaches were committed, they were distinct and unrelated to the <span class="font-italic">defendant’s</span> breach of duties which the plaintiff was seeking to prosecute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In considering the requirement of good faith, a distinction between “motive” and “purpose” should be drawn.  The element of good faith is “dependent less on the motives” behind the application and “more on the purpose of the proposed derivative action, which must have an obvious nexus with the company’s benefit or interests”: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [16].  In other words, it is not the questionable motivations of the applicant <span class="font-italic">per se</span> that amounts to bad faith; instead bad faith may be established where questionable motivations constitute a personal purpose which will be pursued at the expense of or in lieu of the company’s interests.  In this sense, the requirements under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 216A(3)<span class="font-italic">(c)</span> of the CA are quite clearly inter-linked: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [13] and [16], citing <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock </span>at [20].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 The good faith enquiry may also extend beyond the two main facets earlier identified, honest and reasonable belief in the merits, and purpose for bringing the application.  It can also encompass considerations of the applicant’s conduct in the proceedings: Margaret Chew, <span class="font-italic">Minority Shareholders’ Rights and Remedies </span>(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) at para 6.043.  For instance, the failure to be fully candid before the court would indicate a lack of good faith.  In <span class="font-italic">Agus Irawan v Toh Teck Chye </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 471 (“<span class="font-italic">Agus Irawan</span>”) at [9], Choo Han Teck JC, as he then was, considered this to be relevant, and held that good faith would have required the applicant to “set out the story in full from the beginning but he did not do so”.  This was cited with approval in <span class="font-italic">Wong K</span><span class="font-italic">ai Wah </span>at [66], where Lee Kim Shin JC held that “[h]ints of lack of candour may justify an inference of a lack of good faith”.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Prima facie in the interests of the company</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In order to satisfy the requirement that the proposed derivative action be “<span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>in the interests of the company”, the applicant must show that the claim is “legitimate and arguable”: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [53].  This means that the claim must have a reasonable semblance of merit and is not one which is frivolous, vexatious or bound to be unsuccessful.  Further, the claim must be such that if it is proved, the company will stand to gain substantially in money or money’s worth: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [53]–[54], citing <span class="font-italic">Agus Irawan </span>at [8]<span class="font-italic"> </span>and<span class="font-italic"> Urs Meisterhans v GIP Pte Ltd</span> [2011] 1 SLR 552 (“<span class="font-italic">Urs Meisterhans</span>”) at [25].  The expected benefit to the company must be real to justify the costs and effort of pursuing the action when the company itself had not proceeded with it.  Therefore, the applicant must not only identify causes of action, he must also show that the company has sustained or may sustain real loss or damage as a result of the failures and that there are some prospects of obtaining relief or redress through the proposed action: <span class="font-italic">Law Chin Eng and another v Hiap Seng &amp; Co Pte Ltd (Lau Chin Hu and others, applicants)</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(“<span class="font-italic">Law Chin Eng</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>[2009] SGHC 223 at [25].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 At the leave stage, only affidavit evidence is before the court.  The court should not be drawn into an adjudication on the disputes of facts; it only has to examine if there is <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>merit: <span class="font-italic">Law Chin Eng </span>at [11]; <span class="font-italic">Urs Meisterhans </span>at [25];<span class="font-italic"> Teo Gek Luang v Ng Ai T</span><span class="font-italic">iong and others </span>[1998] 2 SLR(R) 426 (“<span class="font-italic">Teo Gek Luang</span>”) at [15].  The threshold for the applicant to meet is therefore low and only the most obviously unmeritorious claims are excluded: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [55]; <span class="font-italic">Yeo Sing San v Sanmugam Murali and another </span>[2016] SGHC 14 at [23]; <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span><span class="font-italic">Investment Pte Ltd v Wealthplus Pte Ltd and others</span> [2015] SGHC 145 (“<span class="font-italic">Petroships</span>”) at [152].  The court should be mindful that the applicant may not, in the nature of things, have access to all the information: <span class="font-italic">Wong Lee Vui Willie v Li Qingyun </span><span class="font-italic">and another </span>[2016] 1 SLR 696 (“<span class="font-italic">Willie Wong</span>”) at [51].  But this may not invariably be the case – the applicant may have access to the necessary information despite being a minority shareholder: see, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>where the Court of Appeal noted that it was the applicant who had the upper hand in terms of information and it was the defendant who was agitating for access to the company’s books (at [55]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 In addition, leave to commence the derivative action would not be granted if there is only a mere “suspicion of wrongdoing”. As Aedit Abdullah JC, as he then was, noted in <span class="font-italic">Willie Wong</span> at [36]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…Many actions or transactions could conceivably be perceived on the surface as being tainted or coloured, only to be cleared when the evidence is sufficiently tested. <span class="font-italic">Claims founded only on suspicion are bound to be unsuccessful at the end of the day</span>. To permit claims to proceed only on the basis of suspicion would, to my mind, create great difficulty in the administration of companies, especially once friction arises between the directors or shareholders, as it invariably does. [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Previous decisions have also stressed the need to show a reasonable basis for the applicant’s complaint so as to avoid unnecessary interference with company administration. In <span class="font-italic">Teo Gek Luang</span>, Lai Kew Chai J noted that management decisions should be left to the board; members generally cannot sue in the name of the company, and the court should be wary of any attempt by a minority shareholder to abuse the s 216 CA procedure (at [14]).  In <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock</span>, the Court of Appeal held that the requirement that the applicant show a “legitimate and arguable” case was consonant with the legislative intention of protecting the interests of the genuinely aggrieved minority while ensuring that the company’s directors are not unduly hampered in their management decisions by “loud but unreasonable dissidents attempting to drive the corporate vehicle from the back seat” (at [19]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 As already alluded above, there is an inter-play here with the requirement of “good faith” because an applicant with a frivolous or vexatious claim will also usually be unable to show that he has an honest or reasonable belief in the merits of the proposed derivative action or the absence of a collateral purpose amounting to an abuse of process: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [55]. Commentators describe the overlap between s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) and s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the CA to be “clear” and “substantial” (see Hans Tjio, Pearlie Koh &amp; Lee Pey Woan, <span class="font-italic">Corporate Law </span>(Academy Publishing, 2015) at para 10.063 and Wee Meng Seng &amp; Dan W Puchniak, “Derivative actions in Singapore: mundanely non-Asian, intriguingly non-American and at the forefront of the Commonwealth” in <span class="font-italic">The Derivative Action in Asia</span><span class="font-italic">: A Comparative and Functional Approach </span>(Dan W Puchniak, Harald Baum &amp; Michael Ewing-Chow eds) (Cambridge University Press, 2012) at p 347).  But, again, I would emphasise that unlike the “good faith” requirement under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the CA, the “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company” requirement under s 216A(3)(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) focuses on an objective assessment of the legal merit of the claim: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span> at [58]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Even if a claim is meritorious, the court may come to the view that it may not be in the company’s interests for the derivative action to be brought.  For instance, the company may have genuine commercial considerations for not wanting to pursue certain claims, such as where there is a good, long-term and profitable relationship that might be damaged: <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee </span>at [56]; <span class="font-italic">Pang Yong Hock </span>at [21].  The “interests of the company” requirement entails a multi-factorial inquiry that can take into account the character of the company, the availability of alternative remedies, the ability of the defendant to satisfy the claim, the costs and benefits of the proposed action and the effect of the litigation on the conduct of the company’s business among other considerations: <span class="font-italic">Willie Wong </span>at [50]; see generally <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>at [153].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The views of the shareholders may provide some indication as to whether the commencement of a derivative action is in the interests of the company. In <span class="font-italic">Ang Thiam Swee</span>, the Court of Appeal observed there was “no positive affirmation from the majority shareholder that the Company views the action as worthwhile”; the shareholder’s silence suggested instead that the action was <span class="font-italic">not in </span>the company’s interests (at [57]).  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 Having set out the applicable legal principles, I turn now to determine the two issues in this application.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 1 – Whether the plaintiffs are acting in good faith </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I will consider the “good faith” requirement in relation to the plaintiffs’ application for leave to bring derivative actions against Mr Lian and Mr Chang for both the Collaboration with PI claim and the Hard Disk claim.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The essence of the plaintiffs’ case in this regard is that, if one examines the conduct of Mr Lian and the chronology of events, the inference must be that that Dr Ting and Mr Chua were abruptly removed from their executive positions in Healthstats on 2 March 2018 so as to give the opportunity to Mr Lian to access the Trade Secrets.  Mr Lian did this by giving instructions for the copying of the Trade Secrets to the Hard Disk.  This must have been done pursuant to a scheme by Mr Lian and Mr Chang to pass the Trade Secrets to PI for the Real Time Strategic Alliance, and not the API Strategic Alliance as documented in the MOU.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As such, the Collaboration with PI claim and the Hard Disk claim are intimately connected because, according to the plaintiffs, they are part and parcel of the same scheme to wrongfully pass on Healthstats’ Trade Secrets to PI.  The plaintiffs submit that they are acting in good faith because they honestly and reasonably believe, from these facts, that Healthstats has valid claims against Mr Lian and Mr Chang for breaching their duties as directors by failing to safeguard the company’s interests because they permitted or sanctioned the passing of the Trade Secrets to PI.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Collaboration with PI claim </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 The plaintiffs’ case that there was an intention to disclose the Trade Secrets, or that there was actual disclosure, to PI is premised on this court finding that there is evidence to show an arguable case that Healthstats and PI have indeed agreed to work together on the Real Time Strategic Alliance.  As explained at [22] above, such a Real Time Strategic Alliance, according to the plaintiffs, would require Healthstats to share the Trade Secrets with PI, and it is alleged that this would be highly detrimental to Healthstats because these “crown jewels” should never be shared with any third party.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Counsel for the plaintiffs candidly admitted that there was no direct evidence to show that Mr Lian or Mr Chang had, on behalf of Healthstats, agreed to a Real Time Strategic Alliance with PI, and pursuant to that, had agreed to disclose the Trade Secrets or had actually disclosed the Trade Secrets to PI.  However, it was submitted that there is sufficient circumstantial evidence for the court to draw the necessary inferences that there is such a Real Time Strategic Alliance.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 To establish the existence of the Real Time Strategic Alliance, the plaintiffs rely on the events of 1 and 2 March 2018 and also to a number of documents.  I shall deal with the specific arguments in relation to the events of 1 and 2 March 2018 later in the context of the Hard Disk claim.  I address first the various documents relied on by the plaintiffs.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 First, the plaintiffs refer to an e-mail from Mr Eduardo Vom (“Mr Vom”), the Executive Vice President of the Connected Health Department of PI, dated 16 January 2018.  This e-mail was sent to Mr Lian and Mr Sam Lanyon (“Mr Lanyon”), the Chief Commercial Officer of PI.  Mr Sidaway and Mr Marcus Chua were also copied.  This e-mail was meant to be a draft of a “Master Service Agreement” which would be the starting base of the partnership with PI.

</div>  Their concern was compounded by two things. First, the delay by Mr Marcus Chua in providing them with a complete copy of the MOU with PI (the MOU was sent to Dr Ting and Mr Chua on 26 February 2018, some months after it was signed in November 2017).  Secondly, they had been kept out of the loop in the discussions with PI by Mr Marcus Chua on the instructions of Mr Lian, and thus did not know whether there were any other agreements signed between PI and Healthstats.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Fifthly, the plaintiffs refer to an e-mail dated 19 March 2018, sent to Dr Ting from Mr Alexander Gosling (“Mr Gosling”), an Australian technopreneur known to both Mr Sam Lanyon and Dr Ting.

The e-mail contains a deck of slides prepared by PI for Healthstats (“the PI slides”) detailing a proposal for a project on how it can improve the usability of the BPro device.  The PI slides also make reference to a challenge organised by the Westmead Applied Research Centre of the University of Sydney (“WARC”) to find the “most accurate and most usable technology solution which can continuously monitor blood pressure”.

This in itself meant that the defendants had given or were planning to divulge the Trade Secrets to PI.

</div> made it clear that only the API Strategic Alliance was envisaged.  In fact, it was common ground that a Real Time Strategic Alliance was not covered by the MOU’s terms.  Also, I find that none of the communications that the plaintiffs have referred to support a claim that Mr Lian and Mr Chang have actually agreed to disclose the Trade Secrets to PI.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 First, as regards the 16 January e-mail from Mr Vom, it must be pointed out that neither the BPro software nor the API, to which PI had asked for access, contain the Trade Secrets.  As counsel for Healthstats noted, even Dr Ting has agreed that the BPro software cannot be reverse-engineered to produce the underlying source code and algorithm.

</div>  As such, simply allowing PI to access the BPro software and the API would not entail divulging the Trade Secrets to PI. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 Not only that, on a proper reading of this e-mail, any Master Service Agreement to be entered into envisaged a division of labour whereby Healthstats would be in charge of creating the “5-10 minutes data logging and transmitting” capability whereas PI would be in charge of “Vitalic integration” and “Bpro and QBox integration”.  So, it appeared that if there was to be any modification to the BPro software source code or algorithm, this would be done by Healthstats and not PI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 Secondly, the 17 January e-mail from Mr Marcus Chua, following from Mr Vom’s email, does not assist the plaintiffs to show that Mr Lian and Mr Chang permitted, or would have permitted, the disclosure of the Trade Secrets to PI.  In fact, it shows that the need to protect Healthstats’ Trade Secrets weighed on the mind of Mr Marcus Chua and was communicated to Mr Lian.  Hence, in deciding between developing the API in house and allowing PI to create the API, Mr Marcus Chua cautioned that for the latter, “sensitivities need to be considered”.  In addition, reference is made, at the foot of the e-mail, to a meeting with Mr Chua on 19 January 2018.  On that day, there was a conference call with PI to discuss matters raised in the e-mail.  Mr Chua attended the call, but he has not given evidence that PI asked for the Trade Secrets at that call.

The confusing reference to the “access to the code” can probably be attributed to the fact that Mr Gosling was hearing second-hand from PI’s officers about the nature of the collaboration with Healthstats and their discussions with Mr Marcus Chua, and he might have misunderstood that further development of the source code and algorithm was needed for the API Strategic Alliance.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 But, more significantly, Mr Gosling confirms that PI had no engagement with Mr Marcus Chua and that PI would not be willing to work with Healthstats while the company was in a state of flux.  Mr Gosling therefore told Dr Ting that he could “put [his] concerns at rest about PI colluding with Marcus”.  Subsequently, in another e-mail on 30 March 2018, Mr Gosling assures Dr Ting again that PI was not interested in dealing with Mr Marcus Chua until the situation at Healthstats was resolved.

</div> and it thus could not have influenced Dr Ting’s decision whether to meet with Mr Lanyon in April 2018.  Secondly, I found Dr Ting’s complaint that he was in the dark as to the dealings between Healthstats and PI quite inconsistent with him declining to take up the opportunity to learn about the Healthstats-PI collaboration straight from the horse’s mouth, in a manner of speaking.  In my view, this suggested that he was intent on looking for evidence to support his allegation that there was a Real Time Strategic Alliance, and was not prepared to listen to or look at anything that suggested a more benign explanation.  I can only conclude that Dr Ting was actually motivated by other objectives, and I shall touch on this again below when I turn to the other facet of the “good faith” requirement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 Sixthly, the PI slides do not assist the plaintiffs in showing that Healthstats and PI were working on a Real Time Strategic Alliance.  The PI slides themselves state that focus of the proposed project was to improve the BPro’s usability, and on addressing problems that have the “highest adverse impact on sales conversions”, including issues that lead to invalid or poor results, discomfort, or software and hardware issues that make the product inconvenient to use.

</div>  Counsel for the plaintiffs confirmed that Mr Chua had access to Healthstats’ e-mails even as late as 26 July 2018, which was well after they were suspended in March 2018 and removed as directors in May 2018.  This came to light after Healthstats’ solicitors had written to them on 7 November 2018 to enquire how they obtained the e-mail with the PI slides (see [71] above), and the plaintiffs’ solicitors replied on 8 November 2018 to say that the e-mail was an unsolicited e-mail from outgoing@healthstats.com.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The existence of this auto-forwarding system is significant for three reasons:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, it is remarkable that, even though Mr Chua and Dr Ting had access to all outgoing e-mails and documents passing through Healthstats’ servers since December 2017, they were unable to produce a single document or e-mail that showed the existence of a Real Time Strategic Alliance between Healthstats and PI.  For the reasons above from [76]–[89], none of what the plaintiffs has produced thus far passes muster.
                   <sup><button class="btn btn-link superscript-btn" data-target="#fn-374323c0-40b6-41b1-8aac-3f4c43e5d7ae" data-toggle="modal" type="button">118</button></sup>

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Secondly, it appears to me that the plaintiffs have not acted with candour and honesty.  They had acted as if they had no knowledge of Healthstats’ discussions with PI even though they were able to secretly access the outgoing e-mails of Mr Marcus Chua, Mr Sidaway and Mr Lian up to, at the very least, 26 July 2018.  With such access, they would be in a position to know what these individuals were saying to PI’s officers by email.  As I have stated above, the applicant’s lack of candour is relevant to whether the plaintiffs have brought this application in good faith (see [48] above).</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Thirdly, it is contrived for the plaintiffs to continue maintaining that they need to conduct further investigations to substantiate their Collaboration with PI claim. The present case was quite unlike the usual situation where the minority shareholder is not privy to the conduct of the company’s affairs (see [50] above).  Counsel for the plaintiffs acknowledged that, if it was proven that Dr Ting and Mr Chua had access to all of the e-mails in relation to the collaboration with PI, that would be “relevant to good faith”.

</div>
</div>  However, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that there is no evidence that they did indeed enjoy such access until 26 July 2018.  I cannot accept this submission.  Mr Lian’s evidence was that the outgoing@healthstats.com account was only discovered when it was disclosed to Healthstats’ solicitors on 8 November 2018.  The tenor of the e-mails forwarded by Mr Chua from the account to Dr Ting and his own personal account also suggest that they were surreptitiously accessing Healthstats’ e-mails unbeknownst to Mr Lian, Mr Marcus Chua and the rest of the company.

</div>
</div>
</div>  For instance, an update sent by Mr Marcus Chua only to Mr Lian and Mr Sidaway appears to have been secretly accessed by Mr Chua and then forwarded by him to Dr Ting. The latter two then corresponded briefly by email on 15 December 2017 on how Mr Marcus Chua had not sent them this same update, and with Dr Ting pejoratively referring to Mr Marcus Chua as a “dog” [that] has recognised a new master”.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 For the reasons above, I do not think that a reasonable person in the position of Dr Ting or Mr Chua, and with the plaintiffs’ level of knowledge, would have honestly thought that a good cause of action existed in respect of the Collaboration with PI claim.  The evidence that could conceivably support the existence of a Real Time Strategic Alliance was sparse – the e-mail on 16 January 2018 comes closest, and even then it was Healthstats, and not PI, that was supposed to enhance the BPro device to equip it with “5-10 minutes data logging and transmitting” capability.  Further, even if it was the case that PI had asked if they could access the Trade Secrets, there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Lian, Mr Chang or any other officer of Heatlthstats agreed to disclose the Trade Secrets to PI.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 As I have stated, the plaintiffs have tried to convey the impression, through their affidavits, that they were kept in the dark as to Mr Lian’s dealings with PI, and that they are seriously concerned, based on what little they know and from the conduct of Mr Lian on the day of their suspension, that the Trade Secrets of Healthstats have been surreptitiously disclosed to PI without proper safeguards.  However, I find that the true picture appears quite different.  It seems to me that the plaintiffs were sufficiently aware of the dealings with PI, or were in a position where they could clarify their doubts with PI or with Mr Lian, without rushing to make serious, but ultimately unsubstantiated, allegations of breach of fiduciary duties involving the improper disclosure of Healthstats’s Trade Secrets to PI.  The fact that the plaintiffs were prepared to so act leads me to seriously question the true purposes of this application.  This is a point that will be addressed later in this judgment. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Hard Disk claim</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 As already explained, while the plaintiffs submit that the copying of the Trade Secrets to the Hard Disk forms part of the factual matrix which shows that Mr Lian and Mr Chang had a plan to take the Trade Secrets and pass them to PI for the purpose of the Real Time Strategic Alliance, it is also argued that such conduct gives rise to an arguable case that Mr Lian and Mr Chang had breached their fiduciary duties to Healthstats by the removal of the Hard Disk from the office premises for a period of 6 days.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 The crucial factual backdrop, according to the plaintiffs, is the sudden removal and suspension of Mr Tan, Dr Ting and Mr Chua on 1 and 2 March 2018, which, they say, created the opening for Mr Lian and Mr Chang to “freely access and hijack the Trade Secrets”.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 He flew to Hong Kong on the afternoon of 1 March 2018 at Mr Phua’s request.  He was told that he would be meeting someone to discuss a property deal in Singapore.  At about 10.30pm, he was led to Mr Phua’s room at the Gloucester Hotel by a security person.  In the room, he was made to surrender his mobile phone. Mr Phua then accused him of mismanaging Tupai’s investment in Healthstat, and in particular, for allowing Dr Ting and Mr Chua to obtain payments for their accrued salaries and loans to the company.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 He was then given the Separation Deed to sign.  When he wanted to seek independent legal advice, his request was denied.  He was made to think that, if he did not sign the documents, Mr Phua’s bodyguards would inflict physical harm on him.  After agreeing to sign the documents, Ms Flora Lam, a Hong Kong solicitor, entered the room to witness the signing, without having heard the earlier conversation between Mr Phua and Mr Tan. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 On the night of 1 March 2018, at about the same time as the signing of the Separation Deed, Mr Lian attempted to but failed to access the Trade Secrets in Healthstats’ R&amp;D office (at [28] above).  On the following day, Dr Ting and Mr Chua were suspended from their executive positions.  The Trade Secrets were then taken out of the office in a Hard Disk and then later brought back to the office on 7 March 2018.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 In his affidavits, Mr Lian’s explained why he gave instructions for the Trade Secrets to be copied to the Hard Disk and kept by Ms Serene Chang at her home.  He believed that, once Dr Ting and Mr Chua learnt of their suspension from Healthstats, the two of them would react badly and try to retaliate.  Since the Trade Secrets were the <span class="font-italic">raison d’être</span> for Tupai’s investment in Healthstats, he wanted to be sure that a copy of the Trade Secrets would be kept safely out of harm’s way, at least until he could be sure that Dr Ting and Mr Chua could not access the office and hence the Trade Secrets.  Hence, he gave the instructions for the downloading and safekeeping of the Trade Secrets with Ms Serene Chang.  Counsel for Mr Lian argued that there was nothing surreptitious about such conduct since the instructions were given openly in the presence of Healthstats’ employees, and this indicated that Mr Lian had genuinely made a judgment call about the best way to protect the Trade Secrets given the situation he was faced with.    </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 After considering the parties’ submissions, I was unable to agree with the plaintiffs that there was an arguable or even plausible case that Healthstats had a good cause action against Mr Lian and or Mr Chang in respect of the removal of the Trade Secrets from Healthstats’ office for a period of 6 days from 2 March to 7 March 2018.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Assuming <span class="font-italic">arguendo</span> that the plaintiffs’ version of events is true, it is difficult to understand why the defendants would go to such an extent to get access to the Trade Secrets when clause 4.4(b) of the Investment Agreement grants Tupai “full and unrestricted access to all the trade secrets” of the Healthstats, and clause 6.4 of the Investment Agreement stipulated that Healthstats was to “do all things necessary and/or provide such information or documents as necessary” to enable Tupai to use Healthstats’ algorithm, software and other information. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 Indeed, the context of Tupai’s investment should also be borne in mind.  Prior to the investment, Healthstats was not in the pink of financial health, and had averaged losses of S$2m a year, with accumulated losses between 2000 to 2017 exceeding S$44m.

</div>  Full and unrestricted access to the Trade Secrets was fundamental to Tupai’s decision to invest in Healthstats.  It was something that Tupai had specifically negotiated for.  This being the case, one would have expected Tupai to get hold of the Trade Secrets in a more direct way, rather than to come up with an elaborate and coordinated plan to get rid of Mr Tan, Dr Ting and Mr Chua in order to get to the Trade Secrets.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">112 Counsel for the plaintiffs’ answer to this was that, notwithstanding the existence of these rights under the Investment Agreement, if Tupai had asked for the source code, Mr Chua would in all likelihood have refused to comply, and there would then be a dispute that would proceed to arbitration.

</div>  Counsel submitted that this would be more cumbersome, and that it was thus easier to proceed in the way as that Mr Lian did.  I am unpersuaded by this argument.  I do not see how Mr Phua’s alleged treatment of Mr Tan would be clearly less cumbersome than the assertion of what was a clear and unequivocal contractual right. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 More fundamentally, the central question that remains unanswered by the plaintiffs is how the copying of the Trade Secrets to the Hard Disk and the removal of it from Healthstats’ R&amp;D office could, in and of itself, be a breach of fiduciary duty.  It is well-established that fiduciary obligations take colour from the relationship between the parties.  In <span class="font-italic">Tan Yok Koon v Tan Choo Suan and another and other appeals </span>[2017] 1 SLR 654 at [193], the Court of Appeal cited the following observation with approval:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… the relationship will often provide crucial context for the construction of an undertaking.  For instance, in a case where the fiduciary duties are undertaken as part of a contract, the relationship will not be ‘superimposed’ upon those duties. Instead, it will inform their content.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">Although the Investment Agreement was not the contract governing the relationship between Healthstats and Mr Lian and Mr Chang <span class="font-italic">qua </span>directors, it would be contradictory to the permissive clauses of the Investment Agreement for the copying of the Trade Secrets to the Hard Disk at the instructions of Mr Lian to amount to a breach of fiduciary duty on his part.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The plaintiffs point out that there is an Intellectual Property, Confidentiality and Non-Competition Deed (“Confidentiality Deed”) that all employees of Healthstats had to enter into.  Clause 3.3(a)(<span class="font-italic">v</span>) of the Confidentiality Deed provides that the employees “shall not without the prior authority of the Company remove from the Company premises or copy or allow others to copy the contents of [any medium] that contains Confidential Business Information...”, which encompasses the Trade Secrets.

</div>  However, even assuming there was such a “practice” or that Mr Lian and Mr Chang were bound by the Confidentiality Deed, the content of any fiduciary duty on these Tupai-nominated directors of Healthstats must be defined in a manner that is compatible with Tupai’s right and entitlement to the Trade Secrets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 Moreover, the act of downloading or storage, without dissemination or reproduction, is neutral.  The act of copying and storing of Healthstats’ Trade Secrets in the Hard Disk cannot possibly threaten or damage the commercial interests of Healthstats.  The plaintiffs accept that downloading or storage of the Trade Secrets in the Hard Disk in and of itself may not suffice, but they assert that they would be a breach of fiduciary duty if Mr Lian and Mr Chang had passed on the information to third parties, aside from Tupai, or were preparing to do so.

</div>  Such a claim would be purely speculative.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 In fact, the plaintiffs, at present, are none the wiser as to whether Healthstats may have a case for wrongful disclosure of the Trade Secrets from the Hard Disk or from other computers at Healthstats’ office to unauthorised third parties, but they are effectively seeking leave of court to investigate the matter further.  In their written submissions, the plaintiffs argue that they are now seeking leave of the court to conduct a forensic examination of the main server and the desktop of Mr Tan Boon Hui.  These are the two original places where the Trade Secrets were stored.  The plaintiffs wish to see if there has been any wrongful transfer or dissemination of the Trade Secrets from this computer and the servers for the period of 2 March 2018 to 27 April 2018, apart from the copying of the Trade Secrets to the Hard Disk on 2 March 2018.

As counsel for the plaintiffs candidly admitted, he has not come across any authorities for the proposition that the court will grant leave under s 216A of the CA for the plaintiff to investigate whether it even has a cause of action at all that may be brought.  As such, I would reject the plaintiffs’ submissions in this regard.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Given my views on the Hard Disk claim, there is no need for me to examine in detail the veracity of Mr Tan’s account of what happened on 1 March 2018.

According to Mr Chang’s evidence, the Separation Deed was entered into because of differences between Mr Tan and Mr Chang

</div> and, as I have mentioned above at [27], it also extended to several other companies besides Healthstats.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 Secondly, there were several other facts that militated against a finding that there was any duress exercised on Mr Tan.  For one, one would have expected Mr Tan to let Ms Fiona Lam, a solicitor, know of the circumstances he was under when signing the Separation Deed, but he strangely did not do so.  Further, while Ms Fiona Lam may not have been in Mr Phua’s room initially, she was sitting with Mr Tan for about 30 minutes in the period shortly thereafter, as she explained the Separation Deed to Mr Tan and witnessed his signing.  During this process, she asked if he needed independent legal advice and he replied in the negative.  In her affidavit, she stated that he “appeared… at all times to be calm, composed and collected”.

</div>  Bearing in mind that Mr Tan was the CEO of a fund management company, I found his behaviour to be markedly at odds with the assertion that he had signed the Separation Deed under duress. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 In summary, I find that there is a complete lack of evidence to show that the Trade Secrets were copied from the Hard Disk and passed on to third parties.  I also find that the Hard Disk claim is entirely dependent on further investigations and favourable findings therefrom.  As I have stated, that cannot be the purpose of the statutory remedy of a derivative action.  While it is understood that the plaintiffs may not, because of the nature of things, have access to all available information, it is another matter altogether to bring a speculative claim that is unsupported by any objective evidence (see [50]–[51] above).  In my judgment, the plaintiffs, in so doing, have not satisfied the requirement of showing that they honestly or reasonably believed that a good cause of action exists in respect of the Hard Disk claim.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Collateral objectives and abuse of process</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Given my conclusion that the plaintiffs could not have had an honest or reasonable belief that Healthstats has arguable claims against Mr Lian and Mr Chang for breaches of duties, the question arises as to the plaintiffs’ intent and purpose in making this application.  Counsel for the defendants submitted that it was clear that Dr Ting and Mr Chua were motivated by their collateral purpose of using the s 216A process to try to seize back control of the company insofar as the dealings with PI are concerned.  As such, it was argued that the plaintiffs were plainly attempting to misuse the statutory remedy.  In short, this application was an abuse of process.        </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 I have already noted the plaintiffs’ lack of candour in respect of the e-mail auto-forwarding system, and the fact that they had access to the outgoing emails from Healthstats throughout the material time.  In my judgment, this is indicative that the plaintiffs are quite prepared to present an incomplete portrayal of the facts so as to achieve their objective.  This suggests to me that the plaintiffs have allowed their personal considerations to cloud their mind, and this is an indicia of lack of good faith.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 But, apart from this, on a careful review of the various allegations and counter-allegations by the parties, I find it likely that this application has been brought in retaliation against Mr Lian and Mr Chang for having removed Dr Ting and Mr Chua from their positions in Healthstats.  Dr Ting and Mr Chua appear intent on trying to insert themselves back into control in the company and take charge of the future collaboration with PI.  I also find that the evidence does support counsel for Mr Lian’s submission that, to achieve their objective, the plaintiffs are quite prepared to damage the interests of Healthstats. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 It is not in dispute that, prior to the entry of Tupai as an investor, Dr Ting and Mr Chua enjoyed almost total control over Healthstats for many years.  Their removal from Healthstats did not sit well with them, and this can be gleaned from the vitriol they expressed towards their former subordinates, among many other instances raised by counsel for Healthstats:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, Dr Ting accused Mr Vencel of playing a part in his suspension.  He told Mr Vencel that the company had been “forcefully snatched from [him]”, and threatened that “when [they] hit back [Mr Vencel] will not be spared”.

It will be recalled that Mr Chen was the other investor in Tupai who contributed the sum of S$10m.

Mr Chen explained that he was not consulted prior to such actions being taken and then states:</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">I urged [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] all of you, as I have done, to fully back Dr Ting in his attempt to regain control and lead the company to success.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 I infer from this that Dr Ting, and probably Mr Chua, had sought Mr Chen’s support for this application that had been filed.  Mr Chen must have been told that the objective of this legal process was for Dr Ting and Mr Chua to regain control of the company insofar as its dealings with PI are concerned.  This is confirmed by what Mr Chen in his affidavit where he affirms that he stands by what he stated in his message to the shareholders.  He goes on to say:

They are the only ones who have the required technical knowledge to bring HealthSTATS forward.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 It was explained by counsel for Healthstats that how this could eventually transpire is that, if the court does grant leave for the plaintiffs to bring derivative actions against Mr Lian and Mr Chang for breaches of their duties in wrongfully disclosing the Trade Secrets to PI, it would not be a stretch to imagine that the two of them would probably have to take a hiatus from any dealings with PI until the claims against them are determined, or that Mr Chang might decide to pull out of this investment in Healthstats and sell his interest to Dr Ting and Mr Chua.  In fact, there was evidence before me that Dr Ting had offered to buy out Mr Chang’s interest in Tupai after the dispute arose and some preliminary but abortive discussions had taken place.

</div>  In either situation, there was a significant possibility that the shareholders would be forced to turn to Dr Ting and Mr Chua to take charge of the collaboration with PI given their technical know-how in relation to Healthstats’ products.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Given Mr Chen’s statements, I am driven to conclude Dr Ting and Mr Chua have commenced these proceedings with a collateral objective of retaliation and trying take back control of the technical aspect of the company’s dealings.  Such an outcome would also increase Dr Ting’s and Mr Chua’s leverage in any discussions concerning Mr Chang divesting his interest in Tupai and Healthstats to them.  This would also explain why the plaintiffs are prepared to forge ahead with the allegations that Mr Lian and Mr Chang are in breach of their fiduciary duties despite the paucity of evidence in this regard.  It also explains why Dr Ting and Mr Chua have been less than candid with the court in terms of their degree of knowledge of Healthstats’ dealings with PI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137  I also find that these collateral objectives have led the plaintiffs to act in a manner which has potentially damaged the interests of Healthstats.  In the series of e-mails between Dr Ting and Mr Lanyon in April 2018, he has repeatedly presented a picture of bitter infighting within Healthstats, souring the PI collaboration opportunity in Mr Lanyon’s eyes.  To illustrate, Dr Ting resorted to telling Mr Lanyon that Mr Lian “has hijacked the whole company illegally and suspended both of us by force” and how “Lian, thru [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] very scheming manipulations have kicked [Mr Tan] out completely”.

</div>
</div>  It is quite inexplicable to me why a person who has the interests of Healthstats at heart would actually resort to informing a third party of the internal issues within the company.  The plaintiffs’ actions demonstrate that they have really no qualms about jeopardising Healthstats’ collaboration with PI, which was the very thing of value that prompted Tupai’s investment in the first place.  This suggests a recklessness on the part of the plaintiffs in trying to achieve their collateral objectives. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 I have only referred to a few pieces of evidence as set out above, but the record is replete with several other instances where the court can readily infer that Dr Ting and Mr Chua are motivated by such hostility against Mr Lian and Mr Chang to the extent that they are no longer thinking about what is in the best interests of Healthstats.  In such circumstances, I have little difficulty in finding that the plaintiffs’ actions are so clouded with personal considerations as to amount to a lack of good faith for the purposes of the leave application under s 216A of the CA.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue 2 - Whether it is </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">prima facie </span><span class="font-weight-bold">in the interests of the company that the derivative action be brought</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Given my finding that the plaintiffs are not acting in good faith, the question as to whether the proposed derivative action is <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of Healthstats becomes academic.  “Good faith” and “<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> in the interests of the company” are cumulative requirements under s 216A of the CA.  As Vinodh Coomaraswamy J pithily stated in <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>at [79], “[i]f the court [finds] that the applicant lacks good faith, its application will fail, no matter how strong the merits of the derivative action are” (see also <span class="font-italic">Petroships </span>at [172]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 Having said that, however, it should be fairly obvious based on my findings in relation to the requirement of “good faith” that I am of the view that the plaintiffs have clearly not discharged their burden of showing, on an objective analysis, that either the Collaboration with PI claim or the Hard Disk claim have any legitimate or arguable basis.  The claims are so speculative that it is not possible to determine whether Healthstats will stand to gain substantially in money or money’s worth if leave to pursue the claims is granted.  Simply put, there is just no real evidence showing that the Trade Secrets have been disclosed to PI or to any other unauthorised third party.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I would add that, apart from the lack of evidence, there appears to me to be a serious flaw in the plaintiffs’ case on breach of fiduciary duties.  Even if one was to assume that the board of Healthstats, in a good faith exercise of their judgment, has decided to disclose the Trade Secrets to some third party in pursuance of some project that the parties are pursuing, the mere fact of disclosure would not constitute breaches of duties on the part of the directors <span class="font-italic">unless</span> it can be shown that they put the Trade Secrets at risk by, for example, failing to insist on contractual clauses for the protection of the company’s intellectual property.  Thus, the Collaboration with PI claim is, as framed, unsustainable, frivolous and vexatious because it proceeds on the basis that disclosure in whatever circumstances would be a breach of fiduciary duties.  The considerations above at [52] apply with force here.  Sanctioning the plaintiff’s derivative action in the absence of any evidence of impropriety in respect of the company’s dealings with PI would unduly interfere with the affairs of Healthstats. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 Finally, it is also significant that based on a survey conducted by Mr Lian, 18 out of 25 shareholders (representing 81% of Healthstats’ shareholding) replied and agreed to put on record their disagreement to the proposed action.

</div>  This is probably explained by the fact that most of the shareholders are hoping that the new investor can lead the company into a potential venture that would successfully exploit the Trade Secrets of Healthstats.  Given the loss-making history of Healthstats, one can probably understand their anxiety about the company putting at risk its chance of a successful collaboration with PI because of a speculative lawsuit.  This consideration contributes to my assessment that it would not be <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> be in the interests of Healthstats for leave to be granted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the plaintiffs’ application for leave to commence the derivative action as set out in Originating Summons No 666 of 2018.
