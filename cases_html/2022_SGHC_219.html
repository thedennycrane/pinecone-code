The Development is a mixed-use strata title development comprising a shopping mall and a hotel. The MCST had commenced District Court Suit No 2074 of 2019 (“the Suit”) against Smart for breaching its contractual duties. The District Judge (“DJ”) allowed the MCST’s claims in part and ordered Smart to pay damages totalling $120,948.70. Smart appealed against the DJ’s decision in relation to three claims, as follows:</div><div class="mb-3"><div class="Judg-List-1 text-justify">(a) First, Smart had failed to supervise the landscaping works provided by Oakland Landscaping Pte Ltd (“Oakland”), pursuant to a landscaping contract between Oakland and the MCST (“Landscape Works”) and was liable to the MSCT for the rectification costs to restore the landscaping on the Development.

This resulted in the landscape of the Development being poorly maintained and falling into a state of disrepair. Thus, Smart had breached Article 4, paragraphs (A)(a), (A)(c) and (A)(i) of Schedule 2 of the Contract and clause 7(d) of the Contract. The MCST claimed $33,405, being the costs to restore the landscaping which was carried out by Lucky Garden Floriculture Pte Ltd (“Lucky Garden”).

In reliance of Smart’s advice, the MCST engaged Build Archive 1 (“BA”) to install the Hoarding Works. However, the SPs subsequently refused to reimburse the MCST for such works. As such, the MCST claimed that Article 4, paragraph (A)(b) of Schedule 2, and clauses 7(a), (b), (c), (e), (i) and (j), of the Contract were breached. It claimed $67,000 as compensation for the costs of the Hoarding Works that could not be reimbursed from the sinking fund.

The DJ also observed that Smart’s characterisation of Oakland as a “recalcitrant” contractor whom even Colliers had difficulty managing was a “non-starter” as Smart had failed to lead any evidence to show that it made efforts to supervise and manage Oakland. The DJ further stated that even if Oakland was uncooperative, it was entirely open to Smart to accept Oakland’s repudiation of the landscaping contract and engage a replacement contractor to carry out the landscaping duties. Accordingly, the DJ found that Smart had breached its duty to supervise Oakland. The DJ accepted the cost of rectification works to restore the landscape amounted to $32,752.70, based on the invoices adduced by the MCST and noted that no evidence was led by Smart to dispute the rectification cost.

</div> However, the DJ found that Resolution 9.5 did not authorise the MCST to install the Hoarding Works without an SP’s consent, to charge the installation costs to the sinking fund and to claim such costs from the SP or its contractor. Further, the proposed by-law contemplated by Resolution 9.5 had not been passed. Accordingly, Smart had wrongly advised the MCST to install the Hoarding Works and the DJ awarded damages as the installation costs of the Hoarding Works at $67,000.

The DJ was satisfied that the MCST had showed that the EM Locks were unnecessary and wasteful. The DJ accepted the MCST’s evidence that: (a) the EM Locks were never activated for use because they were not functioning well; (b) there were safety concerns that patrons of the shopping mall might be accidentally trapped in the mall when the EM Locks were activated; and (c) after the EM Locks were installed, there was no evidence of the MCST receiving any complaints that had initially prompted the installation of the EM Locks. The DJ thus concluded that Smart’s advice to install the EM Locks was “misconceived or at the very least not properly thought through”. Further, it was Smart, and not the MCST, who decided not to activate the EM Locks. Accordingly, the DJ awarded the full installation costs of the EM Locks, amounting to $19,153.50, to the MCST.

Paragraphs (A)(a) and (A)(c) of Schedule 2 of the Contract provide that Smart was under a duty to “carry out weekly <span class="font-italic">visit/inspection</span>” [emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics] of the Development “to ensure [the Development] is in satisfactory and serviceable condition and properly maintained” and “to ensure that all … routine maintenance works undertaken by the contractors are carried out properly and completed satisfactorily in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract”. Clause 7(d) of the Contract states that Smart had to “supervise” its contractors for the purpose of their completing the works undertaken by them “in accordance with the terms of the relevant contract”. Thus, Smart’s duty to supervise included a duty to independently verify (including a <span class="font-italic">physical </span>verification) that the works undertaken by Oakland were satisfactorily completed in accordance with Oakland’s landscaping contract. The mere receipt of service reports from Oakland did not amount to adequate supervision by Smart to discharge its duties under the Contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 In the above regard, the DJ had found, and I agree, that Smart did not show evidence of having made any attempt to supervise and manage Oakland. I accept the DJ’s analysis of the evidence on this matter, including the evidential burden being on Smart to show what efforts it had taken to supervise Oakland, after the MCST had established a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case (see the GD at [18]–[19]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 I agree with the DJ that the service reports did not show how Smart supervised Oakland, despite Mr Liew’s submissions to the contrary.

Whilst Lucky Garden described its works as “enhancement work”, this did not mean that it had performed works over and beyond what was required in the first place of Oakland to maintain the landscape, but that such description had to be read in context of the scope of Lucky Garden’s engagement which was to rectify the damage to the landscape (see GD at [22]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Lucky Garden’s invoices showed that the substance of its works corresponded to the proposed scope of rectification identified in a takeover report submitted to Colliers (“Takeover Report”).

</div> Smart also submitted that even if the advice were wrong, this was premised on its “incorrect understanding” of Resolution 9.5, and that “wrong advice of itself does not give rise to a cause of action”. This is because Smart’s advice did not fall below the standard of a reasonably competent managing agent and the MCST did not call expert evidence on what this standard was.

Moreover, the MCST submitted that Smart had shifted from its original defence at first instance (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, that it had correctly advised the MCST on the recoverability of the costs of hoarding) to arguing that it should not be judged on the basis of “perfect advice”. This amounted to a different defence which Smart had not sought leave to adduce as a new point on appeal, and hence this new argument should be dismissed.

Resolution 9.5 merely empowered the MCST to <span class="font-italic">draft and implement</span> a new <span class="font-italic">by-law</span> pertaining to the hoarding up of vacant units.

Resolution 9.3 empowered the MCST to “erect kiosks, booths and push carts on common property for short term lease” and expressly provided that the costs for such works could not exceed $500,000 and that the moneys would come from the sinking fund. Likewise, resolution 9.4 (which was defeated when put to a vote) was to enable the MCST to “undertake modification works to the façade fountain water feature” and other works with the costs for such works not exceeding $50,000 and to be drawn from the sinking fund.

As Angeline attested, there was no discussion at the 2nd AGM as to who would bear the costs of the Hoarding Works.

</div> Hence, I disagree with Desmond’s evidence that Resolution 9.5 authorised the MCST to carry out Hoarding Works with the costs to be paid out of the sinking fund.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Given the lack of explicit authorisation in Resolution 9.5, Smart submitted that the resolution implicitly supported its advice to the MCST. Mr Liew argued that Smart’s advice was not wrong because a reading of Resolution 9.5 showed that the SPs would ultimately have to pay for the Hoarding Works and it was reasonable to assume that they would bear the cost of such works having voted for the resolution. Mr Liew also submitted that the pre-existing by-laws that required a unit under renovation to be hoarded up, meant that eventually all vacant units would have to be hoarded up, and thus an SP of a vacant unit would in any case have to pay for the costs of hoarding up his unit.

</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 I reject Mr Liew’s argument that Smart’s advice was not wrong and I reiterate [44]–[47] above. Even if it were reasonable to assume that an SP of a vacant unit would eventually have to bear the costs of hoarding, the fact remained that Smart had advised the MCST to proceed with the Hoarding Works when no by-law had been drafted, let alone passed to give effect to Resolution 9.5, and advised the MCST that it could use the sinking fund to pay for such works when it was clear that Resolution 9.5 was silent on the MSCT’s authority to do so. Further, Smart’s submission, that its advice that the MCST could recover the costs of hoarding up from an SP of a vacant unit was correct, presumes that the SP would be liable to pay <span class="font-italic">whatever </span>costs the MCST had incurred on Hoarding Works, even if such costs were excessive, unreasonable or not agreed upon by the SP in the first place. I pause here to note that Resolution 9.5 is unclear as to whether it would be the outgoing or incoming SP who would ultimately bear the cost of the works. As the DJ rightly observed, Smart itself appeared uncertain as to who should bear the costs given its vague reference to a “contractor” in addition to a “landlord” at the 14 September 2018 Council Meeting (see GD at [36]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 During the proceedings below, Desmond agreed that Resolution 9.5 did not expressly state that an SP of a vacant unit would have to pay for the Hoarding Works, or that the MCST was to pay upfront for such works, or that the hoarding could be charged to the contractor/landlord. Desmond further agreed that Smart’s position (that the MCST would subsidize the costs first and subsequently claim the costs back from an incoming contractor/landlord when the unit is tenanted out) was not borne out by Resolution 9.5 as there was then no by-law passed on the resolution.

</div> Hence, on a plain reading of Resolution 9.5 and by Smart’s own admission, a reasonably competent MA would not have interpreted the resolution in the manner that Smart had, and Smart’s advice to the MA fell below the standard of what could be expected of a reasonably competent MA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 It is pertinent to note that Smart held itself out to be a leading MA with more than 160 residential and commercial developments under its charge.

</div>  Desmond agreed that Smart would be familiar with property management and the laws in this area and in particular the requirements under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (“BMSMA”). As an established MA, Smart should have had a basic understanding of the statutory requirements for passing a by-law and should have known that the MCST would require proper authorisation to use the sinking fund to pay for the Hoarding Works. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 As provided in clause 7(i) of the Contract, Smart had to be familiar with the provisions of the BMSMA in order to provide good and sufficient guidance and assistance to the MCST in complying with the provisions therein. It thus cannot be said that it was unreasonable for the MCST to have relied on Smart’s advice on the Hoarding Works. Hence, I agree with the DJ that Smart breached its duties under the Contract to act competently and to provide good and sufficient guidance to the MCST in complying with the provisions of the BMSMA when it incorrectly advised the MCST to install the Hoarding Works.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In this regard, Mr Liew argued before me that “even if the advice was wrong… that does not automatically translate into actionable negligence” as “wrong advice of itself does not give rise to a cause of action”.

In this regard, Smart claimed the MCST had obtained a benefit from the Hoarding Works.

</div> As such, that the MCST did not attempt to claim payment of costs of the works from the SPs involved was irrelevant as it had no legal basis to do so.

Hence, the EM Locks “became a white elephant and an unnecessary expense”.

Smart submitted that the DJ’s finding that its advice to install the EM Locks was “poorly thought through” went against the weight of the evidence and was factually unsupportable. Accordingly, Smart could not be liable and no question of quantum of loss could arise. Smart further submitted that even if it were liable, the MCST had suffered no loss because it continues to retain and use the EM Locks.

Contrary to the MCST’s submission, Smart’s arguments before me were not premised on any new evidence it was seeking to introduce.

</div> In gist, the tenant complained against the proposal for a bar to be operated on the same floor as the kindergarten on the basis that the bar would negatively impact the kindergarten’s business, and further stated that there were already six bars operating at the mall. The tenant also noted in the 7/6/18 Email that “the Central Management [was] experiencing great difficulty clearing the smell of smoke from the corridor each morning on Level 3 due to the bars already operating at the Mall” and highlighted that there were “a number of unsavoury and illegal activities” operating at an establishment on the first floor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Smart then wrote to the MC on 11 June 2018 to update them on the 7/6/18 Email. In its update to the MC, Smart also highlighted two incidents caused by intoxicated patrons within the span of a month that resulted in damage to the Development, namely a “broken wire mesh glass for 4 way breeching inlet box” and a “car crashing into [the] carpark barrier during exit”. Smart then informed the MC that it would be taking measures in the form of “installing electromagnetic locks at the entry/exit doors of the mall and the doors will be locked based on the shopping mall closing hours” with the EM Locks being “deactivated and released if the fire alarm is triggered”.

It was therefore reasonable for Smart to have been concerned about further property damage to the mall (particularly after operating hours) and the reputation of the mall. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 Indeed, Angeline agreed during the proceedings below that the EM Locks were considered to be essential for the safety of the Development, especially in relation to the late-night patrons at the pubs and bars. Angeline also agreed that the MC did not blindly accept Smart’s recommendation to install the EM Locks but had deliberated on the matter before making a decision. She further agreed that the MC had also, in its deliberation, discussed what would happen to patrons in the mall if the EM Locks were activated, but nevertheless agreed to the installation of the EM Locks.

</div> Pertinently, Angeline stated that the bars and pubs moved out of the Development due to their business being affected by the Covid-19 restrictions. Hence, even if the original purpose of the EM Locks (to deal with unruly patrons of bars and pubs) was not a concern at that time, this was due to an unforeseen supervening event (Covid-19) which could not be attributed to Smart. As Angeline attested, while the bars and pubs have left the Development, the concerns of unruly patrons damaging the mall in future should the bars and pubs return as tenants would be addressed by the EM Locks.

Angeline’s answers in cross-examination showed that the decision not to activate the EM Locks was made by both Smart and the MCST. Angeline attested that the MC had a meeting with Smart about a month after the EM Locks were installed but not yet activated. At this meeting, the activation of the EM Locks was discussed. When cross-examined as to why the MC did not simply instruct Smart to activate the EM Locks given that they had been installed, Angeline replied that “we can’t because we were concerned there were safety concerns for the patrons”, in that patrons could be trapped in the mall if the EM Locks were activated after the mall was shut.

The MCST had at that time considered it to be an essential feature to meet its purposes and accepted that it would have addressed the legitimate concern of unruly patrons damaging the shopping mall (see [69] above). Moreover, the MCST decided not to activate the locks at the material time although it could have resolved the safety issue (of patrons being trapped in the mall) in some other manner (see [72] above) and, in the end, the EM Locks were eventually used and continues to be used. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 As such, I disagree with the DJ that Smart had breached its duties under the Contract in relation to its advice to install the EM Locks.
