</div> I accept the evidence of Sen and Lim in this regard. The second defendant had indeed held up his end of the bargain by converting his loan to F8 into equity. The curiosity that the second defendant never accepted this apparently favourable fact is explained by a further point. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 Regardless of the conversion of his loan to F8 into equity, he still owed First Media $50,000.

The second defendant contends that his failure to produce such documents was contributed to by the plaintiff’s own failure to plead that the second defendant had not repaid the increased salaries.

</div> However, as I explain later at [20] to [23], the question of how much the second defendant had repaid of the monies he had caused F8 to disburse had been put in issue. The second defendant is the person who knows best how much he in fact repaid, and his own bank and other personal records would be the best evidence of what he had repaid. His evidence was entirely vague and unsatisfactory on this point, and I do not believe his unsupported assertions that he had repaid more than what the documents placed before the court showed. I thus find on a balance of probabilities that the second defendant only repaid $13,000 of the $35,000. Further, I also find that none of the $13,000 paid directly to First Media by F8 on 10 August 2017 has been repaid to F8.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 The company ceased operations around the end of 2018.

F8 did not enter appearance and was not represented in these proceedings. Default judgment was entered on this claim on 12 July 2019. However, on the application of the plaintiff himself, I set aside this default judgment on the first day of trial. This default judgment was plainly irregular, given that the relief of rescission is not a relief that can be ordered in default pursuant to O 13 rr 1 to 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). The plaintiff presumably had also appreciated that if rescission of the SA were indeed granted, he would be deprived of standing to seek relief under s 216 of the CA, as he would be deemed never to have been a shareholder. Moreover, it would be F8 which would be obliged to repay his subscription amount, and F8 had no funds or resources to do so. Nonetheless, the plaintiff maintained the claim for rescission in the alternative, if he failed in his primary claim for relief under s 216 of the CA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The alternative claim of rescission of the SA must fail.

</div> It was the second defendant’s witnesses whose testimony changed the picture. The plaintiff was merely reacting to that, with the riposte that the conversion of the loan into equity did not eliminate the unfairly prejudicial conduct, because the second defendant then used F8’s funds for his own ends, namely to repay his personal loan from First Media.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The second defendant also argues that the plaintiff failed to plead that the direct payment to First Media and the inflated salaries had not been repaid.

The crux of the plaintiff’s argument is not that the second defendant did not carry through his promise, made upon being found out, to repay the monies; it is that the second defendant should never have inflated his and Lim’s salaries in the first place.

</div> It is true that the plaintiff did not complain in his pleadings about the direct payment of $13,000 from F8 to First Media, using his invested funds. But this goes to the extent of the second defendant’s misuse of the plaintiff’s funds. This misuse was plainly in issue in this matter. When the financial amounts misused prove to be larger than pleaded, this only fortifies the case for unfairly prejudicial conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 This is separate from the question whether there was an accord resolving the unfairly prejudicial conduct, which if performed would bring it to an end.

In particular, the second defendant took issue with the plaintiff’s reliance on a particular page of a presentation deck the second defendant had shown him. This page described F8’s monthly expenditure prior to the plaintiff’s investment as limiting the use of his funds to the purposes described on that page (essentially various categories of operating expenses).

</div> This expectation plainly carried with it the expectation that his funds would not be used to pay off those existing loans.

</div> He had obtained a personal loan in order to fund his loan to F8, which needed funds for its operations. I agree that F8 did derive a benefit from the second defendant’s making of the loan arrangements. However, after his loan to F8 had been converted into equity, the second defendant still used the funds of F8 to repay the loan he had taken personally. This was certainly not in F8’s interests. If the loan had not been converted into equity, it would have at least remained a debt owed by F8 to the second defendant. Once converted, there was no debt owed by F8 and so any use of F8’s funds to pay off a debt owed by the second defendant was a misuse.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Third, in arguing that the increase in salaries did not found the minority oppression claim, the second defendant suggested that “[t]he inflation of salaries to pay back part of the loan was not a covert machination on the 2nd Defendant’s part but a suggestion made to him and [Lim] by [Sen]”.

</div> Whether to remove a material issue from consideration at such an advanced stage of proceedings by virtue of an arbitration clause would have been a difficult question. However, I do not have to answer that question because I do not need to place reliance on breach of the SHA. This is because, regardless of whether the SHA required the unanimous consent of shareholders, including Lim, for an increase in salaries, it was wrong for the second defendant to increase his and Lim’s salaries not because they deserved more but only in order to channel F8’s funds (invested by the plaintiff) to the repayment of his personal loan from First Media. It was not a genuine or deserved increase in salaries but a covert machination.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The fourth point that the second defendant made was that the real injury was to F8 and not to the plaintiff. The second defendant relies on the analytical framework laid down by the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd</span><span class="font-italic"> and other appeals and other matters</span> [2018] SLR 333 at [116], whereby the court must inquire into the injury suffered and the remedy sought. In terms of injury, the court should ask what the real injury is that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate, whether it is distinct from the injury to the company and whether it amounts to commercial unfairness against the plaintiff. In terms of remedy, the court should inquire into the essential remedy sought, whether it meaningfully vindicates the real injury suffered by the plaintiff and whether it is only obtainable under s 216.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Turning to the facts in this case, it is true that it was a breach of his fiduciary duty to F8 for the second defendant to increase his and Lim’s salaries for the collateral purpose of repaying his personal loan from First Media. But the same conduct can be both a breach of duty to the company and unfairly prejudicial conduct, if it involves unfairness or prejudice to the plaintiff distinct from, and in addition to, the breach of duty to the company. This is because the source of the funds was the plaintiff’s investment,

</div> and that investment had been made in the legitimate expectation that the second defendant would not use those funds to pay off existing loans (see [29] above). This was what the second defendant effectively did, albeit indirectly, by converting the loan to equity but surreptitiously increasing his and Lim’s salaries to channel funds to him so he could repay his personal loan from First Media. The injury that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate is precisely the wrong done to him in violating the assurance given to him. It is distinct from the injury to the company. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 The remedy sought is also different, namely a buyout of his shares, and that remedy is only obtainable under s 216. Accordingly, I do not accept the second defendant’s contention on this point.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The fifth and final point made by the second defendant in the first set of contentions is that the second defendant’s failure to repay the unjustifiably increased salaries cannot amount to unfairly prejudicial conduct. This too is without merit. The prejudicial conduct was using the plaintiff’s invested funds to pay off the personal loan from First Media under the guise of the unjustifiably increased salaries, not the failure to repay those amounts. That failure is however relevant to one question arising under the second set of contentions, namely whether the prejudice was eliminated, cured or resolved.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the prejudice caused by the second defendant was eliminated</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Turning then to the second set of contentions, the second defendant argued that to the extent that there had been any breach of the plaintiff’s legitimate expectations, it had been remedied with the plaintiff’s agreement. When the plaintiff discovered that the second defendant’s and Lim’s salaries had been inflated so that the second defendant could repay his personal loan, it was agreed that the salary increases would be reflected as a loan to the second defendant, which he would have to repay.

</div> The second defendant relied on <span class="font-italic">Lim Chee Twang v Chan </span><span class="font-italic">Shuk Kuen Helina and others </span>[2010] 2 SLR 209 (“<span class="font-italic">Lim Chee Twang</span>”) at [110] for the proposition that the plaintiff must show oppression continuing at the time the action under s 216 of the CA is brought, as past oppression, the effects of which had already ceased, would not found such an action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 The difficulty with this argument is that the breach and the prejudice it caused was not fully remedied because the second defendant only made partial repayment (see [10] above). Had he immediately and fully restored the monies wrongly disbursed, this would likely have brought the prejudicial state of affairs to an end. But he did not do that. At the same time, that there was an agreement concerning how to remedy the unfairly prejudicial conduct – even though this was not fully performed – remains material to the question of the appropriate remedy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The second defendant made a further and related point. He argued that while the plaintiff was only a minority shareholder the second defendant would have agreed to whatever remedial action he wanted. Accordingly, he had the power to stop the allegedly unfairly prejudicial conduct. Given that he had practical options for redress, he was not entitled to seek redress by legal means.

</div> In support of this proposition, the second defendant relied on <span class="font-italic">Ascend Field Pte Ltd and others v Tee Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Sien and another appeal</span> [2020] 1 SLR 771, where the Court of Appeal said at [32] that: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [W]here a member is able to remedy any prejudice or discrimination he has suffered through the ordinary powers he possesses by virtue of his position as member, the conduct of the defendant cannot be said to be unfair to him.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 While ingenious, the argument fails for two reasons. First, the second defendant did not specify what the plaintiff could have required (other than repayment of the monies) that would have put an end to the prejudice. Secondly, what was agreed by way of remedy, namely repayment, was not fully performed by the second defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 This leaves the final contention of the second defendant. It brings the discussion back to the question posed at the start of this judgment, in [3], concerning the impact of a finding that F8 would in any case have ceased to be a going concern for other and independent reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The effect of F8’s failure as a business</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 This contention responded to the point I had raised at the conclusion of oral submissions for both parties to consider. I asked what the appropriate order would be if I accepted that there was unfairly prejudicial conduct, but that regardless of such conduct F8 would still have failed as a business so that the shareholding would be worth nothing.

</div> In that decision (at [76] to [78]), the Court of Appeal held that there was power under s 216 to order a defendant to make good to the company loss resulting from his unfairly prejudicial conduct, but concluded that whether the loss was caused by the unfairly prejudicial conduct remained contentious and unproven. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal set aside the order made at first instance on this aspect. This authority certainly demonstrates that the question of causation is important. I am of the view that the court should consider what consequences flow from or have been caused by the unfairly prejudicial conduct, and whether such consequences continue to operate in the present. The corollary of this is that it is legally relevant to what the appropriate order should be if factors other than the second defendant’s conduct have operated in relation to the company or the plaintiff’s grievance.   </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The plaintiff’s response to my question was to argue that I should order the buyout either at the subscription price for his shares, or on the basis of the revenue for 2019 that had been forecast in the presentation deck.

Because the appellant was excluded, he could do nothing to resuscitate the business.

</div>
</div> The plaintiff’s consistent engagement and enthusiasm suggests that he did not consider the unfairly prejudicial conduct to be fundamental to his investment or incapable of remedy. As noted at [38] above, the fact that there was an agreement concerning how to remedy the unfairly prejudicial conduct, even though not fully performed, is material to the question of the appropriate remedy. That agreement had nothing to do with a buyout, and only involved repayment to F8 of the wrongly diverted funds. This certainly militates against the grant of a buyout on either of the bases now sought by the plaintiff.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In fact, F8’s business model did not lead to the anticipated revenues and profits, and no new investors could be found. It was not until 16 December 2018 that the plaintiff asked for repayment of his investment, but only of such part that had been used to pay off First Media, saying to the second defendant, “Since there is no interest to continue building [F8] from all parties, I would like to recover my investment amount which you used to pay off First Media”.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  AB 802.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 For these reasons, I am not persuaded that it would be right to grant the remedy of buyout on either basis sought by the plaintiff. In relation to the first basis, effectively seeking the return of his whole investment, the evidence does not show that the plaintiff truly considered the inflation of salaries to break the deal on the basis of which he had invested. Moreover, the second defendant did not cause F8’s business failure. Unlike the respondent in <span class="font-italic">Tullio</span><span class="font-italic"> Planeta</span>, he genuinely tried to make F8 a success, and it failed simply because its business model did not work. In relation to the second basis, whereby the plaintiff seeks the value of his investment on the assumption of F8’s success, the second defendant’s misuse of F8’s funds did not cause the business failure of F8. In short, the plaintiff would still have both made and lost his investment even if the unfairly prejudicial conduct had not occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 To put it another way, the bases now put forward by the plaintiff would overcompensate him and penalise the second defendant. The plaintiff would escape the consequence of his own decision to invest in F8 made because he, like the second defendant, believed in its business model. The second defendant would be made to shoulder the burden of F8’s business failure on both his own and the plaintiff’s behalf. This is not what fairness requires in this case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 It could be said that perhaps the plaintiff should be given the remedy of a buyout for a price calculated by reference to the amount of his investment wrongly diverted by the second defendant and not repaid to the company by him i.e. $36,000, comprising $22,000 of inflated salaries not repaid and $13,000 paid directly to First Media. This is not a remedy the plaintiff has sought. It is not appropriate in any event because it cannot be said that but for the unfairly prejudicial conduct the plaintiff’s shareholding would be worth $36,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 On the other hand, it could be said that there is no prejudice to remedy, no present state of affairs to correct, given that F8 has ceased business for reasons independent of the unfairly prejudicial conduct. If so, then, as explained in <span class="font-italic">Lim Chee Twang</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(see [37] above), s 216 would have no application. This is not quite how the defendant has argued it, but it is a point the court must consider.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 Taking a step back and looking at what transpired as a whole, both the plaintiff and second defendant believed in the business model of F8 as a young start-up. Unfortunately, it never gained the hoped-for traction. This was not the fault of the second defendant. Where the second defendant was at fault was in causing F8’s funds to be used to pay off his personal loan from First Media, surreptitiously sidestepping the loan-to-equity conversion that had been done because the plaintiff required it. When this misuse of F8’s funds was discovered by the plaintiff, he was unhappy but continued to believe in the potential success of F8. For this reason, he agreed that the increased salaries should be reflected as a loan to the second defendant, which the second defendant should repay. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the second defendant’s conduct continues to have effect notwithstanding the business failure of F8. For example, it would have been material if it was shown that F8’s continuing in business for another few months would have enabled it to gain the traction it had previously failed to achieve. The plaintiff did not suggest, let alone prove, that this was the case.  It would have been material if the monies misused and not repaid would otherwise have been available for payment of significant dividends to shareholders including the plaintiff. Such a consequence could continue to operate to prejudice shareholders long after the event. Again, the plaintiff did not suggest that this was the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 As it turned out, both the plaintiff and second defendant were wrong about the business model of F8. It failed. While the second defendant had engaged in unfairly prejudicial conduct, that conduct did not cause the business failure of F8. The failure of F8 brought an end to the prejudicial state of affairs. The plaintiff had lost his investment. But this was because of F8’s business failure and not the second defendant’s conduct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 There is one small point that remains, namely the plaintiff’s prayer that the second defendant account to F8 “for any loans undertaken and manner in which the said loans were used and/or dissipated”.
