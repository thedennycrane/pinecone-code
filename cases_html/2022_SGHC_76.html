In the eyes of the law, however, forgiveness is often eclipsed by the strong societal interests in punishing offenders for the crimes they have committed. This is reflective of our State-centred system of criminal justice where little emphasis is placed on the traditions of restorative justice. Despite this, it has been recognised that in certain limited circumstances, forgiveness may be relevant in the court’s sentencing calculus. But just how much weight should be placed on it? This appeal presents a timely opportunity to revisit the issue of the role of forgiveness in our sentencing jurisprudence. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In the court below, the respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) for committing acts of violence against the victim with whom he was in a romantic relationship at the material time. The victim was about nine weeks’ pregnant.

They were advised by a doctor to decide, within a week, between proceeding with the pregnancy or opting for an abortion, as there would be a further risk of medical complications if the victim delayed the decision to undergo an abortion.

In <span class="font-italic">Tan Kay Beng v P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor </span>[2006] 4 SLR(R) 10 at [31], V K Rajah J (as he then was) opined as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [Deterrence] is premised upon the upholding of certain statutory or public policy concerns or alternatively, upon judicial concern or disquiet about the prevalence of particular offences and the attendant need to prevent such offences from becoming contagious. Deterrence, as a sentencing principle, is also intended to create an awareness in the public and more particularly among potential offenders that punishment will be certain and unrelenting for certain offences and offenders. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Prosecution relies on this court’s decision in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v Satesh s/o Navarlan</span> [2019] SGHC 119 (“<span class="font-italic">Satesh</span>”) to argue that a deterrent sentence in the form of a custodial term is warranted, as the present case involves violence committed in the context of an intimate relationship. In <span class="font-italic">Satesh</span>, Tay Yong Kwang JA observed that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">13 It has been held that violent acts are particularly heinous when they are committed within the confines of a familial relationship as they <span class="font-italic">constitute an abuse of the bonds of trust and interdependency that exist between family members</span>. Thus, there is a strong need to deter anyone who might resort to such violence (<span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Luan</span><span class="font-italic"> Yuanxin </span>[2002] 1 SLR(R) 613 (“<span class="font-italic">Luan </span><span class="font-italic">Yuanxin</span>”) at [17]) … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 It is clear therefore that the principle of deterrence features prominently in offences of domestic violence. The present case is no exception. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 It is important to recognise precisely what the law is concerned with when calling for deterrent sentences in cases involving domestic violence and violence between parties in an intimate relationship. To my mind, deterrence is warranted in such situations because there has been an abuse of the bonds of trust and interdependency that exist between the parties. Thus, the courts seek to uphold the public interest in preventing such abuse by imposing deterrent sentences as a signal of society’s opprobrium. This is clear from the passage in <span class="font-italic">Satesh</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>quoted earlier (at [15]). In fact, this too was acknowledged by Parliament to be the driving force behind the introduction of ss 74C and 74D of the Penal Code, which provide for enhanced penalties where specified offences under Chapter 16 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, offences affecting the human body) are committed against persons in intimate or close relationships.

Rather, the underlying inquiry is whether there has been an abuse of trust and interdependency associated with the relationship between the parties. Invariably, where violence is committed between parties in certain categories of relationships, for example, familial relationships, there is almost always an abuse of trust and interdependency. However, in other cases, whether such abuse has been occasioned is a fact-specific inquiry. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18  Although the respondent and the victim were in a romantic relationship at the time, I do not think that a deterrent sentence is specifically warranted on account of this relationship. The respondent’s violent outburst arose out of a heated argument between him and the victim over the decision of whether to proceed or terminate the latter’s pregnancy. I accept that it was unplanned and out of character. The facts did not disclose any abuse of trust and interdependency of the victim on the part of the respondent. The public interest of protecting victims of violence whose trust has been exploited does not, in my view, apply here. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Nonetheless, in such situations of unprovoked violence against a vulnerable victim, it is plain that general deterrence is still the paramount sentencing consideration. The reason for this is simple and captured succinctly in the dicta of Woo Bih Li J in <span class="font-italic">P</span><span class="font-italic">ublic Prosecutor v BPK </span>[2018] 5 SLR 755 at [11]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">General deterrence was necessary to send the important signal that <span class="font-italic">the law would not condone violence as a solution to problems, </span>however personal they may be, and however angry or justified one might feel… the focus here was on the law’s expectation of self-restraint even in moments of grave anger and in relation to disputes of a personal nature, and this reminder was relevant to more than just the Accused… [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 One can appreciate that such a critical decision as to whether to proceed or terminate a pregnancy must have been immensely stressful for the respondent and the victim. However, that is no legitimate excuse for the respondent to respond with violence, especially against the victim who would have been disproportionately affected by the consequence of their decision. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Custodial threshold is crossed </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I now turn to address the main contention in this appeal, namely, whether the custodial threshold has been crossed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 As I observed earlier, both the Prosecution and the respondent agree that the sentencing framework for voluntarily causing hurt offences as laid down in <span class="font-italic">Low Song </span><span class="font-italic">Chye</span> applies. I see no reason to depart from this. I only note that the range of sentences in <span class="font-italic">Low Song </span><span class="font-italic">Chye</span> will have to be adjusted to take into account the increase in the prescribed punishment range for offences under s 323 of the Penal Code, consequent to the amendment introduced by s 95 of the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 (Act 15 of 2019), which increased the maximum custodial term from two to three years’ imprisonment. However, for the avoidance of doubt, I do not think that the failure of the Prosecution or the respondent to raise this has any material impact on the sentence to be imposed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Having considered the relevant sentencing factors and the importance of general deterrence, I am of the view that the fine imposed on the respondent is manifestly inadequate, and the custodial threshold has necessarily been crossed in the present case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Harm </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 At the first stage of the sentencing inquiry, the court considers the hurt caused by the offence in determining the appropriate sentencing band and identifying where the particular case falls within the applicable indicative sentencing range (see <span class="font-italic">Low Song </span><span class="font-italic">Chye</span> at [78(a)]). The harm assessed at this stage is limited to <span class="font-italic">actual </span>harm, and potential harm is to be considered at the second stage of the inquiry (see <span class="font-italic">Low Song </span><span class="font-italic">Chye</span> at [79]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 It is undisputed by the parties that the harm caused to the victim in the present case falls within Band 1 of the <span class="font-italic">Low Song </span><span class="font-italic">Chye</span> framework. I agree. Based on this factor alone, a fine is the appropriate indicative starting point. However, it is clear that there are several culpability enhancing factors which the DJ failed to appreciate in arriving at her decision not to impose a custodial sentence. It is to these factors that I now turn to analyse.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Culpability </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 The Prosecution submits that the DJ erred by failing to have regard to two main culpability enhancing factors: (a) the sustained nature of the assault; and (b) the potential harm to the victim’s foetus and the victim’s physical vulnerability. For reasons I will elaborate on later, I am satisfied that the DJ made several errors in her assessment of the respondent’s culpability. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Sustained and vicious nature of the assault</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 First, I am of the view that the DJ erred in failing to consider the sustained and vicious nature of the respondent’s assault. In the court below, the DJ accepted the respondent’s explanation that his acts of violence were committed in the context of his struggle to leave the room in order to end the argument with the victim. On the respondent’s account, the victim had held onto him and refused to let him leave.

</div>
</div> In this appeal, the respondent similarly urges the court to take cognisance of this context when assessing his culpability. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Yet, even if I accept this to be an accurate account of the events as they unfolded, the respondent’s attempted justification for his assault does little to minimise his culpability. His resort to violence was a wholly disproportionate response to the situation. Not only did he admit to delivering multiple punches to the victim’s face and punching and kicking her abdominal area, but it is also clear that he had inflicted more extensive injuries to the rest of her body, including her chest, spine and limbs, as evidenced by the medical report (Exhibit P1). It is also notable that the respondent directed blows at the victim’s face which is a vulnerable part of her body. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 Moreover, as the Prosecution rightly observed, the respondent did not merely deliver a one-off blow, but instead engaged in a continuous and persistent assault against the victim, with each strike delivered with the intention to cause hurt to her. Crucially, the respondent did not desist of his own accord, but only ceased his violence after his mother overheard the commotion and intervened. To this end, it is unconscionable that the respondent now seeks to downplay his culpability by arguing that his offending conduct was not protracted in nature and that his acts were not especially violent.

</div> I find this to be entirely misconceived. It is trite that while premeditation is an established aggravating factor, its absence operates only as a <span class="font-italic">neutral</span> factor and carries no mitigating value at all. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) Vulnerable victim and potential harm to the foetus </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Second, I am of the view that the respondent’s culpability is further heightened due to the victim’s physical and emotional vulnerability, as well as the potential harm to the foetus. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 It cannot be ignored that the victim in the present case was particularly vulnerable. At the material time, she was about nine weeks’ pregnant, and the respondent was well-aware of that. Yet, he had deliberately and viciously directed multiple punches and kicks at the victim’s abdominal area. In this regard, I accept the Prosecution’s submission that the potential harm to the foetus that could have resulted is a relevant factor that should have been taken into account in the sentencing analysis. It did not matter in the slightest that the respondent and the victim eventually decided to terminate the pregnancy. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Moreover, I find that there is an additional dimension of vulnerability unique to pregnant victims who suffer from acts of violence perpetrated against them – this being the emotional distress arising out of the fear for the potential loss of their unborn child. At the time, the respondent and the victim had yet to arrive at a decision on whether to proceed with the victim’s pregnancy. As the respondent inflicted blow after blow on the victim, she must not only have feared for her own safety, but also for the safety of the child in her womb. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Based on an examination of the GD, I am not satisfied that the DJ fully appreciated the extent of the respondent’s culpability in view of the victim’s vulnerability and the potential harm to the foetus.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 Therefore, it is patently clear to me that after an assessment of the seriousness of the offence, the custodial threshold has undoubtedly been crossed in this case. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Forgiveness as a mitigating factor </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 Lastly, the Prosecution submits that the DJ wrongly regarded the victim’s forgiveness as a mitigating factor. In the alternative, that the DJ had placed undue weight on forgiveness in arriving at the sentence imposed on the respondent. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Before I address the Prosecution’s arguments, I first proceed to consider the treatment of forgiveness as a mitigating factor as established by case law. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In <span class="font-italic">PP v UI</span>, the Court of Appeal set out the starting point that forgiveness should <span class="font-italic">not </span>ordinarily be regarded as a mitigating factor capable of affecting the sentence to be imposed on an offender: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">48 In our view, whilst forgiveness is a great force for good to the extent that the act of forgiving often has a beneficial effect on the victim (such as enabling him or her to let go of the pain and hurt inflicted by the offender), there is little place for forgiveness in the field of criminal law, which punishes offenders on the basis that they have committed criminal acts against the State. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">51 … The forgiveness shown by the victim to the offender should not impinge on the sentence to be passed by the court as forgiveness bears no relation to the liability for punishment.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 However, the Court of Appeal went on to opine that this was subject, <span class="font-italic">possibly</span>, to the two following exceptional situations (see <span class="font-italic">PP v UI </span>at [57]): </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) situations where the sentence imposed on the offender would aggravate the victim’s distress; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) situations where the victim’s forgiveness provided evidence that his or her psychological and/or mental suffering as a result of the offender’s criminal conduct must be very much less than would normally be the case.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Bearing in mind the Court of Appeal’s observations, it is clear that the question for determination is whether either or both of the two exceptional situations listed above are demonstrated on the facts. In the court below, the DJ answered this question in the affirmative, relying primarily on a handwritten letter by the victim which was tendered to the court.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 However, having carefully considered the victim’s letter, I respectfully disagree with the DJ’s findings in this regard. I find that the DJ failed to explain precisely how the quotations she reproduced from the victim’s letter constituted evidence which satisfied the two exceptional situations set out in <span class="font-italic">PP v UI</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In relation to the first situation, I am of the view that there is insufficient evidence to prove that the victim’s distress would be aggravated by the imposition of a custodial term of the length submitted by the Prosecution. The main tenor of the victim’s letter was to express her belief in the respondent’s capacity for change. It went no further than to demonstrate her forgiveness and concern for him. For instance, she wrote: “I do not wish for this charge to have a negative impact on <span class="font-italic">his</span> future, academically and socially.” However, the respondent argues that the victim’s request for the court to have consideration to the impact on the sentence passed as “it might significantly hurt [them] in the planning of [their] future together”, necessarily leads to the inference that she did not wish for the respondent to receive a custodial sentence and that such a sentence would aggravate her distress. I am unable to accept this argument. In my view, this request did not clearly indicate that the victim’s distress would be aggravated on account of the imposition of a short custodial sentence. First, any negative impact which was to be suffered by the victim was framed in tentative terms. Second, the victim did not expressly explain how a short custodial sentence would specifically aggravate her distress, as opposed to any other sentence imposed. Third, I note that the victim herself acknowledged that the respondent had “broke the law” and she “[did] not believe that he should get off without any punishment”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 I acknowledge that imposing a custodial sentence on the respondent may be of some concern to the victim, but it certainly would not aggravate her distress such as to satisfy this exception. I should add that, in the absence of a clear and unequivocal indication that a victim’s distress would be significantly aggravated, this exception is unlikely to be satisfied. A finding that a victim’s distress would be aggravated is more likely to be arrived at in a situation where the sentence to be imposed on the offender is an especially onerous one, for example, where the custodial term is of a considerable length. This high threshold for the application of the exception is, in my view, consistent with the recognition of the general principle that forgiveness should ordinarily not factor into the court’s deliberation of the appropriate sentence to impose in criminal cases.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 In relation to the second situation, I note that the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">PP v</span><span class="font-italic"> UI</span> at [60], had regard to a case commentary in the Criminal Law Review (see [1996] Crim L R 210 at 212) by Lord Bingham CJ of the decision in <span class="font-italic">R v James Kevin</span> <span class="font-italic">Hutchinson</span> (1994) 15 Cr App R (S) 134, which restricted its application to a “limited range of offences only”. In <span class="font-italic">PP v UI</span> itself, the Court of Appeal at [60], held that this limited range of offences would not include the offence of rape committed against a young girl. This was so especially if the victim is the offender’s own child, as public interest requires that the offender be punished with what he deserves, regardless of whether or not the victim displays a relative lack of suffering. I similarly find that this “limited range of offences” does not include the offence committed in the present case. In my view, public interest requires that the respondent be punished in a manner that is commensurate with the seriousness of his criminal conduct, due to the factors discussed above at [27]–[35]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In any event, it bears emphasis that where forgiveness is relevant as a mitigating factor, it merely serves as a <span class="font-italic">moderating</span> influence on the <span class="font-italic">severity</span> of the sentence; it should not in any way determine the <span class="font-italic">type</span> of sentence to be imposed. Ultimately, what should determine the type of sentence to be imposed is the gravity of the offence committed, reflecting the harm caused to the victim, the culpability of the offender and other relevant sentencing principles. Thus, where the custodial threshold has been crossed based on an assessment of these factors, the victim’s forgiveness cannot, and should not, be accorded such significant weight as to justify the imposition of a fine instead. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 A custodial sentence is unquestionably warranted in this case. Such a sustained and vicious act of violence committed against a pregnant victim must be visited with a condign punishment which reflects the gravity of the offence. The criminal justice system functions to protect those who have been or may be victims of violence. The sentence to be imposed must send an unequivocal message to would-be perpetrators that such behaviour is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated by our courts. The sentence must give emphasis to the need for specific and general deterrence, punishment and to reflect society’s strong disapprobation of such conduct. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 Having considered the other mitigating factors present, including the respondent’s plea of guilt and his lack of antecedents, I allow the Prosecution’s appeal against sentence. Although the Prosecution had sought a sentence of <span class="font-italic">at least</span> two weeks’ imprisonment in the court below,

</div> I note that the Prosecution has in this appeal submitted a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment. While I am of the view that a slightly higher imprisonment sentence is justified in this case, I will refrain from imposing it given the adversarial nature of our criminal justice system. </div><div class="txt-body text-justify">48 Therefore, I set aside the fine of $3,500 imposed on the respondent for the sole charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code in MCN-900295-2021 and substitute it with a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment. The fine already paid by the respondent is to be refunded to him.</div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 The respondent is still young, and he has a long road ahead of him. He has expressed a positive desire to change for the better, and I hope that he will learn from this unfortunate experience and become a better person, not only for himself but also for the victim whom he is to marry.

Shortly before the incident, they visited a clinic and discovered that the victim was about nine weeks’ pregnant. They were advised by a doctor to decide, within a week, between proceeding with the pregnancy or opting for an abortion, as there would be a further risk of medical complications if the victim delayed the decision to go for an abortion. A few days after visiting the clinic, the victim stayed overnight at the respondent’s home.<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1)"> However, the next day, they got into an argument while discussing what should be done about the victim’s pregnancy. The argument became heated. The respondent pushed the victim onto his bed and punched and kicked her abdominal area multiple times, and punched her face multiple times, intending to cause hurt to her. Upon hearing the commotion, the respondent’s mother intervened and managed to stop the respondent from further assaulting the victim. </span></div><div class="txt-body justify-content-center"><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,1) ">2 </span>Later that day, the victim was treated at the Department of Emergency Medicine at the National University Hospital.
