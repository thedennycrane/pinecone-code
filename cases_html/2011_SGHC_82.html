<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       In the present action, the plaintiff, Fongsoon
                    Engineering (S) Pte Ltd, claims moneys due to the plaintiff under a lump sum
                    contract for the fabrication and erection of the main structure of the Su Tu
                    Vang switchgear (hereafter referred to as “the Sub-Contract
                    Works”). The other claim relates to variation or additional works
                    requested by the defendant, Kensteel Engineering Pte Ltd. The defendant’s
                    counterclaim against the plaintiff is for expenses incurred by the defendant in
                    rendering assistance to the plaintiff to complete the Sub-Contract Works. Mohd
                    Puad bin Md Isa (“Mohd Puad”), the plaintiff’s business
                    manager, and Ng Chin Hong, commonly known as Francis Ng (“Francis
                    Ng”), the defendant’s chief executive officer, were the only
                    witnesses called to testify for the respective parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The parties’ pleaded cases</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff’s pleaded case is based on a
                    lump sum contract for the Sub-Contract Works. Whilst the defendant rejects in
                    entirety the plaintiff’s claim in the sum of $403,072.74 for variation
                    works, the defendant’s refusal to pay the outstanding progress claims in
                    the sum of $121,621.16 was on account of its counterclaim against the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       In its Defence and Counterclaim, the defendant
                    pleaded that the plaintiff was contractually obliged to complete the
                    Sub-Contract Works by 6 May 2007. However, the plaintiff failed to meet the
                    contractual deadline, and was therefore in breach of contract. The defendant, in
                    adherence to its duty to mitigate following the plaintiff’s breach,
                    proceeded to and did render assistance to the plaintiff to facilitate completion
                    of the Sub-Contract Works as well as rectification of defective works. As a
                    result, the defendant expended the sum of $201,649.53 and is, therefore, seeking
                    payment in its counterclaim against the plaintiff. In addition, the defendant
                    denies issuing any variation orders to the plaintiff. In any event, the
                    defendant’s pleaded case is that the plaintiff was obliged to finish the
                    Sub-Contract Works by a stipulated time, and changes to the work-plan, if any,
                    were due entirely to plaintiff’s obligation to speed up its work after its
                    initial delay. Accordingly, the defendant has denied any responsibility
                    whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       In its Reply and Defence to Counterclaim, the
                    plaintiff denied that it was in breach. It contended that it had a period of ten
                    weeks to complete the Sub-Contract Works, and that the period of ten weeks would
                    not commence until the plaintiff had received all the steel required for the
                    Sub-Contract Works. The defendant only completed its supply of steel sometime in
                    mid April 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">What were the terms of the lump sum contract?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The debate is over the deadline by which the
                    plaintiff was supposed to complete and hand over the Sub-Contract Works.
                    Ordinarily, the applicable deadline can be easily ascertained from the terms of
                    the contract. Unfortunately, the parties were unable to agree on the documents
                    that evidenced the contract between them, or even the date on which a binding
                    contract was formed. As such, the dispute became rather
                protracted.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The defendant maintains that the contract gave
                    the plaintiff a total of ten weeks to complete the Sub-Contract Works, and time
                    would start to run from <em>the commencement of the
                        work</em>. The plaintiff commenced work on 22 February 2007, and
                    the Sub-Contract Works should have been completed by the end of April 2007. In
                    contrast, the plaintiff’s case is premised on a different start date: the
                    ten weeks to complete the Sub-Contract Works was to start from <em>the total receipt of the steel</em>. The defendant’s
                    delivery of the steel material was completed on 20 April 2007. As such the
                    period of ten weeks should start from that April date. In support of its
                    contention, the plaintiff relied on a 3-page document dated 7 March 2007
                    which was signed and initialled by the parties. According to the plaintiff, this
                    3-page document is the contractual documentation governing the rights and
                    obligations of the parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       This dispute came about because of the inclusion
                    of an additional term shortly <em>after</em> the defendant
                    had signed the 3-page document and then <em>passed</em> it
                    on for the plaintiff’s execution. A good starting point is to examine the
                    course of the correspondence between the parties to determine the date on which
                    the contract between them was concluded, as well as the terms contained within
                    that contract.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Initial quotation by the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       On 24 January 2007, the defendant sent an e-mail
                    to the plaintiff attaching the terms and conditions and the schedule of work.
                    The plaintiff was specifically asked to review the terms and conditions and to
                    revert with its comments, if any. The plaintiff’s witness, Mohd Puad,
                    confirmed that the terms and conditions referred to in the e-mail of
                    24 January 2007 were attached to the e-mail and received by the plaintiff.
                    He identified the documents exhibited in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief at
                    pages 36 to 54 as the terms and conditions received by the
                        plaintiff.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_1" id="Ftn_1_1"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The documents in question
                    comprised “Exhibit A - Form of Agreement, Part II - Sub-contract terms
                    and conditions (hereafter referred to as “the STC”). In reply, the
                    plaintiff on 30 January 2007 quoted a total price of $480,000 excluding GST
                    and wrote:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Letter of intent</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 9 February 2007, the defendant e-mailed its
                    Letter of Intent to the plaintiff. The Letter of Intent read as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We are preparing the subcontract agreement (Draft will be email to you for

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     I should mention that the usage of letters of
                    intent that give rise to some limited rights and liabilities is common in the
                    construction business. Typically, the employer states that it intends to enter
                    into a contract with the contractor and requires the contractor to start work
                    while the formal contractual documentation is being prepared. Ultimately, the
                    full effect of any letter of intent depends entirely on the objective meaning of
                    the language used as well as the context in which it was given.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In my judgment, the Letter of Intent coupled
                    with the defendant’s e-mail of 9 February 2007 make up the
                    defendant’s offer for the Sub-Contract Works. The terms of the offer were
                    those set out in the e-mail, Letter of Intent and the STC. I should add that the
                    document entitled “Scope of Work” and dated 23 January 2007
                    was exhibited by Mohd Puad in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief at p58. The
                    witness confirmed that it was provided to the plaintiff by the defendant via
                    e-mail of 24 January 2007.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_2" id="Ftn_2_1"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Mohd Puad
                    also confirmed that the Scope of Work mentioned in item 1 of the Letter of
                    Intent was referable to the document at p58 of his written evidence.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> For present purposes, under the Scope

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     In my view, the plaintiff’s e-mail reply
                    of 10 February 2007 was a counter-offer which was accepted by the defendant on
                    12 February 2007. The text in blue did not contain counter proposals, but
                    rather the defendant’s attempts at stating its understanding of the
                    ambiguous and imprecisely worded terms put forward by the plaintiff. In my
                    judgment, a concluded and binding contract was therefore formed between the
                    parties on 12 February 2007, the terms of which included:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendant’s STC (see
                            <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above); and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_16-p2_b"></a>(b)     the Letter of Intent and e-mail of
                        9 February 2007 (see [9]-[10]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Subsequent events</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     On 13 February 2007, the plaintiff in an
                    e-mail attempted to change the payment terms. It also tried to add other
                    conditions like liquidated damages for late completion, and incentives for early
                    completion. The defendant did not reply to this e-mail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 15 February 2007, the defendant sent the
                    plaintiff an undated copy of the contract (“the Contract”) via
                    e-mail. The e-mail read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Dear Edmund,</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Refer to Letter of intent given to you. Attached is the contract which we
                        will be signing for the contract of structural fabrication. Pls review and
                        confirm agreement and we will make the original for signature.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The original copy of the Contract was
                    pre-signed by the defendant and forwarded to the plaintiff for execution.
                    Shortly thereafter, the defendant by e-mail dated 17 February 2007
                    requested the plaintiff to send its workers to the worksite on 22 February
                    2007 for a safety induction, as well as to commence the cutting of steel. The
                    plaintiff’s personnel showed up at the yard as instructed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     The plaintiff signed the Contract, dated it
                    7 March 2007, and returned it to the defendant on a date which the
                    defendant’s witness could not recall.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Unbeknown
                    to the defendant, the plaintiff’s Edmund See had handwritten against the
                    provision in the Contract that the “delivery time” was to be
                    “10 weeks end of April 2007”, the following:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(To be revised – 10 weeks from total receipt of raw material)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff’s attempt to change the
                    completion date to a later one was unilateral. It was ineffective as it was
                    inserted well after the contract had been concluded, and without the prior
                    knowledge and consent of the defendant. There is no evidence that after the
                    Contract was returned, the defendant had by conduct subsequently agreed to the
                    plaintiff’s revision.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     To summarise, the defendant’s e-mail of
                    9 February 2007 required “the Fabrication and erection schedule to be
                    completed by 10 weeks”. There is no dispute that this referred to
                    completion of the Sub-Contract Works within ten weeks from commencement of work,
                    as Puad had candidly admitted to this during cross-examination.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Accordingly, I hold that the plaintiff was
                    contractually obliged to complete the Sub-Contract Works within ten weeks of
                    commencement, starting from 22 February 2007. However, matters developed
                    into the second dispute.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Delay</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The second dispute between the parties
                    resolves around the issue of whether the plaintiff or the defendant was
                    responsible for the delay in the plaintiff’s completion of the
                    Sub-Contract Works. Although the defendant did not make any claim for damages
                    for the plaintiff’s late completion of the construction works, a
                    substantial part of its counterclaim against the plaintiff was for time and
                    money expended in helping the plaintiff to speed up the Sub-Contract Works.
                    Naturally, if I find that the defendant was responsible for the
                    plaintiff’s late completion of the Sub-Contract Works, then that part of
                    its counterclaim against the plaintiff would fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     I note that there was no extension of time
                    clause in the contractual documents. In the absence of such a clause, an
                    employer would not be allowed to insist on completion by the due date if he was
                    responsible for part of the delay, and he would not be able to rely on any
                    liquidated damages clause (see generally <em>Dodd v
                        Churton</em> [1897] 1 QB 562; <em>Trollope
                        &amp; Colls v North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board</em>
                    [1973] 1 WLR 601). In common parlance, time is said to be “at
                    large”.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Even though time for completion is at large,
                    the contractor has to complete the works within a reasonable period. If the
                    contractor fails to do so, the employer will be able to sue to recover general
                    damages resulting from the contractor’s breach (see per Salmon LJ in
                        <em>Peak Construction (Liverpool) Ltd v McKinney Foundations
                        Ltd</em> (1970) 1 BLR 114 at 121). What constitutes a
                    reasonable time is a question of fact. As a guide, how the courts in some cases
                    have determined the period of reasonable time is by simply adding the effect of
                    the employer’s delay to the contractual deadline. This is usually regarded
                    as a fair method because it is able to strike an appropriate balance between not
                    allowing the employer to take advantage of its own fault, and not giving the
                    contractor any other additional time other than that caused by the
                    employer’s delay (see generally <em>Balfour Beatty
                        Construction Ltd v London Borough of Lambeth</em> [2002]
                    1 BLR 288).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     The contractor has the burden of proving that
                    the employer’s actions caused the delay in completing the works. In
                        <em>John Doyle Construction Ltd v Laing Management
                        (Scotland)</em> Ltd 2004 S.L.T. 678, the court held at
                        [35]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Ordinarily, in order to make a relevant claim for contractual loss and
                        expense under a construction contract (or a common law claim for damages)
                        the pursuer must aver (1) the occurrence of an event for which the defender
                        bears legal responsibility, (2) that he has suffered loss or incurred
                        expense, and (3) that the loss or expense was caused by the event. In some
                        circumstances, relatively commonly in the context of construction contracts,
                        a whole series of events occur which individually would form the basis of a
                        claim for loss and expense. These events may interreact with each other in
                        very complex ways, so that it becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to
                        identify what loss and expense each event has caused. The emergence of such
                        a difficulty does not, however, absolve the pursuer from the need to aver
                        and prove the causal connections between the events and the loss and
                        expense.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As the passage quoted above made it clear,
                    causation is not easy to prove. Even if the employer’s actions prevented
                    the contractor from working on a certain part of the project, but the contractor
                    was nevertheless still able to continue to work uninterrupted elsewhere, the
                    courts might not find that the employer had caused any delay to the contractor.
                    To succeed, the contractor would have to prove that the works had to be
                    completed in a sequential manner, and that no work could be done until the
                    employer’s default had abated or resolved. The difficulty with discharging
                    the burden of proof explains why many construction contracts have provisions
                    allowing a neutral party like an assessor to determine whether or not there has
                    been delay by the employer, and its resulting effects. If the dispute ends up in
                    court, expert evidence often plays an important part in determining whether the
                    employer’s default has caused the delay which the contractor
                    alleges.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The plaintiff’s allegations of delay
                    fall into four main categories. They are:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The defendant’s failure to supply steel to
                            the worksite on time;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The defendant’s change of
                        plans;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The defendant’s failure to provide proper
                            equipment on the worksite on time; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">The stop orders issued by the defendant’s
                            client.</div>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(a)   The defendant’s failure to send steel to the worksite
                on time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiff’s allegation is that the
                    quantity of steel on the worksite was insufficient for its workers to commence
                    work on 22 February 2007. In addition, the supply of steel to the worksite
                    was intermittent, and it was only until 21 April 2007 that the supply of
                    steel was completed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     For its part, the defendant conceded in its
                    closing submissions that it was late in supplying some of the steel to the
                    worksite. However, by 16 March 2007, at least, 80% of the steel was already
                    been sent to the worksite.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Hence, the defendant submits
                    that the period of ten weeks to complete the Sub-Contract Works commenced from
                    16 March 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     I now turn to examine the alleged delay caused
                    by the defendant after 16 March 2007. I begin with the project schedule
                    sent to the plaintiff on 24 January 2007. The relevant portion of the
                    schedule states:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     During cross-examination, Mohd Puad admitted
                    that by 16 March 2007, the plaintiff had only managed to cut 30% of the
                    primary steel that was on the worksite.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> His
                    testimony is borne out by the plaintiff’s own first progress claim of
                    20 March 2007, whereby the plaintiff invoiced the defendant the sum of
                    $30,219.97 for 30% of work done on the 68.526 tons of primary steel. In light of
                    this, and on account of the plaintiff’s inability to explain why its
                    workers did not work on the remaining 70% of the primary steel that was
                    available at the worksite by 16 March 2007, it is reasonable for the court
                    to draw the inference that there is no correlation between the defendant’s
                    late delivery of steel material and the plaintiff’s work progress. The
                    evidence points to the plaintiff’s inability to complete the Sub-Contract
                    Works seeing the quantities of primary and secondary steel available to the
                    plaintiff on the worksite as at 16 March 2007. I therefore reject the
                    plaintiff’s first complaint as baseless.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(b)   Change of construction plans by the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The plaintiff blames the changes made to the
                    construction plans many times during the Sub-Contract Works, thereby causing
                    further delays in the work process and progress.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The first set of project drawings was issued
                    by the defendant to the plaintiff on 15 January 2007, and it related to the
                    general scope of the plaintiff’s work.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> On
                    20 March 2007, the defendant issued a second set of drawings to the
                    plaintiff, and it related to the floor beam details. The first and second sets
                    of drawings were for different aspects of the Sub-Contract Works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Mohd Puad admitted in cross-examination that
                    the second set of drawings did not change the instructions in the first set of
                    drawings, and that the plaintiff could still use the first set of drawings to
                    carry out the Sub-Contract Works.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_11" id="Ftn_11_1"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     On 22 March 2007, the defendant issued a third
                    set of drawings to the plaintiff which related to the lower floor framing and
                    the floor beam details. Even at this stage, the changes to the construction
                    plans did not affect or disrupt the plaintiff’s work progress because as
                    Mohd Puad admitted at paragraph 20 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the
                    plaintiff only started the fabrication work on 22 March 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     On 2 April 2007, a fourth set of drawings was
                    issued to the plaintiff. Mohd Puad admitted in cross-examination that those
                    drawings only required some minor changes to the entire floor beam
                        details.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_12" id="Ftn_12_1"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Furthermore, there is no
                    evidence that the plaintiff had even started work on the floor beam at the time
                    the fourth set of drawings was issued.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     On 19 April 2007, a fifth set of drawings was
                    issued to the plaintiff. It related to the roof beam details. Mohd Puad admitted
                    during cross- examination that the plaintiff had not started work on the roof
                    beam at the time the fifth set of drawings was issued.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_13" id="Ftn_13_1"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     The last allegation was that the defendant
                    required some amendments to the requirements for the padeye (lifting eye
                    section) on 5 June 2007. This allegation turned out to be a red herring
                    because Mohd Puad admitted during cross-examination that the amendments were
                    actually given to the plaintiff on 18 April 2007, and as such, the
                    plaintiff’s progress was not affected at all.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_14" id="Ftn_14_1"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In light of Mohd Puad’s evidence, the
                    plaintiff’s allegation that the defendant’s changes to the
                    construction plans caused delays to the plaintiff is unfounded and must
                    fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">(c)   The defendant’s failure to provide equipment at the
                worksite on time</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The plaintiff’s allegation that there
                    was insufficient equipment on the worksite is entirely bereft of details. No
                    details were given as to the kind of equipment that were supposedly lacking, the
                    time period in which they were lacking, and to what extent the plaintiff’s
                    work was held up and, hence, delayed as a consequence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Again the allegation assumes that the
                    defendant was contractually obliged to supply the equipment. The contractual
                    documents do not stipulate the type and number of equipment to be supplied by
                    the defendant. One finds some hints in the copy of the Contract sent to the
                    plaintiff on 9 Feb 2007:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Work scope</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">a) welding test</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">b) one supervisor</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">c) welder and fitter</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">d) cutting torch</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">e) PPE</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">f) Including the supply of grinding machine</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1"> </p>

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">d) gases</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">e) testing for weld and welders</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">f) painting</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Beyond that list headed “Work exclude”, nothing more was
                    stipulated elsewhere after 9 February 2007. It is not unreasonable to
                    construe every item listed there as the responsibility of the defendant to
                    supply at its cost when so required by the plaintiff for the Sub-Contract Works.
                    The other list of items under “Work scope” was to be provided by
                    the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     Throughout the period of March to May 2007,
                    Mohd Puad agreed during cross-examination that there was sufficient material and
                    equipment on- site for the plaintiff’s work. In fact, the plaintiff issued
                    three progress claims in respect of the following areas of Sub-Contract
                    Works:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     I was referred to the plaintiff’s e-mail
                    of 24 May 2007 as proof that the defendant did not provide the plaintiff with
                    equipment at the worksite. The e-mail read as follows:</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Taking the e-mail at its face value, what
                    seems to have happened is that the plaintiff had fallen behind in the progress
                    of its work and the defendant proposed a recovery plan that was supposed to help
                    the plaintiff speed up its work. The equipment that the defendant promised to
                    give to the plaintiff by 10 May 2007 was pursuant to the proposed recovery
                    plan, and not based on the original contract. Accordingly, this e-mail does not
                    assist the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     In conclusion, the plaintiff’s
                    allegation that the defendant had failed to provide it with sufficient equipment
                    at the worksite is without merit and baseless.</p>

          <b><em>The stop orders issued by
                        the defendant’s client</em></b>
</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The plaintiff’s allegation is that the
                    defendant’s client had issued a stop order due to safety issues on the
                    worksite. Details of the stop order were not given in Mohd Puad’s
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief. However, an e-mail from him to the defendant
                    dated 19 June 2007 read as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Hi Mond;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The stop work order by your client on the roof section and other areas due
                        to scaffold and other related issues, will definitely slowing down the
                        process of completing the work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I really don’t understand why now then they come to give such
                        comments and demand. This should be addressed much earlier during the
                        initial start of work.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Please assist to look into this matter immediately by engaging a full time
                        scaffold erector &amp; supervisor at site to avoid all this stoppage of
                        work.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The plaintiff did not give evidence on how
                    long the stop order lasted, what aspects of the work the stop order related to,
                    or what impact the stop order had on the plaintiff’s work. Accordingly, I
                    reject the plaintiff’s complaint for being too sketchy and vague to merit
                    serious consideration.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In conclusion, I find that the defendant was
                    responsible for the delay arising from the fact that the steel materials to be
                    supplied were sent to the worksite on 16 March 2007. The contractual
                    deadline of ten weeks beginning from 22 February 2007 was no longer binding
                    on the plaintiff. In its place, I hold that the plaintiff was obliged to
                    complete the construction work within a reasonable time, which would be ten
                    weeks starting from 16 March 2007 through to end May 2007. However, the
                    Sub-Contract Works were only completed on 11 August 2007. In the premises,
                    the plaintiff was in breach of its obligation to complete the Sub-Contract Works
                    within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The plaintiff’s claim for variation works</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     The plaintiff is claiming a substantial amount
                    for variations works requested by the defendant. They were oral variation orders
                    for the completion of certain works. Details of the variation works were
                    particularised in:</p>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(a)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Invoice number 170177 dated 17 July 2007 for
                            a sum of $28,643.90;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(b)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Invoice number 170178 dated 17 July 2007 for
                            a sum of $10,785.60;</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(c)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Invoice number 170179 dated 17 July 2007 for
                            a sum of $4,269.30; and</div>
<p><div class="Judg-List-1-No">(d)</div><div class="Judg-List-1-Item">Attachment 1 dated 10 September 2007 for a
                            sum of $403, 072.74.</div>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     The defendant denies the claim for several
                    reasons. First, there was no variation order issued to the plaintiff. Second,
                    the items which the plaintiff had billed the defendant fell within the scope of
                    works which the plaintiff had agreed to complete under the lump sum contract. I
                    will deal with the first reason now. A determination in favour of the defendant
                    disposes of the liability issue completely.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     Clause 5 of the Contract (see <a href="#p1_18">[18]</a> above) states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the event of delaying the completion of the aforesaid work, the
                        Sub-Contractor shall ensure it shall bear its own cost in the execution of
                        the aforesaid work. In the event there are variations to the aforesaid work,
                        the Contractor shall issue new variation order to the Sub Contractor and the
                        Sub Contractor shall comply with the new variation order in an appropriate
                        and diligent manner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In addition, clause 3.8 of the STC (see
                        <a href="#p1_8">[8]</a> above) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">SUB-CONTRACTOR shall submit such variations to the SUB-CONTRACT WORK
                        whenever by way of additions, modifications or omissions the variation may
                        be:</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">a)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Ordered by JRMAP under the Main Contract and
                            confirmed in writing to SUB-CONTRACTOR by CONTRACTOR; or</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">b)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Agreed to be made by JRMAP and CONTRACTOR and
                            confirmed in writing to SUB-CONTRACTOR by CONTRACTOR; or</span></p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-1"><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-No">c)</span><span class="Judg-QuoteList-1-Item">Ordered in writing by CONTRACTOR</span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     The plain wording of clause 3.8 requires a
                    variation order to be in writing. Clause 5 as a matter of construction also
                    contemplates, from the use of the word “issue”, the existence of a
                    written variation order from the defendant. The plaintiff has not produced any
                    written variation order issued by the defendant. A written variation order is a
                    condition precedent for any claim by the plaintiff for payment of any additional
                    or varied work done. The plaintiff is not entitled to payment of any of its
                    claims for variation works since there were no written instructions from the
                    defendant. As an aside, the plaintiff did not establish any verbal instructions
                    for variation works in any case. In the premises, the claim for variation works
                    is fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The defendant’s counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     The defendant’s counterclaim against the
                    plaintiff consists of two separate claims. The claim of $69,911.13 is for costs
                    incurred when it had to provide additional workers to assist the plaintiff in
                    rectifying defectives, and to make up for the delay that had been caused by the
                    plaintiff’s slow progress (“first counterclaim”). The other
                    claim of $131,738.40 is for costs incurred in assisting the plaintiff to weld 12
                    of the 24 lifting padeye box stiffeners that the plaintiff was supposed to
                    complete ($32,400.00), as well as for conducting rectification works on the
                    floor of the fabrication structure ($90,720.00) (“second
                    counterclaim”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     In relation to the defendant’s first
                    counterclaim for $69,911.13, it is noteworthy that the plaintiff has accepted
                    this claim as justified. The statement of account sent by the plaintiff to the
                    defendant on 1 October 2007 showed the plaintiff’s acceptance of the
                    defendant’s claim, and had even used the said amount to set off the sums
                    which it said were owed by the defendant (or so it thought). In the
                    circumstances, the defendant’s first counterclaim of $69,911.13 against
                    the plaintiff is allowed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     This leaves the defendant’s second
                    counterclaim of $131,738.40. There are two parts to this second counterclaim.
                    The first sub-claim is for costs incurred in assisting the plaintiff to weld 12
                    of the 24 lifting padeye box stiffeners that the plaintiff was supposed to
                    complete ($32,400.00), and the second sub-claim is for conducting rectification
                    works to the floor of the fabrication structure ($90,720.00).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     As regards the first sub-claim, it is
                    noteworthy that nowhere in Mohd Puad’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief did
                    he challenge the defendant’s witness, Francis Ng, on his testimony that
                    the defendant had completed 12 of 24 lifting padeye stiffeners that were
                    supposed to be completed by the plaintiff. In fact, the plaintiff’s
                    counsel did not cross-examine Francis Ng nor challenge his evidence on this.
                    Applying the principle enunciated in <em>Browne v Dunn</em>
                    (1893) 6 R 57, I am entitled to hold that the plaintiff has accepted
                    Francis Ng’s evidence on this issue. Accordingly, I allow the
                    defendant’s claim of $32,400.00 against the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Turning now to the rectification works, the
                    plaintiff’s position, as stated in paragraph 21 of Mohd Puad’s
                    affidavit of evidence-in-chief, was that although the floor framing was uneven,
                    it did not constitute a breach of contract. It backed up its position with a
                    survey report prepared by one of the defendant’s employees, Yuly Satiawan,
                    where the said employee had mentioned that the calculation was adequate for
                    presentation to the defendant’s client. Furthermore, even if the defendant
                    had conducted some rectification work to even out the unlevel or sagging floor
                    framing, it was voluntary and had nothing to do with the
                plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     On the other hand, the defendant’s
                    stance was that the survey report prepared by its employee had been made purely
                    for the purpose of showing that the fabrication structure could be lifted to the
                    quay side of the defendant’s yard. It did not, however, show that the
                    fabrication structure had been satisfactorily constructed. Furthermore, the
                    plaintiff did not dispute that the defendant had carried out some rectification
                    work to the floor framing.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_15" id="Ftn_15_1"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     From the contemporaneous correspondence
                    between the parties, I have no doubts that the defendant had recorded its
                    dissatisfaction with the uneven floor framing and its intention to rectify the
                    defects on multiple occasions. On 17 August 2007, the defendant had sent a
                    letter by fax to the plaintiff complaining about the unevenness of the floor
                    framing. The letter was written in the following terms:</p>

                    counterclaim. In that e-mail, the defendant indicated to the plaintiff its
                    intention to make further claims against the plaintiff for the cost of welding
                    the 12 lifting padeye stiffeners, and for rectification of uneven or sagging

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     Mohd Puad admitted in cross-examination that
                    the defendant had carried out substantial rectification work to the floor

                    would have no reason to undertake such works if there were no defects to the
                    floor frame at all. For instance, shimp plates were added to fill the gaps
                    between floor and equipment supports due to uneven floor framing. All in all,
                    there was credible evidence of the existence of defects, and rectification of
                    the same by the defendant. The uneven floor framing was due to the
                    plaintiff’s defective or shoddy workmanship.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     In its Defence and Counterclaim, the defendant
                    is claiming $90,720.00 being the cost of rectifying the uneven floor framing. As
                    stated in the e-mail of 3 September 2007, the claim is only for labour
                    supplied. I noticed that the plaintiff had not challenged the defendant’s
                    quantum at the trial even though no details were given. I sought clarification
                    from counsel on 16 February 2011. For their mutual benefit and in the
                    interest of expediency and cost, I directed the defendant to provide the
                    documentary particulars of its claim within a week with liberty to the plaintiff
                    to respond by way of an affidavit to whatever documentary particulars the
                    defendant might produce. If cross-examination was required by the parties, leave
                    of court had to be sought by 7 March 2011.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     On 24 February 2011, counsel for the defendant
                    filed an affidavit which was affirmed by the managing director of the defendant,
                    Tsai Heng Een (“Tsai”), in respect of the expenses incurred by the
                    defendant in rectifying the defective floor framing. In his written statement,
                    Tsai deposed that he was able to locate documentary evidence in support of
                    $78,023.71 and not $90,720.00. The plaintiff did not file any reply affidavit
                    nor sought leave to cross-examine Tsai.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The documents attached to Tsai’s
                    affidavit included cheques paid out by the defendant to third parties for work
                    done, as well as the time sheets to show the period when the work was done. The
                    time sheets were for work done in the period stretching from as early as
                    22 May 2007 up to 6 September 2007. On reviewing the documents, it was
                    clear to me that not all the documents were for the rectification work. The
                    survey report prepared by Yuly Satiawan on the adequacy of the calculations
                    relating to the floor of the building structure was dated 11 August 2007.
                    Any rectification work done by the defendant to the floor must have been done
                    after 11 August 2007, or more precisely, after 17 August 2007, when
                    notice of the defects were first brought to the attention of the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     Given this state of affairs, the best case for
                    the defendant would be for me to accept that all the expenses incurred by the
                    defendant after 17 August 2007 (as shown by the cheques and the timesheets)
                    were for the purpose of rectifying the uneven floor. Based on the documents
                    produced by Tsai, there are 4 sets of expenses that were incurred by the
                    defendant in respect of work done after 17 August 2007. These are</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_a"></a>(a)     Amount of $3,313.08 paid as salary
                        to Yip Wing Koo and Leong Sek Khan for 406 hours of casual labour
                        supplied;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_b"></a>(b)     Amount of $2,295.00 paid as salary to Yu Chee Hoe and Fong Kun Fatt for 165
                        hours of casual labour supplied;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_c"></a>(c)     Amount of $3,400.00 (UOB Cheque No.383217) paid to
                        Express Engineering Pte Ltd for 340 hours of labour supplied;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_67-p2_d"></a>(d)     Pro-rated
                        amount of $18,947.50 [(2056.5-161.75)/2056.5 x $20,565] paid to Express
                        Engineering Pte Ltd for 1,894.75 hours of labour
                    supplied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These four sets of expenses add up to
                    $27,955.58.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff is
                    liable to the defendant for the sum of $27,955.58 in respect of the expenses
                    incurred by the defendant in rectifying the defective flooring.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Results</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     For the reasons given, I hold:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendant is liable to pay to
                        the plaintiff the balance of the contract sum of $121,621.16;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_69-p2_b"></a>(b)     the plaintiff
                        is liable to the defendant under its Counterclaim for the sums of
                        $69,911.13, $32,400.00, and $27,955.58 (being the cost of providing extra
                        workers to make up for the delay caused by the plaintiff’s slow
                        progress, the cost of welding 12 lifting padeye box stiffeners, and the cost
                        of rectifying the defective flooring, respectively). This adds up to a total
                        figure of $130,266.71.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">After setting off the figures in
                    (a) and (b), the plaintiff has to pay the defendant a sum of $8,645.55.
                    Accordingly, there be judgment for the defendant in the sum of $8,645.55. I make
                    no order on interest.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     As both parties have succeeded substantially
                    against each other in respect of their claims, I order each party to pay its own
                    costs.</p>
