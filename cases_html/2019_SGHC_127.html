While there were perhaps strands of evidence that pointed to a suspicion of breaches by the defendants in the Suits, this was not enough to bring the plaintiff over the requisite evidential threshold. The strength of the inferences drawn from the evidence was not to the extent that it was more likely than not that the plaintiff’s assertions were true, as opposed to the alternative explanations proffered by the defendants. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Much of the parties’ cases turned on the strength of the respective sides’ expert evidence. To this end, concurrent evidence sessions were held for the software and forensic experts. The approach adopted here was as follows. The experts first summarised their positions in presentations. Based on these presentations, counsel identified issues that remained contentious, which set the parameters for the witness conferencing that followed. The contested issues were then raised in sequence. The plaintiff’s expert would raise matters directly to the defendants’ expert for his response or clarification; the plaintiff’s expert would afterwards be given time to make further responses. Finally, the defendants’ expert would raise any further points on that specific topic for the plaintiff’s expert to respond to. Given the technical nature of the canvassed matters, I was of the view that this format permitted the experts to raise matters directly to the court rather than through counsel, and allowed them to reach consensus where possible, or otherwise to identify more clearly the areas of contention between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 In general, I preferred the defendants’ expert evidence in respect of the questions of both coding and forensics. I found the defendants’ experts’ opinions to generally be more cogent, in terms of their explanations and reasoning. I would emphasise, however, that I did not find that the plaintiff’s experts’ testimony was in any way partial or in breach of the obligation owed to the court, as the defendants contended in their submissions.

While the plaintiff showed that the defendants had access to its materials, there was no substantial copying of the plaintiff’s software and source codes in the generation of Nice Payroll’s various databases, templates, and other files and documents.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 I had some sympathy for the defendants on this point; the plaintiff’s pleadings could have been clearer as to which of the defendants’ materials allegedly infringed its copyright. However, the ultimate question at the end of the day was whether the plaintiff’s pleadings were sufficient: see <span class="font-italic">Invenpro</span><span class="font-italic"> (M) Sdn Bhd v JCS Automation Pte Ltd and another</span> [2014] 2 SLR 1045 (“<span class="font-italic">Invenpro</span>”) at [127]. This issue arose in <span class="font-italic">Global Yellow Pages Ltd v </span><span class="font-italic">Promedia Directories Pte Ltd and another matter </span>[2017] 2 SLR 185 (“<span class="font-italic">Global Yellow Pages</span>”) at [54] to [56], where the Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court that the statement of claim in question had been framed in sufficiently broad and general terms as to include a temporary database which had not been referenced in the initial pleadings. The Court of Appeal noted as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">54    Promedia submits that the Judge erred in holding that the temporary database was covered by GYP’s pleadings. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">55    We agree with Promedia’s argument. The statement of claim (“SOC”) states that the infringing works comprised Promedia’s directories, which are the Online Directory, the printed form directories and the Green Book CD-ROM. … The use of “namely” (instead of “including”) suggests that the list of allegedly infringing works is exhaustive, while the lack of any reference or allusion to databases suggest that they were not regarded as infringing works. In this respect, we respectfully disagree with the Judge, who held at [367] of the Judgment that the SOC was framed in sufficiently broad and general terms such that the temporary database could be regarded as an infringing work. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The result in <span class="font-italic">Global Yellow Pages</span> turned on the use of the word “namely”, which suggested that the list of infringing materials contained in the statement of claim was exhaustive. The present case, however, differs. Given the interlinked nature of the causes of actions and looking at the pleadings as a whole, I found that the defendant was not prejudiced by any insufficient particularity in the pleadings. Critically, the plaintiff’s case in relation to breach of confidence asserted that the defendants had reproduced and copied its confidential information and materials as listed at Annex C.

In the context of compilations, the compiler must exercise sufficient creativity in selecting or arranging the material within the compilation. The resulting copyright only protects the original expression in the form of the selection or arrangement of the material.

To this end, I considered <span class="font-italic">Asia Pacific Publishing</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>where a body corporate asserted authorship over horse-racing information organised in various tables. The respondent could only identify its employees as having gathered and organised the information and data in the tables (at [77]); the Court of Appeal found that such facilitative work did not amount to authorship: at [78]. As the collection, organisation and selection of data were done by separate people, each individual employee’s contribution (which had not been particularised) was insufficient to render them an author or joint authors of the tables: at [79]. The Court of Appeal also considered that the respondents might have been unable to identify authors as a high degree of automation might have been involved in compiling the tables: at [81]. In the circumstances, without the identification of a human author, there could be no “original work” capable of copyright protection, and the respondent’s claim that copyright subsisted in the tables that were “authored” by it failed: at [82].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 This, however, was not a case where it was seriously disputed that some human intellectual input resulted in the creation of the Category 1 materials.

The criteria for originality within the meaning of ss 7A and 27 of the Copyright Act requires merely that the work was independently created by the author and that it possesses some minimal degree of creativity: see <span class="font-italic">Global Yellow Pages</span> at [15].

In comparison, Nice Payroll’s software architecture was written in APEX, an application development tool that ran within the Oracle database. Nice Payroll’s data, application logic and user interface were stored in and on the Oracle database. Nice Payroll’s application development required the application logic (code) to be written in PL/SQL.

Much of Nice Payroll’s PL/SQL code was automatically generated by the APEX application builder used by its human programmers, which meant that the actual code written by its programmers was even smaller. A great deal of effort would have been required to reproduce the plaintiff’s code by translating it into a different language and then shrinking it.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The plaintiff made extensive use of Java’s language features, Java being a much more powerful programming language than PL/SQL. The difference in programming languages meant that the plaintiff’s program could not be meaningfully compared to Nice Payroll’s.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The plaintiff isolated its database by client. This allowed it to engage in specific database customisation. Its SQL queries were embedded into its Java code and called upon multiple database tables. In comparison, Nice Payroll’s client data was stored in a single database and its PL/SQL code was integrated with its SQL queries and called on a single database schema.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) The core functionality in the two payroll systems differed. For instance, the payroll calculation algorithms differed: the plaintiff’s Java code computed payrolls at the individual payroll item level, sequentially processing each employee’s payroll; Nice Payroll’s algorithm computed payrolls at the employee level, computing payroll items per employee. As the inner and outer loops for calculation were completely different, the plaintiff’s code would have required complete rewriting to be converted into Nice Payroll’s.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">In addition, the database architectures of the two systems differed: the plaintiff’s software included more schemas and tables, the contents of the database tables were organised differently, and different primary keys were used.

As I noted above at [50], what distinguished the plaintiff’s software was its organisation of its database architecture and its development of its source codes. The defendants’ expert evidence demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that Nice Payroll’s software was so fundamentally different that it could not have been copied from the plaintiff’s. To the extent that some similarities existed across the two systems, I accepted the defendants’ position that any similarities in Nice Payroll’s software and payroll output could be attributed to the functional and statutory requirements that informed what payroll reports should generally contain.

</div> The defendants responded that Mr Pillay should have compared the source codes before reaching a conclusion. They explained that Nice Payroll’s code read from the “Employee ID” field to minimise human error, and that the “Employee Name” field was retained to assist persons reading and uploading spreadsheets into the database. From a computer science viewpoint, the two codes were different as they were based on different algorithms involving different error handling and processing logic.

An assessment of its similarity to the plaintiff’s payitem database tables required consideration of the development and design of the respective source codes; Mr Pillay’s focus on whether “PR_PAYITEM” was referred to in Nice Payroll’s source codes was irrelevant since the source codes would necessarily draw on the data contained in the database tables to operate and produce output.

</div> He concluded that Nice Payroll’s code differed from the plaintiff’s in that it did not include the non-statutory “hard-coded” payitems found in the plaintiff’s code. He explained that most payitems are generic and simply serve as data to be drawn upon by the code; they are added or deducted from an employee’s payroll computation. However, certain payitems may be hard-coded if they require specific computation: code may be written to cater for a particular statutory computation. The plaintiff’s codes referred to at least 21 statutory and two non-statutory hard-coded payitems; Nice Payroll’s only included 12 statutory hard-coded payitems. Furthermore, the defendants’ payitem bible used a naming convention that contained more information that the plaintiff’s.

</div> The defendants concluded that as the source code’s logic differed such that the parties’ database tables were used differently in their respective software, no copying had occurred. Any similarities that Nice Payroll’s payitem database table had to the plaintiff’s Payitem Bibles were explained by the fact that the data contained therein reflected what was found in the relevant statutory rules.

The question of whether substantial copying has occurred must consider what makes the copyrighted material original. I mentioned at [71] that the plaintiff’s database tables were original by dint of the creative effort invested to organise the relevant information into a format suitable for computer processing. It was therefore relevant to consider whether the defendants’ organisation of the database tables – both within the database schema and <span class="font-italic">vis-à-vis</span> the source code – was a reproduction of the plaintiff’s. I found Mr Pillay’s assessment of the defendants’ emails to be irrelevant to this analysis, and preferred Prof Yap’s evidence instead. It was on the basis of the latter that I was satisfied that differences in the naming conventions and the number and type of hard-coded payitems sufficiently distinguished Nice Payroll’s payitem database table from the plaintiff’s, and that no copying could be said to have occurred. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(2) CPF database tables</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 Parties took similar positions as regards the CPF database tables.

</div> Conversely, the defendants identified differences between the tables: Nice Payroll’s CPF database table was a more compact reformulation of the CPF Board rules, and had 17 columns to the plaintiff’s 24. Nice Payroll’s CPF calculation rules also involved algebraically equivalent but different arithmetic computations that optimised the CPF Board rules, resulting in more streamlined and simpler formulae.

The first instance court held that the appellant company’s computer, hard disk and office hours were not “specially provided” for the respondent to create the copyrighted works for the appellant company. The Shanghai Intellectual Property Court upheld this decision on appeal. It held that “material and technical resources” within the meaning of Art 16 referred to the “legal entity or other organisation specially [providing] funds, equipment or information and materials for the citizen to complete the creation(s)”. The created works had not required “special and specialised equipment … for their specific expressions”.

</div> The defendants’ expert criticised the use of these timings as creating inconsistency: the “last saved” timings only showed that changes happened within a particular file, and did not reflect whether these changes were substantive: for instance, merely navigating back and forth within a file would cause the “last saved” timing to be updated.

</div> The plaintiff’s expert’s response was that these timings were biased towards showing that Mr Liu only worked on the file outside of his working hours: the “last written” timing only shows when a back-up file is created, and cannot indicate when the codes contained therein were last written or worked on. Mr Liu could have worked on the Kikocci files during office hours, saving and exporting them after he ended work.

But what seemed more methodologically concerning was the fact that the forensic experts were only able to analyse the deleted Kikocci files that were successfully recovered. As the plaintiff’s forensic expert observed, there may well have been more files that had been deleted and which could not be recovered.

</div> As the existing evidence could only portray an incomplete picture, it was unsafe to draw any conclusions regarding the extent to which Mr Liu had worked on the files during office hours. I therefore did not place much weight on this aspect of the parties’ cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 Instead, I focused on the software and equipment that Mr Liu had used to create the Kikocci files, and whether their use caused the Kikocci files to fall within the meaning of “works” under para 2 of Art 16 of the Copyright Law which the plaintiff could claim copyright ownership over. It was clear from the foreign law evidence that this required the software and equipment to be “purposely” or “specially” provided by the plaintiff for Mr Liu to create the Kikocci files: see Art 11 of the Copyright Law Implementation Regulations and the first instance decision that was upheld in <span class="font-italic">Zhanyu</span><span class="font-italic"> Enterprise</span>. This requirement was not fulfilled in the present case, for the following two reasons: </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) I found that Mr Liu had used i-Admin (Shanghai)’s laptop for some of the Kikocci coding work: the Kikocci files that were forensically assessed were found on the laptop which i-Admin (Shanghai) had assigned to him.

</div> But it was crucial that this laptop had not been purposely or specially provided to him for coding the Kikocci files.

As noted by Lee Seiu Kin J in <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [215], information that is too broad, general and unoriginal may not be capable of being protected as confidential:<span class="font-italic"> </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… In <span class="font-italic">De </span><span class="font-italic">Maudsley v Palumbo</span> [1996] FSR 447 (“<span class="font-italic">De </span><span class="font-italic">Maudsley</span>”), an idea for a dance club was held not to be protectable because its five composite elements were, individually or combined, far too vague and/or unoriginal to constitute confidential information. [The unprotectable elements were that] (a) the club would operate all night long, (b) the decor would be of “high tech industrial” warehouse style, (c) there would be separate areas for dancing, resting and socialising as well as a VIP lounge, (d) the acoustic design for the enclosed dance area would prevent sound, light and atmosphere to leak beyond the area, and (e) top disc jockeys would appear at the club. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 It followed from my findings in relation to the copyright claim above that no reproduction or copying of the plaintiff’s materials had occurred <span class="font-italic">per se</span>. Although the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had adapted its database structures, it did not explain how such “adaptation” had occurred or what references the defendants had made of the plaintiff’s database structures; it only relied on Mr Pillay’s comparison of the parties’ respective database tables.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 I took the view, however, that mere copying did not amount to actual use for the purposes of making out the breach of confidence claim. In reaching this conclusion, I looked to the reasoning in <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span> for guidance. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 To summarise, the plaintiff in <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>(“Clearlab”), a contact lens manufacturer, sued its ex-employees, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for taking its confidential information and using it for the benefit of a rival company (“Aquilus”). Six “clear instances” of breach of confidence were found to have occurred:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The first two instances of breach involved the use of Clearlab’s confidential software to design contact lenses: at [157] to [165]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The third involved the defendants’ copying of Clearlab’s lens formulations to use in Aquilus’s application for a Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) manufacturing license: at [166] to [176]. Lee J took note of the fact that the defendants would otherwise not have had enough time to independently develop a workable lens formulation: at [174].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Fourth, Aquilus used Clearlab’s combination of dosage, spin-speed and lens dimensions in its lens production. One of the defendants admitted under cross-examination that Aquilus faced “a lot of difficulties in coming up with a good lens”, and thus asked another colleague for Clearlab’s specifications in order to “shorten the trial”: at [180]. This suggested that the document from Clearlab containing this data was used for making certain lens: at [177] to [181].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Fifth, the defendants had input Clearlab’s parameter settings into a machine used to cut the metal insert for producing Aquilus’s lens cast mould: at [182] to [186]. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Finally, the defendants used Clearlab’s documents to obtain four certifications for ISO and OHSAS standards, following an audit by TQCS International Pty Ltd (“TQCSI”), an audit firm: at [187] to [194]. ISO certification required a minimum of three months of actual implementation of quality management systems and related standard operating procedures (“SOPs”). Clearlab pointed toward the speed at which Aquilus obtained certifications (within three months after three of its four technical crew came on board) as suggestive of copying: at [188]. Lee J noted in particular how certain emails showed that the defendants circulated batches of Clearlab’s SOPs and operating instructions (“OIs”) with instructions to “change for Aquilus”; the reply email described the 18 attached files as having “removed all mentions of [Clearlab] and also changed the words 1-Day to [Aquilus’s] Daily Lens”. Lee J found that implementation of the SOPs and OIs to satisfy the audit requirements constituted use; relevantly, an email sent in the midst of the TQCSI audit stated, “As per Mr Ting advice, we can use Clearlab’s standard for a while.”: at [193].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 It is clear from this reasoning that the copying of information alone does not constitute breach of confidence. Crucially, the defendants in <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>had actually used Clearlab’s confidential information for various purposes: to apply for a HSA license, to obtain ISO and OHSAS certifications, and in developing Aquilus’s contact lenses. The same could not be said in this case. As the defendants argued, while the data in the plaintiff’s Payitem Bibles might have been copied into the file “Payitem Bible_Singapore.xls”, this file was “not commonly used”.

</div> The argument that the copied data had also been used to create Nice Payroll’s payitem database was also shaky; to this end, I accepted the defendants’ arguments that payitems were common knowledge in the payitem industry and that MrOng would have been able to c Hong would have been able to compile a similar list of payitems based on his own knowledge of the payitem industry.

Although Mr Hong and Mr Liu admitted to an intention of using the plaintiff’s materials for Nice Payroll’s purposes, this alone could not allow the plaintiff’s claim to succeed. Access alone would not be sufficient to establish anything. Its case was that the defendants had actually referred to its materials in developing Nice Payroll’s business materials. Accordingly, even if reference or reviewing was made out (which it was), the latter element of its pleaded claim still had to be proved. Similarly, although the defendants or Ms Shen had reviewed the plaintiff’s materials through the use of the Eclipse software, it had to be further shown that this resulted in the creation of the defendants’ own materials.

</div> I disagree: as this formulation of the breach of confidence claim had not been pleaded, it could not be considered; the plaintiff should have specifically pleaded that the fact of mere taking sufficed to give rise to breach of confidence. In any case, such a claim would not have succeeded as the present case could be sufficiently distinguished from <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span>.<span class="font-italic"> </span>Lee J, in concluding that the defendants had breached their obligations of confidence to Clearlab in respect of the whole lot of documents taken out of Clearlab (at [207]), considered that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) First, the defendants systematically took a “substantial” and “remarkable” documents numbering in the thousands shortly before leaving Clearlab: at [150], [151] and [195]. This suggested that they had taken the documents not for the purposes of their work at Clearlab, but to accumulate them to be used at Aquilus. The defendants admitted to taking and passing on Clearlab’s documents for “reference”. This showed that the documents were treated as a resource that they could freely use: at [206].</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Second, the retention of the documents was in breach of the defendants’ employment contract with Clearlab: at [206].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 It was further crucial that the defendants in <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span> had set themselves an extremely short manufacturing timeframe that would only have been consistent with the use of Clearlab’s confidential information: at [149].

Moreover, Lee J’s <span class="font-italic">obiter </span>observations about whether “potential use” could amount to a breach of confidence were also situated alongside the “clear” instances of breach of confidence where Clearlab’s confidential information was actually used: see the discussion above at [117] to [119]. It was against the backdrop of multiple breaches of confidence that Lee J found that it would have been no defence that certain documents in the defendants’ collection of Clearlab’s documents were not actually used, when each of the documents had been taken with the intention of using them: at [207]. Seen in this context, the present facts were not so egregious (as in <span class="font-italic">Clearlab</span>) that the mere fact that the plaintiff’s documents could potentially have been used by the defendants amounted to a breach of confidence on their part.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Generation of payroll reports for Nice Payroll’s employees</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 The plaintiff submitted that the defendants used a copy of its payroll software to generate Nice Payroll’s internal payroll reports between May 2011 and February 2012.

This IP address was traced to an Amazon Web Services cloud server. The use of Eclipse indicated that the defendants were running the plaintiff’s Java codes, since their own software was written in PL/SQL and programmed using APEX. The references to “HRIS” and “ePayroll” also pointed to the use of the plaintiff’s software, which required data to be input into an HRIS template and a “recurring/variable” template in “ePayroll”. Finally, the reference to “synchronization [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>]” also indicated that the plaintiff’s software had been used, seeing as how the plaintiff’s software required multiple databases to be synchronised, while Nice Payroll’s comprised a single database.

Running a single piece of code to generate a payroll report would have required various pieces of the plaintiff’s source codes and database to be fully installed and operational. Prof Yap’s evidence showed that it would have been extremely difficult to set up the various elements of the plaintiff’s software and database. Indeed, given the small number of employees at the time (three to eight), a payroll report could have been easily created by hand or by running a simple custom program.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 The plaintiff’s case that the disclosures to HSBC and ADP constituted a breach of confidence appeared to conflate (a) the client data in the defendants’ possession, which was confidential information that had been retained by the defendants without the plaintiff’s permission; and (b) the fact that this data was in the defendants’ possession. The information in category (b) came to Mr Hong and Mr Liu’s knowledge after they left the plaintiff’s and i-Admin (Shanghai)’s employment. In my view, although they might have been obliged not to make unauthorised use of the information in category (a), it did not follow that they could only disclose that they had come into possession of this information with the plaintiff’s authorisation. While they could have directly informed the plaintiff of this fact instead of disclosing the latter information to HSBC and ADP, they were not compelled to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 Furthermore, the references to “interference” in the plaintiff’s submissions appeared to invoke the tort of wrongful interference with trade. This was not pleaded as a claim, and would not have succeeded in any case. The plaintiff would have had to show that (a) the defendants had committed an unlawful act affecting a third party; (b) the defendants acted with an intention to injure the plaintiff; and (c) the defendants’ conduct in fact resulted in damage to the plaintiff: <span class="font-italic">Paragon Shipping Pte Ltd </span><span class="font-italic">v Freight Connect (S) Pte Ltd </span>[2014] 4 SLR 574 at [83]. It was unclear how the defendants’ actions were “unlawful”, and the plaintiff would have run into further difficulties in proving that damage resulted from the disclosures to HSBC and ADP. Mr Kim testified that HSBC had subsequently conducted an independent audit of the plaintiff’s security and operational measures, before ultimately deciding not to renew its contract with the plaintiff.

</div> The defendants submitted that neither Mr Hong nor Mr Liu had been in Shanghai before 1 July 2011, and they could not have removed the materials then. The fact that the folder names included Zaza’s name also increased the likelihood that the materials had come from her computer. Finally, adverse inferences should be drawn against the plaintiff, given its failure to provide forensic evidence of thumbdrive access to Ms Shen’s i-Admin (Shanghai) computer to show that she had not removed the plaintiff’s materials.

Although Mr Hong’s and Mr Liu’s affidavit evidence stated that Mr Li had rejected the SaaS idea in March 2011, they admitted under cross-examination that Mr Li had only done so in May 2011. Further, Mr Li’s account during cross-examination that he had not understood the schedules because he could not read or understand English was inherently unbelievable, given that he had reviewed the schedules which contained the English word “i-Admin” without asking for clarification. It was similarly unbelievable that Mr Li did not know what “i-Admin” and who the plaintiff was.

Mr Hong and Mr Liu’s actions fell far short of any conspiracy to steal the plaintiff’s confidential information. As regards Mr Li, I did not find that the evidence showed that he was involved in any way in any machinations as alleged by the plaintiff.

In particular, the files “tax.txt” and “cpf.xls” had been found in the directory “D:\Errol\” on Nice Payroll’s Dell Server. Mr Tan had also operated the Eclipse program and accessed Eclipse projects that pointed to the plaintiff’s materials. Finally, Mr Hong had emailed files containing the plaintiff’s materials to Mr Tan for the purpose of developing Nice Payroll’s materials.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">168 Given that I ultimately found that Nice Payroll’s materials were not infringing copies of the plaintiff’s own materials and that the defendants did not make use of the plaintiff’s confidential materials in the relevant sense, the claims against Mr Tan failed as they were not supported by the evidence. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Miscellaneous issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">169 The plaintiff’s submissions raised additional claims that were unpleaded. I will deal with them briefly. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">170 First, the plaintiff relied on the “mass departures” of Mr Hong, Mr Liu and Mr Tan from their respective employers as a factual basis for finding that a conspiracy between them existed to steal and use the plaintiff’s materials to set up a competing business.

</div> In my view, while the defendants might not have been candid about their reasons for resigning and their intention to join a competing business, I did not find that this amounted to a conspiracy; these ex-employees were not obliged to inform the plaintiff of their plans. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">171 Second, the plaintiff pointed to Mr Hong and Mr Liu’s deletion of the plaintiff’s documents on the day of the Anton Piller order as evidencing their intention to destroy evidence showing that they had taken and retained the plaintiff’s materials for their own use. Specifically, Mr Hong had logged onto his ThinkPad laptop and deleted “payitem setup_iAdmin.xls”, and performed a search for “i-Admin” on his laptop and created “desktop.rar”, which he stored files in. “Desktop.rar” was found to contain some of the plaintiff’s files, which were mostly in the file “RR to Mr Li Lian.zip”. Mr Liu deleted two folders from Nice Payroll’s Dell Server: “From Zaza” and “Zara_dev”, which contained i-Admin materials.

I awarded the plaintiff nominal damages of $500 as no injury or damage resulted from Mr Hong’s breach. I ordered delivery up by the defendants of any materials belonging to the plaintiff in two weeks. Costs awards were dealt with separately.
