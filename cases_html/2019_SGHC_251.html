</div>
</div>
</div> On 3 January 2019, the District Judge convicted the appellant on both charges. The appellant was subsequently sentenced on 21 February 2019.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The unlawful assembly charge</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Before me, the appellant submitted that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) section 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) POA is unconstitutional because it contravenes Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Cap 1, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Constitution”); </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) in any event, the Event did not require a permit because it did not “publicise a cause”; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the fine of $2,000 is manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether s 16(1)(a) contravenes Article 14</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 Under s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) POA, it is an offence to organise a public assembly in respect of which a permit is required under the POA and no such permit has been granted under s 7 or no such permit is in force. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Section 6 POA requires that notice of intention to organise a public assembly be given to the Commissioner of Police (“the Commissioner”) in the prescribed manner and not less than the prescribed period, accompanied by an application for a permit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 Under s 7 POA, the Commissioner may grant a permit (with or without conditions), or refuse to grant a permit on any of the grounds set out in s 7(2). Under s 11(1) POA, any person aggrieved by the Commissioner’s decision to refuse to grant a permit, to cancel a permit or to impose any particular condition, may appeal to the Minister.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Article 14(1)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Constitution protects the right of all citizens of Singapore to “assemble peaceably and without arms”. However, it is unarguable that this is not an absolute right. Article 14(2)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Constitution expressly subjects this right to “such restrictions as [Parliament] considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof or public order”. There is a wide “legislative remit that allows Parliament to take a prophylactic approach in the maintenance of public order”: <span class="font-italic">Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister for Home Affairs and another</span> [2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 at [50], referred to in the District Judge in his Grounds of Decision (“the GD”) at [29]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Before me, the appellant accepted that s 7(2) POA sets out specific grounds upon which the Commissioner can refuse to grant a permit, and that these are not arbitrary grounds. The appellant did not contend that any of the grounds under s 7(2) POA contravenes Article 14.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 However, the appellant contended that s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) POA contravenes Article 14 of the Constitution. The appellant made two submissions in support of this contention.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 First, the appellant referred to <span class="font-italic">Jeyar</span><span class="font-italic">etnam Joshua Benjamin v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</span> [1989] 2 SLR(R) 419 (“<span class="font-italic">Jeyar</span><span class="font-italic">etnam</span>”). In that case, the first appellant (“JBJ”) was convicted of providing public entertainment without a licence by addressing a public gathering, an offence under the s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) of the Public Entertainments Act (Cap 257, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PEA”). JBJ had applied for a licence but the application was rejected. Nevertheless, he proceeded to address the public gathering. On appeal, JBJ argued, among other things, that the decision not to issue the licence was contrary to law and null and void and was an unjustified interference with his right to freedom of speech and expression under Art 14(1) of the Constitution (<span class="font-italic">Jeyar</span><span class="font-italic">etnam </span>at [8]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 In <span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span>, the Court decided (at [26]) that the invalidity of the licensing officer’s decision (assuming it was invalid) could not have provided a defence to a charge under s 18(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) PEA because the law was that no public entertainment might be provided without a licence. Even if the licensing officer’s decision was quashed in judicial review proceedings, it was still an offence to provide the public entertainment without a licence. The learned Judge went on to observe (at [27]) that the only available defence would be that the PEA (or, the scheme of licensing established by the PEA) contravenes Art 14(2) of the Constitution to the extent that it affects the right to freedom of speech and expression. However, that line of argument was not pursued in <span class="font-italic">Jeyaretnam</span>. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Picking up on the observation made by the learned Judge in <span class="font-italic">Jeyar</span><span class="font-italic">etnam</span>, the appellant submitted that s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) POA contravenes Article 14 of the Constitution because under s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>), any person who organises a public assembly without a permit commits an offence even though the refusal to grant the permit is inconsistent with s 7 POA and is therefore invalid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 To illustrate his point, the appellant contrasted the framework under the POA with a hypothetical framework under which any person who wishes to organise a public assembly merely needs to notify the Commissioner of his intention to do so and it is up to the Commissioner to issue an order prohibiting the public assembly from being held. If the organiser nevertheless proceeds with the public assembly notwithstanding any such prohibition order, he would not have committed any offence if the Commissioner’s decision to prohibit the public assembly is subsequently challenged and found to be invalid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 I disagree with the appellant’s submission. The appellant’s submission rests on the assumption that a person who disagrees with the Commissioner’s decision is entitled to disregard and defy it, instead of challenging it in Court in accordance with the law. In my view, this assumption cannot be justified. The Commissioner’s decision, made pursuant to his exercise of a statutory power, is valid and should be obeyed until and unless it is quashed by the Court. Allowing any person organising a public assembly to ignore and defy the Commissioner’s decision, instead of challenging it in Court, is to allow that person to take the law into his own hands. Such vigilante conduct cannot be condoned. Article 93 of the Constitution vests judicial power in the Courts. It is for the Court, and the Court alone, to decide whether the Commissioner’s decision is invalid. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 Second, during oral submissions, the appellant submitted that s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) POA contravenes Article 14 of the Constitution because there is no “practical remedy” against decisions made in bad faith to refuse to grant the necessary permit. The appellant argued as follows:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) Even if the Court finds that the refusal to grant a permit is unlawful and quashes it, the applicant for the permit still cannot proceed to organise the public assembly because under s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) POA, it is an offence to organise a public assembly without a permit. The applicant has to repeat the process under s 6 and make a fresh application to the Commissioner for a permit.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) If the Commissioner or the Minister, acting in bad faith, ignores the Court’s decision and again refuses to grant the permit based on the same reasons as those that the Court has found to be unlawful, the applicant has to challenge the refusal in Court again. He would be committing an offence under s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) POA if he proceeded to organise the public assembly without a permit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) This process can go on indefinitely without the applicant ever being able to organise the public assembly lawfully, since the Court can only quash a decision that is unlawful but cannot issue the permit or direct the Commissioner or the Minister to issue the permit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The appellant’s submission that s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) POA contravenes Art 14 of the Constitution, rests on the suggestion that the Commissioner and/or the Minister <span class="font-italic">may act in bad faith and</span> <span class="font-italic">disregard</span><span class="font-italic"> the Court’s decision</span>.

The appellant’s submission would lead to the absurd result that any law that requires a permit or licence to be obtained before an activity may be lawfully carried out, can be struck down simply by arguing that the power to grant the permit or licence <span class="font-italic">may </span>be exercised in bad faith.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 I also note that it is an established principle that acts of high officials of state should be accorded a presumption of legality or regularity: <span class="font-italic">Ramalingam Ravinthran v Attorney-General</span> [2012] 2 SLR 49 (“<span class="font-italic">Ramalingam</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [46].

The Public Order (Exempt Assemblies and Processions) Order 2009 (S 486/2009) (“the 2009 Order”) exempts certain public assemblies from the permit requirement under s 5 POA. Pursuant to paragraph 2 read with item 4(1) of First Schedule to the 2009 Order, the Event would have been exempt from the permit requirement if all of the speakers were Singapore citizens. However, as one of the speakers at the Event (Wong) was not a Singapore citizen, the Event was not exempt under the 2009 Order. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 Section 2(1) POA defines “public assembly” to mean:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">an assembly held or to be held in a public place or to which members of the public in general are invited, induced or permitted to attend; </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">It is not disputed that the Event satisfied the “public” element; members of the public in general were invited or permitted to attend the Event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Section 2(1) POA defines “assembly” to mean:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">a gathering or meeting (whether or not comprising any lecture, talk, address, debate or discussion) of persons the purpose (or one of the purposes) of which is ––</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) to demonstrate support for or opposition to the views or actions of any person, group of persons or any government;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) to publicise a cause or campaign; or</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) to mark or commemorate any event,</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">and includes a demonstration by a person alone for any such purpose referred to in paragraph (<span class="font-italic">a</span>), (<span class="font-italic">b</span>) or (<span class="font-italic">c</span>);</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The unlawful assembly charge against the appellant alleges that he organised a public assembly to publicise the cause of “civil disobedience and democracy in social change”.

The District Judge adopted the definition in the Oxford English Dictionary, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “a principle, aim or movement to which one is committed and which one is prepared to defend or advocate” (GD at [33]).

The appellant submitted that the term “cause” in the POA should be interpreted to exclude the latter, because Parliament’s intent in enacting the POA was to prevent the threat of violence and anti-social behaviour. Therefore, according to the appellant, the Event did not involve a cause because it did not feature discussions about any particular cause but only discussions “about the means through which any cause might be furthered”.

</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 I disagree. In my view, advocating the method by which a substantive end is to be achieved is as much a “cause” as the substantive end itself. In any event, this distinction is irrelevant in the present case. The allegation against the appellant is that the appellant was advocating the use of civil disobedience to bring about social change. In this context, the focus is on the use of civil disobedience and that, in itself, is the substantive end. Even if one viewed bringing about social change as the substantive end, and the use of civil disobedience as the method by which this end can be achieved, it is clear that both are causes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 Second, the appellant submitted that on its literal interpretation, the term “assembly” refers to an event that sought to publicise only a “single and distinct cause”. Hence, because the title of the Event indicated two separate topics – “civil disobedience” and “social movements” – the Event could not have publicised a single cause.

</div> I disagree with the submission that the term “assembly” refers to an event that publicises only a single cause. This interpretation would lead to the absurd result that it would be an offence to organise an event (involving a foreign speaker) publicising a single cause but not one publicising multiple causes.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Third, the appellant submitted that the Event was merely a discussion and sharing of thoughts and experiences about issues relating to civil disobedience and democracy in social change. The definition of “assembly” in the POA includes a “discussion”. For present purposes, the question is whether the discussion publicises any cause. In my view, a discussion would publicise a cause if it defends or advocates a principle, aim or movement to which one is committed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 In the context of the unlawful assembly charge in this case, the Prosecution had to prove that the appellant intended that the Event would publicise a cause, specifically, that the Event would advocate the use of civil disobedience to bring about social change. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 I agree with the appellant

</div> that the title of the Event, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “Civil Disobedience and Social Movements”, was neutral and did not necessarily suggest that the Event advocated the use of civil disobedience to bring about social change. During oral submissions, the Prosecution agreed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 However, I agree with the Prosecution that the description of the Event on Facebook did advocate the use of civil disobedience to bring about social change. It would be useful to set out again the description of the Event on Facebook:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Join Joshua Wong, Secretary General of Hong Kong’s Demosisto party as he shares with local activists Seelan Palay and Kirsten Han their thoughts on the role of civil disobedience and democracy in building social movements for progress and change.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 It is clear from the above description of the Event that the talks were about the role that civil disobedience had to play in bringing about change. It was not (and nothing in the description suggested that it was) just a neutral academic discussion about issues relating to civil disobedience. Further, at the material time, Wong was a known Hong Kong activist who advocated the use of civil disobedience. I have no doubt that in inviting Wong to speak at the Event, the appellant intended or expected that Wong’s speech would include advocating the use of civil disobedience to bring about social change. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Prosecution also relied on the statements made by Wong and the appellant during the Event. These statements were made only during the Event itself. However, they constitute evidence that supports the allegation that the appellant organised the Event to advocate the use of civil disobedience to bring about social change. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Wong spoke about how he transitioned from being “a normal high school student to a [<span class="font-italic">sic</span>] organiser of the civil disobedience” and said, “in Hong Kong, what we hope is just to prove civil disobedience and direct action to deliver our dissatisfaction”.

</div> The appellant submitted that Wong was not suggesting that Singapore citizens should consider using civil disobedience to bring about change. According to the appellant, Wong was merely telling the audience that the use of civil disobedience was something to think about. However, in my view, telling the audience how civil disobedience had been used in Hong Kong and asking the audience to think about using civil disobedience in Singapore, was tantamount to advocating the use of civil disobedience.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The appellant himself had this to say during the Event:

Right, if you look at how successful Pink Dot is, right, everyone is happy to go to Pink Dot, wear pink, and party, and you know, eat pink muffins and pink cakes, you know, pink as a show of solidarity. I mean I think it is a great movement, and I say this not to criticize Pink Dot, but it seems like in Singapore there are certain ways in which we do our activism, and we don’t seem to like this very confrontational civil disobedience types of actions. <span class="font-italic">So how do we how do we get there, I think this is the billion-dollar question</span>. Step by step, do we do we wait for many Pink Dots to happen and then slowly we transition there, or do we need to have a bunch of individuals come together and really hammer on in the civil disobedience so that we open space in the same way that um, people like Seelan, Dr Chee Soon Juan and all that, did 10 years.

The Prosecution submitted that the appellant’s culpability was higher whereas the appellant submitted that it was lower.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 In <span class="font-italic">Jacob Lau</span>, the accused organised a march, at 7.00pm on 5 November 2013, from the City Hall Mass Rapid Transit Station to demonstrate support for the “Million Mask March Singapore” and opposition against the new media regulations by the Media Development Authority. The “Million Mask March” was an online movement that called for 24-hour protests globally on Guy Fawkes’ day (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, 5 November) as a form of social protest. The movement had been promoted in Singapore through various social media platforms and on 5 November 2013, at about 4.14am, the Police issued a public advisory on Facebook advising the public that it is illegal to organise or take part in a public assembly without a permit. The statement of facts did not state that the accused in<span class="font-italic"> Jacob Lau</span> was aware of the public advisory issued by the Police.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 In the present case, the District Judge agreed with the Prosecution that the appellant’s culpability was higher than that of the accused in <span class="font-italic">Jacob Lau</span> because the appellant had (a) ignored the advice by the Police to apply for a permit, and (b) shown no remorse in claiming trial (GD at [54]). I agree with the District Judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 I also agree with the Prosecution that the fact that the Event was peaceful was not a mitigating factor; it merely meant that the way that the Event was conducted did not constitute an aggravating factor.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 The maximum punishment for the offence under s 16(1)(<span class="font-italic">a</span>) POA is a fine not exceeding $5,000 dollars.

In that case, the Court of Appeal said (at [56]) that “the rules prescribed by the CPC for the recording of statements are in existence to provide a safeguard as to reliability”, and (at [60]) that the objective of these provisions is to ensure that the twin objectives of accuracy and reliability are met in every investigation. The appellant argued that these procedural requirements are therefore addressed to the statement-taker and not the statement-giver.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 I disagree. Nothing in what the Court of Appeal said in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> supports the appellant’s argument that the police officer has no power to require him to sign his statement recorded pursuant to s 22 CPC. The appellant accepted that the statement-giver’s signature is important to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the statement, but submitted that the statement-giver is not legally bound to and can refuse to sign the statement. This does not make any sense. Requiring the police officer, who recorded the statement, to obtain the statement-giver’s signature is meaningless if the police officer does not have the concurrent power to require the statement-giver to sign his statement. Being required to sign his statement does not mean that the statement-giver has to sign the statement where he disagrees with its contents. He can amend his statement before signing it. The twin objectives of accuracy and reliability referred to in <span class="font-italic">Kadar</span> cannot be achieved if the statement-giver cannot be required to sign his statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 Next, the appellant referred to the privilege against self-incrimination which is protected under s 22(2) CPC, and argued that under s 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) CPC, the police officer is not legally competent to require a person to sign an incriminatory statement.

</div> I disagree. Section 22(3)(<span class="font-italic">d</span>) draws no such distinction, and for good reason. A person has the right not to <span class="font-italic">say </span>anything that incriminates himself but if he chooses to waive this right and makes a self-incriminatory statement, there is no reason whatsoever why he should not be required to sign the statement. After all, if a self-incriminatory statement can be used in evidence against the maker of that statement, why should there be any objection to him being required to sign the same? Obviously, the right against self-incrimination ceases to apply once it is waived. The privilege is against making a self-incriminatory statement; there is no privilege against signing a self-incriminatory statement that a person has willingly chosen to make. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 In my judgment, the police officer recording a statement pursuant to s 22 CPC is legally competent to require the statement-giver to sign his statement.

The accused was fined $1,200 (in default, eight days’ imprisonment) on each charge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 In the present case, the appellant submitted that the sentence for the s 180 charge is manifestly excessive because he is far less culpable than the accused in <span class="font-italic">Ng Chye Huay</span> who had multiple antecedents (albeit not for a similar offence) and displayed an intransigent attitude throughout the proceedings. The appellant submitted that the fine should be no more than $600. The Prosecution submitted that the appellant has similarly not demonstrated any remorse in the present case and argued that the fine of $1,200 imposed by the District Judge is not manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 In my view, the appellant’s culpability is similar to that of the accused in <span class="font-italic">Ng Chye Huay</span>. However, the fine imposed in <span class="font-italic">Ng Chye Huay</span> should be viewed in context. There, in imposing the fine of $1,200 for each charge, the District Judge had expressly tempered justice with mercy after taking into consideration the accused’s financial circumstances (at [107] and [109]). The fines would doubtless have been higher otherwise. In contrast, there are no mitigating factors in the appellant’s favour in the present case. In the circumstances, viewed in totality, the fine imposed on the appellant is not out of line with <span class="font-italic">Ng Chye Huay</span>.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 The appellant next referred to three other cases which involved offences under ss 177 and 182 of the Penal Code – <span class="font-italic">Ng Hoon Hong v Public Prosecutor </span>Magistrate’s Appeal 199 of 1996, <span class="font-italic">Ee Chong Kiat Tommy v Public Prosecutor</span> Magistrate’s Appeal No 143 of 1996, and <span class="font-italic">Kuah Geok Bee v Public Prosecutor </span>Magistrate’s Appeal 171 of 1997.

</div>
</div> According to the appellant, these were relevant sentencing precedents because they involved non-violent offences for improperly furnishing information to public servants. The appellant submitted that the offences under ss 177 and 182 are more serious than offences under s 180 since the maximum fine under ss 177 and 182 is $5,000 whereas the maximum fine under s 180 is $2,500. The appellant therefore submitted that the fine of $1,200 imposed on him was manifestly excessive when viewed against the fine of $1,000 imposed in each of the three cases mentioned above.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 However, as the Prosecution pointed out, these three cases are unhelpful because the fines imposed were in fact the maximum provided under ss 177 and 182 at the material time. The maximum fine for ss 177 and 182 was increased to $5,000 only after the commencement of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (No 51 of 2007) on 1 February 2008. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In my view, the fine imposed by the District Judge in the present case is not manifestly excessive.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 For all of the above reasons, I dismiss the appellant’s appeals against conviction and sentence in respect of both the charges.  </div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Kumaresan Gohulabalan and Seah Ee Wei (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the Prosecution;<br/>Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam, Suang Wijaya and Johannes Hadi (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the accused.<br/></div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<strong>Case summary</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<em>Wham Kwok Han Jolovan v Public Prosecutor </em>
[2019] SGHC 251
<em>
<br/>
</em>
Magistrate’s Appeal 9041 of 2019
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
Decision of the High Court (delivered by Justice Chua Lee Ming):
</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outcome: The High Court dismisses the appeal against conviction and
sentence of Wham Kwok Han Jolovan.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Facts</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
1 The appellant claimed trial to and was convicted of two charges. The
first charge was under the Public Order Act (Cap 257A, 2012 Rev Ed)
(“POA”), for organising a public assembly without a permit, to publicise
the cause of “civil disobedience and democracy in social change”. The
appellant had organised a public event entitled “Civil Disobedience and
Social Movements”. A permit was required for the event because one of the
speakers, Joshua Wong Chi-Fung (“Wong”), was not a Singapore citizen. The
Police had advised the appellant to apply for a permit but he did not do
so.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
2 The second charge was for refusing to sign an investigation statement
recorded from the appellant under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012
Rev Ed) (“CPC”), which was an offence under the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008
Rev Ed).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
3 The District Judge convicted the appellant of both charges after the
trial. The appellant was sentenced to a fine of $2,000 (in default, ten
days’ imprisonment) for the first charge and a fine of $1,200 (in default,
six days’ imprisonment) for the second charge.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
4 The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Decision of the High Court</strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
5 The High Court dismissed the appellant’s appeal against conviction and
sentence.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
6 The appellant first argued that the provision under the POA that
prohibited him from holding a public assembly without a permit, contravened
Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore which protects the right of all
Singapore citizens to “assemble peaceably and without arms”.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
7 Under the POA, it is an offence to organise a public assembly without a
permit, where a permit is required. The authority to grant a permit is
vested in the Commissioner of Police, who may refuse to grant a permit on
any of the specified grounds in the POA. Should the Commissioner refuse an
applicant’s permit application, the applicant may appeal the decision to
the Minister.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
8 The appellant argued that the permit requirement contravenes Article 14
of the Constitution because an event organiser who chooses to go ahead with
the event after his application for a permit has been rejected, would be
guilty of the offence under the POA even if the refusal to grant a permit
is subsequently challenged and found to be invalid. The court rejected this
argument, as the argument incorrectly assumed that an applicant who
disagrees with the Commissioner’s decision is entitled to disregard and
defy it, instead of challenging the decision in court. It is for the court
alone to decide whether the Commissioner’s decision was invalid (at    <strong>[25]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
9 The appellant further argued that the permit requirement under the POA
contravenes Article 14 of the Constitution because there is no practical
remedy if the Commissioner acting in bad faith refuses to grant a permit.
The appellant argued that even if the Commissioner’s decision is
successfully challenged in court, the court can only quash the decision.
The court cannot issue the permit or direct the Commissioner (or Minister)
to issue the permit. Therefore, if the Commissioner and Minister continues
to act in bad faith after the court quashes the initial refusal, the
applicant would never be able to lawfully organise the public assembly. The
court rejected this argument. The assumption that the Commissioner and
Minister may act in bad faith and disregard the court’s decision was
speculative and unsubstantiated. The appellant’s argument would mean that
any law that requires a permit to carry out an activity may be struck down
simply by arguing that the permit <em>may</em> be refused in bad faith (at    <strong>[28]</strong>).<em> </em>The court was of the view that it should
be presumed that the Commissioner and Minister will, consistent with the
rule of law, act in accordance with the law (at <strong>[29]</strong>).    <em></em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
10 The court then turned to consider whether the appellant’s event was an
“assembly” within the POA’s definition. The question turned on whether the
event advocated a cause, the cause being the use of civil disobedience to
bring about social change. Advocating the method by which a substantive end
is to be achieved is as much a “cause” as the substantive end itself (at    <strong>[38]</strong>).There was no requirement that the event publicises
only a single cause; an event publicising multiple causes would also
constitute an assembly (at <strong>[39]</strong>). Discussions could also
publicise a cause, if it defends or advocates a principle, aim or movement
to which one is committed (at <strong>[40]</strong>).<em></em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
11 The court was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved that the
appellant’s event publicised a cause by advocating the use of civil
disobedience to bring about social change. The description of the event
showed that the talk was about the role that civil disobedience had to play
in bringing about change, and it was not merely a neutral discussion. One
of the speakers at the event, Wong, was a known Hong Kong activist who
advocated the use of civil disobedience. In inviting Wong to speak, the
appellant clearly intended or expected his speech to include advocating the
use of civil disobedience to bring about social change. During the event,
Wong told the audience about how civil disobedience had been used in Hong
Kong and asked the audience to think about using civil disobedience in
Singapore. This amounted to advocating the use of civil disobedience. The
appellant himself had asked the audience – how do Singapore citizens get
from what he described as “picnic”-type activism to the “very
confrontational civil disobedience types of actions”. In essence, he
advocated that Singapore citizens should move towards civil disobedience.
The court was thus satisfied that the appellant was correctly convicted of
the first charge (at <strong>[43]–[49]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
12 As for the second charge, the appellant argued that he committed no
offence because he did not have a legal obligation to sign his statement
(which he had confirmed to be true and correct). The court rejected this
argument. The requirement under the CPC for the police officer to obtain
the statement-giver’s signature, is to ensure the accuracy and reliability
of the statement. This would be meaningless if the police officer does not
have the concurrent power to require the statement-giver to sign his
statement. Being required to sign his statement does not mean that the
statement-giver has to sign the statement where he disagrees with its
contents. He can amend his statement before signing it (at    <strong>[63]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
13 The court also rejected the appellant’s argument that requiring him to
sign an incriminatory statement violated his privilege against
self-incrimination as protected under the CPC. The privilege is against
making a self-incriminatory statement; there is no privilege against
signing a self-incriminatory statement that a person has willingly chosen
to make (at <strong>[64]</strong>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
14 The court dismissed the appeals against sentence in respect of both
charges, as they were not manifestly excessive, taking into account the
facts of the appellant’s case and the relevant case precedents (at    <strong>[55]</strong> and <strong>[71]</strong>).
