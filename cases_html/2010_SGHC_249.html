        Andrew Ang J:</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The plaintiff is a company incorporated in the
                    United States of America which set up a Corporate Investor Account (Delaware
                    Account) numbered 1EY-07021 (“the Account”) for the second
                    defendant pursuant to an application by the latter for the same. As the
                    plaintiff does not have a place of business in Singapore, the Account was
                    serviced on its behalf by private wealth managers in the Singapore branch of
                    Merrill Lynch International Bank Limited (Merchant Bank) (“MLIB”),
                    an affiliated company under the Merrill Lynch Group.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The first defendant, Prem Ranchand Harjani,
                    wholly owns the second defendant, Renaissance Capital Management Investment Pte
                    Ltd, and had sole authority to give instructions in respect of the Account on
                    behalf of the second defendant. The first defendant wanted to acquire a
                    substantial number of shares in an Indonesian company, PT Triwira Insanlestari
                    (“PTTI”) listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, on behalf of the
                    second defendant and therefore contacted the plaintiff. On 23 June 2008,
                    the first defendant instructed the plaintiff to purchase approximately 120
                    million shares in PTTI (“the PTTI Shares”) on behalf of the second
                    defendant. There were no moneys in the Account with the plaintiff to pay for
                    such purchase. According to the market rules, the PTTI Shares had to be paid for
                    three days after the purchase, <em>ie</em>, 26 June
                    2008 (“the Settlement Date”). The plaintiff’s case against
                    the first defendant was that by a series of false representations, the first
                    defendant induced the plaintiff to purchase the PTTI Shares on the second
                    defendant’s behalf in the belief that the plaintiff would be put in funds
                    before the Settlement Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The first defendant assured the
                    plaintiff’s representatives that the funds would be transferred into the
                    Account to pay for the PTTI Shares before the Settlement Date, but no moneys
                    came in by that date. The purchase price was debited against the Account which
                    fell into deficit. The first defendant thereafter made several further false
                    statements in response to the plaintiff’s requests for payment of the
                    outstanding amounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       On account of the defendants’ failure to
                    pay for the PTTI Shares, on 2 July 2008, the plaintiff informed the first
                    defendant of its intention to liquidate the PTTI Shares. The shares, however,
                    proved difficult to sell and the plaintiff only managed to completely liquidate
                    the shares sometime in November 2009, leaving US$9,437,687.18 outstanding
                    (“the Outstanding Sum”) as at 1 January 2010, after
                    taking into account part payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The plaintiff commenced an action against both
                    defendants. Against the second defendant, the plaintiff is seeking recovery of
                    the Outstanding Sum in contract. The plaintiff is also claiming against the
                    first defendant damages for the tort of deceit and against both defendants for
                    conspiracy by unlawful means.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the close of the plaintiff’s case, the
                    defendants elected to submit that they had no case to answer. The parties asked
                    to be given time to tender written submissions, but the second defendant
                    eventually decided against tendering any. I therefore have only the written
                    submissions of the plaintiff and the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       It is undisputed that there was an agreement
                    between the plaintiff and the second defendant whereby the plaintiff agreed to
                    purchase the PTTI Shares on the second defendant’s instructions. In the
                    second defendant’s defence and counterclaim filed on 29 September
                    2009, the second defendant admitted that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_a"></a>(a)     on 23 June 2009, the first
                        defendant placed the order for the PTTI Shares with the plaintiff on the
                        second defendant’s behalf;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_b"></a>(b)     the plaintiff purchased the PTTI Shares;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_7-p2_c"></a>(c)     the plaintiff
                        has not received full payment for the PTTI Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the
                    circumstances, the second defendant’s failure to make full payment for the
                    PTTI Shares is undisputed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       In this regard, it is the unchallenged evidence
                    of Jeremy Roy (“JR”), a client service associate, and Christopher
                    Majeski (“CM”), the Head of Compliance at MLIB that on or around
                    the Settlement Date, the plaintiff instructed its custodian bank, the Hong Kong
                    and Shanghai Banking Corporation (Jakarta), to pay for the PTTI Shares on its
                    behalf to settle the trade involving the PTTI Shares. The undisputed evidence is
                    that the purchase price for the PTTI Shares is IDR132,587,475,000. As the
                    Account was a USD account, the purchase price was converted to USD, and the
                    amount of US$14,318,301.84 was payable by the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On or around 9 and 10 July 2008, the
                    defendants made part payment of US$2m for the PTTI Shares. The liquidation of
                    the PTTI shares by the plaintiff was eventually completed on or around
                    18 November 2009 (<em>ie</em>, after more than a year)
                    for only US$2,225,106.98. As of 1 January 2010, the Outstanding Sum was
                    US$9,437,687.18. In the circumstances, the second defendant is plainly in breach
                    of its obligation to pay the Outstanding Sum and is liable to the plaintiff for
                    the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     Indeed, ultimately, to argue that the second
                    defendant is not liable to pay for the PTTI Shares would be tantamount to saying
                    that the second defendant is able to instruct the plaintiff to purchase the PTTI
                    Shares and then claim that it does not have to pay for the same. This defies
                    logic and is completely absurd. In fact, the second defendant itself clearly
                    recognises this.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     At the close of the trial, the second
                    defendant’s solicitors indicated that the second defendant would not be
                    putting in submissions if it had no sensible submissions to put in. By a letter
                    dated 3 May 2010 from the second defendant’s solicitors, the second
                    defendant informed that it would not be making any submissions. The obvious
                    conclusion is that the second defendant knows the plaintiff has made out a case
                    against it and the second defendant can say nothing in response.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claim against the second defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     In any event, the second defendant has
                    admitted its liability for the purchase price. The second defendant had
                    previously applied for a stay of proceedings (“the Stay
                    Application”) in the present action in favour of arbitration. The stay
                    was denied by the assistant registrar. On appeal, Lee Seiu Kin J agreed with the
                    assistant registrar and affirmed the decision (<em>Merrill Lynch
                        Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc v Prem Ramchand Harjani</em> [2009]
                    4 SLR(R) 16 (“the Stay GD”). Lee J’s decision was
                    subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal. In the Stay GD, Lee J held that
                    the first defendant and the second defendant had admitted, numerous times, that
                    the second defendant was liable to the plaintiff for the purchase of the PTTI
                    Shares in the amount of the purchase price. It is trite law that the doctrine of
                    issue estoppel obviates the need to re-litigate issues that have already been
                    decided in interlocutory applications: <em>Alliance Management SA
                        v Pendleton Lane P</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 1 at
                    [21]–[24].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     In any event, based on the evidence before me,
                    I am satisfied that there was sufficient evidence that the second defendant had
                    admitted its debt. The following, in particular, are worthy of mention:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_a"></a>(a)     Prior to the placing of the order
                        for the PTTI Shares, at around 11.40am on 23 June 2008 (“the
                        11.40 Conversation”), the first defendant, on behalf of the second
                        defendant, stated that he would pay for the PTTI Shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_b"></a>(b)     After the order for the PTTI Shares
                        was placed, at around 12.30pm on 23 June 2008 (“the 12.30
                        Conversation”), the first defendant stated that he was aware of the
                        price of the PTTI Shares and he would be transferring the requisite funds to
                        the Account. Further similar assurances were given later that day, at 1.59pm
                        and 6.07pm;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_c"></a>(c)     At
                        around 11.07am on 24 June 2008, the first defendant informed the
                        plaintiff that he would be remitting “14 million something”
                        that day;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_d"></a>(d)     At or
                        around 25 June 2008, the first defendant faxed a copy of a remittance
                        form to the plaintiff to prove that he had already arranged for funds to pay
                        for the PTTI Shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_e"></a>(e)     After 25 June 2008, the first defendant continued to acknowledge
                        the second defendant’s liability and promised that the second
                        defendant would pay for the PTTI Shares through various e-mails and
                        telephone calls. Notably, on 3 July 2008 – during a conference
                        call with representatives of the plaintiff, Nikhil Advani
                        (“Advani”), Christopher Yeo (“Yeo”) and Amit
                        Gupta (“Gupta”) – the first defendant confirmed that he
                        would transfer US$14m into the Account to settle the payment. During this
                        conversation, Advani carefully summarised the sequence of events leading to
                        the purchase of the PTTI Shares and what happened thereafter. The first
                        defendant agreed with the summary which made it clear that he had promised
                        to transfer funds to pay for the PTTI Shares; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_13-p2_f"></a>(f)     On 9 and 10 July 2008, the second
                        defendant made part payment of US$50,000 and US$1.95m respectively for the
                        PTTI Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     As stated in <em>Cytec
                        Industries Pte Ltd v APP Chemicals International (Mau) Ltd</em> [2009]
                    4 SLR(R) 769 at [38], admissions and acknowledgments of an outstanding
                    debt are sufficient to make out a <em>prima facie</em> case
                    against a defendant, which will result in summary judgment being granted unless
                    the defendant raises a positive case. The above is sufficient evidence of the
                    admission and acknowledgment of the debt owed by the second defendant to the
                    plaintiff. The part payment of the purchase price is further evidence of the
                    admission and acknowledgment of the outstanding debt. On the totality of the
                    evidence before me, therefore, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has established
                    a <em>prima facie</em> case that the purchase price (less
                    the part payment) is owed to the plaintiff by the second defendant. I therefore
                    grant the plaintiff judgment against the second defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The claim against the first defendant for the tort of
                deceit</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The development of the law relating to the
                    tort of deceit was succinctly summarised by LP Thean JA, delivering the
                    judgment of the Court of Appeal, in <em>Panatron Pte Ltd v Lee
                        Cheow Lee</em> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 (“<em>Panatron</em>”) at [13]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... Since the case of Pasley v Freeman (1789) 3 TR 51, it has
                        been settled that a person can be held liable in tort to another, if he
                        knowingly or recklessly makes a false statement to that other with the
                        intent that it would be acted upon, and that other does act upon it and
                        suffers damage. This came to be known as the tort of deceit. In Derry v
                            <em>Peek (1889) 14 App Cas 337 the tort
                            was</em> further developed. It was held that in an action of
                        deceit the plaintiff must prove actual fraud. This fraud is proved only when
                        it is shown that a false representation has been made knowingly, or without
                        belief in its truth, or recklessly, without caring whether it be true or

<p class="Judg-1">The essential elements of the tort were set out by Lord Maugham in

                    by the Court of Appeal in <em>Panatron</em> at [14]. The
                    elements are:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_a"></a>(a)     There must be a representation of
                        fact made by words or conduct;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_b"></a>(b)     The representation must be made with the intention that

<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_c"></a>(c)     It must be proved that the plaintiff had acted
                        upon the false statement;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_d"></a>(d)     It must be proved that the plaintiff suffered damage by
                        so doing; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_15-p2_e"></a>(e)     The representation must be made with knowledge that it is false; it must be
                        wilfully false or at least made in the absence of any genuine belief that it
                        is true.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     It is therefore beyond dispute that prior to
                    the placing of the order and after the order had been placed, the first
                    defendant represented by his words that he would transfer funds to make payment
                    for the PTTI Shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     Counsel for the first defendant attempted to
                    suggest that the above statements made by the first defendant were merely
                    statements of intention and not actionable without more since a
                    misrepresentation had to be one of fact. However, a statement of intention is
                    also a representation as to the existence of the intention and that is a
                    statement of present fact. It is often difficult to prove the state of mind of
                    the maker of a statement. However, in some situations, as in this case, such
                    proof is satisfied by showing that, by reason of the surrounding circumstances,
                    the maker of the statement had no basis upon which he could have had that
                    intention.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The representation must be made with knowledge that it is
                false</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     This particular element was elaborated on by
                    the House of Lords in <em>Derry v Peek</em> (1889) 14 AC
                    337 at 374 (cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in <em>Wishing Star Ltd v Jurong Town Corp</em>
                    [2008] 2 SLR(R) 909 at [16]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... First, in order to sustain an action of deceit, there must be proof of
                        fraud, and nothing short of that will suffice. Secondly, fraud is proved
                        when it is shewn that a false representation has been made (1) knowingly, or
                        (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be
                        true or false. Although I have treated the second and third as distinct
                        cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes
                        a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth of
                        what he states. To prevent a false statement [from] being fraudulent, there
                        must, I think, always be an honest belief in its truth. And this probably
                        covers the whole ground, for one who knowingly alleges that which is false,
                        has obviously no such honest belief. Thirdly, if fraud be proved, the motive
                        of the person guilty of it is immaterial. It matters not that there was no
                        intention to cheat or injure the person to whom the statement was
                        made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     Therefore, aside from actual knowledge, making
                    a representation without belief in its truth will satisfy the knowledge element
                    here, as will making a representation recklessly, without caring if it is true
                    or false. Furthermore, the motive of the person making the representation is
                    irrelevant; the representation need not be made with an intention to cheat or
                    injure the person to whom the statement was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The question therefore as far as this element
                    is concerned, is this: Did the first defendant make a false representation
                    either: (a) knowingly; (b) without belief in its truth; or (c) recklessly,
                    without caring as to whether it is true or false? If any of the above applies,
                    then this element of the tort of deceit is satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     At the close of the plaintiff’s case, I
                    found there to be overwhelming evidence that the first defendant made more than
                    one false representation with knowledge that it was false. The evidence which
                    led me to this finding is as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_a"></a>(a)     the first defendant knew that the
                        second defendant had no funds available to pay for the PTTI Shares and
                        admitted on oath that this was so. In the affidavit filed on 25 November
                        2008 in support of the Stay Application, the first defendant states
                        that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">... at the point in time when the order was placed with [JR] for the
                            purchase of the 120 million PTTI shares, the 2nd Defendant did not have
                            the funds in hand to pay for the purchase. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-2">The first defendant went on to state that he could have paid for
                        the purchase with a certain credit facility from the plaintiff, but the
                        first defendant provided no evidence that the plaintiff agreed to the use of
                        the facility and the plaintiff’s uncontroverted evidence is that there
                        was no such facility;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_b"></a>(b)     the first defendant pretended that moneys were coming in on false and
                        dishonest grounds. The first defendant pretended that moneys were going to
                        come from a US$17m investment he had with a company called “Pioneer
                        Capital LLC” (“Pioneer Capital”). The plaintiff
                        provided unchallenged evidence that Pioneer Capital is a sham, however.
                        Furthermore, the first defendant provided no documents relating to the
                        investment or the defendants’ relationship with Pioneer
                        Capital;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_c"></a>(c)     the
                        first defendant fabricated documents to create the impression that moneys
                        were coming in. At around 12.27pm on 25 June 2008, the first defendant
                        faxed to the plaintiff a remittance form (“the Remittance
                        Form”) as evidence that a sum of US$14,863,200 was in the process of
                        being transferred from Pioneer Capital to the second defendant before the
                        Settlement Date. The plaintiff provided, however, uncontroverted evidence
                        that the Remittance Form was a sham document. Crucially, no funds were ever
                        transferred pursuant to the Remittance Form. The first defendant admitted
                        that the Remittance Form was a sham document: in para 109 of the affidavit
                        (“the Mareva Affidavit”) in support of the Mareva application
                        (which the plaintiff filed on 20 October 2008), the first defendant
                        “admit[s] the falsehood of the remittance advice from
                        Pioneer”;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_d"></a>(d)     the first defendant procured an imposter to pose as a bank officer to
                        give false reassurances to the plaintiff. On 1 July 2008, the first
                        defendant arranged for a conference call between the plaintiff’s
                        representatives and a certain Antonio, a banker from Standard Chartered
                        Bank, to discuss the status of the funds for the purchase of PTTI Shares.
                        During the conversation, Antonio stated, <em>inter
                            alia</em>, that the funds had been transferred. The plaintiff,
                        however, provided uncontroverted evidence that it made enquiries with
                        Standard Chartered Bank and discovered that there was no such banker working
                        there. The first defendant admitted that Antonio was not who he appeared to
                        be in para 109 of the Mareva Affidavit (the first defendant admits the
                        “dubious existence of Antonio”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_e"></a>(e)     the first defendant came up with excuses to
                        avoid paying the amount owed by the second defendant. After numerous
                        assurances subsequent to the placing of the order, the defendants raised a
                        new objection to making payment for the PTTI Shares. By way of their
                        solicitors’ letter dated 5 August 2008, the defendants alleged that
                        the purchase of the PTTI Shares was made using a credit facility provided by
                        the plaintiff; and that there was no reason for the plaintiff to demand the
                        settlement of the trade by 26 June 2008. However, that ran counter to the
                        first defendant’s representations that payment would be made. The
                        plaintiff provided clear and uncontroverted evidence that no approval for
                        any such credit facility was granted and that it was never used or drawn
                        down for the purposes of purchasing the PTTI Shares. Furthermore, the 11.40
                        Conversation is evidence that the objection based on the credit facility was
                        without basis. During the 11.40 Conversation, the first defendant
                        represented to JR that he would transfer the necessary funds into the
                        Account to purchase the PTTI Shares; this was prior to the placing of the
                        order; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_25-p2_f"></a>(f)     the
                        first defendant submitted false documents to the plaintiff prior to
                        purchasing the PTTI Shares. In order to process the application for the
                        credit facility, Gupta of the plaintiff asked the first defendant for the
                        second defendant’s financial statements. The first defendant furnished
                        the plaintiff with the second defendant’s Profit and Loss Accounts for
                        the months ended October 2007 to December 2007. The Profit and Loss
                        Accounts, however, were false. They showed that the second defendant had, as
                        of December 2007, total assets worth about $200m. This was markedly
                        different from the audited financial statements for the year ended 31
                        December 2007, attached to the second defendant’s Annual Return filed
                        on 28 August 2008 (which were never furnished to the plaintiff) which
                        indicated that as at 31 December 2007, the second defendant had total assets
                        worth only about $3.8m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     I found the above to be credible and
                    unchallenged evidence that the first defendant made the representations with the
                    full knowledge that they were false.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The representations were made with the intention that they should be
                relied on by the plaintiff</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As stated in <em>Raiffeisen
                        Zentralbank Osterreich AG v Archer Daniels Midland Co</em> [2007]
                    1 SLR(R) 196 at [53], the issue of reliance is closely tied to the
                    issue of how material the representations are:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it is relevant to consider the state of mind of the representor as the
                        plaintiff must establish an intent to induce. The representor is presumed to
                        have so intended once materiality is proved. The evidential burden then
                        shifts to the representor to displace the prima facie case. It follows that
                        materiality and inducement are closely related. Conversely, if the subject
                        matter of the misrepresentation was immaterial to the business at hand, the
                        court will normally find that the defendant had no intention to induce in
                        the absence of evidence otherwise.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, if the representations are material, the court will presume
                    that the representor intended that the plaintiff rely on the representation. The
                    evidential burden then shifts to the representor to displace the <em>prima facie</em> case. As to what constitutes a material
                    misrepresentation, a material misrepresentation is one that no reasonable person
                    would consider unimportant: <em>Jurong Town Corp v Wishing Star
                        Ltd</em> [2005] 3 SLR(R) 283 at [119].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Here, the representations by the first
                    defendant that the defendants would pay the funds in time for the Settlement
                    Date is certainly material; no reasonable person would consider them
                    unimportant. As such, <em>prima facie</em>, the first
                    defendant intended that the plaintiff rely on the representation. The first
                    defendant has failed to displace the <em>prima facie</em>
                    case, and therefore this element is satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff relied on the representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     The plaintiff’s unchallenged evidence is
                    that had the first defendant not made the representations, the plaintiff would
                    either not have placed the order or would have taken steps to stop the order
                    from being filled. JR provided evidence that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_a"></a>(a)     If the first defendant had not
                        represented during the 11.40 Conversation that he would effect payment
                        for the PTTI Shares by 24 June 2008, he would not have placed the order as
                        there were insufficient funds in the Account to cover the purchase price of
                        the PTTI Shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_b"></a>(b)     After placing the order, if the first defendant had not represented,
                        in the 12.30 Conversation, that he would pay for the PTTI Shares by 24 June
                        2008 and had instead said that he would not be able to pay for the PTTI
                        Shares before the Settlement Date, JR would have pulled back the order;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_29-p2_c"></a>(c)     In any
                        event, between 12.59pm and 3.18pm, while the order was being filled, the
                        plaintiff could have withdrawn any unfilled portion of the order if it was
                        aware that the first defendant would not pay for the PTTI Shares by the
                        Settlement Date.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Therefore, on the evidence before me, I
                    was satisfied that the plaintiff had relied on the
                representations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     The first defendant argued that the
                    pre-approval for the purchase of the shares was made by RW on 20 June 2008
                    without the first defendant having said anything to RW. This, the first
                    defendant argued, was clear evidence that JR had merely carried out the
                    instructions and approval already made by RW on 23 June 2008. JR did not
                    independently decide to proceed with the purchase based on the innocuous
                    responses by the first defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     This contention is untenable. The evidence did
                    not support the first defendant’s contention. Even if the pre-approval was
                    made without any representations on the part of the first defendant,
                    representations were made to JR during the 11.40am Conversation prior to the
                    purchase of the PTTI Shares, which he relied on for the purchase.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The plaintiff further adduced evidence that
                    before JR’s and RW’s superiors, namely, Yeo and Advani, approved the
                    order, they had made express enquiries as to whether the first defendant and/or
                    the second defendant had promised to transfer the money. This is clear from,
                        <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     JR’s evidence that Yeo and
                        Advani expressly instructed him to make the 12.30 Conversation and obtain
                        the confirmation on a recorded line from the first defendant and he would
                        pay before the Settlement Date;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     the telephone conversation among JR, RW and Yeo at
                        12.43pm on 23 June 2008 (“the 12.43 Conversation”) to confirm
                        that the first defendant had agreed to transfer money to pay for the
                        shares;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     Advani’s e-mail at 12.47pm requesting RW’s confirmation in
                        writing that the first defendant will pay for the PTTI Shares;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     RW obtaining
                        the first defendant’s confirmation during the 1.59 Conversation that
                        the first defendant would pay for the PTTI Shares on 24 June 2008 and his
                        subsequent report to Advani that the first defendant’s confirmation
                        had been voice-logged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     It is therefore clear that the
                    plaintiff’s employees were aware of the risks involved in placing the
                    order and were anxious to have on record the first defendant’s
                    confirmation that he would pay for the PTTI Shares before the Settlement Date.
                    Unlike the plaintiff who proved reliance through the evidence, the defendants
                    did not offer any evidence to challenge the plaintiff’s version of
                    events.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The defendants also contended that the
                    plaintiff’s representatives were careless in their haste to obtain
                    business from the first defendant and did not go through the necessary internal
                    approvals prior to placing the order. This was a red herring. The law is clear
                    that even if a plaintiff acted incautiously or failed to take steps to verify
                    the truth of the representations that a prudent man would take, that is no
                    defence to a claim in fraudulent misrepresentation: <em>Panatron</em> (<a href="#p1_12">[12]</a> <em>supra</em>) at [24]. As such, it is irrelevant whether
                    the representatives did the necessary due diligence that would have been prudent
                    of them to do or not. With regard to the internal approval, JR’s actions
                    were ratified, and such ratification was given with the full knowledge by the
                    superiors that the funds for the purchase were not in the account yet but would
                    come in before the Settlement Date. If anything, JR’s eagerness to bypass
                    the internal approvals and place the order is perhaps further indication of the
                    materiality of the representations made by the first defendant and JR’s
                    reliance upon the same.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The plaintiff suffered damage in relying on the
                representation</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     In reliance on the representations, the
                    plaintiff placed the order for the purchase of the PTTI Shares on behalf of the
                    second defendant. After the order was placed, as a result of the
                    defendants’ failure to transfer funds to pay for the PTTI Shares by the
                    Settlement Date, the plaintiff had to pay the full purchase price of the PTTI
                    Shares, amounting to US$14,318,301.84. This evidence was unchallenged. Also
                    undisputed was the plaintiff’s evidence that as of 1 January 2010,
                    after all the PTTI Shares were sold and after part payment, the outstanding
                    amount owed by the second defendant to the plaintiff was US$9,437,687.18.
                    Therefore, the evidence clearly establishes that the plaintiff suffered damage
                    by relying on the representation. This element is accordingly
                satisfied.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     After examining all the elements of the tort
                    of deceit, I found that all the elements were satisfied and that the plaintiff
                    has established that the first defendant committed the tort of deceit against
                    the plaintiff. I therefore grant the plaintiff judgment against the first
                    defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     In view of the foregoing, it will not be
                    necessary to go into the plaintiff claim against the defendants for conspiracy
                    by unlawful means.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The second defendant’s counterclaim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The second defendant had also brought a
                    counterclaim against the plaintiff alleging, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, that the plaintiff’s steps to liquidate the PTTI
                    Shares caused a loss of confidence in the PTTI Shares. However, as the
                    defendants elected to submit that they had no case to answer, this counterclaim
                    was not supported by evidence and thus could not stand. I therefore dismiss the
                    second defendant’s counterclaim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Damages</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Having found both the defendants liable on the
                    respective claims against them (other than for conspiracy) to the counterclaim,
                    it is now necessary to consider the quantum of damages.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Since the plaintiff has established that the
                    purchase price was owed by the second defendant to the plaintiff upon the
                    purchase of the PTTI Shares, and the outstanding amount is the Outstanding Sum
                    (after taking into account the part payment of US$2m and the funds received from
                    the disposal of the PTTI Shares), the plaintiff is entitled to damages from the
                    second defendant in the amount of the Outstanding Sum, which equals
                    US$9,437,687.18. However, as the second defendant still has PT Colorpak shares
                    in the Account, which the Plaintiff is in the process of disposing of, the
                    aforementioned damages shall be reduced by any funds received by the Plaintiff
                    from the disposal of the PT Colorpak shares.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     As the plaintiff has lost the use of the
                    moneys from the Settlement Date, the plaintiff is entitled to interest as well.
                    Section 12(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) grants the
                    court wide discretion to grant interest for any period from the date when the
                    cause of action arose to the date of judgment. Here, the cause of action against
                    the second defendant and the cause of action against the first defendant for the
                    tort of deceit on 26 June 2008. I therefore additionally award the
                    plaintiff interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum on the purchase price (not
                    merely the Outstanding Sum) of US$14,318,301.84 or (as the case may be) the
                    balance thereof outstanding from time to time from 26 of June
                2008.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Since the plaintiff has established that the
                    first defendant committed the tort of deceit against the plaintiff, the first
                    defendant is liable for the losses that resulted from the tort. The losses are
                    exactly the same as described above at <a href="#p1_39">[39]</a>.
                    I therefore award the plaintiff damages to be paid by the first defendant in the
                    amount of the Outstanding Sum, which equals US$9,437,687.18. However, as per
                        <a href="#p1_36">[36]</a> above, the damages shall be reduced
                    by any amounts received by the plaintiff due to the disposal of the
