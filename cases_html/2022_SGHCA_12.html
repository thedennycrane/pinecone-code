In AD/CA 102, the appellant, Png Hock Leng (“Png”), appeals against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in HC/RA 162/2021, which affirmed an assistant registrar’s (“the AR”) decision in HC/OS 171/2021 (“OS 171”), to dismiss his application to transfer the whole of MC/MC 146/2020 (“MC 146”), consisting of a claim and counterclaim, to the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 Png primarily contends that he has the right to transfer MC 146 to the High Court under s 54E of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, Rev Ed 2007) (“SCA”) because his counterclaim in MC 146 exceeds the monetary cap on the District Court’s jurisdiction of $250,000. Alternatively, MC 146 ought to be transferred under s 54B of the SCA because there is “sufficient reason”, an important question of law or MC 146 is a test case and there would be no irreparable prejudice to the respondent, AXA Insurance Pte Ltd (“AXA”). AXA opposes the transfer application. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 In our judgment, Png’s appeal has no merits. MC 146 should not be transferred to the High Court under ss 54B and 54E of the SCA.

Pursuant to the Magistrate’s Court directions, AXA need not file its defence to Png’s counterclaim pending the conclusion of OS 171, including the present appeal. On 10 June 2021, the AR heard and dismissed OS 171 with costs of $3,000 (all inclusive) awarded to AXA. His reasons are contained in the notes of evidence dated 10 June 2021 (“NE”). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">8 On 23 June 2021, Png appealed against the AR’s decision. On 18 August 2021, the Judge heard and dismissed RA 162 with costs of $5,000 (all inclusive) awarded to AXA. The Judge also rejected Png’s request on 27 August 2021 for further arguments and an oral hearing. Png then filed AD/CA 102 on 29 September 2021. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 On 11 March 2022, we heard AD/CA 102 and reserved judgment. The day before, counsel for the appellant, Ms Carolyn Tan (“Ms Tan”), filed a notice to refer to two originating summonses, affidavits and orders of court filed in HC/OS 106/2020 and OS 15/2011. During the hearing, Ms Tan sought leave to refer to these documents as precedent that transfer applications have been allowed simply based on the pleaded quantification of the claims or counterclaims. Counsel for the respondent, Mr Ang Tze Phern (“Mr Tan”), objected on the basis that the notice to refer was a procedural misstep as it was being used as a backdoor attempt to introduce evidence on appeal. As we do not find these documents relevant to AD/CA 102, there is no need to deal with Mr Ang’s contentions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">AR’s decision in OS 171</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 We briefly summarise the decisions below. The AR considered both ss 54B and 54E of the SCA. Png relied on three main grounds for the transfer: (a) that the quantification of his counterclaim exceeded the District Court limit; (b) that the case involved important questions of law and public interest concerning the roles and responsibilities of a financial advisor, the Financial Advisors Act (Cap 110, 2007 Rev Ed) (“FAA”) and Monetary Association of Singapore (“MAS”) regulations; and (c) that for largely the same reasons as in (b), this is a test case more appropriately dealt with in the High Court: NE<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [1]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Dealing with s 54B of the SCA, the AR held that the proceedings did not raise any important question of law or warrant characterisation as a test case. While it may have involved financial dealings, the FAA and the MAS, the shape of pleadings and arguments did not present any issue of law that required resolution by a higher court or where resolution by a higher court is needed for the fundamental operation of the industry or some other fundamental public interest. There was no specific issue of law that would necessarily have to be addressed at trial: NE<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [2]–[3].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The “other sufficient reason” limb was not satisfied. As regards the prospects of mediation if the matter was transferred to the High Court, Png contended that AXA had indicated it was only open to mediation if the matter was transferred to the High Court. However, AXA clarified that it was also amenable to mediation in the State Courts. Thus, it was not necessary or helpful to order a transfer just so the parties would be amenable to mediation: NE<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [4]–[5].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The AR did not find the other reasons raised by Png persuasive: NE at [6]. First, the fact that a counterclaim exceeded the District Court’s jurisdiction did not in itself constitute a “sufficient reason”. The AR relied on <span class="font-italic">Autoexport &amp; EPZ Pte Ltd (formerly known as AJ Towing (S) Pte Ltd v TOW77 Pte Ltd </span>[2021] 4 SLR 1201 (“<span class="font-italic">Autoexport (HC)</span>”) for the proposition that something more than that fact is required. On the test – <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> credible evidence supporting the counterclaim in a transfer application – the AR’s view is that given the preliminary stage of the proceedings in that AXA had not filed its Reply and Defence to the Counterclaim, a determination of the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>merits and credibility of the evidence would effectively be a preliminary trial. The better position is that if the pleadings made clear that the counterclaim was brought solely or vexatiously to abuse the transfer process, that would be sufficient to dismiss the transfer application. The AR did not consider this case an abuse of process: NE<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [7]. Second, the AR rejected Png’s argument that it would be better for perception if the proceedings were heard by the High Court since this was a “David” versus “Goliath” situation: NE<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [8]. Third, there was nothing particularly complex that would more appropriately be heard in the High Court. The causes of action seemed fairly straightforward and would be within the realm of issues dealt with regularly in the State Courts: NE<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [9]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Dealing with s 54E of the SCA, the AR relied on the same three reasons stated in the preceding paragraph. Further, since MC 146 was on a simplified track which was designed to expedite matters and facilitate their resolution at lower costs, it would be beneficial for the parties and especially Png who was, in his counsel’s words, the “David” going up against the “Goliath”. The AR considered that making the transfer order would deprive parties of that set of procedures and subject them to the extended rules of the High Court: NE<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [10]. Finally, the AR also noted that it was inappropriate to transfer the counterclaim alone since the claim and counterclaim are between the same parties and arise largely from the same set of facts: NE<span class="font-italic"> </span>at [11]. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Judge’s decision in RA 162</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 In RA 162, the Judge noted that Png had relied on substantially the same grounds as he did in OS 171. In <span class="font-italic">Png Hock Leng v AXA Insurance Pte Ltd </span>[2021] SGHC 231 at [2]–[3], the Judge agreed with the AR’s decision <span class="font-italic">in toto </span>and dismissed RA 162. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The parties’ arguments</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16 Preliminarily, we note that it is common ground that neither party sought for Png’s counterclaim to be transferred to the High Court alone and for AXA’s claim to proceed in the Magistrate’s Court.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 We reject the notion that the inquiry as to whether the counterclaim exceeds the District Court limit is simply a numerical exercise looking at the counterclaim amount stated in the pleadings. It cannot be the case that a counterclaimant can simply manipulate the transfer process by making a bare assertion that the quantification of his counterclaim exceeds the District Court limit <span class="font-italic">without any substantiation</span>. The minimum requirement is that the applicant must produce some evidential material which can be taken at face value to support the quantification of his counterclaim. Without satisfying this minimum requirement, a bare assertion of a large quantification for the purposes of a transfer application may raise questions as to the counterclaimant’s motive for filing the counterclaim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 We note that the AR expressed doubt that it was appropriate to require <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>credible evidence supporting the counterclaim in a transfer application given the preliminary stage of proceedings as a determination of the <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>merits and credibility of the evidence would transcend into a “mini trial”. He was thus inclined to take the position that the threshold should be an abuse of process instead (see above at [13]). We disagree that a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> threshold necessarily requires the court to enter into a mini trial. As stated by Lai Siu Chiu SJ in <span class="font-italic">Wong Siew Mee v Jee Lee and another (Tan Poh Weng Andy (formerly known as Tan Poh Kim), third party)</span> [2020] 5 SLR 1391 at [66], while a transfer application is not the forum to determine the merits of the plaintiff’s claim or its quantum, the burden is still on the plaintiff to show some <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>evidence that the general damages being claimed is likely to exceed $250,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 In our view, the case law speaks with one voice that the quantification of the counterclaim must be proven on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard. In <span class="font-italic">Tan Kok Ing v Tan Swee Meng and others </span>[2003] 1 SLR(R) 657 (“<span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Meng</span>”) at [25]–[26], Woo Bih Li JC (as he then was) stated:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25 In the case before me, [the plaintiff] wanted to … transfer his case from a lower court, (<span class="font-italic">ie </span>the Magistrate’s Court), to a higher court (<span class="font-italic"> ie</span> the District Court). …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 … I was of the view that there is no question of making a mini-inquiry first. If a plaintiff subsequently takes the view that the quantum of his damages may exceed the jurisdiction of the court in which he has commenced his action, then he must apply to transfer his action to a higher court as soon as possible. <span class="font-italic">So long as there is some reasonable basis for his view</span>, it is not for the court hearing the application, to embark on an inquiry to assess the quantum before deciding whether to transfer the action or not. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Ms Tan conveniently relies on <span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Meng </span>as authority that the court should not embark on an inquiry to assess the quantification of Png’s counterclaim but fails to appreciate that Woo JC’s statement was caveated by his own statement that this applies “[s]o long as there is <span class="font-italic">some reasonable basis</span> for [the plaintiff’s] view” [emphasis added]. This must mean that the court would naturally expect an applicant to adduce the evidential basis and calculations which show that the quantification is <span class="font-italic">reasonable</span>.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 More recently, Hoo Sheau Peng J in <span class="font-italic">Ng Djoni v Miranda Joseph Jude </span>[2018] 5 SLR 670 (“<span class="font-italic">Djoni</span>”) undertook a review of the case law as to the appropriate standard required of an applicant to show that the damages of his claim would exceed the jurisdictional limit of the inferior court (at [21]–[26] and [29]) as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">21 …[T]he plaintiff contended that the threshold for a ‘sufficient reason’ was a lower one. He submitted that there would be ‘sufficient reason’ for the transfer if he could demonstrate merely the possibility, and not the likelihood or a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case, that his damages would exceed the jurisdictional limit of the inferior court. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">22 In [<span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd v Ng Chan Teng</span> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 839], the Court of Appeal … opined, as an aside, that the <span class="font-italic">possibility</span> of damages exceeding the jurisdictional limit would ordinarily be regarded as a ‘sufficient reason’ for a transfer of proceedings (at [38]) …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">23 This iteration of the legal test was applied by the High Court in <span class="font-italic">Ng</span><span class="font-italic"> Chan Teng v Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd </span>[2009] 2 SLR(R) 647<span class="font-italic"> </span>(‘<span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine 2009 HC</span>’) when the same plaintiff’s subsequent<span class="font-italic"> </span>application for a transfer of proceedings came before the High Court. From the medical reports on the plaintiff’s severe injuries, Tay Yong Kwang J was satisfied that there was a <span class="font-italic">‘</span><span class="font-italic">real possibility’</span> that the plaintiff’s damages would exceed $250,000 (<span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine 2009 HC </span>at [24]). When this decision went on appeal, the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment in <span class="font-italic">Keppe</span><span class="font-italic">l Singmarine 2010</span>, … as authority for the applicable law. The Court of Appeal described the applicable standard for a ‘sufficient reason’ in these terms (<span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine 2010 </span>at [16]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We were <span class="font-italic">in agreement</span><span class="font-italic"> with the [High Court] Judge </span>that the <span class="font-italic">likelihood </span>that a plaintiff’s damages would exceed the jurisdictional limit of the District Court would, ordinarily, be regarded as ‘sufficient reason’ for the transfer of proceedings to the High Court under s 54B of the [Subordinate Courts Act]. As the respondent’s claim here was <span class="font-italic">likely </span>to exceed the $250,000 mark …, we found that the respondent had given sufficient reason to <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>satisfy the transfer threshold.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24 The Court of Appeal agreed with the standard applied by Tay J in <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine 2009 HC </span>notwithstanding that Tay J had expressed the requisite standard in different terms. In <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine 2009 HC</span>, Tay J had required the plaintiff to demonstrate a ‘possibility’ of damages exceeding $250,000, whereas the Court of Appeal required a ‘likelihood’ to be shown. On the facts, the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the plaintiff’s claim was likely to exceed the $250,000 mark given the severity of the injuries suffered by him (see <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine 2010 </span>at [16] and <span class="font-italic">Keppel</span> <span class="font-italic">Singmarine 2009 HC </span>at [24]). Thus, the plaintiff had given sufficient reason to <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>satisfy the threshold for a transfer, subject to him showing that a transfer would not cause irreparable prejudice to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25 In the later case of <span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat v Lim Kui Lin </span>[2013] 1 SLR 765 (‘<span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat</span>’), Judith Prakash J applied <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine 2010 </span>and was satisfied that there was ‘<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, credible evidence’ to support the assertions underlying the substantial loss of earnings, so as to justify crossing the jurisdictional limit of the State Courts.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">26 From this brief review, it seems that what is ostensibly the same criterion has been described by the courts using different terms that suggest varying degrees of proof, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, ‘possibility’, ‘likelihood’ and a ‘<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>’ case. Nonetheless, it would appear that the courts have used these terms synonymously, without observing any tension between them. On this basis, I am of the view that the correct test was applied by the AR, who followed the approach in <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine 2010 </span>and <span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat</span>. <span class="font-italic">Keppel</span> <span class="font-italic">Singmarine 2010 </span>is, moreover, the most recent Court of Appeal authority determining the applicable law as part of its holding, not merely as an aside.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">29 In the present case, the plaintiff placed great emphasis on the court’s view in <span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat</span> that the hearing of the transfer application was not the correct forum to determine whose evidence of the plaintiff’s physical condition and abilities was more credible. He argued that, likewise, the AR erred in scrutinising the evidence of his injuries, abilities and loss of income, because such scrutiny was to be reserved for the trial itself. However, this argument failed to grasp that the court in <span class="font-italic">Tan Kee Huat</span> required minimally the existence of ‘<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, credible evidence’ to substantiate the assertions underlying the quantification of the claims. A ‘<span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>’ standard assumes that the conclusion reached is subject to further evidence and cross-examination. Nonetheless, to show a <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> case<span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">, the evidence must at first appearance be capable of supporting the desired</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> conclusion</span>. <span class="font-italic">A priori</span>, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">if the</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> plaintiff’s own evidence is incapable of supporting the desired quantification of the claims, the plaintiff would have failed to demonstrate a possibility or likelihood</span> that the claims would exceed the jurisdictional threshold of the State Courts. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 We see no reason that Hoo J’s analysis in respect of s 54B ought not apply to s 54E. After all, Hoo J was assessing the same inquiry of whether the asserted quantification of the claim exceeded the District Court limit. That said, we hesitate to use the term “credible evidence” since it may imply that the court ought to go further to examine the merits of the evidence or question the veracity of it. We agree with Hoo J in <span class="font-italic">Djoni </span>(at [29]) that the <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> threshold simply means that the evidence at <span class="font-italic">first appearance </span>(similar to accepting the evidence at face value) must be capable of supporting the asserted quantification of the counterclaim. If the applicant’s own evidence is incapable of even supporting the quantification of the counterclaim, the applicant would have failed to meet the threshold requirement of s 54E(1) of the SCA on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard.

</div> There is no explanation for why this differs so radically from the remuneration of $109,054.57 stated in AXA’s own letter dated 5 March 2015 for the <span class="font-italic">same </span>period. In our judgment, for the purposes of this threshold requirement, it is not appropriate for the court to entertain speculation to explain this discrepancy or assess the credibility of the disputed figures to decide which is more accurate. For the foregoing reasons, we accept Png’s evidence at face value that his total remuneration for 2014 was $109,054.57. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 In the premises, Png’s loss of income for the period of May 2017 to April 2021 can be calculated at $366,030. Adopting AXA’s formula (see above at [44]), this is based on the sum of $109,054.57 divided by 12 months, multiplied by 47 months and deducting his actual income of $1,300 for 47 months in the waterproofing company. This exceeds the District Court limit. Whilst this approach assumes that Png performs at the same level as he did in 2014 in respect of his targets and would likely earn a similar remuneration throughout the period of 2017 to 2021, this is nonetheless his arguable case that he would have consistently achieved it but for AXA’s repudiatory breach. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether a transfer should be granted as </span><span class="font-weight-bold">of right </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">so long as the</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> counterclaim exceeds $250,000</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Even though Png arguably satisfies the threshold requirement, he also has to persuade the court that it ought to order the transfer of MC 146 to the High Court considering all the circumstances.

Properly construed, a counterclaim which exceeds the District Court’s limit simply satisfies the prerequisite for the High Court’s power to transfer the proceedings under s 54E(1) as stated at [31] above. The court nonetheless has a discretion to decide whether or not to transfer the proceedings in s 54E(2). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Third, we agree with AXA that Png’s reliance on case law that pre-dated the amendment to the SCA and the legislative history of the SCA does not assist him.

The Court of Appeal was dealing with the sole issue of whether the High Court had the power to transfer proceedings started in the Magistrate’s Court to itself. While it referred (at [26]) to s 22 to 24 of the 1999 SCA which dealt with situations when a claim or counterclaim filed in the District Court exceeded the District Court limit, it did not decide that a party is entitled to a transfer based solely on the fact that the counterclaim exceeds the District Court limit. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) <span class="font-italic">Rightrac Trading v Ong Soon Heng trading as Everbright Engineering &amp; Trading and others</span> [2003] 4 SLR(R) 505 is distinguishable on the basis that it concerned a transfer application under the 1999 SCA by the plaintiffs to transfer proceedings from the Magistrate’s Court to the District Court and it was the plaintiff’s case which exceeded the Magistrate’s Court limit. As explained in <span class="font-italic">Autoexport (HC) </span>(at [14]–[15]), without a transfer to the High Court, a plaintiff’s recovery in the District Court would be subject to the District Court limit, unless otherwise agreed with the defendant under s 23 of the SCA. However, the position would be very different when it is the defendant’s counterclaim which exceeds the District Court’s jurisdiction. Under s 54E(4) of the SCA, if no application is made under s 54E(1) or an order is made for the whole proceedings to be tried in the State Courts, the State Court’s jurisdiction to try the proceedings would not be subject to the District Court limit.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) <span class="font-italic">Tan Swee Meng</span> dealt with an application under the 1999 SCA by the plaintiff to transfer a case from the Magistrate’s Court to the District Court on the basis that the damages arising might exceed the Magistrate’s Court limit. This case is similarly distinguishable on the same basis that it was the plaintiff’s case which exceeded the Magistrate’s Court limit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">54 Nothing in the second reading of the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 16/2005) shed any light on the test to be applied for s 54E. While it was noted in <span class="font-italic">Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report </span>(15 August 2005) vol 80 col 1239 (Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for Law) that the situation where the defendant’s counterclaim exceeded the court’s jurisdiction was an example of a difficult case where there may be a need to transfer, the statement did not go so far as to set this as a sole basis for the transfer to be effected. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 Similarly, the May 2004 Report of the Law Reform Committee on Transfers of Civil Proceedings between Courts does not assist him either. The report observed at p 3 that there should be a general discretion to transfer civil proceedings between courts and “one uniform regime of transfer for civil proceedings”. It also noted at p 4 that there should be uniformity in the grounds for transfers and these grounds should be spelled out in general terms as it is not desirable for legislature to lay down specific rules as to when the court should exercise its discretion. These observations in fact militate against Png’s interpretation of s 54E. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 In <span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine Dockyard</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Ng Chan Teng </span>[2010] 2 SLR 1015 (“<span class="font-italic">Keppel Singmarine</span>”) at [16]–[17], the Court of Appeal held that the mere existence of a “sufficient reason” under s 54B(1) of the SCA does not automatically entitle a party to a transfer of proceedings. A holistic evaluation of <span class="font-italic">all the material circumstances</span> must be undertaken; in particular the court should assess the prejudice that might be visited upon a party resisting the transfer. The Court of Appeal explained that the words “may order” in s 54B of the SCA (see [27] above) “make it abundantly clear that every transfer under the subject provision is a discretionary one requiring a principled approach that requires a balancing of the respective competing interests of the parties”. Consistent with the intention for an “uniform regime of transfer”, the same approach is equally applicable to transfer applications under s 54E. Indeed, s 54E(2) is worded similarly to s 54B(1) in that the court “<span class="font-italic">may</span>, as it thinks fit, and on such terms as it sees fit, <span class="font-italic">order</span>” [emphasis added] (see [28] above) a partial or full transfer of the proceedings to the High Court or that the proceedings remain in the States Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 In <span class="font-italic">Autoexport (HC) </span>itself (at [20]), the applicant’s transfer application was dismissed under s 54E of the SCA because its <span class="font-italic">only</span> ground was that its counterclaim exceeded the District Court limit. There was no important or complex issue of law or fact, and there was no prejudice to the applicant if the proceedings remained in the District Court. We agree with <span class="font-italic">Autoexport (HC)</span> at [18] that even if an applicant satisfied the threshold requirement in s 54E(1) on a <span class="font-italic">prima facie </span>standard, this alone does not justify the court’s exercise of discretion to allow the transfer application under s 54E(2) (or amount to “sufficient reason” under s 54B(1)). Something more is required. The ruling is consistent with the structure of s 54E of the SCA and correctly interprets the provision. As stated above at [30], the burden of proof lies on the applicant to persuade the court that the court ought to order the transfer sought considering all the circumstances. We thus do not hesitate to reject Png’s misconceived argument that if there is an absence of factors against a transfer, the default position is that a transfer should be ordered.

Under the simplified process for proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court governed by O 108 rr 2(7) and 2(9) of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed), the court may at any stage of the proceedings order the production of any document, if the court is of the opinion that such an order is necessary either for the fair disposal of the case or for the saving of costs. If any party fails to comply with any such order, the court may make any order it thinks just including dismissing the action and finding the default party liable to committal. As such, there is no merit to Png’s bare assertion that he is unable to obtain discovery in the Magistrate’s Court but can somehow do so in the High Court. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 Third, we agree that the AR’s and the Judge’s finding that transferring MC 146 would deprive parties of the simplified process for trials in the Magistrate’s Court leans in favour of refusing the transfer. AXA points out that since pleadings have been crystallised save for AXA’s right to file an amended reply and defence to Png’s counterclaim and parties have undergone several rounds of discovery by way of letter requests, the relevance and necessity of which have been fully ventilated before the Magistrate’s Court, a transfer of the proceedings will deprive parties of the simplified procedure and put parties to significant costs of having to re-litigate and undergo the entire discovery process again.

</div> They are vague in that no specific issues are clearly crystallised. Taking his argument at such a general level, any clause within AXA’s employment contract with a financial adviser would be an important question of law. Lastly, his argument assumes that the relationship between AXA and Png traversed employment law whereas the relationship of the financial adviser and the company is typically that of an independent contractor and outside the realm of employment law.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) Even though MC 146 may involve questions of contract law, employment law and the insurance industry, the submissions made by Png did not adequately justify why the High Court is better placed than the Magistrate’s Court to determine the issues in MC 146. There was no basis for Png’s bare assertions that the issues of (i) whether “Letters of Release” (which Mr Ang distinguishes from a reference check form) were such a common requirement in the insurance industry that denial of the same constituted an unlawful interference with trade and profession; and (ii) the determination of a multiplier and multiplicand to assess his losses of future earnings would be complex and therefore “best left to a High Court judge”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Finally, we would add that AXA’s claim and Png’s counterclaim are inextricably linked. If Png succeeds in proving his counterclaim, he will not be limited to obtaining judgment of only $250,000. This is because Png’s counterclaim being heard in the Magistrate’s Court would not be subject to the District Court limit under s 54E(4) (see above at [53(b)]). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 For the reasons above, MC 146 (which includes Png’s counterclaim) should not be transferred to the High Court under s 54E of the SCA.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether MC146 should be transferred to the High Court under s 54B of the SCA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 As regards s 54B, Png largely relies on the same arguments canvassed under s 54E. It is clear to us that none of the three limbs of s 54B(1) are satisfied. As we explained above at [66]–[67], Png fails to produce sufficient evidence showing that MC 146 is a test case or that MC 146 raises an important question of law. We have also held above at [57] that the fact that the counterclaim <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span> exceeds the District Court limit is insufficient to amount to “sufficient reason”. None of the other reasons Png relies upon are supported by any evidential basis. In our judgment, they do not amount to “sufficient reason” to transfer the whole of MC 146 to the High Court.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 Accordingly, we dismiss AD/CA 102 in full. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 At the conclusion of the hearing, Ms Tan made a last-ditch attempt to pray that this court transfers MC 146 to the District Court if we were minded to dismiss AD/CA 102. She did not point to any provision allowing the court to do so. It suffices for us to observe that this is not an order we may make under s 54E(2). If Png wished to seek a transfer from the Magistrate’s Court to the District Court, Png ought to have applied to the District Court under ss 54A and/or 54F of the SCA which deals with the District Court’s power to allow a transfer of proceedings from the Magistrate’s Court to itself. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 As for the costs of AD/CA 102, Png submits that costs should be fixed at $20,000 (inclusive of disbursements) if he succeeds on appeal and at $10,000 (inclusive of disbursements) if he is unsuccessful on appeal.
