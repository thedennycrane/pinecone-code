He is a graduate of the University of Virginia and of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Some 30 years ago, he was involved, together with two colleagues, Mr S. L. Choi and Mr Andy Kwei, in the purchase of the Asian business of a company called Flextronics. The chief financial officer of that business was Mr Goh Chan Peng, the first defendant (“Mr Goh”). Mr Shaw worked closely with Mr Goh and the business flourished. Mr Shaw concluded as a result that Mr Goh was a “straightforward guy”.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">2 In early 2000, Mr Goh was approached by Mr Chay Kwong Soon (“Mr Chay”), the Chairman of the parent company of the Beyonics group of companies (the “Beyonics Group” or “Beyonics”) of which the five plaintiffs are subsidiaries. Mr Chay invited Mr Goh to become the chief executive officer (“CEO”) of the Beyonics Group. Mr Goh left Flextronics and on 1 May 2000 was appointed CEO of the Beyonics Group. He remained CEO until 30 April 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">3 The Beyonics Group consisted of two manufacturing divisions, the Precision Engineering Services (“PES”) Division and the Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) Division. Amongst other things, the PES Division manufactured and sold baseplates for hard disk drives (“HDDs”) destined for end customers, such as Seagate, Hitachi and Western Digital. The dispute in this action concerns the PES Division, specifically, the baseplate manufacturing business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">4 At the time of the matters giving rise to the dispute, the parent company of Beyonics was called Beyonics Technology Ltd (“BTL”). The first plaintiff (“BAP”), the fourth plaintiff (“BTEC”), the fifth plaintiff (“BPM”) and a further subsidiary, Beyonics Technology (Thailand) Co Ltd (“BTT”), were part of the PES Division. BTEC owned and operated a baseplate manufacturing facility in Changshu, China; BPM owned and operated a baseplate facility in Tampoi, Malaysia; and BTT owned and operated a baseplate facility in Ayutthaya, Thailand. BAP did not own or operate any such facility but was the sales company for the baseplates manufactured by BTEC, BPM and BTT. The second and third plaintiffs (“BIL” and “BTS”) are also subsidiary companies of BTL but are not part of the PES division. I refer to these companies collectively as the “Plaintiffs”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">5 By 2010, Mr Shaw had become a partner in an independent private equity fund manager, Shaw Kwei &amp; Partners (“SKP”), based in Hong Kong. One of the managing directors was Mr Tsui Sung Lam (“Mr Tsui”), who had worked with Mr Goh at Flextronics. In late 2010 or early 2011, Mr Tsui and Mr Goh met and Mr Goh indicated that Beyonics was considering the sale of its business. Mr Tsui informed Mr Shaw and, as a result, SKP proposed that its investment vehicle, Bayport Capital Ltd (“Bayport”) should consider acquiring the Beyonics Group through a BVI company, Channelview Investments Ltd (“Channelview”). This led to an Implementation Agreement dated 5 October 2011, followed by due diligence which resulted in a formal offer to take over the Beyonics Group. This was approved in a shareholders meeting on 30 December 2011 and the scheme was sanctioned by the High Court of Singapore and completed on 2 February 2012. Mr Shaw then became chairman of Channelview with both Mr Goh and Mr Chay being directors as well as not insubstantial shareholders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6  As was apparent in the witness box, both Mr Shaw and Mr Goh are powerful personalities, used to being the directing minds of commercial operations and accustomed to being leaders rather than followers. Mr Shaw expected Mr Goh to follow his lead and Mr Goh expected Mr Shaw to allow him, with his more than ten years in the business, to continue to run Beyonics with the freedom he had been given by the previous board of directors. A falling out was perhaps inevitable and it duly occurred. I shall have to consider in some details the factual background leading up to the fall out. It is sufficient for present purposes to record that it occurred, with the result that on 9 January 2013 Mr Goh resigned his directorships in the various companies in the Beyonics Group. Resignation agreements (the “Resignation Agreements”) were signed with a number of those companies (including BAP, BIL and BTS) and Mr Goh ceased to be employed on 30 April 2013.

He therefore asked Mr Goh to return the notebook computer he had been using and discovered that all files had been deleted before it was returned. The same was true of a desktop computer. Later in January 2013 Mr Shaw engaged FTI Consulting to carry out a full forensic investigation into the contents of the deleted files. During the course of a lengthy piece of cross-examination,

In particular, three agreements between the second defendant, Pacific Globe Enterprises Ltd, a company owned and controlled by Mr Goh which, at the relevant time, was named Wyser International Ltd, (“Wyser”), and Nedec/Kodec were discovered which indicated that Wyser had been paid substantial sums by Nedec/Kodec.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">9 FTI’s final report

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> (the “FTI Report”) was issued on 23 July 2013 and proceedings were brought on 25 July 2013 by BTL and one subsidiary company (Beyonics International Pte Ltd or “BIPL”) against Mr Goh, his wife and Wyser in Singapore in High Court Suit No 672 of 2013. I shall refer to this action as “the 672 Action” and to the Plaintiffs in that action as BTL and BIPL or, together, as “the 672 Plaintiffs”, and to Mr Goh, his wife, and Wyser as “the 672 Defendants”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 The 672 Plaintiffs alleged that Mr Goh had breached various duties owed to them and further had engaged in a conspiracy with Wyser and Nedec/Kodec to injure the Plaintiffs. Mr Goh’s wrongdoings were alleged to have resulted in the diversion of certain business from a customer of the Beyonics Group, Seagate, to Nedec/Kodec which culminated in the loss of its entire baseplate business with Seagate. For the role Mr Goh played, he allegedly received two payments from the Nedec/Kodec via Wyser, which dishonestly assisted in Mr Goh’s breach of duties. BTL’s claims related to the loss of the Seagate’s business and it also sought an order that the payments be disgorged to BTL. Additionally, BIPL raised claims against Mr Goh for the return of unjustified expenses and salary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">11 Mr Goh denied that he was in breach of duties and maintained that he acted in the best interests of the 672 Plaintiffs at all times. He did not deny that he received payments from Nedec/Kodec, but claimed that they were legitimate payments for consultancy services. Hence, there was no conspiracy between Mr Goh, Wyser and Nedec/Kodec to injure the Plaintiffs and Wyser did not dishonestly assist in the breach of his duties. The loss of Seagate’s business, in whole or in part, was not caused by them. Finally, Mr Goh contended that the expenses and salary were justified.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">12 The action was heard by Hoo Sheau Peng JC (as she then was) (“the 672 Trial Judge”) over a period of 19 days in August and September 2015 which, following written closing submissions, resulted in a judgment on 28 June 2016 ([2016] SGHC 120, reported as [2016] 4 SLR 472) (“the 672 Judgment”). The 672 Plaintiffs were almost entirely successful although the damages awarded for the loss of the Seagate business were less than those claimed. Mr Goh and Wyser appealed and, whilst the Court of Appeal did not reverse any of the findings of fact, by its judgment of 27 June 2017 ([2017] SGCA 40, reported as [2017] 2 SLR 592) (“the 672 Appeal Judgment”) it held that BTL was not entitled to recover certain of the losses that it had claimed and which had been awarded by the 672 Trial Judge, as those losses had not been suffered by BTL, the parent company, but had in fact been suffered by various subsidiary companies which are now the plaintiffs in this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">13 The Court of Appeal’s reasoning was as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">70 The third point is the most important point. It appears from [37] of the [672 Judgment] that the Judge considered that the holding company in a group of companies could claim for loss suffered by a subsidiary in the group because as a holding company it was in a position to direct and control the application of the cash and profits of its subsidiaries. This, however, is not the law. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">71 The well-established doctrine that each incorporated entity is a separate legal entity with separate legal rights and liabilities applies as much to companies within an ownership group as it does to companies that are unrelated to each other. As stated by Sundaresh Menon JC [as he then was] in <span class="font-italic">Public Prosecutor v Lew </span><span class="font-italic">Syn Pau and another</span> [2006] 4 SLR(R) 210 (“<span class="font-italic">Lew </span><span class="font-italic">Syn Pau</span>”), at [212], the doctrine of separate legal personality is not displaced simply by virtue of the fact that the companies in question are, as members of a group, organised as a single economic unit. Thus, between a parent or holding company and its subsidiary, the rights and assets of the related companies are treated as belonging to each discrete company, distinct from those of the other company. Further, in <span class="font-italic">Manuchar</span><span class="font-italic"> Steel Hong Kong Ltd v Star Pacific Line Pte Ltd</span> [2014] 4 SLR 832 (“<span class="font-italic">Manuchar</span><span class="font-italic"> Steel</span>”), Lee Kim Shin JC observed at [101] that the single economic entity concept was not recognised by Singapore law or by the common law generally. This being the case, it is incorrect to say that BAP’s loss of profits that were booked in BAP’s accounts could be considered to be the loss of profits of its holding company, BTL, simply because consolidated accounts were prepared for the whole Beyonics Group [BAP, Beyonics Asia Pacific Ltd, was a subsidiary company of BTL and is the 1st Plaintiff in this action].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">72  To amplify, Menon JC in <span class="font-italic">Lew </span><span class="font-italic">Syn Pau</span> stated at [204] that “reliance upon the fact of control and of consolidation of group accounts is misplaced if it is thereby sought to be suggested that the doctrine of separate legal personality is something displaced in a group setting”. Consolidated financial statements are required by financial reporting standards when an entity controls one or more other entities (see Financial Report Standard 110 on Consolidated Financial Statements as issued by the Accounting Standards Council Singapore, a standard which applies to BTL). <span class="font-italic">The mere fact that accounts are consolidated on a group basis for reporting purposes does not detract from the reality that the profits (and losses) of each separate company are still that company’s own profits and losses</span><span class="font-italic">. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">75  It was BAP that suffered the Diversion Loss and the Total Loss and these losses could not legally be transformed into BTL’s losses whether by the preparation of consolidated accounts or in any other way. Accordingly, the Judge erred in awarding BTL damages based on such losses and Mr Goh’s appeal on this point must be allowed. While this result may seem harsh to BTL given the egregious nature of the breaches by Mr Goh, the alternative – which would be to recognise the single economic entity concept – would be contrary to both principle and authority. It would critically undermine the doctrine of separate legal personality which is the bedrock of company law not just in Singapore but also throughout the common law world. The single economic entity concept is also difficult to reconcile with the restricted approach to the piercing of the corporate veil which is a feature of the common law (see <span class="font-italic">Manuchar</span><span class="font-italic"> Steel</span> at [96]). Generally, piercing the veil is justified by abuse of the corporate form or if it is necessary for the veil to be lifted to give effect to a legislative provision …; but neither situation exists here. BTL was not a wrongdoer. Hence, we cannot ignore the separate legal existence of BAP and BTL much though we deplore Mr Goh’s conduct.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added; original emphasis and internal citations omitted]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">14 Having suffered that reverse, this action was commenced on 21 August 2017 by the five subsidiary companies against Mr Goh and Wyser (the “Defendants”) claiming both the losses which had been disallowed in the 672 Action as well as certain other alleged losses which had not been claimed in that action. The Plaintiffs accepted that they could not rely on the findings of fact made in the 672 Plaintiffs’ favour in that action and that, in so far as the Defendants did not admit liability, the necessary evidence would have to be adduced afresh and the matter ruled upon at a subsequent trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">15 The Defendants made no admissions. They contended that on the basis of subsequently obtained material the outcome of any later trial would be different and would result in findings in their favour. In addition, however, they contended that the bringing of this action by these Plaintiffs was an abuse of the process of the court as the claims now made in this action could and should have been made by them in the 672 Action. They rely on the well-known doctrine of the extended form of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> having its origin in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson </span>[1843] 3 Hare 999 (“<span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">16  There are thus two entirely different defences. I shall refer to them as the “<span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue” and the “Substantive Issue”. The former requires close attention to be paid to the matters in issue in the 672 Action in order to compare those issues with the issues raised in this action. The question of whether in all the circumstances the bringing of this action is an abuse can then be addressed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 The Substantive Issue however requires the findings of the 672 Action to be disregarded. No plea of estoppel is raised by the Plaintiffs. It is common ground that this issue can only be and must be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced at the trial of this action. It is therefore open to this court to come to a different conclusion on the facts to that reached by the 672 Trial Judge in the 672 Action if the evidence given at this trial requires it. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 Immediately prior to the trial of this action the Defendants objected to certain passages in the affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs”) sworn on behalf of the Plaintiffs because they sought to rely on findings in the 672 Action as being true. An application was therefore made to strike out those passages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 I heard arguments on the first day of the trial and gave judgment on the second day. In that judgment I set out the distinction between the approach to those two wholly discrete issues which I draw upon in [20] to [37] below.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 It is trite law that only evidence relevant to the issues in the case is admissible at trial. Evidence which is relevant and admissible on one of those issues may not be relevant to the other. The court must be astute in identifying to which issue a given piece of evidence is relevant and to ensure that if it is inadmissible in relation to another issue, it does not serve to cloud the judicial mind on that other issue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 Admissibility of evidence relating to the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue is governed by s 42 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) which is as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Previous judgments relevant to bar a second suit or trial</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">42.</span> The existence of any judgment, order or decree which by law prevents any court from taking cognizance of a suit or holding a trial is a relevant fact when the question is whether the court ought to take cognizance of the suit or to hold the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The Plaintiffs referred me to the commentary on s 42 which is found in paragraph 7.003 of <span class="font-italic">Evidence and the Litigation Process </span>(LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2017) by Professor Jeffrey Pinsler SC, which states: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">This section concerns estoppel by record, otherwise known as ‘judgment estoppel’ or estoppel <span class="font-italic">per rem </span><span class="font-italic">judicatam</span>.  The effect of the estoppel is that a previous judgement of a court of competent jurisdiction over the parties is conclusive – unless it is obtained by fraud or collusion – as between those parties so that they are estoppel from contradicting it.  The section is procedural in nature because its intention is to admit the previous judgment, not for its evidential value, but for the purpose of supporting the plea of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> so as to bar the suit.  Therefore, when the judgment is pleaded in this way and accepted as <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, it is conclusive as to the facts on which it is based in relation to the parties and their privies.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Plaintiffs also referred me to the decision in <span class="font-italic">Arul Chandran v Chew Chin </span><span class="font-italic">Aik Victor JP</span> [2000] SGHC 111 (“<span class="font-italic">Arul Chandran</span>”).  I shall cite more out of that judgment than the Plaintiffs referred me to because it is also relevant to the question of evidence on the Substantive Issue which I shall consider below.  Paragraphs 141–144 read as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">141 Subject to s 42 to 45A, a previous judgment making certain findings of fact cannot be merely tendered in another trial as proof of the existence or the truth of those facts.  If questions of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or issue estoppel arise for determination for instance, then the previous judgment is admissible under s 42, (a) to prove the existence of that previous judicial determination as a final judgment of a competent court, and (b) to establish what the cause of action there was, who the parties were, in what capacities they were litigating, and what exactly were the issues previously determined so that the court can decide those questions. But this by no means provides the gateway for the flood of facts established in other judicial forums to be admitted as evidence or as conclusive proof of the same facts which are in dispute in another trial where all or some of the parties are different. The general rule is that the production of a previous judgment merely evidences the fact that there has been a judgment and there are certain legal consequences. But tendering the previous judgment and then quoting parts of the judgment at length in a question to which the witness refuses to accept as being undisputed will not <span class="font-italic">per se</span> amount to evidence proving the correctness or the truth of any of the facts mentioned therein.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">142 I follow the strict approach. I am mindful of the hearsay rule. Where the evidence amounts to hearsay it can only be admitted if the hearsay evidence comes in under the exceptions to the hearsay rule provided in the Evidence Act. Hence, reading out chunks of any judgment relating to certain facts (whether disputed or not) as found previously by a court to a witness at this trial, in particular to Arul, as a prelude to the questions asked of him during his cross-examination, will not turn that narration by counsel into evidence to prove those facts, if Arul does not admit or agree to them. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">143 I am also mindful that I have to consider whether those facts not proved have materially injured his reputation after taking account of those other facts and imputations that the defendant manages to prove to the requisite degree of probability, commensurate with the gravity of the charges. If his reputation has not materially suffered because of those facts not proved, then the justification defence still succeeds. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">144 However, in relation to what Arul had (a) testified to in evidence at the previous trial before Justice Abdul Razak (for which notes of evidence were available), (b) affirmed in any of his previous affidavits in the various court actions in Johore, or (c) said in any correspondence with the Law Society, the defendant or third parties, these are admissible in evidence before me, when the object is to discredit him, contradict his testimony, or establish the contrary facts or admissions, by proof that he had indeed said something very different on some previous occasion. The relevance and admissibility under these circumstances have been clearly provided for in other sections of the Evidence Act.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 This judgment highlights very clearly the circumstances in which previous statements are admissible at a subsequent trial on the merits and those where they are not. I shall return to this below. However, in the case of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span>, the previous judgment is admissible, but only for the limited purposes outlined above, either (a) to prove its existence, or (b) to identify issues that were previously determined.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">25 Additionally, of course, in a case of an alleged <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> estoppel, evidence relating to why the plaintiff could not or should not have brought the claim in the previous action and any other evidence relevant to the question of abuse of process will be admissible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 On the Substantive Issue, s 42 does not apply. Questions of admissibility are governed by s 45 of the Evidence Act which reads: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Judgments, etc., other than those mentioned in sections 42 to 44 when relevant</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">45.</span> Judgments, orders or decrees other than those mentioned in sections 42, 43 and 44 are irrelevant <span class="font-italic">unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree is a fact in issue or is relevant under some other provision of this Act</span>. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27  The existence of the judgment is not a fact in issue in relation to the Substantive Issue and, thus, the question is whether it is relevant under some other provision.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 Both parties accept that this provision is based on s 43 of the Indian Evidence Act and each referred me to <span class="font-italic">Sarkar’s Law of Evidence</span>, the Plaintiffs choosing to use the 16th edition (Sudipto Sarkar and V R Manohar, <span class="font-italic">Sarkar’s Law of Evidence</span> (Wadhwa &amp; Co, 16th Ed, 2007)) and the Defendants the 19th edition (Sudipto Sarkar and Dr H R Jhingta, <span class="font-italic">Sarkar’s Law of Evidence</span> (LexisNexis, 19th Ed, 2016)). I can discern no difference between them. Since the first one I read was the 16th edition, I shall cite from that at page 952:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The object behind enacting section 43 appears to be twofold: (1) to treat every case a class by itself so that the judgment delivered in one case may not be availed of by parties to another case; and (2) to maintain the independence of courts by preventing the parties from submitting before the court hearing their case the judgments of other courts. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29  The editors then turned to consider the latter portion of the section at pages 952–953: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The latter portion of this section, that is, the words “<span class="font-italic">unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree is a fact in issue, or is relevant under some other section of this Act</span>” requires some explanation. In <span class="font-italic">Gujja</span><span class="font-italic"> Lai v. Fateh Lall</span> 6 C 171 FB, Garth CJ has thus explained the section:  </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">The cases contemplated by s 43 are those where a judgment is used not as <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> or evidence more or less binding upon an opponent by reason of the adjudication which it contains. But the cases referred to in s 43 are such, I conceive, as the section itself illustrates thus, <span class="font-italic">viz</span> when the fact of any particular judgment having been given is a matter to be proved in the case.  As for instance, if <span class="font-italic">A</span> sued <span class="font-italic">B</span> for slander, in saying that he <span class="font-italic">(A)</span> had been convicted of forgery, and <span class="font-italic">B</span> justified it upon the grounds that the alleged slander was true, the conviction of A for forgery would be a fact to be proved by <span class="font-italic">B</span> like any other fact in the case, and quite irrespective of whether <span class="font-italic">A</span> had been actually guilty of the forgery or not.  Thus, I conceive would be one of the many cases alluded to in s 43.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 The commentary continues: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thus, for example, where it is proposed to discredit a witness or to contradict his testimony by proving that he gave different testimony on a former trial, the judgment in the former case will, notwithstanding that the parties to it were strangers to the subsequent suit, be admissible for the purpose of laying the foundation for the evidence of the former statements. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 In a following passage, the editors state as follows: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where a judgment is not <span class="font-italic">in rem</span>, nor relevant to matters of public nature, nor between the parties to a subsequent suit, the fact that the court by that judgment decides a point in a particular way, is not relevant under s 13 for the purpose of the decision on the same point in the subsequent suit ... It has been observed in a later Nagpur case that the reference to the Full Bench in <span class="font-italic">Shankar's</span> case was in terms wider than that was necessary for the purpose of the decision in that case and <span class="font-italic">pro tanto</span> it is <span class="font-italic">obiter</span>. A judgment is not admissible to prove the truth of the fact which it states.  But where the right of a party has already been concluded by a previous judgment, the fact can be proved by production of the judgment since in such a case the existence of the judgment itself is relevant …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 With regard to that last sentence, it is important to note that the editors are talking about the right of a party; that is, a party to the subsequent litigation who was also a party to the earlier case. It is not a reference to any other party, more specifically to a party to the earlier litigation who is not a party to the subsequent action or <span class="font-italic">vice versa</span>. The right of any of the Plaintiffs in this action has not already been concluded by a previous judgment. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Accordingly, evidence of statements made in an earlier case may be adduced in order to seek to discredit evidence given by a witness in a later case, but there is an important distinction between reliance upon statements made in a previous action and conclusions reached by the court in that previous action on the basis of those statements, as is clear from the passages from <span class="font-italic">Arul Chandran</span> cited above at [23].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 The Defendants referred me to the case of <span class="font-italic">Zainal bin </span><span class="font-italic">Kuning and others v Chan Sin Mian Michael and anor</span> [1996] 2 SLR(R) 858 (“<span class="font-italic">Zainal</span>”) at [68]–‍[70] where the Court of Appeal, when considering whether previous convictions were admissible in evidence, said this: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">68 While these convictions are admissible in evidence in the instant case – they appeared to have been accepted by both sides and were not strictly proved before the court below – the evidence adduced at the trial of Mohd Sulaiman and the findings thereon made by the courts – both the High Court and the Court of Appeal – cannot be accepted or relied upon in the instant case to prove the primary fact on which the appellants based their argument. The judgments and notes of proceedings in the case concerning Mohd Sulaiman are, of course, public documents: see s 76 of the Evidence Act … Assuming that certified copies thereof had been produced … the contents thereof are purely hearsay. In other words, what was said by Jahpar and Mohd Sulaiman and other witnesses at the trial of Mohd Sulaiman was purely hearsay as to the truth thereof.  Clearly the appellants cannot rely on what Jahpar and Mohd Sulaiman said at the trial to establish that they (the appellants) had no involvement in the offence for which they were prosecuted.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">69 [The court gave an illustration and continued] This illustration covers squarely the position in this case. <span class="font-italic">A judgment determining a fact in one trial cannot be used or relied upon in another trial</span><span class="font-underline">. </span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">70 The appellants could have subpoenaed Jahpar and Mohd Sulaiman and called them as witnesses to prove the primary fact that they (the appellants) were not involved in the housebreaking at the coffeeshop or the attack on Ang.

A finding of fact in a previous judgment cannot be relied upon to prove primary facts which have to be proved in a subsequent action. It is, I think, succinctly put in the passage emphasised above in <span class="font-italic">Zainal</span> (at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 What can be used, if relevant, is evidence given at a previous trial if its purpose is to challenge or discredit the evidence given by a witness at a subsequent trial. If a witness has made a previous inconsistent statement, this can be put to the witness to challenge the subsequent evidence and to give the witness the opportunity to satisfy the court, if they can, that the later evidence is to be preferred. This is not because it is evidence given in a previous trial, it is because it is an antecedent inconsistent statement. It could just as well have been given in a pre-existing document.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 This type of evidence is covered by s 157(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) of the Evidence Act, which reads, so far as relevant: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">Impeaching credit of witness</span></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">157.</span> The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent of the court, by the party who calls him:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">... </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(<span class="font-italic">c</span>) by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Henderson v Henderson </span><span class="font-weight-bold">Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Preliminary Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38 In order to determine the issue of <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> abuse, it is not necessary to know anything more about the parties or, indeed, the witnesses who gave evidence. Before turning to the law, I shall consider the desirability of hearing any allegation that an action should be struck out on these grounds as a preliminary issue. In the present case this was not done. At the outset the Defendants did not seek such an order on the basis that, having had one appeal to the Court of Appeal which had resulted in the matter having to be restarted in the High Court, they were unwilling to risk the same happening again and preferred to incur the costs of preparing for a trial which, if the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue was finally decided in their favour, would be unnecessary. The Plaintiffs did not oppose this and the court did not at that stage see fit to impose such a course on the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 When the matter was transferred to the Singapore International Commercial Court, my instinct was to order the trial of a preliminary issue even at a late stage. However, both parties requested that there should not be such an order, not only on the basis originally relied upon by the Defendants but also on the ground that significant discovery had by then been given and preparations for trial were well advanced. A trial date was available which was suitable for the parties and the court, and if there was to be a preliminary hearing followed by an appeal that trial date would be lost. I concluded that, in those circumstances, there should not be the trial of a preliminary issue since neither party wished it for the reasons given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 With hindsight I regret that decision and wish that I had followed my instincts. The <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue could have been prepared for hearing and heard in a relatively short period of time. The hearing would have lasted a day, two at the most. If successful, even after an appeal, the time and expense of the trial that has now taken place would have been avoided. Yes, there might well have been a delay but that it is price well worth paying to investigate the possibility that the trial should not be allowed to take place at all. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 I consider that it will rarely, if ever, be the case that an allegation that a subsequent action should be struck out on <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> grounds should not be heard as a preliminary issue, even if this does cause a measure of delay.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Be that as it may, there was no such order in this case and the issue now falls to be decided. The fact that there was no preliminary hearing is not material to outcome of that issue. It has to be determined on the basis of the facts at the date when the writ in this action was issued.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Henderson v Henderson – The Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 As is well known, the extended form of <span class="font-italic">res judicata</span> has its origins in the celebrated statement by the Vice-Chancellor, Sir James Wigram, in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> [1843] 3 Hare 999 at 114:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a court of competent jurisdiction, the court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The doctrine has evolved over the years both through decisions in Singapore and in the United Kingdom. The foundation of the current approach to the doctrine lies in the decision of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</span> [2002] 2 AC 1 (“<span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood</span>”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 In that case a company, Westway Homes Ltd, a company controlled by Mr Johnson, had previously brought an action against Gore Wood &amp; Co, a firm of solicitors, for negligent advice.

Prior to the trial, Gore Wood’s solicitors were informed that Mr. Johnson also had a claim against Gore Wood arising out of the same facts which he would pursue in due course.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 Following the settlement with the company, in 1993 Mr Johnson commenced his own action which proceeded slowly towards trial. It was not until December 1997, some 4½ years later, that the defendant sought to strike out the action as an abuse of the process of the court relying on the <span class="font-italic">Henderson</span> <span class="font-italic">v Henderson</span> doctrine. Even at this late stage, this issue was directed to be heard as a preliminary issue. The judge held in favour of the plaintiff but the Court of Appeal reversed that decision and the action was struck out. The plaintiff appealed to the House of Lords.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The leading opinion was that of Lord Bingham of Cornhill.

The circumstances in which abuse of process can arise are very varied; those which give rise to the instant appeal must surely be unique. It would, in my view, be most unwise if this House were to use this occasion to say anything that might be taken as limiting to fixed categories the kinds of circumstances in which the court has a duty (I disavow the word discretion) to exercise this salutary power."</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 After reviewing a number of earlier authorities, Lord Bingham continued (at 31A–F):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… But <span class="font-italic">Henderson v</span><span class="font-italic">. Henderson</span> abuse of process, as now understood, although separate and distinct from cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel, has much in common with them. The underlying public interest is the same: that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twice vexed in the same matter. This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. <span class="font-italic">The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all</span>. I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. <span class="font-italic">It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in early proceedings it should have been, </span><span class="font-italic">so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before</span>. As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not. Thus while I would accept that lack of funds would not ordinarily excuse a failure to raise in earlier proceedings an issue which could and should have been raised then, I would not regard it as necessarily irrelevant, particularly if it appears that the lack of funds has been caused by the party against whom it is sought to claim. While the result may often be the same, it is in my view preferable to ask whether in all the circumstances a party's conduct is an abuse than to ask whether the conduct is an abuse and then, if it is, to ask whether the abuse is excused or justified by special circumstances. Properly applied, and whatever the legitimacy of its descent, the rule has in my view a valuable part to play in protecting the interests of justice. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 Lord Bingham then went on to consider the question of the extent to which the doctrine applied to parties to the later action who had not been parties to the earlier action (at 32C–G):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Two subsidiary arguments were advanced by Mr. ter Haar in the courts below and rejected by each.

If he had wished to include his personal claim in the company's action, or to issue proceedings in tandem with those of the company, he had power to do so.

This question must be determined as at the time when Mr. Johnson brought the present proceedings and in the light of everything that had then happened</span>. There is, of course, no doubt that Mr. Johnson <span class="font-italic">could</span> have brought his action as part of or at the same time as the Company's action.

The absence or existence of these enumerated factors (which are not intended to be exhaustive) is not decisive. <span class="font-italic">In determining whether the ambient circumstances of the case give rise to an abuse of process, the court should not adopt an inflexible or unyielding attitude but should remain guided by the balance to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his case in court and recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to the defendant</span>. In the context of cases such as the present, the inquiry is directed not at the theoretical possibility that the issue raised in the later proceedings could conceivably have been taken in the earlier, but rather at whether having regard to the substance and reality of the earlier action, it reasonably ought to have been.

Indeed, as has already been noted above (at [38]), the court will exercise its discretion in such a way as to strike a balance between allowing a litigant with a genuine claim to have his day in court on the one hand and ensuring that the litigation process would not be unduly oppressive to the defendant on the other.

As the AR below noted at some length, there are multiple, often competing, policy reasons for the doctrine. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">82 Fundamentally, <span class="font-italic">the doctrine aims to bring finality to litigation and to avoid multiplicity of proceedings</span> <span class="font-italic">…</span> This serves at least two functions. <span class="font-italic">First, it promotes the public interest of efficiency and economy in the conduct of </span><span class="font-italic">litigation as a whole</span>.

As observed by Lord Millett in <span class="font-italic">Johnson</span> at 59, “[i]t is one thing to refuse to allow a party to relitigate a question which has already been decided; it is quite another to deny him the opportunity of litigating for the first time a question which has not previously been adjudicated upon.”</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[internal citations and emphasis omitted; emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The latest consideration of the scope of the doctrine and the principles to be applied is to be found in the judgment of Lord Sumption in the UK Supreme Court in <span class="font-italic">Takhar v </span><span class="font-italic">Gracefield Developments Ltd and others</span> [2019] 2 WLR 984 (“<span class="font-italic">Takhar v </span><span class="font-italic">Gracefield Developments Ltd</span>”), a case involving an application to set aside a judgment allegedly obtained by fraud, when he said this (at [61]–[63]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">61 The cause of action to set aside a judgment in earlier proceedings for fraud is independent of the cause of action asserted in the earlier proceedings. It relates to the conduct of the earlier proceedings, and not to the underlying dispute. There can therefore be no question of cause of action estoppel. Nor can there be any question of issue estoppel, because the basis of the action is that the decision of the issue in the earlier proceedings is vitiated by the fraud and cannot bind the parties: <span class="font-italic">Director of Public Prosecutions v </span><span class="font-italic">Humphrys</span> [1977] AC 1, 21 (Viscount Dilhorne). If the claimant establishes his right to have the earlier judgment set aside, it will be of no further legal relevance qua judgment. It follows that res judicata cannot therefore arise in either of its classic forms.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62 The rule, originally stated by Wigram V-C in <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> (1843) 3 Hare 100, 115, that a party is precluded from raising in subsequent proceedings matters which were not, but could and should have been raised in the earlier ones, is commonly treated as a branch of the law of res judicata. It has the same policy objective and the same preclusive effect. But, it is better analysed as part of the juridically distinct but overlapping principle which empowers the court to restrain abuses of its process. The relationship between the two concepts was examined by this court in <span class="font-italic">Virgin Atlantic Airways </span><span class="font-italic">Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd</span> [2014] AC 160, paras 22-25. Whereas res judicata is a rule of substantive law, abuse of process is a concept which informs the exercise of the court’s procedural powers. <span class="font-italic">These are part of the wider jurisdiction of the court to protect its process from wasteful and potentially oppressive duplicative litigation even in cases where the relevant question was not raised or decided on the earlier occasion</span>. Since the decisions of the House of Lords in <span class="font-italic">Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc</span> [1991] 2 AC 93 and <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co</span> [2002] 2 AC 1 it has been recognised that <span class="font-italic">where a question was not raised or decided in the earlier proceedings but could have been, the jurisdiction to restrain abusive re-litigation is subject to a degree of flexibility which reflects its procedural character. This allows the court to give effect to the wider interests of justice raised by the circumstances of each case</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63 It is this flexibility which supplies the sole juridical basis on which the respondents can argue that the evidence of fraud must not only be new but such as could not with reasonable diligence have been deployed in the earlier proceedings. It is also the basis on which Lord Briggs, in his judgment on the present appeal, suggests a less absolute rule than that proposed by Lord Kerr. I cannot accept either the respondents’ argument, or Lord Briggs’ more moderate variant of it. <span class="font-italic">The reason is that proceedings of this kind are abusive only where the point at issue and the evidence deployed in support of it not only could have been raised in the earlier proceedings but should have been</span>: see <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore-Wood &amp; Co</span>, at p 31 (Lord Bingham of Cornhill) and <span class="font-italic">Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd</span> [2014] AC 160 at para 22 (Lord Sumption). As Lord Bingham observed in the former case, it is “wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive.” <span class="font-italic">The “should” in this formulation refers to something which the law would expect a reasonable person to do in his own interest and in that of the efficient conduct of litigation</span>. However, the basis on which the law unmakes transactions, including judgments, which have been procured by fraud is that a reasonable person is entitled to assume honesty in those with whom he deals. He is not expected to conduct himself or his affairs on the footing that other persons are dishonest unless he knows that they are. That is why it is not a defence to an action in deceit to say that the victim of the deceit was foolish or negligent to allow himself to be taken in: <span class="font-italic">Central Railway Company of Venezuela v </span><span class="font-italic">Kisch </span>(1867) LR 2 HL 99, 120 (Lord Chelmsford); <span class="font-italic">Redgrave v Hurd</span> (1881) 20 Ch D 1, 13-17 (Jessell MR). It follows that unless on the earlier occasion the claimant deliberately decided not to investigate a suspected fraud or rely on a known one, it cannot be said that he “should” have raised it. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 The task facing the court therefore is, first, to consider whether the claims made in the second action could, and if so, should have been brought in the first action. If so, the court must then go on to consider whether at the time the second action was started, in the light of everything that had happened prior to that date, it would be an abuse of process to allow the second action to proceed. The burden is on the Defendants to demonstrate that the Plaintiffs are abusing the process of the court by bringing the second action. The burden is a heavy one. As Lord Bingham put it, “<span class="font-italic">[l]</span><span class="font-italic">itigants are not without scrupulous examination of all the circumstances to be denied the right to bring a genuine subject of litigation before the court</span>” (see [47] above). But equally, on the other hand, as Lord Diplock put it, the court must possess the power “<span class="font-italic">to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people</span>” (see [47] above).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The claims brought in the 672 Action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In the 672 Action claims were made by BTL, the parent company, and by BIPL, neither of which is a party to this action.

Accordingly, I grant judgment to (BTL) against Mr Goh and Wyser International jointly and severally for </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) US$166,554.02 paid under the First Wyser Agreement; </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) US$200,000 paid under the Second Wyser Agreement; and </div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) US$2,970,559 for the Diversion Loss. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">In addition, I grant judgment to [BTL] against Mr Goh for the Total Loss quantified at US$4,793,591. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">226  I also find that [BIPL’s] claim against Mr Goh for unjustified expenses and salary are made out.

It disallowed the awards in relation to the Diversion Loss and the Total Loss on the basis that any such loss had not been incurred by BTL but by BAP, which was not a party to the 672 Action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The claims brought in this action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 The primary claim in this action is brought by BAP and is founded upon an allegation that Mr Goh owed a duty of loyalty and fidelity to BAP. In the alternative, substantially the same claim is made on behalf of BAP, BTEC and BPM individually. The alleged breaches are based on the same allegations as were made in the 672 Action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 There is also a claim against Wyser brought by BAP or, alternatively, by BAP, BTEC and BPM, for dishonest assistance of Mr Goh together with a claim for conspiracy by unlawful means against Mr Goh and Wyser. Again this is based on the same allegations as were made in the 672 Action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">67 The relief sought in respect of all these claims is for the same Diversion Loss and Total Loss that was disallowed in the 672 Action. These claims therefore mirror the claims previously made by BTL in the 672 Action. It is however to be noted that the sums claimed in relation to those alleged losses were not the sums awarded by the 672 Trial Judge but the higher sums claimed by the 672 Plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">68 Additional claims have, however, been brought in this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 First, it is alleged that Mr Goh breached his duty to disclose to BAP his alleged breaches of fiduciary duties such that BAP paid Mr Goh the sum of S$200,000 as a bonus which BAP would not have paid had Mr Goh disclosed his breaches (the “Unjustified Bonus Claim”).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 Secondly, it is alleged that Mr Goh’s failure to disclose to BAP, BIL and BTS his alleged breaches of fiduciary duties caused those parties to enter into one of the Resignation Agreements referred to in [6] above and thus to pay Mr Goh’s salaries until 30 April 2013 which they would not have done had they been made aware of his breaches. These claims are equivalent to the claims made by BILP in the 672 Action (“the Unjustified Salaries Claim”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Could these claims have been brought in the 672 Action?</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 It is clear that Mr Shaw was informed before the 672 Action was commenced that the losses claimed by BTL in the 672 Action were in fact losses which would have been directly suffered by BAP.

In terms of my thinking about Goh and what he did, he was a director of 40-plus companies.  He was paid out of several companies. His misdeeds are not limited to BTEC.  These are the only ones we've brought to the court in this case or in the previous case back in 2015.  So in reading this, I probably didn't have much diligence or care in distinguishing plaintiff from non-plaintiff and actually as I read it now, I don't really distinguish much difference but -- so I'm not -- I don't think I'm legally qualified to answer these questions. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q.  Let me put it another way, sir.

</div> to the 672 Action. They assert however that since the matter was not pleaded and was alluded to only twice in cross-examination and was covered in greater detail only after the trial in closing submissions that it was reasonable for them not to have applied to amend to join BAP, BTEC and BPM as plaintiffs in the 672 Action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 In [68] and [69] of the 672 Appeal Judgment, it was held that there was no requirement that the matter should be expressly pleaded and that it was wrong to say, as the 672 Plaintiffs contended, that the 672 Defendants had dropped the matter. In so far as it is open to me to consider the matter afresh, which I doubt, respectfully, I agree. At the latest, by the time the written closing submissions were received the Plaintiffs’ advisers could have been in no doubt that the point was being taken and they elected to deal with the matter by taking the pleading point and contending that they had been taken by surprise. No application to amend was made.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">81 Order 20 rule 5(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) provides that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"><span class="font-weight-bold">5</span>.—(1)  Subject to Order 15, Rules 6, 6A, 7 and 8 and this Rule, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow the plaintiff to amend his writ, or any party to amend his pleading, on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 An application to amend can be made during or even after trial (see Singapore Civil Procedure 2020 (Vol 1) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2020) at para 20/8/6). The principles which apply to any application to amend are well known and are considered in para 20/8/8 of the same. For present purposes it is sufficient to record that in general amendments ought to be allowed to be made “for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties” (per Jenkins LJ in <span class="font-italic">G.L. Baker Ltd v Medway Buildings and Supplies Ltd</span> [1958] 1 WLR 1216 at 1231). The guiding authority which has been applied in Singapore is the UK House of Lords case <span class="font-italic">Ketteman</span><span class="font-italic"> v Hansel Properties Ltd</span> [1987] 1 AC 189 where Lord Brandon said this at 212:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">With regard to the principles on which his discretion to allow or refuse the applications to amend should be exercised, the judge referred to the notes to R.S.C., Ord. 20, r. 5, in <span class="font-italic">The Supreme Court Practice 1982</span> and to the authorities there cited. The effect of these authorities can, I think, be summarised in the following four propositions. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">First, all such amendments should be made as are necessary to enable the real questions in controversy between the parties to be decided. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Secondly, amendments should not be refused solely because they have been made necessary by the honest fault or mistake of the party applying for leave to make them: it is not the function of the court to punish parties for mistakes which they have made in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Thirdly, however blameworthy (short of bad faith) may have been a party's failure to plead the subject matter of a proposed amendment earlier, and however late the application for leave to make such amendment may have been, the application should, in general, be allowed, provided that allowing it will not prejudice the other party. Fourthly, there is no injustice to the other party if he can be compensated by appropriate orders as to costs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 Had the 672 Plaintiffs applied to amend either when the matter was first raised during cross-examination or after receipt of the 672 Defendants’ written closing submissions, I am in no doubt that applying the above principles, the 672 Trial Judge would, in the exercise of her discretion, have allowed the amendment. The amendment was necessary to allow the real question in controversy to be decided which was whether the Beyonics Group had suffered loss by reason of Mr Goh’s actions. The 672 Defendants were contending that, if there was any loss, it was BAP rather than BTL that had suffered it. BAP was thus a necessary and proper party. The application would have been made late and it may have been necessary for the experts to consider in a little more detail precisely where the losses had fallen, which might have led to the addition of BTEC and BPM as parties if the 672 Defendants took the additional point that it was those companies rather than BPM that had actually suffered some of the losses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The additional work would not have been great and the 672 Defendants could have been adequately compensated by an award of costs. Refusing the application would have led (a) to the possibility of an appeal against refusal, which necessarily would have had to be heard before judgment could be given or (b) to refusal of leave to appeal which would have been seen to raise the possibility that if either the 672 Trial Judge or the Court of Appeal held that it was BAP which had suffered any losses, an injustice, far outweighing the cost and delay of allowing the amendment would arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 It is these factors which lead me to the clear conclusion that the 672 Plaintiffs should have made an application to add BAP, BTEC and BPM as parties to the 672 Action to seek to recover the Diversion Loss and the Total Loss and that this application would have been allowed. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 I turn then to consider the Unjustified Bonus Claim and the Unjustified Salaries Claim. In this case it would have been necessary for BAP, BIL and BTS to be joined as parties, for the issues to be pleaded and the necessary evidence adduced. In the case of the Unjustified Salaries Case, since the claims mirrored that being made by BIPL, minimal extra evidence would have been required. The Unjustified Bonus Claim arose out of the same matrix of facts as underlies the Diversion Loss and the Total Loss claims. Absent special circumstances, these factors are compelling. The 672 Plaintiffs knew of the existence of the potential claims yet elected not to include them in the litigation.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The only special circumstance relied upon by the Plaintiffs is the fact that the Defendants were specifically informed that BTL reserved the Plaintiffs’ right to bring the claims at an appropriate time (see [73] above). In <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood</span> ([44] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) a similar reservation was made and was a factor in the House of Lords’ conclusion that in the circumstances of that case there was no abuse of process in allowing the second action to proceed. The primary reason however lay in the fact that the settlement provisions of the earlier action only made sense on the basis of an assumption that Mr Johnson was likely to make a personal claim and that he had compelling reasons to defer prosecution of that claim.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 There are no equivalent reasons here. In cross-examination it was suggested that Mr Shaw had reserved the right to bring further proceedings as a means of putting pressure on Mr Goh.

</div> I do not accept this. I prefer Mr Shaw’s evidence recited in [74] above which is to the effect that he and his lawyers had identified many possible claims and made an election as to which to put forward in the 672 Action for reasons which he cannot now explain. He advanced no reasons for making the election not to include these claims in that action and, without compelling reasons, it is right to conclude that these claims should have been included in the 672 Action as well.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 The Plaintiffs deal with the question of whether they should have brought the current claim in the 672 Action at some length in their written closing submissions.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 First, they contend that plaintiffs must be at liberty to decide whether to sue and, if so, who to sue and when. This however cannot be an unfettered freedom. One of the fetters on that freedom is the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> doctrine. The suggested freedom cannot be exercised if it results in an abuse of process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 Secondly, they contend that there is no principle that a related group of companies is obliged to commence a single suit against a given defendant. Again, if there is such a principle, it must be a principle conditioned by or subject to the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> doctrine.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Thirdly, they assert that BTL reasonably considered itself to be the proper party that suffered the Diversion Loss and the Total Loss and that this factor, in some way, justifies the bringing of the second action. I regret that I do not follow the logic of this. I fully accept that BTL were either advised or itself formed the belief that it was the appropriate plaintiff to claim those losses but the Court of Appeal has decided that it was mistaken in so doing. The reasonableness or otherwise of the grounds on which the belief was formed is neither here nor there; it was wrong. The question I have to decide is whether the Plaintiffs or the Defendants should suffer because of that mistaken belief. It cannot of itself constitute a basis for concluding the Plaintiffs should not have been joined as parties to the 672 Action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 Fourthly, they submit that since the Defendants did not take the affirmative position that BAP was a proper party to the 672 Action and/or admitted that BPL was the proper party to that action and/or failed to seek to strike out the 672 Action in so far as it related to the Diversion Loss or the Total Loss, this should count against the conclusion that BAP should have been joined as a party to the 672 Action. This is however merely a different way of contending that the Court of Appeal should not have decided the appeal in the way it did. I have to proceed on the basis that BPL was not the proper party and that this was an issue of law which the 672 Plaintiffs should have taken into account in formulating the 672 Action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 Finally, the Plaintiffs draw my attention to a number of matters which have occurred since the commencement of this action and which, it is suggested, should be taken into account. I do not accept this. The question of abuse of process has to be considered as at the date of the writ in this action. Subsequent events cannot influence that decision. This is amply demonstrated by the facts in <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood</span> ([44] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>) where there was a 4½ year delay in bringing the application under <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> yet it was allowed to proceed.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 None of these points therefore undermine the conclusion I have reached that the Plaintiffs in this action should have been joined as parties to the 672 Action and brought the claims made in this action in the 672 Action. To echo the words of Lord Sumption in <span class="font-italic">Tak</span><span class="font-italic">har v Gracefield Developments Ltd </span>([56] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case the law would have expected a reasonable person to done this both in his own interest and in that of the efficient conduct of litigation. Indeed, Mr Shaw reluctantly accepted this at the end of his cross-examination on this issue quoted in [74] above when he accepted that he did not have a good answer to the question why BAP, BIL and BTS were not joined as plaintiffs to make their claims in the 672 Action.

As indicated in [56] above, there is a heavy burden on the Defendants to demonstrate that the Plaintiffs are abusing the process of the court by bringing this action. The Plaintiffs will only be denied the right to bring a genuine subject of litigation before this Court if it would be manifestly unfair to the Defendants for this to be done. In the light of the 672 Judgment it is plain that the Plaintiffs have a genuine cause of action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 I therefore turn to consider the factors that the Defendants rely upon as supporting the suggestion that it would be manifestly unfair on them to be exposed to the burden of a further trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 Mr Goh gave evidence as to the way in which the 672 Action was conducted in paragraphs 452 to 500 of his AEIC in this action, which was not the subject of cross-examination. I can consider his evidence concerning the Plaintiffs’ and Mr Shaw’s conduct under three headings: conduct before the 672 Action, conduct during the 672 Action and conduct after the 672 Appeal Judgment prior to the writ in this action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conduct before the 672 Action</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 Mr Goh ceased to be a director of companies in the Beyonics Group on 9 January 2013 and under the Resignation Agreements, his employment was to end on 30 April 2013.

Mr Goh responded saying that if discussion of the matters was critical, Mr Shaw should write to him and he would consider the matters whilst on his travels.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">104 The matter did not return to court in Singapore for a continuation of the Mareva injunction until 2 April 2014 when Mr and Mrs Goh offered to have caveats lodged against five properties that they owned to obtain release of the injunction. The judge acceded to this offer and directed that the Plaintiffs be at liberty to lodge the caveats which would remain until after the decision on the trial or until further order. The Mareva injunctions were thus discharged, having been in force for some nine months.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 On 28 June 2016, the 672 Judgment was handed down ordering the Defendants to pay almost US$8 million, which they did. The Plaintiffs, however, declined to release the caveats without seeking a further order from the court on the basis that this would serve to protect the Plaintiffs in respect of any order as to costs and disbursements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 The effect of the 672 Appeal Judgment was that the Defendants only had to pay the 672 Plaintiffs some US$500,000.00 so that, in the event, the two Mareva injunctions gave the 672 Plaintiffs far greater protection than they were entitled to. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">107 Mareva injunctions are exceptional remedies granted in specific circumstances where the potential loss to plaintiffs if defendants are not restrained from disposing of assets outweighs the invasion of the defendants’ privacy and deprivation of their right to deal with their assets and live their lives as they please. It is a necessary shield for plaintiffs but one cannot get away from the fact that it will inflict damage not only financial but also, almost inevitably, emotional on defendants without their first having been held to be liable to the plaintiffs at all. This is particularly so in a case such as the present where Mrs Goh, against whom no cause of action was raised, was subject to the Mareva injunction.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">108 I emphasise that the 672 Plaintiffs did nothing wrong in seeking the Mareva injunctions. The courts held that they were entitled to them and the variation nine months later still placed a fetter on Mr and Mrs Goh’s freedom to deal with their properties as they saw fit. Where a party obtains these exceptional remedies, which inevitably will serve to place pressure on the defendants, it is incumbent on them to prosecute their claims against those defendants with the utmost diligence in accordance with the rules and with respect for the defendants’ position. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">109 In my judgment, the 672 Plaintiffs failed in that duty. First, rather than bringing all their claims in the 672 Action, they expressly elected to reserve certain claims for a later date and did not seek to join the current Plaintiffs to that action. In the circumstances, this was inappropriate as it left the 672 Defendants uncertain as to when the litigation was going to end. Once the Mareva injunctions were in place I consider that there was an added burden on the 672 Plaintiffs to ensure that all the claims which the Beyonics Group wished to make arising out of the same matrix of facts were in fact made so that there could be an end to the dispute as early as possible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">110 Secondly, following the 672 Judgment at first instance, they did not seek a continuation of the caveats, which lapsed when the Judgment was given, but declined to withdraw them on the basis that this provided them with security for costs and disbursements. Whilst a continuation of the some of the caveats might have been ordered by the 672 Trial Judge pending payment of costs, an application should have been made and it was not. Without such an application, their conduct was inappropriate and would have had the effect of placing further unwarranted pressure on Mr and Mrs Goh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">111 At the time, it appears that Mr Shaw was aware of and indeed wanted there only to be one trial and must therefore have accepted that the claims that he had purported to reserve would never be brought. In cross-examination he said this:

They had paid some US$8 million and the Court of Appeal’s award was for less than US$500,000. The 672 Defendants’ solicitors sought repayment by letter dated 4 July 2017. The 672 Plaintiffs’ solicitors replied by letter dated 10 July 2017 refusing to do so on the basis that there could be no dispute that the Defendants were liable to pay the excess sums to BAP. On the same day BAP, BIL and BTS wrote to the Defendants demanding not only that the excess sums should be paid over to BAP but also making the Unjustified Bonus and the Unjustified Salaries Claims. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">113 The inter-solicitor correspondence ran on without result which led to the 672 Defendants writing to the Court of Appeal on 14 July 2017 seeking an order for the refund of the excess. Again, the 672 Plaintiffs refused to back down and some fairly acrimonious correspondence ensued. The 672 Defendants wrote again to the Court of Appeal on 17 July 2017 following which the 672 Plaintiffs did back down and by a letter dated 20 July 2017 agreed to refund the excess by 31 July 2017. In fact, this was not done until 3 August 2017.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">114 The 672 Plaintiffs’ conduct in this regard was unacceptable. They had no right to retain the excess and they knew it. They sought to use possession of the excess to place pressure on the Defendants in this action to agree to pay the money to the Plaintiffs without a court order compelling them to do so. Once the Defendants declined to agree to the 672 Plaintiffs’ suggested course of action, those Plaintiffs were obliged either to repay the sums or, possibly, start a new action naming these Plaintiffs as parties and seeking an order of the court that the new Plaintiffs should be allowed to retain the excess pending trial of the new action. Again therefore, without taking such steps, their conduct was inappropriate and would have had the effect of placing yet further unwarranted pressure on Mr and Mrs Goh.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other factors</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">115 In different ways, both parties sought to draw the Court’s attention to the fact that allowing this trial to go ahead would amount to some form of collateral attack on the findings of fact made by the 672 Trial Judge. This however is the inevitable effect of allowing a second trial where the same or similar issues arise for consideration. As a general rule, of course, this is undesirable as it may lead to inconsistent outcomes, but in circumstances where it is appropriate to hold a second trial, as for example in <span class="font-italic">Johnson v Gore Wood</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>([44] <span class="font-italic">supra</span>), it is a potential consequence of requiring evidence to be led again. This does not amount to an impermissible attack on the findings in the previous judgment. What would be impermissible would be to seek in the second action to revisit the findings of the Court of Appeal in the 672 Action. This would be an impermissible collateral attack on the legal outcome which would constitute an abuse. But it is not what the Plaintiffs are seeking to do.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">116 However, in considering the question of unfairness, it is right that I should take into account the fact that the 672 trial was a burdensome trial, lasting some 19 days in court followed by extensive written submissions. The 672 Judgment ran to 228 paragraphs and almost 100 pages. It is not something that an individual defendant, however pecunious, should lightly be exposed to. Yet the consequence of the decisions made by 672 Plaintiffs in that action leading to the bringing of this action must necessarily expose the Defendants, effectively Mr Goh, to a further trial of equivalent magnitude if it was allowed to proceed. In my judgment, where, as here, the new claims could and should have been brought in the earlier action with little or no additional expense, the 672 Plaintiffs should not only show that that they behaved properly towards the Defendants in that action but also that there are good reasons for allowing the second action to go to trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">117 The sole reason put forward by the Plaintiffs is that striking this action out would be a travesty.

That would be the effect of what he seeks to achieve if his defence of abuse of process is allowed.  Why do we have this doctrine?  The touchstone at the end of the day is justice and we have quotes from the Court of Appeal that the court will exercise discretion in such a way as to strike a balance between allowing a litigant with a genuine claim to have his day in court on the one hand and ensuring that the litigation process would not be unduly oppressive to the defendant on the other.  It is a weighing exercise.  It is a fact-sensitive inquiry.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">118 The problem with this submission is that it presumes that the Plaintiffs will succeed in the second action. Whilst, having regard to the facts as found in the 672 Action, the Plaintiffs may well have viewed their prospects of success as being very high, they do not dispute that a full trial is needed to obtain judgment in their favour. It will almost inevitably be the case that the Plaintiffs in any subsequent action will believe that their prospects of success are good otherwise they would have been unlikely to start that action. The <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> doctrine works on the basis that a potentially valid claim will not be allowed to go to trial and this is why the unfairness to the Defendants must be manifest before the Plaintiffs are denied the right to bring a genuine claim. This is a genuine claim but it is no more than that.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 Further, the fact that the Defendants did not seek to have the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue determined as a preliminary issue and therefore accepted the inevitable burden of a subsequent trial is not a matter that, in my judgment, carries any weight. Mr Goh would naturally have preferred there to be no second trial but the way in which he conducted the second trial once it had been commenced, weighing up the burden of a further trial as against the possibility of a further appeal on the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue, followed by the second trial if the Defendants failed on the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue, was a matter for him. It is not a matter relevant on the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue as it occurred after the date of the writ in this action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Conclusion on the Henderson v Henderson Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 Drawing all these factors together, the Plaintiffs in this action could and should have brought the claims made in this action in the 672 Action. Had the claims been raised in that action they could have been adjudicated upon without materially increasing either the burden or length of that trial. It could be foreseen when the writ in this action was issued that if this action proceeded to trial it would be of equivalent magnitude to the 672 trial. The Defendants are Mr Goh and a company controlled by him. Effectively, therefore, it is an individual who is being forced to bear the burden of a second trial. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 The 672 Plaintiffs cannot be criticised for seeking relief in that action in the form of Mareva injunctions but where such injunctions are sought, particularly when sought against individuals, more especially against individuals against whom no other relief is sought, the Plaintiffs must act with due diligence in accordance with the rules and with respect for the position in which they have placed the Defendants by obtaining Mareva relief.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 The 672 Plaintiffs did not do this. On more than one occasion they used the position the litigation had placed them in to further the Beyonics Group’s interests but disregarded their obligations to the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 Taking all these factors into account I am satisfied that the Defendants have discharged the heavy burden upon them to demonstrate an abuse of process. In my judgment it would be manifestly unfair to the Defendants, particularly to Mr Goh, for a second trial to take place based on the same matrix of facts as arose in the first trial. The unfairness is such that it outweighs the right of the Plaintiffs to have what is plainly a genuine cause of action tried. This action should therefore be struck out.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 At one stage of the argument I did consider whether it was possible under the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> doctrine for relief short of striking the action out to be granted. I had in mind the possibility, for example, of making an award of costs in the second action that ensured that the Defendants were not out of pocket by reason of the failure of the Plaintiffs to bring their claims in the 672 Action. On further consideration and having received submissions on the point, I am satisfied (a) that such a course is not open to me and (b) that on the facts of this case it would not be an appropriate course to take even if it was open to me for the reasons I have given.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">125 As to (a), it is only in exceptional circumstances that the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> doctrine applies. The unfairness must be manifest. There must be an abuse. This is not a doctrine which gives the court an unfettered discretion to deal as it sees fit with unfairness which falls short of being manifest. It is a matter of judgment not discretion; either the abuse is manifest or it is not. If it is, the only appropriate relief is striking out. If it is not, the application fails and the trial goes ahead in the usual way. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Substantive Issue</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">126 Strictly speaking the decision on the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue makes it unnecessary for me to give judgment on the Substantive Issue. However the parties wished the trial on the Substantive Issue to go ahead, the evidence was heard and submissions were made. I shall therefore give judgment on the basis that I am wrong on the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The HDD Industry</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">127 This action concerns the manufacture of baseplates which, subsequently, are further processed by the addition of motors and drives to make an end product, a HDD (hard disc drive), which is then incorporated into both desktop and laptop computers.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">128 At all material times, the Beyonics Group had two manufacturing divisions, the PES (Precision Engineering Services) Division and the EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Services) Division (see [3] above). The PES Division manufactured and sold baseplates destined for end customers, such as Seagate, Hitachi and Western Digital. These baseplates are manufactured for an end customer under what is described as a “baseplate programme”, with each programme having its own design specifications and schematics, and a manufacturer of baseplates must be qualified by an end customer to undertake a specific baseplate programme.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 The baseplate manufacturing process has two main stages called the “1st Stage” and the “2nd Stage” (see [141] below). Thereafter, completed baseplates are sent to a company which assembles the other components of the HDD in a process called the motor baseplate assembly (“MBA”). This company will then ship the completed baseplate to the end customer. The MBA company which features prominently in this action is the Nidec Corporation (“Nidec”) (see [134(c)] below).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 BAP, BTEC, and BPM together with BTT (see [4] above) were part of the PES Division. BTEC owned and operated a baseplate manufacturing facility in Changshu, China, BPM owned and operated a baseplate facility in Tampoi, Malaysia and BTT owned and operated a Baseplate Facility in Ayutthaya, Thailand. BAP did not own or operate any Baseplate Facility. BAP was in essence a sales company for the baseplate manufacturing companies. Seagate and the other end customers ordered baseplates through the MBA companies which then would place purchase orders to a baseplate manufacturer selected by them, such as BTEC, BPM and BTT. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 Prior to October 2011, the manufacture of baseplates within the Beyonics Group was divided between BTT, BPM and BTEC. In some cases, 1st Stage work was performed in one facility and 2nd Stage in another. In October 2011 there were extensive floods in Thailand which affected not only BTT’s premises but the premises of other baseplate manufacturers. BTT’s factory was a total write off and resulted in a significant insurance claim. The floods had a major effect on the HDD industry and it was the steps that the various players in that industry took to seek to alleviate the problems that arose that underlie this dispute.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132 At all material times, Mr Goh was both a director and the CEO of the parent company, BTL. He was also either a director or employee of all the Plaintiffs (see [153] below). The management structure of the Beyonics Group consisted of Mr Goh as the CEO of the Group and, reporting to him, there were General Managers at each manufacturing plant. Mr Lee Leong Hua, who gave evidence, was at all material times Senior General Manager of BTEC’s facility at Changshu.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133   The 2nd Defendant, currently named Pacific Globe Enterprises Limited, was at the material times named Wyser International Limited and is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. It is (and was) owned and controlled by Mr Goh. I shall refer to it as “Wyser”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The other companies that feature prominently are:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) “Seagate”: Seagate Technology International, a company with its headquarters in California, was a customer of both divisions of the Beyonics Group. The PES Division manufactured and supplied baseplates for Seagate HDDs, including baseplates under what was known as the Brinks 2H programme (also known as the Pharaoh programme). The EMS Division manufactured and supplied printed circuit board assemblies. Seagate held about 40% of the HDD market over the relevant period. Mr Chua Wui Chung (“Mr Billy Chua”), Senior Manager for the Commodity Management Team (“CMT”) at Seagate, was subpoenaed to give evidence at the trial by the Plaintiffs.  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) “Nedec/Kodec”: Nedec Co Ltd and Kodec Co Ltd are incorporated in South Korea and manufacture HDD and automotive components. Nedec and Kodec together with a Chinese company, Langfang Nedec Machinery &amp; Electronics Co. Ltd (“LND”), are members of the NEDEC/KODEC Group of companies. LND has a baseplate manufacturing facility in Langfang, China. Save where necessary, I shall refer to any or all these entities simply as Nedec/Kodec. The Nedec/Kodec group is a private group of companies. The owner and Chairman was Mr Neung Woong Hwang. His son, Mr Sejoon Hwang, also known as Stephen Hwang (“Mr Hwang”), was the CEO and the chief financial officer (“CFO”) was Mr Tae Sung Lee (“Mr Tony Lee”). Mr Tony Lee gave evidence on behalf of the Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) “Nidec”: Not to be confused with Nedec/Kodec, Nidec Corporation is a Japanese manufacturer of electric motors. Their products are found in HDDs, electric appliances, automobiles and commercial and manufacturing equipment. Nidec (Zhejiang) Corporation (“NCC”) and Nidec Electronics (Thailand) Co Ltd (“NET”) were subsidiaries of Nidec Corporation and were at all material times MBA entities. In the case of the PES Division, NCC issued purchase orders to BAP for baseplates manufactured by BTEC, and NET issued purchase orders to BTT for baseplates manufactured by BPM and BTT. Again, save where necessary I shall refer to all these entities, together or individually, as Nidec. No witness from Nidec gave evidence at the trial.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 In addition to Seagate, in 2010 the other principle HDD manufacturers were Western Digital, Toshiba, Samsung and Hitachi. There were two sizes of HDD, 2.5” and 3.5”. In 2011 there was a measure of consolidation in the industry. Seagate acquired Samsung’s HDD business, Western Digital acquired Hitachi’s 2.5” business and Toshiba the 3.5” business. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 Other entities that were involved in the manufacture of baseplates in addition to companies in the Beyonics Group and Nedec/Kodec were MMI China (a subsidiary of MMI International Holdings Pte Ltd, a Singapore company) and Nidec Brilliant, a subsidiary of Nidec. Prior to the sale of Samsung’s HDD business to Seagate, Nedec/Kodec were qualified to manufacture baseplates for Samsung but not for Seagate. Prior to 2011 the Beyonics Group were qualified to manufacture baseplates for Seagate and Hitachi and, in 2011 began to manufacture also for Western Digital.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 When the likes of Seagate, Western Digital and Toshiba launch a new product, a specific baseplate will be required. Whilst the various baseplates are fundamentally similar, the specification for each will vary.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 In order to become a manufacturer of baseplates for, <span class="font-italic">eg</span>, Seagate HDDs, the manufacturing plants have to undergo a qualification process. Two levels of qualification are required for baseplates of any given product. First, the plant must be a qualified supplier for Seagate and, secondly, it must be specifically approved for the manufacture of baseplates for the product in question. So far as concerns Beyonics, BTEC became a Seagate qualified plant in 2005 whereas both BPM and BTT had qualified earlier (1991 and 2004 respectively). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 Secondly, once qualified in this general sense, in order to qualify to manufacture a particular product a rigorous programme has to be followed, which takes some 4 to 6 months on average. In outline, as between, say, BTEC and Seagate, the process requires Seagate to issue drawings for the new product, followed by discussions between the relevant teams at Seagate and BTEC. Following internal discussions at BTEC coupled with the preparation of the necessary moulds, cast toolings, machining fixtures and inspection fixtures, pre-production samples, known as First Articles, would be produced. These would be inspected by Seagate and (hopefully) approved. Seagate would then send its engineering representatives to the plant to do a line qualification. Samples will be sent to the relevant MBA entity to test motor assembly and, if the MBA entity approved them, the samples will be sent to Seagate for a full assembly test run after which the plant would be allowed to proceed with full production.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 Hence the fact that a company is qualified to manufacture baseplates for one customer does not entitle it to manufacture for another. Equally, qualification for one product does not enable to manufacturer to circumvent the rigorous qualification process for another product.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The manufacture of baseplates involves various manufacturing processes, which can be broadly divided into two main stages. The 1st Stage involves, among other things, die casting and ends with e-coating, and this stage is often referred to as “e-coating”. The 2nd Stage involves, among other things, precision machining and other work to produce a finished baseplate, and this process is often called “machining”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 In the 1st Stage, die casting molten metal is poured into a mould and allowed to solidify; the die casted parts are then sent for trimming, deburring and polishing after which they will be put through a process of stress relief to refine their grain structure. There is then a pre-treatment process to clean the baseplates using chemicals.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 For some baseplates, it is necessary for pre-machining to be done. There are two machines that can be used to do this, Special Purpose Machines (“SPM”) or Computer Numerical Control Machines (“CNC”). I shall have to consider the function and costs of these two types of machine below. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The baseplates will then be e-coated to coat the surface of the baseplates and they will be inspected prior to undergoing the 2nd Stage which may be carried out at the same facility as the 1st Stage or they may be transported to a different facility for the 2nd Stage.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 In the 2nd Stage, CNCs and/or SPMs are used to drill holes and cut the baseplate. CNC Machines are more precise machines, but are more expensive than SPMs. Hence CNC Machines are generally used to drill critical holes and cut the baseplate whereas SPMs are used to do drilling and tapping of non-critical holes. Both machines can be used for all this work but because the SPM machine is less precise, the propensity for rejected products is greater.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 Following sample inspection and the removal of machining burrs certain products will undergo pin assembly. The baseplates then go through a high pressure water jet and ultrasonic washing to clean the holes to remove particles that are not visible to the naked eye. The baseplates will thereafter be put through an air leak test and a final inspection before being shipped to the relevant MBA.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Issues</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 With that background, I can turn to consider the issues that arise for determination. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">148 The main claims against Mr Goh and Wyser are for breaches of duties, dishonest assistance, and conspiracy. They are brought by BAP as the primary plaintiff. In the alternative, a similar claim is made by BAP, BTEC, and BPM. It is alleged that in his capacity as a director and/or an employee of those companies, Mr Goh allegedly:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) used Wyser secretly to enter into the Wyser Agreements and received undisclosed payments from Nedec/Kodec pursuant thereto;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) secured a collaboration between BAP and Nedec/Kodec (“the BN Alliance”) to divert 2nd Stage work in the manufacture of baseplates for Seagate HDDs from the Beyonics Group to Nedec/Kodec, and procured a US$2.5 Million Grant from Seagate to Nedec/Kodec to assist this; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) facilitated Nedec/Kodec’s business with Seagate for the supply/manufacture of baseplates for Seagate HDDs in competition with BAP, BTEC, and/or BPM, with the intention that Nedec/Kodec should supplant the Beyonics Group as a supplier and/or manufacturer of baseplates for Seagate HDDs in whole or in part.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">149 The claim against Wyser is for dishonest assistance of Mr Goh’s alleged breaches of duty and against both Defendants for unlawful means conspiracy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">150 The primary loss allegedly suffered is the Diversion Loss and the Total Loss referred to in [61] above. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">151 In addition a claim is made by BAP for the return of a bonus S$200,000 awarded to Mr Goh in January 2012 which, it is claimed, would not have been paid if Mr Goh’s alleged breaches had been known to the then directors at that time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">152 Further, claims are made by BAP, BIL and BTS for the return of the sums paid to Mr Goh under the various Resignation Agreements (see [6] and [70] above) which again, it is alleged, would not have been paid if Mr Goh’s alleged breaches had been known at that time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">153 Mr Goh does not dispute that he was a director and/or employee of the various Plaintiffs or that he owed them the well-known obligations of loyalty and fidelity and the fiduciary duties imposed upon directors. It is also not in dispute that Wyser is owned and controlled by Mr Goh. Mr Goh’s primary defence is that at all times he acted in the best interests of the Beyonics Group in general and of each of the Plaintiffs in particular and that a thorough examination of the facts as presented to this court will demonstrate that. Accordingly, he contends that there was no breach of any of the duties owed to the Plaintiffs and that the bonus and the payments made to him under the Resignation Agreements were properly paid.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">154 He further contends that the payments made to Wyser under the Wyser Agreements were in respect of consultancy work done by him in order to assist the relationship between Beyonics and Nedec/Kodec, a relationship that was in the best interests of Beyonics that he should strive to enhance. Since Beyonics was not in the business of providing consultancy work, it was appropriate that the payments should have been made to his order and not to Beyonics. In any event, following the 672 Action, all sums paid under the Wyser Agreements have been repaid and thus, he asserts, the question of whether it was appropriate for the payments to have been paid to Wyser rather than Beyonics does not arise in this action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">155 The only other minor defence pleaded relates to the BTEC’s claim in relation to the Diversion Loss and the Total Loss. If, contrary to the Plaintiffs’ primary case that BAP is entitled to make to claim for the whole of those losses, the claim must be made by each of BAP, BTEC and BPM for their individual losses, the Defendants contend that Mr Goh’s obligations towards BTEC are governed by Chinese law and that, under that law, the claim is time-barred (“the Limitation Defence”).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The Law</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">156 The Plaintiffs’ primary case is that Mr Goh breached the fiduciary duties he owed to BAP, BTEC and BPM and/or his duties of fidelity and loyalty to BPM and that Wyser dishonestly assisted in those breaches.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">157 Alternatively it is said that there was a conspiracy to injure those companies by unlawful means, the conspirators being Mr Goh, Wyser and representatives from Nedec/Kodec. The unlawful means were the breaches and dishonest assistance pleaded in this action and those upheld by the Court of Appeal in the 672 Action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">158 Much of what follows is an abbreviated extraction (with gratitude) from the Plaintiffs’ written closings.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Breach of Duties</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) Duty of an Employee</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">159  Every employment contract contains an implied term that an employee will serve his employer with good faith and fidelity (<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</span> (LexisNexis, 2017) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span>”) Vol 9 at paras 100.171 and 100.175).

A fiduciary must not place himself in a position or enter into a transaction in which his personal interest may conflict with his duty to his principal, unless his principal, with full knowledge of all the material circumstances and of the nature and extent of the fiduciary’s interest, consents (<span class="font-italic">p</span><span class="font-italic">er</span> Lord Herschell in <span class="font-italic">Bray v Ford</span> [1896] AC 44 at 51, cited in <span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee and others v Mamata Kapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 (“<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee</span>”) at [137]). The test for determining whether a conflict of interests exists is an objective one. The law requires that there is a “reasonable perception of a conflict of interest arising” (<span class="font-italic">Ng </span><span class="font-italic">Eng Ghee </span>at [138]) but the law is strict: where a director is found to have placed himself in a position of conflict of interest, he will not be permitted to assert that his action was <span class="font-italic">bona fide</span> or thought to be in the interests of the company (<span class="font-italic">Walter </span><span class="font-italic">Woon </span>at para 8.44).

This applies to silence as acceptance of the terms of a contract (see <span class="font-italic">R1 International</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd v Longstroff AG</span> [2015] 1 SLR 521 at [53]–[54], waiver of rights (see <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction P</span><span class="font-italic">te Ltd v Kian Hiap Construction Pte Ltd</span> [2018] 1 SLR 317 (“<span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span>”) at [58]–[61] and squarely in cases of misrepresentation by silence (see <span class="font-italic">Wee </span><span class="font-italic">Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve</span> [2013] 3 SLR 801 at [65]). Silence, being passive conduct, and inherently lacking the definitive quality of an active statement, is rarely considered sufficient to amount to a representation. <span class="font-italic">But the courts have also made it clear that silence can in appropriate circumstances acquire a positive content and amount to a representation</span>. Such cases have been characterised as situations where there is a duty on the alleged representor to speak or disclose certain facts, and in cases of misrepresentation, that failure to do so renders a statement previously made by the representor false or (more rarely) itself constitutes a false statement. <span class="font-italic">Such a duty may arise out of the relationship of the parties</span> and/or other circumstances in which the silence is maintained, and <span class="font-italic">is to be assessed by reference to </span><span class="font-italic">how a reasonable person would view the silence in the circumstances</span>: <span class="font-italic">Audi Construction</span> at [61].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">181 In <span class="font-italic">Loh</span><span class="font-italic"> Sze Ti Terence Peter v Gay Choon Ing</span> [2008] SGHC 31 , Belinda Ang Saw Ean J stated at [77]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Under this head of claim, Loh must establish the making of the misrepresentation by Gay, the inducement thereby of Loh and reliance thereon by Loh to his detriment.

More specifically, would the reasonable person regard the silence as being a representation that the fiduciary had no wrongdoings to disclose to his employer?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 In addition, the person to whom the representation was made must show that he relied upon the representation as an inducement to enter the contract. The false representation need not be the sole inducement, as long as it “<span class="font-italic">played a real and substantial part and operated in their minds</span><span class="font-italic">, no matter how strong or how many were the other matters which played their part in inducing them to act</span>” (<span class="font-italic">Panatron</span><span class="font-italic"> Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another</span> [2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [23]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Failure of Consideration</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">184 The Court of Appeal considered this aspect in its Judgment in the 672 Action (see the 672 Appeal Judgment at [85]–[92]). Judith Prakash JA, giving the judgment of the Court, distinguished the entitlement of an employee to retain salary owning to him on termination of a contract from his right to retain a bonus paid in circumstances where there was a breach of a fiduciary relationship in [86]–[88]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">86 … The Judge found that the post-resignation salary payment was unjustified and should be repaid to [BIPL]. Her reason, based on <span class="font-italic">John While</span><span class="font-italic"> Springs</span>, was that no reasonable employer would continue to pay a fiduciary salary when faced with knowledge of the fiduciary’s breach of duties and lack of good faith.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">87  With respect, we do not agree that <span class="font-italic">John While Springs</span> supported the Judge’s finding on this issue. In <span class="font-italic">John While Springs</span>, Choo Han Teck J allowed the plaintiffs to reclaim bonus payments paid to their ex-employee who had breached his fiduciary duty on the basis that “[n]o reasonable employer would have offered a bonus to a cheating employee, or one who was in breach of his fiduciary duty as was the case here”. However, the present case can be distinguished on the facts. Unlike a bonus that is “generally a payment fashioned as a reward as well as an incentive” (<span class="font-italic">John While Springs</span> at [7]), salaries paid after resignation are generally contractually due to the employee. In such situations, payments of salary after resignation are not gestures of goodwill, but would be the employee’s contractual entitlement. In <span class="font-italic">Schonk</span><span class="font-italic"> Antonius Martinus Mattheus v Enholco Pte Ltd</span> [2016] 2 SLR 881 (“<span class="font-italic">Schonk</span>”), <span class="font-italic">this court held that an employer may not use an employee’s breach of fiduciary duties to justify withholding payment of salary that that employee is entitled to. Instead, the employer would only be entitled to make a deduction from the employee’s salary in respect of such losses as the employer can prove that it has suffered by reason of the employee’s breach </span>(Schonk at [15]). The employee in breach in <span class="font-italic">Schonk</span> was held to have been entitled as a matter of law to his salary for so long as he was working and, in the particular circumstances of that case, regarded himself as an employee. In the present case, if Mr Goh had a legal entitlement to the salary he was paid for the period after he served notice of resignation, his breaches of fiduciary duties would not take that entitlement away from him. Accordingly, those breaches cannot, in themselves, support a claim for reimbursement of the amount paid.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">185 However the Judgment went on to consider the question of consideration in circumstances where the employee has not insisted on his contractual right to payment but has entered a subsequent contract on different terms and Prakash JA reasoned as follows at [88]–[89]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">88  There is, however, another way in which the Judge’s order that Mr Goh repay the salary he received can be justified. To abridge a contractual period of notice, mutual agreement between the parties to a contract of employment is required: see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore </span>(LexisNexis Singapore, 2017 Reissue) (“<span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s</span>”) vol 9 at para 100.190. Although Mr Goh’s notice of resignation was signed only by him, it purports to evince such a mutual agreement to abridge the six months’ contractual period of notice to about three and a half months (from 10 January to 30 April 2013). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The issue that arises is whether this was a valid agreement supported by consideration</span>. Mr Goh argues that he provided consideration in the form of his accepting a lower amount in lieu of full notice (which would have been six months’ worth of salary) and by giving up any claim against the company. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89  It is trite that a detriment incurred by the promisee (at the request of the promisor) may constitute consideration. This rule does not apply here, however. First, Mr Goh was not as a matter of law entitled to salary in lieu of notice either contractually by express provision or under common law; and second, the abridgment of the contractual notice period was requested by <span class="font-italic">Mr Goh himself </span>and not by [BIPL].</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">90 An employer is entitled to terminate a contract of employment by payment of salary in lieu of notice, even where the contract is silent on this and also arguably where it is expressly provided that it is terminable by notice. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">However, it seems that the employee is, under common law, </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not entitled to terminate the contract of employment by payment of salary in lieu of notice</span> (see <span class="font-italic">Halsbury’s </span>vol 9 at para 100.195, citing <span class="font-italic">Heron, Gethin-</span><span class="font-italic">Jones &amp; Liow v John Chong </span>[1963] MLJ 310 at 313, <span class="font-italic">per </span>Wee Chong Jin CJ, where this court held that implying a term to enable an employee to terminate his employment by paying salary in lieu of giving and serving the required notice was not necessary to give the employment contract business efficacy). <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Here, Mr Goh was the one who sought an abridgment of his</span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> contractual notice period. The company simply agreed to his request. Thus there was no issue of any consideration being provided by Mr Goh.</span> If the company had wanted him to leave early and forgo the salary which he could otherwise have earned during the six-month notice period, then Mr Goh’s acceptance of three-and-a-half months of salary would have been good consideration for the abridgment agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91  Mr Goh’s submission that he gave good consideration by giving up any and all claims that he may have had against [BIPL] is also flawed. Although such forbearance can constitute sufficient consideration (<span class="font-italic">Ang Sin</span><span class="font-italic"> Hock v Khoo Eng Lim </span>[2010] 3 SLR 179 at [71]), on the facts it cannot be surmised that there was a request from [BIPL] that Mr Goh forbear from suing it. In <span class="font-italic">Sea-Land Service Inc v Cheong </span><span class="font-italic">Fook Chee Vincent </span>[1994] 3 SLR(R) 250, this court found on the facts that there was no implied request from the appellants for the respondent to forbear to sue them and thus held (at [22]) that there was no consideration in the form of a forbearance to sue. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">186 Accordingly, in circumstances where it is the employee who requests an abridgment of his contractual notice period and it is the employer who accedes to that request, the employee is, in law, providing no consideration for the resultant agreement.

These duties include the duties of “no conflict” and “no profit” as well as the duty to act in good faith which are precisely the duties alleged to have been broken in this case (see <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span><span class="font-italic"> </span>at [253]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">190 The judgment of the Court was delivered by Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA who considered three possible approaches that had been applied in previous cases (at [89]–[92]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">89 The first (which we refer to hereafter as “<span class="font-weight-bold">Approach 1</span>”) … is that causation is <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">not</span> relevant once a <span class="font-italic">breach</span> of fiduciary duty has been established. In particular, a defendant would not be permitted to argue that it is not responsible for the damage which the plaintiff has suffered as that damage would have occurred in any event and that the defendant had therefore not caused the damage in question. The underlying rationale for such a strict (indeed, prophylactic) approach centres on the need to deter breaches of fiduciary duty.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">91 The <span class="font-italic">second</span> (which we refer to hereafter as “<span class="font-weight-bold">Approach 2</span>”) – which is in <span class="font-italic">complete contrast</span> to the first…. – is that the plaintiff must <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">always</span> establish “but for” causation.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">92 The <span class="font-italic">third</span> (which we refer to hereafter as “<span class="font-weight-bold">Approach 3</span>”) is a kind of <span class="font-italic">hybrid</span> approach which, whilst not eschewing the requirement of causation (which is wholly endorsed under Approach 2), nevertheless attempts to give effect to the underlying rationale under Approach 1 by <span class="font-italic">reversing the burden of proof</span> inasmuch as the <span class="font-italic">defendant</span> will have to prove that the damage suffered by the plaintiff would have occurred in any event.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">191 Following a detailed review of authorities and learned articles in a number of common law jurisdictions, reasons were given in [240]–[243] for preferring Approach 3:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">240  In our view, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Approach 3</span> … should be adopted in Singapore. This approach does not eschew the need for a causation test, and at the same time, such an approach gives legal effect to the stringent duties placed on fiduciaries and the corresponding need to deter fiduciaries from breaching their duties. Under this approach to causation, the principal bears the legal burden of establishing its claim<span class="font-italic">, </span>but the<span class="font-italic"> </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">legal burden of proof</span><span class="font-italic"> of showing that the loss would have been sustained by the principal even if the fiduciary had not breached his or her fiduciary duty falls on the </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">fiduciary</span>. Consistent with s 103(2) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), given that under Approach 3 the fiduciary is bound to prove the existence of facts showing that the losses would have been sustained even without his or her breach, the legal burden of proof lies on him or her. In other words, the burden lies on the fiduciary to rebut the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">rebuttable presumption</span> that the loss would not have been sustained by the principal had the fiduciary not breached his or her fiduciary duty. This rebuttable presumption arises once the principal is able to prove on a balance of probabilities that the fiduciary has breached his or her fiduciary duty, and that loss has been sustained.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">241  …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">242  However, we <span class="font-italic">depart from</span> the Singapore High Court cases with regard to their holding that the burden that shifts to the fiduciary to show that the principal would have suffered the loss even if there had been no breach is only an <span class="font-italic">evidential</span> one. Consonant with the need for strong deterrence against fiduciaries breaching their fiduciary duties, it is necessary to place the legal burden on the fiduciary fully and squarely. ….. Once the principal is able to show breach and loss, there arises a rebuttable presumption that the breach is a “but for” cause of the loss. The burden is then on the fiduciary to rebut this presumption.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">243  In a case where there is patently no linkage between the fiduciary’s breach and the losses sustained, it may, understandably, be of concern to some that the legal burden to rebut the presumed causation is placed on the <span class="font-italic">fiduciary</span>. Such concern, if it so arises, is laid to rest by the fact that the discharge of the legal burden would not be an onerous one where there is clearly no causative link. As we have explained in <span class="font-italic">Loo </span><span class="font-italic">Chay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo, deceased</span> [2010] 1 SLR 286 at [14], although the legal burden lies on one party – in this case, the fiduciary – the evidential burden may shift as between the parties, depending on the precise evidence adduced before the court. After the fiduciary shows evidence pointing to the lack of linkage between the breach and the loss, the evidential burden may shift to the principal to adduce evidence to show otherwise. The precise manner in which the evidence is adduced will of course depend on the precise facts and circumstances of each case. Courts should not belabour themselves unnecessarily with exceptional cases and throw the baby out together with the bathwater in attempting to craft legal propositions for these extreme outlying situations. In any case, even where there is patently no causative link, we are of the view that the <span class="font-italic">practical application</span> of the rebuttable presumption does not pose a problem.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">192 A summary of the applicable approach is contained in [254]:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">254 To summarise briefly, the approach to causation is as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) In a claim for a <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">non</span>-<span class="font-italic">custodial</span> breach of the duty of <span class="font-italic">no-conflict </span>or <span class="font-italic">no-profit</span> or the duty to act in <span class="font-italic">good faith</span>, the plaintiff-principal must establish that the fiduciary breached the duty and establish the loss sustained.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-1 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) If the plaintiff-principal is able to meet the requirements of (a), a <span class="font-italic">rebuttable </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">presumption</span> that the fiduciary’s breach caused the loss arises.

Many of them had already given evidence in relation to precisely the same events at the 672 trial. At the outset therefore it is appropriate to bear well in mind that the contemporaneous documents may provide a more reliable record of the events than will the recollection of a witness some years after those events occurred.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">195  As the Court of Appeal observed in <span class="font-italic">OCBC Capital Investment Asia Ltd v Wong Hua Choon</span> [2012] 4 SLR 1206 at [41], a case concerned with a dispute over the existence and terms of an alleged contract:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… It bears mention that the first port of call for any court in determining the existence of an alleged contract and/or its terms would be the relevant <span class="font-italic">documentary</span> evidence. Where (as in the present case) the issue is whether or not a binding contract <span class="font-italic">exists</span> between the parties, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">a contemporaneous written record of the evidence is obviously more reliable than a witness’s oral testimony given well after the fact, recollecting what has transpired. Such evidence may be coloured by the onset of subsequent events and the very </span><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">factual dispute between the parties.</span> In this regard, <span class="font-italic">subjective</span> statements of witnesses <span class="font-italic">alone</span> are, in the nature of things, often unhelpful. Further, where the witnesses themselves are not legally trained, counsel ought not – as the Respondent’s counsel sought to do in oral submissions before this court – to forensically parse the words they use as if they were words in a statute. <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">This is not to state that oral testimony should, ipso facto, be discounted. On the contrary, credible oral testimony can be helpful to the court, especially where (as we shall see below in relation to supporting the Appellant’s case) such testimony is given for the purpose of clarifying the existing documentary evidence.</span> There is, however, no magic formula in determining the appropriate weight that should be given to witness testimony. Much would depend on the precise factual matrix before the court. However, it bears reiterating that the court would always look first to the most reliable and objective evidence as to whether or not a binding contract was entered into between the parties and such evidence would tend to be <span class="font-italic">documentary</span> in nature. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">196 Similarly, in <span class="font-italic">Sandz</span><span class="font-italic"> Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd and others v Strategic Worldwide Assets Ltd and others</span> [2014] 3 SLR 562 (“<span class="font-italic">Sandz</span><span class="font-italic"> Solutions</span>”) at [77], the Court of Appeal held that in circumstances where the events in question took place many years ago, it would be preferable to place more reliance on the objective documentary evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">We have some concerns about labelling Mr Liaw, and for that matter, Mr Tan (see [76] of the Judgment), as evasive and/or vacillating witnesses. The Judge was correct to find certain aspects of their evidence unsatisfactory, but we think it pertinent to note that the events in question took place nearly five years prior to the trial. A trial should not be a test or contest of memories. As we observed above at [50], even the recollections of the most truthful of witnesses would be tested by the lapse of time. <span class="font-italic">In the premises, we think it preferable in these proceedings to place more reliance on the objective documentary evidence before us as well as the actual conduct of the parties, as opposed to their hazy recollections of past events on the witness stand</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">197 The same considerations apply to cases such as the present where the witnesses are trying to recall what transpired in phone conversations or at meetings of which partial written records in the form of contemporaneous documents exist, either in the form of Board minutes, presentation documents or e-mails. There is however a difference between a witness’s recollection of a particular event and their recollection of working practices and working relationships that existed at the time. Whilst a proper degree of caution has to be taken in assessing the weight that should be given to evidence given many years later as to who said what to whom at a particular meeting or in a given conversation, the same may not apply in an appropriate case where a witness is giving evidence as to the way in which a particular business operated over the years or as to the dynamics of a particular relationship. These are matters on which recollections long after the event may carry more weight.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">198 Equally care has to be taken when reading documents, particularly e-mails, after the event in the context of litigation. E-mails are not documents written on oath and, in the present case, most were written in English which was not the native tongue of the writer. Undue focus on the precise language used is not helpful. What may be helpful is evidence from the writer or recipient as to the relationship between them which may account for the way in which something was written or, indeed, explain why certain things which might have been said were not said or were not directly stated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">199 The parties requested a period of time in which to prepare written closings and indicated that they were prepared to forgo the right to ask for oral submissions thereafter. I agreed to this but reserved the right to ask for oral submissions on any issue that I felt required this after I had read the written closings. After a requested extension of time, these were provided on 20 March 2020. They were voluminous, running to 379 pages for the Plaintiffs and 298 pages for the Defendants. Whilst these do reflect to a certain extent the amount of documents and evidence, it is a matter of concern that the volume (and hence the expense) may be disproportionate to the sums at stake in the litigation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">200 It is regrettable but perhaps inevitable that matters have become polarised with the passage of time and that both the parties and their advocates have somewhat lost a sense of objectivity. The written closings have thus been written from opposite ends of the spectrum making the judicial task of determining the truth, or as near to the truth on the balance of probabilities as is realistically possible after the passage of time, a more difficult task.  An extreme example of this is the parties’ submissions on the credibility of Mr Goh as a witness. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">201 In paragraph 189 of their written closing the Plaintiffs said this:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Before we deal with the substantive points on liability, <span class="font-italic">we note at the outset that Mr Goh was not a credible witness</span>. He would even deny matters clearly recorded in documents he sent or be evasive about them – this is the second time he is being taken to task on inconsistencies between his testimony and the documents, and <span class="font-italic">yet he still chooses to be less than candid in the witness box</span>.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">202 In contrast, in paragraph 196 of their written closing the Defendants submitted the direct opposite:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Mr Goh was the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and a director of [BTL] from 1 May 2000 to 30 April 2013. He is one of the Defendants and has personal knowledge of many of the matters that arise for determination in the Suit. Although Mr Goh is Chinese educated and his primary language is Mandarin, he gave his evidence in English without the aid of an interpreter and <span class="font-italic">the authenticity of his evidence shorn </span><span class="font-italic">[sic] through his candour and immediate responses to questions</span>. Mr Goh’s evidence was corroborated by the testimonies of the other witnesses.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">203 That said, I am grateful to counsel for the clarity with which they have structured their submissions and the logical way in which they have approached the facts. I shall deal with the specific observations that they make on the weight to be attached to individual aspects of each witnesses’ evidence as they arise.  I shall first however consider the general demeanour of the witnesses of fact in the order in which they gave evidence. For convenience I may repeat some of the observations made above in relation to the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> Issue.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Kyle Arnold Shaw Junior</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">204 Mr Shaw is a powerful personality who was intimately involved in the purchase of the Beyonics Group and became Chairman of Channelview after the take-over. He was not however involved at all in the events that give rise to the allegations of breach of duties which took place in the period up to January 2012 when the BN Alliance agreement between Beyonics and Nedec/Kodec was signed. He was not involved in the decision to pay the bonus but did agree to the terms of the Resignation Agreements. Much of his evidence consisted of conjecture and/or of his opinion of what he would have done had he been Chairman in 2011 or what Mr Goh should have done at that time which is both inadmissible and unhelpful.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">205 Further, it was plain from his evidence that he had concluded that Mr Goh had committed the “crimes and misdeeds” of which he was accused.

</div> This is not surprising given the outcome in the 672 Action but it did lead to him to be somewhat combative and conclusory in his evidence. It also led to some feisty exchanges with counsel for the Defendants. However, making due allowance for this, I consider that Mr Shaw was doing his best to assist the Court on factual matters within his direct knowledge but I do regard the documents as generally providing a better record of the relevant events in which he was involved. His evidence based on those matters was, inevitably, coloured by subsequent events.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Ms Tan Cheng Yin </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">206 Ms Tan, who is also known as Rita Tan, was and is the Senior Planning Manager of BPM. BPM, Beyonics’ Malaysian company, carried out both 1st and 2nd Stage work for some Seagate products but, in relation to the Brinks 2H product, the product in question here, it was only qualified to carry out the 1st Stage work. Until the floods in October 2011 those baseplates were then shipped to BTT in Thailand for the 2nd Stage work to be done. Thereafter all the Brinks 2H work was carried out at BTEC. Ms Tan gave evidence as to the ordering process for baseplates and the regulation of capacity in the factory, the effects of the floods and certain difficulties in supply which occurred in 2012. She also gave evidence about transferring CNC and SPM machines between the various plants. She was plainly highly experienced and gave her evidence fairly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Me Lee Leong Hua </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">207 Since there are two Mr Lees who gave evidence I shall refer to this witness as “Mr LH Lee”. Mr LH Lee worked for the Beyonics Group for 37 years from 1981 until he retired in 2017. At all material times he was the General Manager or the Senior General Manager of the BTEC factory. He reported to Mr Goh until Mr Goh resigned and remained at BTEC under the new management. He gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiffs. His evidence covered the manufacturing processes, the volume of manufacture over the years, the effect of the floods, the growing relationship between BTEC and Nedec/Kodec in 2011 and 2012 and the potential capacity of BTEC to carry out additional 2nd Stage work after the floods. In relation to most of these matters he gave his evidence clearly and fairly. However, I found his evidence, particularly his written evidence, on BTEC’s potential capacity to carry out 2nd Stage work somewhat strained and gained the impression that he found himself in the invidious position of a man who had served two masters, Mr Goh and Mr Shaw, and was more concerned at pleasing the latter. I shall make due allowance for this.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mr Billy Chua Wui Chuang</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">208 Mr Billy Chua has been employed by Seagate since 1989. At the material time he was Senior Manager for the Commodity Management Team and he was responsible, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, for the strategic sourcing and planning of the supply chain for baseplate manufacture. As such he was involved with Beyonics and, after the take-over of the Samsung business by Seagate, with Nedec/Kodec. He was particularly involved with both companies after the floods. Mr Chua reported directly to Mr Scott Lamb, the Executive Director, and indirectly to Mr Toh Han Chiow (“Mr HC Toh”), the relevant Vice-President.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">209 Mr Chua came to give evidence pursuant to a subpoena issued by the Plaintiffs. He did not provide an AEIC and was therefore examined orally in chief by counsel for the Plaintiffs and then cross-examined by counsel for the Defendants. It is clear from the pleadings and from other evidence that both parties seek to rely on the evidence of Mr Chua. In particular paragraph 21 of the Defence gives particulars of a number of matters involving Mr Chua on which the Defendants rely. In the 672 trial Mr Chua was subpoenaed by the 672 Defendants.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">210 I regard Mr Chua as being a neutral witness. He gave his evidence both in chief and in cross-examination fairly and with as much precision as one could hope for given the passage of time.  He was able to add colour to some of the documents and I consider that it is appropriate to attach weight to many of his explanations.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mr Goh Chan Peng</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">211 Mr Goh is the first defendant. I have referred to him and his position as CEO of the Beyonics Group above. He was intimately involved in the matters which give rise to this dispute and his conduct has been stigmatised by the Plaintiffs both in their pleadings and in the evidence of Mr Shaw. He was held in the 672 Action to have committed “egregious” breaches of the duties he owed to Beyonics. He was subjected in this action to a lengthy and penetrating cross-examination for the second time. It is therefore not surprising that he appeared defensive in the witness box and was on occasions more than a little prickly. That said, I cannot accept the Defendants’ submission that he was a wholly candid witness. Too often he was evasive in his answers and I do not consider that this can be ascribed to any difficulty with language or due to the lapse of time. As with Mr Shaw, I regard the documents as providing a better record of the events and I approach with caution evidence given by Mr Goh that elaborates on the documents in a way which seeks to cast them in a more favourable light than a plain reading would suggest.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Professor Chua Tat-Seng</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">212 Professor Chua is currently the KITHCT Chair Professor at The School of Computing, National University of Singapore. He was the founding Dean of the School of Computing in 1998 and has a PhD from the University of Leeds in the UK. He was a non-executive Director of the holding company, BTL, from October 2002 until its purchase by Channelview in February 2012. He was Chairman of BTL’s Compensation Committee between 2008 and 2012. As such he was responsible for agreeing to the bonus of S$200,000 awarded to Mr Goh in January 2012.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">213 Professor Chua served in the army with Mr Goh and has thus known him for a long time and it was this relationship that led to Professor Chua being appointed as a non-executive Director. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">214 His AEIC was short and to the point, dealing with the manner in which the Board conducted its business, the presentations that were made to it and its relationship with Mr Goh. It went on to consider the BTL Board’s decision to divest itself of the PES Division in 2010 and the Board’s involvement in decisions following the floods, particularly the decision to enter the BN Alliance with Nedec/Kodec in late 2011. He deposes to the reasoning behind the Compensation Committee’s decision to award the bonus.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">215 In cross-examination, it was clear that he was very well informed as to the nature of the Beyonics Group’s business and was knowledgeable as to the way it worked. He was measured and coherent and was of assistance to the court in explaining the working practices of the Board over the years. In all but one respect I consider it appropriate to place reliance on his evidence. However, at the end of his AEIC he gives his opinion as to the attitude that he thinks the Board would have taken to the sums that Wyser received under the Wyser Agreements had they known of them in late 2011, which they did not. I did not find this hindsight reasoning to be compelling and consider that it demonstrated that he had an over-close relationship with Mr Goh and that his views did not represent the attitude which I consider the full Board should have taken had they been aware of the payments, particularly if it became aware of them otherwise than by disclosure by Mr Goh. I shall take this factor into account when assessing the weight to be attached to Professor Chua’s other evidence.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mr Tae Sung Lee </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">216 At the relevant time Mr Tae Sung Lee, also known as Mr Tony Lee, was the CFO of Nedec/Kodec. He was involved in forming the relationship between Nedec/Kodec with Seagate after the take-over by Seagate of the Samsung HDD business. He was particularly involved in negotiations between Nedec/Kodec with Beyonics which led both to the BN Alliance and to the offer by Nedec/Kodec to purchase BTEC in April 2012. He also gave evidence concerning the Wyser Agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">217 Mr Tony Lee was a courteous personality whose comprehension and use of English was adequate but not great. He had a better understanding of written English and was plainly not always sure what the question was in cross-examination when hearing it orally. He was more at ease when he had the opportunity to review the question in writing on the live-note transcript. This was not a facility that was used at the 672 trial and caused Mr Tony Lee to seek to explain the difference between some answers that he gave in cross-examination in that trial and in this on the basis that he had not fully understood the equivalent question in the 672 trial. His written evidence however closely dovetailed with that of Mr Goh and there were elements of his cross-examination which caused him to give evidence which was not wholly consistent with the contemporaneous documents. Again therefore the contemporaneous documents may paint a more reliable picture.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Mr Imsoo Seo</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">218 Having worked for Samsung until 2009, Mr Seo joined Nedec/Kodec and by October 2011 had become the General Manager of the Nedec/Kodec’s LND facility at Langfang in China. It was at this factory that the Nedec/Kodec side of the BN Alliance took place. After the floods, baseplates which had undergone the 1st Stage at BTEC were then shipped to Langfang where Nedec/Kodec carried out the 2nd Stage. Mr Goh and others at BTEC assisted Mr Seo and his team to obtain qualification with Seagate to carry out this work. Mr Seo gives evidence as to the assistance that was provided. He gave evidence through an interpreter, with the usual attendant difficulties. The interpreter was extremely efficient, taking down the questions and answers in shorthand before translating them. Mr Seo however appeared to find the process a difficult one and some of his answers were somewhat tangential to the questions. I consider that there is substance in the Plaintiffs’ submission that Mr Seo’s written evidence contained an overabundance of suggested detail which is not supported by the facts and that he was being used as a mouthpiece for matters which were not within his actual knowledge.

The manufacture of baseplates is however a high volume, low profit business. Over the years, owing to a number of factors, not least the increasing market for tablets and iPads that did not require HDDs and the fact that some of the MBA companies had acquired their own baseplate manufacturing facilities, the market for baseplates became increasingly more competitive and less profitable.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">221 In the financial year ending in July 2009 (“FY 2009”) the PES Division suffered a loss of S$5.4 million on a turnover of S$131.3 million and in the financial year ending in July 2010 (“FY 2010”), a loss of S$7.9 million on a turnover of S$151.4.  In contrast the EMS Division’s business was both substantially greater and more profitable, recording a turnover of S$1.47 billion and a profit of S$13.9 million in FY 2009 and a turnover of S$1.4 billion and a profit of S$20.7 million in FY2010.

Mr Goh told the BTL Board that the PES Division’s action plan was to continue to keep its costs low by continuing to reduce working hours, overtime and manpower. Mr Goh also informed the BTL Board that the entities in the PES Division i.e. BTEC, BPM and BTT had no plans to incur major capital expenditure.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">25. The BTL Board agreed with this strategy. In my view, the plan not to incur major capital expenditure was completely logical in light of the downturn and reducing demand for HDDs. It was also consistent with the decision of the BTL Board to divest the PES Division. A copy of the minutes of the BTL Board meeting on 28 September 2010 is annexed hereto and marked “CTS-5”.

He had Standard Chartered and DBS's banks already to the company who seemed poise and willing to provide financing.  We had some discussions up through June/July.  Then it kind of died, in a sense, because the banks weren't really that keen; business conditions were deteriorating, the overall markets were bad and so the deal kind of went into a hiatus.  We continued to work on it a little bit and we came back and instead of offering 32 to 34 cents a share, I said we'll offer 26 cents a share.  So we lowered our price which meant less equity, less debt necessary to buy the business and on the basis of that the banks were willing to lend and the company – the board of directors was willing to accept that, subject to a shareholder vote.  So there were really two phases in the deal.  One at a high price and then one at the lower price which subsequently got done.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">235 During the course of the negotiations a letter was written on 6 July 2011 by SKP to Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong concerning the possibility of finance for the proposed purchase.

</div> This is a comprehensive document answering various questions which has been asked by the bank. These focused on the PES Division, its viability and SKP’s intentions in relation thereto. There were concerns about the current losses of that division but in answer to Question 3 SKP did express the view that the business could be profitable in the future. Question 4 relates to the possibility that the PES division might be shut down and on the effect that such a decision might have on the relationship between Seagate and the EMS division. In response, SKP said:

But as time went by and we teased out the facts because they were buried -- it was buried under a lot of noise and disinformation, it became clear that it was actually maybe a better business. Now, the bottom line:  before I could get around to selling PES, I'd already raised all the money to pay back the banks and once I paid back the banks, I didn't have to sell PES.  It was only put on the market, or considered for selling, because of the pressure I felt to pay back the banks extremely quickly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">237 As at July 2011 therefore SKP was fully informed as to the financial position of the PES Division and was well aware of the possibility of a sale, including a sale to a competitor in the PES business, and that, with this in mind, it was prudent to maintain the current business so far as possible. At this time therefore SKP’s thinking was little different to that of Mr Goh and the main Board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">238 As Mr Shaw indicated there was then a delay before matters were carried forward by the Facility Agreement with the banks dated 3 October 2011,

</div> My attention was drawn to clause 3.1.10 of the Implementation Agreement which defines Seagate, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, as being a “Major Customer” of Beyonics and it was a condition precedent to the acquisition that there was no loss of a “Major Customer” before the completion of the purchase.

</div> I do not accept this. Business with Seagate in both divisions was important and was recognised without distinction in the Implementation Agreement.

Mr Goh and Mr Tay Peng Huat, the CFO of BTL, were present. The purpose of the visit was to give Nedec/Kodec the opportunity to consider the possibility of making an offer to purchase assets of the Beyonics Group and, for this purpose a Confidentiality Undertaking, in relatively conventional NDA form, was executed on 5 September 2011.

</div> His initial answer was that he could not recall but on being pressed he gave some answers which were confused and somewhat contradictory, which led the Plaintiffs to submit that he was lying when he asserted that the meeting was only about purchasing the PES business, the implication being that even at this early stage Mr Goh was seeking some form of joint venture with Nedec/Kodec. I do not accept this. There is nothing in the contemporaneous e-mails that suggest that the discussions extended beyond general business discussions appropriate between a potential buyer and seller of a business under an NDA. I consider that there is substance in the first answer of Mr Goh that he did not recall what was said. The e-mails are the best record and I have well in mind the observations of the Court of Appeal in <span class="font-italic">Sandz</span><span class="font-italic"> Solutions</span> cited at [196] above.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">255 This meeting took place before the “Seagate Supplier Convention”. When Seagate purchased the Samsung HDD business, it entered discussions with the baseplate manufactures qualified to fabricate baseplates for Samsung HDDs. In the case of Nedec/Kodec this process began on 14 July 2011. A system was introduced whereby Samsung manufacturers could pre-qualify as a supplier to Seagate without undergoing the usual manufacturer qualification. This Nedec/Kodec sought to do by an application dated 16 September 2011 and subsequent to this Nedec/Kodec attended the Convention.

The Plaintiffs suggested that if all that was being considered at this time was solely the purchase of BTEC then a visit by Mr Goh to Nedec/Kodec was unnecessary and that the reference to co-operation and collaboration supported the submission that by this date Mr Goh and Nedec/Kodec had the possibility of a manufacturing joint venture in mind. Mr Tony Lee gave evidence that the proposed visit was a courtesy to showcase the Nedec/Kodec factories and when writing the e-mail he was thinking about the potential sale of BTEC.

This, they contend, would have rendered Seagate’s approach to Nedec/Kodec, at least in relation to the Brinks 2H programme, unnecessary so that the possibility of the BN Alliance would never have arisen. I do not accept this. The above narrative demonstrates that Mr Goh and his team were focusing on the challenges faced both by them due to the damage at BTT and to others in the supply chain. In particular, they were in close contact with Nidec which was the entity that determined which baseplate orders were to be placed with which baseplate manufacturer.

</div> It was Nidec that indicated that BTEC was to be allocated the Hitachi work and that Seagate work at BTEC was to be reduced and placed with others. It was reasonable to assume that Nidec was liaising with Seagate and Hitachi to ensure, as best it could, that the needs of the HDD companies were being met.

I shall draw upon them in seeking to resolve certain important questions that arise over the developing relationship between the parties over this period. There are a number of issues that need to be resolved: when did Mr Goh first become aware of the Seagate’s idea of joint manufacture between Beyonics or MMI and Nedec/Kodec, why did he accede to the request that Beyonics should take part and what were his reasons for him doing so, why did he accede so rapidly, and what discussions did he have with his colleagues at Beyonics before acceding to it?</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">295 The starting point is Mr Tony Lee’s e-mail to Mr Goh referred to in [278] above. It has to be remembered that there was an NDA in place between Nedec/Kodec and Beyonics concerning the possibility that Nedec/Kodec would purchase BTEC and the e-mail must be read with this in mind. But, equally, by this date Mr Lee was aware of Seagate’s idea of joint manufacture. On its face the reference to “joint operation” is ambiguous. It could be referring only to the possible takeover; it could be referring only to the Seagate idea; or it could be referring to both. Mr Lee believes that he did have in mind Seagate’s idea but considers that if Mr Goh had not been told about this in advance he would not have appreciated this. He also acknowledged that the “alternative solution” referred to was the possible takeover.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">299 I do not consider that much turns on the precise timing of the call on 27 October but, on balance, the contemporaneous documents support the conclusion that it was afterwards. The e-mail was at 8.50am and Mr Goh indicated that he was about to travel from Malaysia back to Singapore and, until the meeting, Seagate could not have known whether Nedec/Kodec were prepared to go along with the Seagate proposal and, if so, whether they would prefer to work with BTEC or MMI.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">300 What I find more difficult is to determine whether Mr Billy Chua outlined the Seagate proposal to Mr Goh on 25 October 2011. The contemporaneous documents are sparse and the one that does exist is not consistent with him having done so. There is no e-mail recording the conversation and no written follow up from Mr Goh. In his e-mail of 27 October 2011 Mr Goh deals with a number of matters concerning Beyonics’ relationship with Seagate but does not mention the Seagate proposal, which one might have expected it to do had Mr Chua already broached the subject with Mr Goh. Once Mr Goh had discussed the matter with Mr Chua on 27 October 2011 he sent an e-mail early the following morning to Mr LH Lee seeking input as to the possibility of manufacturing 1 million 1st Stage baseplates per month. If the matter had been raised with him earlier, one might have expected him to have made such a preliminary enquiry earlier. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">301 Taking all these matters into account I am not persuaded that Mr Goh was aware of the possibility of Beyonics becoming involved in what became known as the BN Alliance until the seeds of the idea were sown by Mr Lee’s reference to a “joint operation” in his e-mail of 26 October followed by the clarification thereof by the telephone call with Mr Chua on 27 October and the meeting with Mr Tony Lee on 28 October.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">302 The Plaintiffs’ assertion on the conduct of the parties at this time was that it was Mr Goh’s alleged “<span class="font-italic">evasiveness in the witness box </span><span class="font-italic">was born out of his efforts to try to distance himself from any suggestion that he had initiated the partnership proposal or was involved in initiating the proposal, and to downplay his discussions with Mr Tony Lee on 28 October 2011</span>”.

</div>
</div> The Plaintiffs also contended that some of the comments in the above e-mails indicated a far closer relationship between Beyonics and Nedec/Kodec at this time than Mr Lee and Mr Goh would have me believe and that both Mr Lee’s rapid choice of Beyonics as a possible partner in the BN Alliance and Mr Goh’s equally rapid acceptance of the possibility of taking part in the Alliance demonstrated this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">303 The Plaintiffs relied in particular on the four passages underlined in the e-mails quoted in [288] and [289] above: first, Mr Tony Lee’s comment: “<span class="font-italic">NEDEC and </span><span class="font-italic">Beyonics are good friends to each other though we are in the same HDD baseplate business, close collaboration is not a problem at all</span>”. On any basis having regard to the state of the negotiations for the possible purchase of BTEC, this is an overstatement but it is not inconsistent with Mr Lee’s somewhat exaggerated use of English in other e-mails. There was good reason for him to emphasise the fact that Nedec/Kodec and Beyonics did have previous business contacts although, having regard to the NDA, he could not indicate that a possible merger was being contemplated. Secondly my attention was drawn to the comment, again by Mr Lee: “<span class="font-italic">You were mentioned in the e-mail as a great excuse which you allowed me to do</span>”. The Plaintiffs suggest that this was a reference to the fact that Mr Goh had told him that BTEC might not have the capacity to meet Seagate’s demand of 6 million per quarter and this would appear to be correct. But it is not indicative of anything other than the position recorded in the e-mail to Mr Billy Chua where Mr Lee stated that he was going to talk to Mr Goh about capacity again the following Monday. It obviously suited Mr Lee to be able to relay concerns about capacity as being Beyonics’ rather than Nedec/Kodec’s concerns but equally it would not be in Mr Goh’s interests to give assurances on capacity without first reviewing it with the production team at BTEC. Third, reliance was placed on the words, “<span class="font-italic">Surely, your involvement is our unnegotiable string attached to the deal even afterwards</span>.” This comment was made in the context of the possible takeover and, stripped of the over effusive language, is no more than a statement of usual practice that it is a term of many takeovers that key personnel are retained for a period as, indeed, was the case with the Channelview takeover of Beyonics. Finally, reliance is placed on the words “<span class="font-italic">Now</span><span class="font-italic">, we are waiting for your positive answer on coming Monday because we’d like to plan 2012 with or without it in coming NEDEC directors’ strategy meeting held on Nov. 2nd and 3rd</span>.” It is suggested that this was an indication of an unusually close relationship because one competitor would not release such information to a competitor. I do not see it as such. To the contrary, the words used are more consistent with Mr Goh having not committed BTEC to the partnership at the meeting on 28 October 2011 and having promised to revert to Mr Lee on the following Monday. Mr Lee was giving Mr Goh the reason why a response on the Monday was important to Nedec/Kodec. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">304 I have already rejected the submission that it was Mr Goh who initiated the partnership proposal. The following factors lead me to the conclusion that there was nothing sinister about the way in which Beyonics and Nedec/Kodec interacted and that Mr Goh was, at this time, acting reasonably and in what he considered to be in the best interests of Beyonics in forming the belief that he did as expressed in paragraph 215 of his first AEIC (see [292] above):</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The possibility of Nedec/Kodec purchasing BTEC had already been canvassed between them and there was an NDA in place. There was therefore every reason for Nedec/Kodec to wish to work with Beyonics rather MMI to render a subsequent merger more attractive.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The primary problem caused by the floods was the loss of CNC machines. These were expensive machines (around US$80,000 each) and there were only 259 at BTEC. Their primary use was in machining at the 2nd Stage.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) Beyonics had been offered an attractive contract by Nidec for Hitachi baseplates which necessitated reducing its commitment to manufacture baseplates for Seagate. The available CNC machines were projected to be working at or around the capacity for 2nd Stage work as a result.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) There was excess capacity at BTEC for 1st Stage work. There was thus a good reason for Mr Goh to seek to employ this capacity to enhance BTEC’s business without incurring any major capital expenditure in accordance with the Beyonics business plan for the PES division.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) Working with Nedec/Kodec was also calculated to enhance the business plan of divesting the PES division. BTT was likely to be written off as an insurance claim so that taking steps to further the possibility of the purchase of BTEC by Nedec/Kodec made business sense.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(f) This was a time of crisis in the industry. Decisions had to be made quickly and parties had to work together to help the industry recover from the floods. Nonetheless, Mr Goh did not commit BTEC at the meeting on 28 October 2011 but indicated that he would give an answer by the following Monday and consulted Mr LH Lee and Ms Yang before committing BTEC any further.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(g) Mr Goh held a significant shareholding in Beyonics. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Events after 28 October 2011</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">305 By the end of 28 October 2011 the position was that Mr Goh had agreed to consider the possibility of a partnership which both Seagate and Nedec/Kodec wished BTEC to do. He had consulted his Senior Manager at BTEC, Mr LH Lee, for details of capacity and had ascertained that there was excess 1st Stage capacity but that there was projected to be none for 2nd Stage capacity early in 2012.

Seagate were conducting similar discussions with other baseplate manufacturers. Mr Billy Chua gave evidence that this resulted in other pairings similar to that proposed with Nedec/Kodec and BTEC between MMI and Shinsung (another ex-Samsung supplier) and between Nidec’s baseplate facility with Foxconn. Similar partnerships were also arranged at the motor level between MMI and NMB, another Nidec entity.

In his evidence in chief, Mr Goh said that he used the visit to evaluate whether Nedec/Kodec was able to meet Seagate’s requirements and that he identified a number of issues that concerned him surrounding their ability to obtain qualification from Seagate for 2nd Stage work. He said that Mr Lee asked him whether he could provide consultancy services to Nedec/Kodec but that he did not give an answer during the visit. Mr Goh also stated that he told Mr Hwang and Mr Lee about his proposed visit to Seagate on 18 November 2011 (the EBR Meeting – see [336] below) and that Beyonics would be seeking funding from Seagate at that meeting. He went on to say that the parties discussed the investment that might be necessary for Nedec/Kodec to manufacture the Brinks 2H baseplates. Mr Lee estimated this to be US$5 million and Mr Goh told Mr Lee that it was unlikely that Seagate would fund the full amount. Mr Lee then asked Mr Goh if he could enquire at the EBR meeting whether Seagate would give a grant to Nedec/Kodec of between US$2–2.5 million in support of the proposed BN Alliance which Mr Goh agreed to do.

Mr Hwang and Mr Lee were aware that Mr Goh was to make a presentation to Seagate at the EBR meeting on 18 November 2011 and that this presentation would include a submission for funding from Seagate to Beyonics.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> Mr Goh’s visit to Langfang was unnecessary and the fact that it took place is, it is said, evidence that it was contemplated that Mr Goh would work in some way with Nedec/Kodec. Mr Goh’s evidence that his primary purpose for making the visit was to seek to further the potential sale of BTEC was inconsistent with the fact that nothing concrete on this subject was discussed during the visit. Mr Goh was evasive in cross-examination and denied that he even discussed meeting the deadlines for qualification and that Mr Goh assumed the position of mastermind with regard to relations between Nedec/Kodec and Seagate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">319 Whist there is substance in the submission that Mr Goh was evasive in cross-examination and making due allowance for this, I consider that the Plaintiffs’ assertions are over exaggerated. It is necessary to have regard to the contemporaneous documents in their entirety and not to emphasise individual phrases and sentences deprived of their overall context. It is plain that by 10 November 2011 Mr Goh, whether rightly or wrongly, had formed the view that BTEC should take part in the proposed BN Alliance, if suitable terms could be agreed, and that he was also continuing to the Board’s strategy of seeking to divest itself of the PES division. He had made enquiries of Mr LH Lee and his team at BTEC to ensure that BTEC could meet the production levels suggested and had a pricing structure in mind. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">320 The success of the BN Alliance was therefore important to BTEC’s business and it would only be successful if Nedec/Kodec moved forward rapidly to gain qualification for manufacturing 2nd Stage Brinks 2H baseplates. Accordingly, by 10 November it was essential that BTEC and Nedec/Kodec worked together to make the BN Alliance successful. More specifically it made commercial sense to work together so as to ensure that the partnership obtained the best possible deal with Seagate. I do not read anything more into the meeting of 10 November, so far as it related to the proposed BN Alliance, than an appreciation by both parties that they should work together for their common good. Mr Goh’s participation was crucial to this. I do not however accept that he was the mastermind behind the project.

Mr Lee then drew Mr Goh’s attention to the fact that he, Mr Lee, was going to meet Mr Scott Lamb of Seagate at Samsung the following week and sought guidance from Mr Goh as to what he should tell Mr Lamb about the progress of the BN Alliance and included a tentative schedule of planned production leading up to 1 million a month the following year. Mr Goh responded, “<span class="font-italic">U just give him this plan first, 2 m needs to come up with investment money, please do not discuss with him, u needs to discuss with him the 1.90 price</span>”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">324 The figure 1.90 was a reference to the price of US$1.90 per baseplate that was being proposed to Seagate for the Brinks 2H baseplates manufactured under the BN Alliance.

The question that I shall have to answer is whether this was solely in furtherance of a desire on the part of Beyonics and Nedec/Kodec to get the BN Alliance to work to their best common benefit or whether it was part of a conspiracy on the part of Mr Tony Lee and Mr Goh to promote Nedec/Kodec’s business at the expense of Beyonics’ business.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">325 On 15 November 2011 Mr Lee updated Mr Goh on his meeting with Mr Scott Lamb.

</div> Mr HC Toh had informed Mr Lamb about the question of increasing production to 2 million a month and that Mr Lamb had assumed that Mr Billy Chua was working with Mr Goh on this. Mr Lee reported that he had told Mr Lamb that without investment support “<span class="font-italic">from </span><span class="font-italic">Beyonics and Seagate</span>” Nedec/Kodec could not “<span class="font-italic">ramp up</span>” to that figure. He ascribed the idea of such a ramp up as having come from Mr Goh on the basis of 1 million 1st Stage baseplates coming from Beyonics and the other from Nedec/Kodec but emphasised that Nedec/Kodec did not have the funds available for the necessary investment for this to be done. He also indicated that the proposed price was US$1.90 of which Beyonics would supply 1st Stage products at US$1.25. He was effusive, perhaps over effusive in his praise of Mr Goh and told Mr Lamb “<span class="font-italic">that discussion with me is not important but Seagate people have to discuss this plan with Mr. Goh who we gave full trust to</span>”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">326 It is clear from this exchange that Mr Goh and Mr Lee were working closely together but there is nothing to indicate that there was anything underhand in this. It was in both companies’ best interests to work together to get the best deal possible. It would have made no sense for questions of pricing and investment contribution to be negotiated on two fronts. The proper inference from all these e-mails is that the parties had agreed at the 10 November 2011 meeting that Mr Goh should take the lead on these matters. Objectively, this made sense. Mr Goh had many years’ experience in the field and, more specifically, had had many years working with Seagate. He was due to have a one to one meeting with high profile representatives of Seagate the following week. If the BN Alliance could be made to work in quantities that were achievable (with or without further investment) at a price that was acceptable to both, then the interests of both companies would be well served. I am unable to read into these e-mails that the relationship between Mr Goh and Mr Lee had gone any further than this. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">327 Of course, if Mr Goh had appreciated from the start that the whole idea of entering the BN Alliance was not in the best interests of the Beyonics Group because the alliance would take work away from BTEC which there was a real prospect it could have obtained directly from Seagate, then things would be different but, for the reasons given in [304] to [320] above, this was not the case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">328 Internally Mr Goh and Mr LH Lee and his team were having discussions on production. In this context it has to be noted that, at that time, Mr Goh and Mr LH Lee were under a double fetter on their freedom to propose any capital investment into BTEC. First, there was the Board resolution of 28 September 2010 to restrict capital investment (see [227] above) but also clause 25.29 of the Facility Agreement with the Banks restricted the freedom of the Beyonics Group as a whole to approve significant capital expenditure.

There are no documents before the Court which amplify upon this request for input. In cross-examination Mr Goh said that he had had conversations with Mr Chay on the limitations on capital expenditure but did not suggest that at this time he mentioned the BN Alliance to Mr Chay or that he asked the Board to reconsider its policy on investment in the light of the floods.

Under the heading “Capacity Analysis” he estimated that by April 2012 BTEC would be producing 3 million 2nd Stage baseplates per quarter and 3 million 1st Stage for completion by Nedec/Kodec.

Foxconn and Nidec, MMI and Shinsung.  So on this meeting is to gather all the three party and make sure we know which role that we are playing.  For Beyonics, we support first stage work.  For KODEC, they do second stage work.  For Seagate, they need to get approval of the plant. Of course, there are many, many detail as to what need to be done at the first stage work correlation between the two parties, spec and Tony in KODEC, they need to get equipment set up, operation readiness, they need to get FA, SBR qualified through Seagate as well as to NCC.  So the meeting is to set up, say, "Okay, three party, that's what we are going to do and each one play your part".  Ultimately what Seagate want is deliver the part from KODEC/NEDEC to NCC.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q.    Right.

Then I decided if I do not render these services, the grant will go away, they will not increment the sales quantity for Seagate, there is no incremental price increase for Seagate, and we lose potential 6 million on the income.  So for me, with a strong request by Seagate, I then decided to offer on the urgent basis to support KODEC and NEDEC second stage qualification process. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">351 I shall review the history of the negotiations leading up to the signing of the Wyser Agreements and the cogency of the evidence relating thereto below when I shall have to consider the overall effect of the events surrounding the Wyser Agreements on Mr Goh’s relationship with Nedec/Kodec.

</div> and, amongst other things, that he had said that the PES division’s strategy was to continue to maintain its current production with limited investment because it had to balance the objective of maintaining its current capacity with the need to ensure that it broke even and that Seagate had proposed a business partnership with Nedec/Kodec with BTEC producing 1 million baseplates per quarter for supply to Nedec/Kodec. Professor Chua stated that the Board agreed with the strategy to enter the BN Alliance and gave his reasons in paragraphs 43–45 of his AEIC:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">43. As a director of the BTL Board, I believed that it was in the interests of the Beyonics Group to agree to the Seagate Initiative to pair up with another baseplate manufacturer and to enter into the B-N Alliance because:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) It would be consistent with the BTL Board’s decision to sell the loss-making PES Division and not make further substantial investments in the PES Division (see paragraphs 18 to 29 above);</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) The Baseplate Supply Crunch was likely to be temporary and would last for a period of only approximately 12 months. This meant that the likelihood of the Beyonics Group making profits from substantial investments into the PES Division (for example, by increasing its capacity for Second Stage Works) for the sole purpose of capitalising on the Baseplate Supply Crunch was very low;</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) In light of the fact that the BTL Board had already decided not to make further investments into the PES Division, a partnership with another baseplate manufacturer was the best way to increase the Beyonics Group’s short term profits as it would allow the Beyonics Group to utilise BTEC’s excess capacity for First Stage Works and substantially increase its revenue from carrying out First Stage Works for Seagate’s Brinks 2H Programme; and</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(d) Further, the Beyonics Group’s entry into the B-N Alliance allowed the Beyonics Group to undertake commitments for other end customers and to negotiate grants for that purpose. During the 13 December 2011 Board Meeting, Mr Goh had also informed the BTL Board that the Beyonics Group had secured a grant of US$1 million from Hitachi for the Jupiter baseplate programme and a grant of US$600,000 from Western Digital for an increase in orders for Western Digital baseplates. That was in addition to the grant of US$1.1 million and working capital financing that the Beyonics Group had secured from Seagate.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">44. I was also of the view that it would have been impossible for the Beyonics Group to turn down a request by Seagate, one of the biggest players in the HDD industry, that the Beyonics Group enter into the B-N Alliance.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">45. An important factor that I considered was that Seagate was a major customer of the Beyonics Group’s EMS Division, which was central to the Beyonics Group’s entire business especially since the BTL Board had decided to divest the PES Division. It was therefore very important for the Beyonics Group to maintain a good business relationship with Seagate to safeguard the EMS Division’s revenues. One of the ways to achieve that would be to as far as possible accede to Seagate’s requests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">356 This evidence was not challenged on cross-examination and I accept it.

Because this is an opportunity to -- I mean the, the -- the OEM are prepared to give us additional -- kind of better – better kind of a pricing and also prepare to give us some grant to help us beef up, but we know this supply chain is actually short-term. Because I think earlier you -- you kind of asked me about that, how do we come out with one year. So I think the general consensus is this supply chain is going to last for a year, but if we start to put in a big investment, what happen a year later? So we'll still be faced with the same problem. So I think the board has considered all of these cases. So the suggestion, in fact, put forward by Mr Goh, I thought it was kind of a reasonable working one, it's that the OEM subsidise part of our, kind of, expansion and so on in order to supply them with additional units, and then -- and then we try to kind of meet their requirements as much as we can to -- to pull through this period together.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q.    Do I take it that you assume that Mr Goh and his team would already produce as much as they reasonably can in the circumstances?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A.    Yeah, given that the -- the Thai plant is also -- is also, kind of, out of action, yeah, because of the flood, so -- yeah.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">357 This evidence is consistent with the long term strategy of the Board and its earlier conclusion that there was no prospect of long term profitability in baseplate manufacturing.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">358 There was a further Board meeting on 29 December 2011 at which Mr Goh again made a presentation with slides.

</div> which records that Beyonics and Seagate had agreed on 18 November 2011 (the date of the EBR meeting) that there should be a strategic partnership with Nedec/Kodec. The price at which BTEC would supply the 1st Stage products to Nedec/Kodec was fixed at US$1.26 per piece.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">360  But Mr Goh never alerted the Board to the possibility that he might be entering a consultancy agreement with Nedec/Kodec, far less to any sums of money that he might be paid for doing so. It is an important part of the Plaintiffs’ case that Mr Goh’s actions in agreeing to enter the BN Alliance and in proposing that the Board should approve it was tainted by the sums he was to receive under the Wyser Agreements. The Plaintiffs contend that these sums were bribes from Nedec/Kodec to pursue the BN Alliance when he knew, or where it should have been obvious to a reasonable person, that the Alliance would work to the benefit of Nedec/Kodec and to the detriment of BTEC. Accordingly, had Mr Goh been honest about the Wyser Agreements and informed the Board about them, they would have reviewed the matter more critically. Mr Shaw made clear in his evidence that on the basis of what the Board was told, its decision was not irrational. His complaint was that they were not told the full story because of the dishonest Wyser payments.

However, the NEDEC/KODEC partnership should have been resisted at all cost, but they were not told the full story. They were not told that Goh had entered into this NEDEC/KODEC partnership under secret terms where he personally benefited.  They would not -- no board would have agreed to that.  He grossly violated his fiduciary responsibility as a director and a CEO of a company by having a handshake -- actually, not a handshake, a contractual deal with a competitor to divert business of his own company to them so that he could benefit.

I do not propose to increase the length of this already overlong judgment by reciting each excuse that they sought to put forward to justify the way in which the payments were structured. The feeblest excuse put forward by Mr Goh was that the payment to him was proper because Beyonics was not in the business of providing consultancy services.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">378 True, it is, that before the BN Alliance was proposed, Beyonics were not in the business of providing consultancy services, but neither was Mr Goh. The request by Mr Tony Lee for Mr Goh to provide consultancy services in support of the BN Alliance was to further the joint venture between Nedec/Kodec and BTEC. If consultancy services were justified, they were only justified if the time spent, not only by Mr Goh but also by others at BTEC in assisting Nedec/Kodec to obtain qualification, worked to BTEC’s benefit. It should have been wholly apparent to Mr Goh, Mr Tony Lee and Mr Hwang that any payment for consultancy services should be paid to BTEC and not to Mr Goh, save with the express approval of Beyonics.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">379 Moreover, I am entirely satisfied that it was in fact wholly apparent to them. No legitimate reason was provided for structuring the payment of US$300,000 from Nedec/Kodec to one of its directors, Mr Hwang, through a third party, Mr Goh. It was, in my judgment, an opportunistic method of surreptitiously transferring corporate funds for the personal use of a director. It therefore suited Nedec/Kodec for the agreements to remain secret. Equally, whereas Mr Goh informed the Beyonics Board fully as to the nature of the BN Alliance at the Board meeting on 13 December 2011, he did not mention the fact that he was going to be paid for consultancy services. He again did not tell them when the terms of the BN Alliance were being discussed with the Board in late December 2011 and early January 2012.

</div>  By no stretch of the imagination could it be said that the payment for consultancy fell outside the meaning of “substantially”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">381 Finally, the e-mail exchange on 17 February 2012 between Ms Mila Hwang and Mr LH Lee and Mr Tony Lee’s “terrible mistake” reaction to it is further proof, if more was needed, that all the parties knew the agreements were clandestine agreements which should be kept secret. There is no escaping the conclusion that Mr Goh’s involvement in the Wyser Agreements was reprehensible.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">382 A consequence of the decision in the 672 Action however, where a similar conclusion was reached, is that Mr Goh was ordered to disgorge and has disgorged the sums he received under the agreements. Even had I come to the conclusion that the agreements were above board, it would not have been open to me to revisit that order. That would be a collateral attack on the 672 Judgments. But what I do have to do is to assess the impact of the circumstances surrounding the Wyser Agreements on the issues arising in this action. They cannot be ignored as part of the matrix of facts but, equally, they have to be taken in context. The mere fact that Mr Goh did not act in good faith towards Beyonics in the arrangements he made to receive the payments under the Wyser Agreements does not necessarily mean that he acted in bad faith towards Beyonics in relation to the BN Alliance and the other issues arising on the pleadings in this action.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The potential purchase of BTEC by Nedec/Kodec</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">383 Whilst the discussions leading up to the BN Alliance agreement were taking place there was no significant progress on the proposed purchase of BTEC by Nedec/Kodec which had been the original reason for the first meetings between Mr Goh, Mr Stephen Hwang and Mr Tony Lee. However, on 20 December 2011 a visit was arranged between Mr Goh and Mr Tony Lee for Mr Hwang and Mr Tony Lee to visit BTEC in China to discuss (amongst other things) “<span class="font-italic">M&amp;A</span>”.

The first two lines, you are actually giving some advice on how much investment is required.  In the third line, you tell him about BTEC, how much it can produce.  At the end of the third line, you say:  "My target price is US$40m, this is FRIEND PRICE, IF SEMCO WE ARE GOING TO ASK FOR 50m ..."  Mr Goh, isn't it clear here that you are preferring the KODEC Group?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A.    First of all, I repeat again, SEMCO has no intention to buy.  The paragraph stated here, I'm trying to ask BTEC to pay my target price.  The words I use "friend price" or "bad price" or "high price" or "low price" or "reasonable price", the choice of word I use try to make sure that this 40 million, he can accept. That's only choice of word and some other people say it's reasonable price. So the word I choose is to make sure that Mr Tony Lee and Mr Stephen Hwang is willing to pay 40 million for BTEC.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Q.    Don't you agree, Mr Goh, that if you give your potential buyer here, KODEC, the impression that you are preferring them by selling at a lower price, they won't try that hard to give you the best price possible?</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">A.  I disagree with your statement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">392 From the e-mails themselves, the following is apparent. First, Mr Tony Lee was disclosing information to Mr Goh which was confidential to Nedec/Kodec concerning discussions he had had with Semco and was seeking advice from Mr Goh as to possible ways in which the acquisition could be financed. Secondly, Beyonics had in the past had contact with Semco but Mr Goh, for reasons which are unclear, had concluded that they were not serious potential buyers of the PES division, something which he had apparently told Mr Tony Lee. Third, Mr Goh was assisting Mr Tony Lee by focusing on ways to obtain the necessary financing to enable Nedec/Kodec to fund the purchase of BTEC. Fourth, Mr Goh was providing reasoning to Mr Tony Lee to justify his target price of US$40 million and in doing so was working on the basis that the capacity at BTEC was between 2.5 and 3 million per month which is consistent with the figures he had been provided with by Mr LH Lee (see [332] above). Fifth, Mr Tony Lee had represented to Semco that the asking price for BTEC was US$55 million which it was not and this could only have been done to try to scare off Semco as a possible bidder.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">393 The e-mails undoubtedly demonstrate that Mr Goh and Mr Lee were working closely together but, in the main, it was Mr Lee rather than Mr Goh who was imparting confidential information. It was Mr Lee that was being proactive and Mr Goh reactive during the interchange. Save for the “FRIEND PRICE” comment, there is nothing in Mr Goh’s comments that suggests impropriety. He was offering some suggestions to Mr Lee as to possible ways in which the prospects of a deal could be moved forward but was not helping him to put any of these suggestions into effect. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">394 The Plaintiffs invite the Court to conclude that this exchange of e-mails demonstrates that Mr Goh was not acting in Beyonics’ best interests. They rely in particular on the “FRIEND PRICE” comment, the failure to alert Semco to the correct asking price and the advice given with regard to financing. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">395   As to the “FRIEND PRICE” comment, Mr Lee was not prepared at that time to state a price. It is not unusual in negotiations for statements to be made which, although not true, have a sufficient ring of truth about them to be calculated to induce the opposite party to accept them as being true and to act upon them. Neither Mr Goh nor the efforts of consultants appointed by Mr Shaw, which I shall consider later, achieved a bid of anywhere near US$40 million. The eventual bid made by Nedec/Kodec was around US$30 million. Viewed in the round, I accept Mr Goh’s evidence that this was an attempt on his part to make Mr Lee comfortable with offering a price in the region of US$40 million and that that this was not a preferential price. Indeed, if Nedec/Kodec had offered such a figure at the time, either the then current Board or, indeed, Mr Shaw and the Channelview Board a month later, would not, I believe, have viewed it as being an unreasonably low figure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">396 This conclusion also casts light upon the fact that Mr Goh did not approach Semco. Semco is recorded by Mr Tony Lee as saying that the price was “TOO high”. Mr Goh knew that and would have placed himself in an impossible position both with Nedec/Kodec and with Semco had he sought to open negotiations with Semco by telling them that the asking price was not as high as US$55 million. I do however accept that the e-mails demonstrate that Mr Goh was prepared to advise Mr Tony Lee as to possible ways forward but that was not contrary to Beyonics’ best interests if it served to promote the take-over.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">397 On 8 January 2012 Mr Lee e-mailed Mr Goh to update him on a further meeting with Semco on 7 January 2012. Again Mr Tony Lee discloses information with regard to a potential investment by Samsung into Nedec/Kodec and that due diligence was to start on 18 January. He also talks about a possible relationship with Nidec; points 6, 7 and 8 read as follows:

Mr Goh was instrumental in pushing for the sale of BTEC to the KODEC Group in negotiations which were not at arm’s length. It would have been clear to Mr Goh that this sale, if it had gone through, would have killed two birds with one stone: it would have strengthened the production capabilities of the KODEC Group, and devastated that of the Beyonics Group. Given that the Beyonics Group had already lost BTT to the floods, if BTEC were sold to the KODEC Group, only BPM would be left. Indeed, it could not have been sensible to break up the PE Division and sell it off in parts: if the Beyonics Group was a “<span class="font-italic">secondary supplier</span>”, its PE business would have been even more insignificant if it was only left with BPM.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">420 The facts as disclosed by the documents considered above demonstrate that in seeking to interest Nedec/Kodec in making an offer for parts of the PES division before the floods, Mr Goh was implementing the then-Board’s strategy. Once Nedec/Kodec had indicated an interest only in acquiring BTEC Mr Goh continued discussions on that basis but also entered discussions for the sale of BPM with other parties and obtained an LOI from Magne for the purchase of BPM. He was thus not ignoring BPM. The Board’s strategy was to divest the PES division which, by then, in essence, was BPM and BTEC as BTT had already been lost as a result of the floods. This strategy was also the strategy that Mr Shaw had proposed to the banks as a means for repaying the loan. It remained part of the new Board’s strategy until at least the autumn of 2012 following the efforts of BDA during that summer and autumn.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">421 Mr Goh carried out these negotiations without informing either Board of the progress made until he had a LOI. This appears to have been his working style which was acceptable to the old Board but not to Mr Shaw. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">422 He undoubtedly became close to Mr Hwang and Mr Tony Lee and information was exchanged which would not have been had the proposed transaction been an arm’s length transaction through, say, BDA. But it bore fruit in that Nedec/Kodec sent the LOI proposing a figure of between US$28–31 million.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">423 The Plaintiffs contend that Mr Goh favoured Nedec/Kodec by offering them a preferential price and a first right of refusal.

<div class="FootnoteRef text-justify">  Statement of Claim at 36(8)(iii).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> I do not accept that he offered them a preferential price. The “Friend Price” of US$40 million can be seen in the light of all the facts as being an inducement to Nedec/Kodec to offer a price in that region which was at the higher end of a reasonable price. This is demonstrated to be so by the fact that Nedec/Kodec’s offer was around US$30 million as was the projected offer from MMI which subsequently was made at between US$25–28 million (see [417] above). Mr Goh cannot be criticised for using marketing tactics to seek to induce a higher offer, nor can he be criticised for acting in a way which, entirely in accordance with both Boards’ strategies, resulted in the highest offer for BTEC which was obtained either by him or by BDA.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">424 He might be criticised for failing to keep the two Boards fully informed as to the progress of the various negotiations he was involved in but this is the way in which he had been allowed to work as CEO over the years. Any such criticism could equally be directed at the old Board for allowing him this freedom.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">425 He might also be criticised on the basis that he became too close to Nedec/Kodec such that his judgment as to what was in the best interests of the Beyonics group became blurred. I shall consider the merits of these criticisms below. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Consultancy</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">426 There were moments during the trial when I was uncertain whether the Plaintiffs’ case in relation to the payments Mr Goh received under the Wyser Agreements was that he was paid a far greater sum than the work he did or whether he did work under those agreements which extended beyond that which was necessary to make the BN Alliance work to the benefit of Beyonics. In the former case, the excess payment would support their case that the sums were bribes. In the latter case, it would support their case that Mr Goh was, in effect, working for Nedec/Kodec rather than Beyonics.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">427 In truth, I think it was probably both. Paragraph 30 of the Statement of Claim pleads that Mr Goh received the payment of US$0.02 per piece as gratification for procuring and/assisting to procure the diversion of 2nd Stage work that should have been carried out by BTEC to Nedec/Kodec pursuant to the BN Alliance. This is referred to as “Bribe 1”. The case therefore is that no payment of this nature was justifiable. In paragraph 33 of the Statement of Claim the allegation is that the net US$200,000 that Mr Goh received pursuant to the other Wyser Agreements was gratification for procuring or assisting to procure the US$2.5 million grant from Seagate. Again therefore their case is that no payment of this nature was justifiable and hence this payment is referred to as “Bribe 2”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">428 However, in paragraph 36 of the Statement of Claim it is alleged that Mr Goh assisted Nedec/Kodec to become qualified as a supplier to Seagate in competition with BTEC with the intention of supplanting BTEC as a supplier to Seagate. Reliance is placed not only on advice given to Nedec/Kodec to achieve qualification for second stage work (para 36(5)) but also on advice relating to qualification for 1st Stage work (para 36(10)) and on a proposed IPO by Kodec (para 36(15)).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">429 The Defendants’ position is that Mr Goh became involved in assisting Nedec/Kodec to obtain the US$2.5 million grant at the request of Seagate as part of the overall package to be provided to Beyonics and Nedec/Kodec and that it was in Beyonics’ interest for him to do so. Further, he provided consultancy services to Nedec/Kodec under the Wyser Agreements to advance the progress of the BN Alliance and therefore the interests of Beyonics. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">430 Whilst the above analysis of the facts goes some way to resolving these issues, the amount and nature of the advice and assistance given by Mr Goh and others to Nedec/Kodec also have a part to play.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">431 Dealing first with the qualification for the 2nd Stage work, Mr LH Lee gave evidence that there were a number of visits both by Nedec/Kodec personnel to BTEC’s Changshu plant and by Beyonics personnel other than Mr Goh to the Langfang facility.

Had the Wyser Agreements been entered into with Beyonics, the sums involved would appear to me to have been in proportion to the involvement of Beyonics personnel both with regard to the lump sum and the US$0.02 per piece. It is to be noted that, in fact, the US$0.02 sum was financed by Seagate as the price per piece was increased from the US$1.90 previously proposed to the eventual agreed price of US$1.92. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">434 But, of course, the Wyser Agreements were with Mr Goh and he therefore benefitted at the time from the work he and others at BTEC did to assist Nedec/Kodec, but Beyonics did not. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">435 The Plaintiffs however contend that, even if some of the advice and assistance given by Mr Goh was in furtherance of the BN Alliance and even if entering the BN Alliance was itself not contrary to Beyonics’ best interests, the relationship between Mr Goh and Nedec/Kodec went far beyond that which was necessary to make the BN Alliance successful. Mr Goh was, they contend, working for the benefit of Nedec/Kodec and contrary to the best interests of Beyonics. They rely not only on the extent of Mr Goh’s involvement in the 2nd Stage process, which they contend was excessive, but also his involvement in other aspects of Nedec/Kodec’s business at the time. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Other assistance by Mr Goh</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">436 In addition to his involvement in obtaining the US$2.5 million grant, the consultancy work and the part he played in promoting the potential purchase of BTEC by Nedec/Kodec, the Plaintiffs rely on two other matters: assistance given by Mr Goh to Nedec/Kodec to develop its capability for 1st Stage work and Mr Goh’s promotion and/or facilitation of Nedec/Kodec as a baseplate supplier for Seagate programmes.

The first four related to 2nd Stage work but the fifth related to e-coating.

</div> This was another internal review which put forward two options: Option A, Hold and Wait and Option B, Remove &amp; Rebuild. Under the former, all suppliers would be maintained although with a lower allocation. Under the latter, orders for baseplates from Beyonics would cease at the 3rd quarter of 2013 (January to March 2013) and contained the comment “<span class="font-italic">Eliminate </span><span class="font-italic">Beyonics in near term. May expect impact to their PCBA business to STX. Need to verify</span>”. PCBA is a reference to “printed circuit boards” which was a part of Beyonics’ EMS business for which Seagate (STX) was a major customer. Orders for baseplates from Nedec/Kodec were however projected to increase.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">458 These two presentations were the subject of evidence from Mr Billy Chua. The market for baseplates was beginning to decrease. Much of the new capacity developed after the floods had been in China whereas all of the motor assemblers were still located in Thailand so there was a need to reduce supply from China.

</div> The reason he gave for maintaining or increasing the supply from Nedec/Kodec whilst reducing that from Beyonics was said to be based not only on Nedec/Kodec’s supply of baseplates for Seagate programmes but also their continued, much greater, production of baseplates for Samsung programmes.

Mr Ng did not give evidence and Mr Billy Chua was not asked about these documents so they are the best record of the events. Mr Shaw approved Mr Ng’s proposed course of action. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">462 The last shipment of baseplates from Beyonics to Seagate was in August 2013. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">463 It can be seen from the above that there were many factors involved in Seagate’s decision to terminate the supply of baseplates from Beyonics, both from BPM and from BTEC. One of those was the fact that Nedec/Kodec had become qualified to carry out the 2nd Stage work and was going to qualify to carry out the 1st Stage work. This was therefore a cause of Beyonics losing the Seagate work but it was only one of a number of reasons. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Capacity</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">464 One of the pillars on which the Plaintiffs’ case is built is that in October 2011, when the floods occurred, there was sufficient capacity at BTEC not only for the 1st Stage work on the Brinks 2H products to be done but also the 2nd Stage as well. Hence, rather than going along with the Seagate’s proposal for the BN Alliance, Mr Goh should have pushed for the whole Brinks 2H programme to be allocated to BTEC. If this had been done, Beyonics would have remained the supplier for this programme, Nedec/Kodec would not have qualified to carry out the 2nd Stage work for that programme and when the time came to assess whether BTEC should continue to receive orders from Seagate, the decision to terminate Beyonics as a Seagate supplier would have been different.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">465 The question of capacity has arisen a number of times in the above narrative. It is now necessary to decide, on the balance of probabilities, what was, at any given time, the actual maximum capacity for machining (2nd Stage plus automotive) at BTEC and whether that capacity was different to what Mr Goh and Mr LH Lee perceived to be the actual maximum capacity. An attempt was made through the evidence of Mr LH Lee to reconstruct, after the event, what was in fact the actual maximum capacity at the time. However, this evidence it is only relevant if either Mr Goh or Mr LH Lee had any reason to turn their mind to the question as to whether their perception of actual maximum capacity was significantly understated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">466 The background for this is set out in [258] to [284] above. After the floods, Hitachi were pressing BTEC to manufacture baseplates for their Jupiter 1 programme, and in his e-mail on 18 October 2011, Mr LH Lee set out in a chart his proposals for accommodating Hitachi’s needs which involved a reduction in the Brinks 2H production for Seagate.

Mr Lee was continuously involved in determining how to increase capacity further and concluded that all of these would involve investment in new machinery.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">475 It was Mr LH Lee’s job to manage the Changshu plant and to be fully aware of matters such as capacity. It was also his responsibility to keep Mr Goh informed as and when necessary on issues such as capacity. It was not Mr Goh’s job himself to assess capacity, whether at Changshu or any of the other 13 factories for which he had overall responsibility. He was entitled to proceed on the basis of figures provided to him by his factory managers, such as Mr Lee.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">476  For these reasons I am satisfied that not only did Mr Lee and therefore Mr Goh perceive that the maximum capacity at the time was as stated above, this was, in fact, the maximum capacity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">477 Without evidence as to how the figures in the PE Memorandum were arrived at I am unable to place material reliance on them it in the face of all the other documents containing detailed figures inconsistent therewith.

Mr LH Lee and his team were focused on production at that time. They knew of the pressure being placed on management to accommodate Hitachi and they knew of the proposal to use spare capacity for 1st Stage work to produce Brinks 2H e-coated products for Nedec/Kodec. They were consistently being asked to increase 2nd Stage capacity and were unable to propose ways of doing so above 3 million per month without further investment.

In April 2011 Seagate acquired Samsung’s HDD business and on 22 June 2011 Mr Goh informed Mr Toshihiko of Nidec of the Board’s policy of divestment. It was Mr Toshihiko who suggested that Mr Goh should be introduced to Mr Stephen Wang of Nedec/Kodec. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">494 In July 2011 Mr Goh became aware of the terms on which SKP were negotiating with the banks for the necessary loan for Channelview to purchase Beyonics and therefore knew that it was also the policy of SKP to seek to divest Beyonics of the PES Division.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">495 Mr Hwang and Mr Tony Lee visited BPM in September 2011 and thereafter indicated that any purchase by Nedec/Kodec would only be of BTEC, not of the whole PES Division.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">496 The Plaintiffs contended that Mr Goh was wrong to approach a competitor in seeking to implement the Board’s policy of divesting itself of the PES Division. I do not accept this. If one is going to divest a division, it does not matter to whom it is sold since, even if at the time the purchaser was a competitor, after the purchase it would cease to be. Indeed, no such limitation was placed on BDA when it was brought in to assist in seeking to divest the PES division. Plainly, when dealing with a competitor it would be essential to have an NDA in place but this was done as between Beyonics and Nedec/Kodec.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">497 There was thus nothing wrongful in Mr Goh’s initial contact with Nedec/Kodec.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Act (2) – Mr Goh’s contact with Nedec/Kodec after the floods and the first proposal of the possibility of the BN Alliance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">498 Immediately following the floods, Mr Goh and Mr LH Lee took stock of the position in the PES Division in light of the fact that BTT in Thailand had lost some 200 CNC machines. Mr LH Lee was in close contact with Nidec, who placed orders with BTEC for baseplates, and was active in obtaining orders for Hitachi baseplates even though this might mean reducing the manufacture of those for Seagate. This was attractive to BTEC as the profit margin on Hitachi baseplates was higher than that for Seagate products. By 26 October 2011 the position had been reached whereby BTEC were being offered contracts from Nidec for the supply of both Jupiter and Eagle baseplates for Hitachi and Mr Goh had been informed by Mr LH Lee’s e-mails that this would stretch current capacity at BTEC such that there would have to be a drop in the allocation of Seagate products. Mr Goh therefore had no reason to believe there was any excess capacity for 2nd Stage work. Indeed, the contrary was true.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">499 Mr Goh was CEO of the whole Beyonics Group. He could not be expected personally to challenge each assessment of capacity made by those responsible for the running of the various factories. He was entitled to rely on the figures provided by Mr LH Lee who was in overall charge of the BTEC facility. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">500 It was at this time that Mr Goh first became aware of the possibility of some form of joint venture with Nedec/Kodec. This had arisen out of the Seagate internal brainstorming meeting in October which Mr Billy Chua had first raised with Mr Tony Lee on 24 October 2011. On 26 October Mr Tony Lee mentioned a possible joint operation in an e-mail to Mr Goh and matters came to a head at the meetings on 27 and 28 October. Having taken advice from Mr LH Lee as to the capacity at BTEC for 1st Stage work, Mr Goh then indicated his willingness to consider entering the joint venture which became the BN Alliance.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">501 The Plaintiffs contend that Mr Goh should have been more proactive in his dealings with Seagate prior to 27 October 2011 and that this would have rendered the need for a joint venture unnecessary. Equally he should have rejected overtures about a joint venture and should have made more effort to obtain the whole Brinks 2H order for BTEC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">502 I do not accept that on the basis of the machining capacity as conveyed to Mr Goh by Mr LH Lee and having regard to the potential for that capacity being used to satisfy Nidec’s orders for Hitachi baseplates, Mr Goh acted otherwise than in the best interests of BTEC in considering entering a joint venture with Nedec/Kodec for the reasons given in [304] above. So far as he was aware there was no surplus capacity at BTEC for 2nd Stage work but there was spare capacity for 1st Stage work for the volume proposed (one million a month). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">503 On the facts as known to him at the time, increasing the capacity for 2nd Stage work to accommodate a further one million a month must have involved a significant capital investment. But he was under a double interdict against further substantial investment in the PES Division, both from the then current Board’s decision and from the proposed terms of the bank loan to SKP. There is no evidence that Mr Goh ever turned his mind to the possibility of seeking that investment but, in the circumstances, there is no reason why he should have done so. Mr Goh was dealing in the art of the possible. In the light of the floods, the projected joint venture with Nedec/Kodec represented a way of using existing capacity at BTEC without further investment but which would yield a profit to BTEC at a financially challenging time.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">504 For these reasons and for the fuller reasons expressed in [304] above, I am satisfied that there was thus nothing wrongful in Mr Goh’s entertaining the proposal of a joint venture with Nedec/Kodec.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Act (3) – Mr Goh’s participation in the negotiations leading up to the BN Alliance (including the negotiations for the US$2.5 million grant)</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">505 I have considered in [305] to [344] above the events which followed the meetings on 27 and 28 October 2011 until the Tripartite meeting on 24 November 2011. In summary, following the October meetings Mr Goh and Mr LH Lee discussed capacity at BTEC to satisfy Mr Goh that there was capacity to carry out the 1st Stage work for Seagate as well as the 2nd Stage work for Hitachi. At no stage was it suggested to Mr Goh that there was additional 2nd Stage capacity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">506 Mr Goh then attended the meeting with Mr Tony Lee and Mr Hwang at Langfang on 10 November 2011 where Mr Goh was assessing whether Nedec/Kodec could perform the 2nd Stage and offered advice in relation to this. This prompted Mr Tony Lee to raise the question of a consultancy. They discussed the investment necessary to enable Nedec/Kodec to perform the work which Mr Lee estimated at US$5 million and Mr Goh advised that at most Seagate might pay half. Both parties were aware that Mr Goh was to attend the EBR meeting on 18 November 2011 and Mr Lee asked Mr Goh to negotiate on Nedec/Kodec’s behalf for a grant of US$2.5 million.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">507 Prior to the EBR meeting Mr Goh was also asked by Mr HC Toh of Seagate to include in his presentation at that meeting details of any investment that would be necessary for Nedec/Kodec to make the proposed BN Alliance work. It is thus not surprising that during his presentation this is what Mr Goh did, as well as promoting various means by which Seagate could support Beyonics directly. When dealing with Nedec/Kodec and the proposed alliance, he identified both the advantages and disadvantages of the alliance, more specifically he referred to the inevitable increase in cost involved in transporting the 1st Stage products across China to Langfang for the 2nd Stage work to be done. At this time the proposed price was US$1.90 per piece compared to US$1.84 which was the increased price that BTEC were seeking from Seagate for Brinks 2H products where both the 1st and 2nd Stage was carried out at BTEC.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">508 The Plaintiffs suggested that this was a reflection of the fact that Mr Goh was promoting a higher price for Brinks 2H products produced by the BN Alliance compared with those negotiated for purely BTEC products. He was, but he was able to do this on the basis of transportation costs. Mr Goh was cross-examined on this

</div> and explained that he had told Seagate what the financial consequences of the additional transport were and that BTEC was charging the same price for the 1st Stage work to Nedec/Kodec (US$1.26) as it was budgeting for in relation to the Brinks 2H baseplates wholly produced by BTEC. This evidence was not challenged further and satisfies me that Mr Goh was not favouring the interests of the BN Alliance over those of BTEC in this regard.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">509 It was at this meeting that Mr Goh agreed with Seagate that, subject to agreement on investment, BTEC would enter the BN Alliance and thereafter decided that he would accept a consultation fee from Nedec/Kodec. This led to the Tripartite meeting in Singapore on 24 November 2011. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">510  At the Tripartite meeting all three parties agreed to the BN Alliance and the issue of funding was, in principle, also agreed. Seagate was to provide both a grant and cash flow support to the various Beyonics companies as well as the grant to Nedec/Kodec. Although the necessary agreements had to be drawn up and executed, in substance it was at this meeting that the BN alliance was concluded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">511 It was immediately after the Tripartite meeting that Mr Goh gave Mr Tony Lee the first drafts of what subsequently became the Wyser Agreements. The possibility of him being paid for consultancy work if the BN alliance went ahead must therefore been on his mind during the Tripartite meeting.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">512 Any assessment of Mr Goh’s activities in this period has to be made in the light of the finding in relation to Act 2 above, namely, that it was in the best interests of Beyonics, both subjectively and objectively, in the light of the facts as they then appeared to Mr Goh (and indeed to Mr LH Lee), to enter negotiations concerning the proposed joint venture. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">513 On this basis, the question that has to be asked is what precisely Mr Goh did during this period that was not in the best interests of Beyonics. He was working not only to encourage Seagate to approve the joint venture but also to obtain the maximum possible funding both for the joint venture and for Beyonics’ other business with Seagate. Both because of the requests by Mr Tony Lee and Mr HC Toh that he deal with the question of funding for the joint venture at the EBR meeting and because of the fact that he had an established long term relationship with Seagate, it made sense for him to do this.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">514 Did the possibility of him receiving payment for consultancy influence his actions up until 24 November 2011?  The possibility must have encouraged him to do his best to ensure that the BN Alliance was a success but, equally, it was in BTEC’s best interests that he did his best to ensure that the joint venture was a success. What Mr Goh did during this period was that which he reasonably had to do to with this end in view. If he had not done what he did, he could justly have been criticised for not acting in the best interests of the Beyonics Group.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">515 Accordingly, in my judgment, there was nothing wrongful in Mr Goh’s actions during the period up to end of the Tripartite meeting when, in substance, the parties agreed to the terms on which the BN Alliance should proceed.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Act (4) – The Wyser Agreements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">516 It was following the Tripartite meeting that Mr Goh gave Mr Tony Lee the first draft of the Wyser Agreements and thereafter negotiations took place which led to the final agreements being executed and Mr Goh being paid. For the reasons given in [377]–[381] above, any payment for consultancy services should have been be paid to BTEC and not to Mr Goh, save with the express approval of Beyonics. Equally, there was no legitimate reason for structuring the payment of US$300,000 from Nedec/Kodec to one of its directors, Mr Hwang, through a third party, Mr Goh.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">517 Furthermore, I am satisfied that all three of them were aware of both these factors and accordingly Mr Goh was in breach of his duties both as a director and employee of the Plaintiffs in entering the Wyser Agreements without the consent of the Plaintiffs. This should have been done by informing the main Board of the proposed agreements and seeking approval of them.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">518 Mr Goh’s reprehensible behaviour lay not in seeking payment from Nedec/Kodec for the consultancy work that he and others at BTEC were to provide to advance the BN Alliance but in structuring the payment to Wyser rather than to BTEC. It was plainly in BTEC’s interest that it should be compensated for the time and effort its directors and employees expended in providing consultancy to advance the BN Alliance.  Further, it is not suggested that in providing the consultancy services Mr Goh was neglecting his duties towards the rest of the PES Division or, indeed, to the EMS Division by focussing his attention on the joint venture for personal gain. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">519 Professor Chua said this about the main Board’s attitude at the time towards the BN Alliance and his views as to what the Board would have done if Mr Goh had notified the Board of the Wyser Agreements:

In view of the fact that as I have explained above, the B-N Alliance was beneficial to the Beyonics Group, it was in the interests of the Beyonics Group for the B-N Alliance to succeed. In light of that, in my view, the provision of the consultancy services referred to at paragraph 59 above to the NEDEC/KODEC Group served the interests of the Beyonics Group by enabling the NEDEC/KODEC Group to properly carry out their role under the B-N Alliance.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">62. A large part of the EMS Division’s business was the manufacture and supply of PCBA for Seagate HDDs. Therefore, the success of the B-N Alliance in producing Brinks 2H Baseplates for Seagate HDDs would also have an impact on the quantities of PCBA that the EMS Division could sell. In this connection, Beyonics Technology (Senai) Sdn Bhd was the sole supplier of PCBA for Seagate HDDs.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">63. I understand that Mr Goh did not obtain formal ratification from the BTL Board for his provision of the consultancy services to the NEDEC/KODEC Group and the payment that he received from the NEDEC/KODEC Group as consideration for the provision of those services.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">64. I understand that Mr Goh had spoken informally to Mr Chay, the Chairman of the Beyonics Group about the fact that he would be providing consultancy services to the NEDEC/KODEC Group.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">65. While it would have been ideal for Mr Goh to have formally notified the BTL Board about the Wyser Agreements before he entered into the Wyser Agreements, in my view, it was understandable for him to have made the decision to proceed with what he felt was in the best interests of the Beyonics Group and to put into effect the BTL Board's decision to enter into the B-N Alliance.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">66. As a director of the BTL Board, I would have voted to approve or ratify Mr Goh's entry into the Wyser Agreements, if this matter had been presented before the BTL Board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">520 It will be apparent that I understand and accept Professor Chua’s reasoning in paragraphs 61 and 62. Had the Board been informed about the provision of consultancy when it was considering whether or not to enter the BN Alliance agreement it would have seen that the provision of consultancy services was proper.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">521  I am however unable to accept that it would have been “ideal” for Mr Goh to have notified the Board. His failure to do so was a gross breach of duty. Equally, whilst I very much doubt that any Board, acting in the best interests of the shareholders, would have sanctioned Mr Goh being paid in this way, the fact remains that Mr Goh did not ask them to sanction his behaviour so the question does not arise. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">522  It is not suggested that Mr Goh and the BTEC team rendered greater service to Nedec/Kodec than was proper because of the Wyser Agreements. Hence, as indicated above, his breaches lay in the way he structured the payments to be made to him rather than to BTEC and in his failure to notify the Board of the Wyser Agreements and seek its consent thereto.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Act (5) - Mr Goh’s involvement in the continued negotiations for the purchase of BTEC by Nedec/Kodec leading up to the LOI</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">523 The negotiations between Mr Goh, Mr Tony Lee and Mr Hwang for the purchase of BTEC by Nedec/Kodec continued from 3 January 2012 through to the sending of the LOI on 24 April 2012 to the termination of the negotiations through Mr Goh and his replacement by BDA in June 2012 (see [383]–[417] above)</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">524 At [420] above, I concluded that in carrying out the various negotiations leading to LOIs not only from Nedec/Kodec but also from Magne was consistent with and in furtherance of the policy of both the old Board and of Mr Shaw and Channelview to consider divesting the PES Division. I did however conclude that Mr Goh could be criticised in two respects in relation to the Nedec/Kodec negotiations. First, he failed to keep the two Boards fully informed as to the progress of the various negotiations he was involved in and, secondly, on the basis that he became too close to Nedec/Kodec such that his judgment as to what was in the best interests of the Beyonics Group became blurred. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">525   The Plaintiffs’ complaint is that these factors indicate that the negotiations were not conducted at arm’s length and that accordingly Mr Goh was in breach of his duties to the Plaintiffs. This however fails to take into account that by reason of the BN Alliance he had inevitably become better acquainted with Mr Tony Lee and Mr Hwang than would normally be the case in takeover negotiations, even with an NDA in place. There was nothing wrong in exploiting that relationship if to do so would further the possibility of divestment at a favourable price. The fact remains that Mr Goh obtained an LOI for a greater sum than any obtained over the same time frame by BDA. In these circumstances I do not see how Mr Goh can be criticised for acting in the way he did.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">526 The criticism that he did not inform either Board of the progress of the negotiations is a criticism that can be directed both at Mr Goh and at the two Boards for giving Mr Goh the freedom to operate as he saw fit and to report only by giving a presentation at Board meetings. It does not relate to the question of whether he acted in good faith in relation to the takeover.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">527 Accordingly, Mr Goh did not breach any of his duties as a director or employee of the Plaintiffs in his dealings with Nedec/Kodec over the proposed purchase of BTEC by Nedec/Kodec.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Act (6) – Mr Goh’s other interactions with Nedec/Kodec</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">528 These are the interactions considered in [436]–[454] above.

</div> not to 3.5” HDDs which Beyonics manufactured for Seagate. The assistance provided by Mr Goh started immediately before the LOI was sent from Nedec/Kodec to Beyonics (22 April 2012) and ended just before Nedec/Kodec were refused exclusivity (6 July 2012). Mr Goh’s assistance thus fell within the period that he was actively encouraging the purchase of BTEC by Nedec/Kodec. In any event Nedec/Kodec did not do business with Ovindo.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">530 Taking such an active part to assist a competitor is not a normal part of the role of a CEO and, <span class="font-italic">prima facie</span>, would give rise to a justifiable assertion that it was not in the best interests of the company. However, in the circumstances of this case, the assistance has to be viewed in the context of the relationship which had developed between BTEC and Nedec/Kodec both as a result of the BN Alliance and the proposed takeover. Mr Goh had to take into account the potential for souring relations between the parties if he had refused to allow Mr Tony Lee and Mr Hwang access to BPM’s factory against the potential assistance he was giving to a competitor by doing what he did. This is a matter of judgment. Other CEOs might have acted differently but that does not mean that what Mr Goh did in the circumstances was a breach of his duties. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">531 In order to reach a conclusion that there was a breach of duty I have to be satisfied that in doing what he did, Mr Goh was acting <span class="font-italic">male fides</span>, knowing that what he was doing was not in the best interests of Beyonics, or that, objectively, no CEO could reasonably have believed that what he was doing was in the best interests of Beyonics. Whilst it may have been a wrong exercise of judgment to go to the lengths he did to assist Nedec/Kodec, I am unable to conclude in the circumstances that then existed that his conduct went beyond what was reasonably permissible and entered the realms of <span class="font-italic">male fide</span> behaviour, either subjectively or objectively.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">532 The second complaint relates to the alleged promotion and/or facilitation of the development of Nedec/Kodec as a supplier to Seagate. For the reasons given (see [454] above), in my judgment, there was nothing sinister in what he did. I shall therefore not consider the complaint further.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">533 In conclusion therefore the sole breach of the duties imposed on Mr Goh in his capacity both as a director and/or employee of the various Plaintiffs was his participation in the Wyser Agreements. This is not to belittle the nature of that breach, it was an egregious breach and the sums paid under those agreements were disgorged to Beyonics as a result of the findings in the 672 action.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">534 That is not however the end of the matter. I have likewise reached the conclusion that there was a breach in this regard and must therefore continue to assess what the effect of this breach was on the issues that are live in this action. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Consequences of the Breach</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Diversion Loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">535 The Diversion referred to in the pleadings is the fact that, pursuant to the BN Alliance, the 2nd Stage work was carried out at Langfang by Nedec/Kodec rather than by BTEC at Changshu.

</div> This work could have been carried out more economically at Changshu as Seagate were paying US$1.92 for baseplates produced by the BN Alliance but only US$1.84 for those wholly produced by BTEC.

</div> and third, the procurement of the US$2.5 million grant to Nedec/Kodec without notifying the Board of the second Wyser Agreement.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div> The second and third need to be considered before the first. Simply put, the Plaintiffs’ case is that Mr Goh either knew that, or ought to have investigated whether, the necessary capacity was available or could readily be made available at Changshu but deliberately failed to do so. He failed to do so as to cause Beyonics to enter the BN Alliance. This was further enabled by wrongfully procuring the US$2.5 million grant and all of this was done for his personal gratification due to the Wyser Agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">537 The Plaintiffs have not proved that Mr Goh acted unreasonably in considering whether to enter negotiations for the BN Alliance. He took advice from Mr LH Lee on capacity at Changshu, was told that capital investment would be needed to increase capacity even by a limited amount and was aware that there was a double fetter on significant investment in the PES Division, both by the old Board and by the banks funding the takeover by Channelview. The BN Alliance represented a means of making profitable use of excess capacity for 1st Stage work. They have also not proved that there was anything wrong in the way in which Mr Goh became involved in the negotiations leading up to the various aspects of financial aid provided by Seagate both to Nedec/Kodec and to the Beyonics Group.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">538 There was however a serious breach of duty in Mr Goh’s failure to inform the Board of the Wyser Agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">539 Following the structured approach of <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span>, it is first necessary to ask whether the Plaintiffs have established the fiduciary breach and the loss. They have done the former but only in relation to the Wyser Agreements. However, they have failed to do the latter in that they have failed to demonstrate that BTEC had the capacity to do the 2nd Stage work and thus there was no diversionary loss. Even if Mr Goh did in fact not act in the best interests of Beyonics in entering the Wyser agreements, if the Plaintiffs cannot establish the pleaded loss they cannot recover it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">540 Looking at it the other way round, and assuming that the Diversion Loss could be proved, the second aspect of the <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span> approach is to ask whether the Defendants can rebut the presumption that the loss was caused by the wrongful acts. This, in my judgment, they have done. The history of the negotiations leading to the BN Alliance considered in detail above demonstrates that the Wyser Agreements were reactive to the progress of those negotiations and were not proactive in causing the parties to enter the BN Alliance agreement. All three parties had reached agreement at the Tripartite meeting on 24 November 2011 before Mr Goh first provided drafts of the Wyser agreements to Mr Tony Lee. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Total Loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">541 The Plaintiffs’ claim in relation to the Total Loss is founded on the same basic assertion that, if BTEC had carried out the 2nd Stage work rather than Nedec/Kodec, then Nedec/Kodec would never have become a competitor of BTEC and hence, when the downturn came, BTEC would have retained the Brinks 2H work and would have remained a preferred Seagate supplier.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">542 Here, undoubtedly, the Plaintiffs have proved loss, in the sense that they did cease to be a supplier to Seagate. The details of this are considered in [455]–[462] above which concludes in [463]: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">It can be seen from the above that there were many factors involved in Seagate’s decision to terminate the supply of baseplates from Beyonics, both from BPM and from BTEC. One of those was the fact that Nedec/Kodec had become qualified to carry out the 2nd Stage work and was going to qualify to carry out the 1st Stage work. This was therefore a cause of Beyonics losing the Seagate work but it was only one of a number of reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">543 Qualification to carry out 2nd Stage work was a necessary consequence of the BN Alliance but there was no breach of duty involved in Mr Goh’s actions in concluding the BN Alliance. The legal question is not whether the fact that Nedec/Kodec had qualified to carry out the 2nd Stage work was a partial cause of the Total Loss; it is whether the Defendants can rebut the presumption that the proven breaches in any way caused the loss. On the findings of fact, this has been done. The Wyser Agreements did not cause the BN Alliance to be formed. Whilst Seagate was aware of the BN Alliance when making its decisions with regard to the future, it was not aware of the Wyser Agreements. The Wyser Agreements can therefore have had no influence on those decisions. Indeed, had Seagate been aware, it might perhaps have been an additional factor in Seagate not wanting Beyonics to remain a supplier.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on Diversion Loss and Total Loss</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">544 Had the action not been struck out as an abuse of process under the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> doctrine, the Plaintiffs’ claims against Mr Goh in relation to both elements of loss based on his breaches of duty would have failed. It follows that their claim against Wyser for dishonest assistance and the claims against both Defendants based on conspiracy by unlawful means would also fail.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Bonus</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">545 The matter of the bonus is different. When the Compensation Committee came to consider the question of bonus payments for 2011 at its meeting on 4 January 2012, no one on the compensation committee was aware of the Wyser Agreements. None of them was aware that Mr Goh stood to make the sums he did by way of payment to Wyser. The effect of the 672 Judgment was that Mr Goh and/or Wyser were ordered to disgorge US$166,554.02, which amounts very roughly to S$230,000 (at S$1.40 to US$1). This is to be contrasted with Mr Goh’s annual salary in 2012 (before options and bonuses) of around S$1.2 million,

</div>
</div> and the bonus of S$200,000 which he was awarded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">546 I have referred above to Professor Chua’s evidence as to what the attitude of the Compensation Committee might have been had it known about the Wyser Agreements. But it did not. Mr Goh dishonestly concealed those agreements from the Board and from the Committee. He owed a duty to seek the Board’s consent to him entering those agreements and he failed to do this. There is all the difference in the world between a director or employee who is open with his Board of Directors and gives them the option of consenting to agreements such as the Wyser Agreements and one who conceals them from the Board.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">547 Bonuses are not paid to dishonest directors or employees. The attitude of the Compensation Committee would, or certainly should, have been different had a “whistle-blower” told them of the Wyser Agreements immediately prior to the meeting on 4 January 2012 and Mr Goh’s breaches of duty had thus come to light before the Committee made its decision. It is inconceivable that a responsible Board, acting in the best interests of the shareholders, would either have allowed Mr Goh to keep the sums due under the Wyser Agreements or paid him any bonus.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">548 Beyonics have already recouped the sums paid to Mr Goh under the Wyser Agreements but they have, to date, suffered a loss of S$200,000 in respect of the bonus.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">549 To adopt the <span class="font-italic">Winsta</span> approach therefore, the Plaintiffs have proved the breach, failure to disclose the Wyser Agreements, and the loss, the S$200,000 paid by way of bonus. It is impossible for the Defendants to seek to rebut the presumption that the breach was not the cause of the loss. Accordingly, had the action not been struck out, the Plaintiffs’ claim for repayment of the bonus would have succeeded.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The Resignation Agreements</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">550 These can be dealt with relatively briefly. When Mr Shaw accepted the terms Mr Goh offered for payments under the resignation agreements he was unaware of the Wyser Agreements. Again, Mr Goh, acting honestly, should have disclosed them and, applying the same “whistle-blower” test, if Mr Shaw had been aware, he would have been entitled to refuse to accept Mr Goh’s offered terms. Indeed, having seen Mr Shaw in the witness box I have no hesitation in concluding that he would have done so and that he had every right to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">551  Whether one looks at this on the basis of a misrepresentation by silence or as a failure of consideration, the result is the same. But for the striking out of the action, the payments made under the Resignation Agreements would fall to be repaid.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Other Matters</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">552 Expert evidence was adduced by both parties in relation to the assessment of the sums due had the claim for the Diversion Loss and/or the Total Loss succeeded. Both Mr Iyer, a chartered accountant who gave financial evidence on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Mr Dass, also a chartered accountant, who gave equivalent evidence on behalf of the Defendants, gave their evidence fully and fairly and were plainly both well qualified to assist the court.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">553 However, both had to prepare their reports on the basis of assumed facts as presented to them by their respective clients and both readily accepted that the financial outcome would be dependent on the facts as found after the trial. Having found on the facts that the alleged losses are unrecoverable, seeking to resolve the various issues that were in dispute between the experts would necessarily involve making assumptions in conflict with those findings of fact. This is a fruitless task and I shall therefore not undertake it.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">554 One thing is however clear in the light of the 672 Appeal Judgment, which is that each of the Plaintiffs must prove its own loss. BAP cannot claim for losses actually suffered by the other Plaintiffs. In particular, BAP cannot claim for any losses suffered by BTEC, a company registered in the People’s Republic of China. An issue would thus have arisen as to whether the Plaintiffs’ claims against BTEC were governed by the law of Singapore or the law of China. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">555 The importance of this lies in different limitation periods under the two laws. The Defendants assert that the proper law is the law of China and that, had there been any loss proved by BTEC, recovery of any such losses would be time barred under the law of China. The Plaintiffs contend both that the proper law is the law of Singapore (where there is no dispute that any claim would not be time barred), but also that the Defendants’ analysis of Chinese limitation law is wrong.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">556 These are two complex issues and a significant body of expert opinion was served on behalf of the parties by two experts in Chinese law and counsel for the parties debated the matter fully in their written submissions. I intend no disrespect in declining to seek to resolve the debates between them. Anything I say will be <span class="font-italic">obiter</span> and I consider that it is better for difficult issues such as these to be resolved in a case where the outcome depends on a finding one way or the other. This is particularly so in the case of the Chinese law issue where a foreign judge is inevitably placed in an invidious position when faced with deciding questions of foreign law.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">557 The bringing of this action is an abuse of process under the <span class="font-italic">Henderson v Henderson</span> doctrine and will be struck out. Had it not been struck out the Plaintiffs’ claims for the Diversion Loss and the Total Loss would have failed but their claims for the return of the bonus and the payments made under the Resignation Agreements would have succeeded.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">558 I shall hear the parties on the question of costs.</div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Simon Thorley<br/>International Judge</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Chin Li Yuen Marina, Alcina Lynn Chew Aiping, Siew Guo Wei, Aditi Ravi and Darren Ng Zhen Qiang (Tan Kok Quan Partnership) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Davinder Singh s/o Amar Singh SC, Lin Xianyang Timothy, Tan Mao Lin, Gerald Paul Seah Yong Sing and Joshua Chia Sheng Rong (Davinder Singh Chambers LLC) for the defendants.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">SIC/S 10/2018</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Beyonics Asia Pacific Limited and others v Goh Chan Peng and another</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> [2020] SGHC(I) 14</span></p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Decision of the Singapore International Commercial Court (delivered by Simon Thorley IJ):</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Outcome:<em> </em>SICC disallows companies’ claims against former CEO because they failed to bring the claims in a similar lawsuit filed in 2013 </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Background </span></strong></p>
<p><span>1<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The plaintiffs are subsidiary companies of the Beyonics Group. The first defendant, Goh Chan Peng (“Mr Goh”), was the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Beyonics Group until April 2013 and the second defendant is a company that is wholly owned by him. </p>
<p><span>2<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>In July 2013, Beyonics Technology Ltd (“BTL”), the parent company of the Beyonics Group, and another subsidiary company brought proceedings against Mr Goh, his wife and his companies in Suit No 672 of 2013 filed in the High Court (“the 672 Action”). BTL alleged that Mr Goh had breached various duties he owed to the Beyonics group by diverting the business of the group to a competitor, Nedec/Kodec, and causing the loss of a major customer, Seagate. Mr Goh denied that he was in breach of any duties and maintained that he had acted in the best interests of the Beyonics group at all times.</p>
<p><span>3<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The trial judge found in favour of BTL in the 672 Action and Mr Goh filed an appeal. The Court of Appeal found in his favour and held that BTL was not entitled to recover most of the losses it claimed as those losses had not been suffered by BTL but by other subsidiary companies within the Beyonics group, who were not plaintiffs in the 672 Action. </p>
<p><span>4<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Subsequently those subsidiary companies filed the present suit against Mr Goh and his company, claiming both the losses that had been disallowed in the 672 Action upon BTL’s claim and additional alleged losses. Mr Goh argued that the claim of those companies was barred by the extended form of <em>res judicata </em>set out in <em>Henderson v Henderson </em>[1843] 3 Hare 999 (“<em>Henderson v Henderson</em>”) as they had failed to bring those claims in the 672 Action.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The court's decision </span></strong></p>
<p><span>5<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>Where the <em>Henderson v Henderson </em>issue is raised, the task facing the court is first, to consider whether the claims made in the second action could and, if so, should have been brought in the first action. If so, the court must then consider whether at the time the second action was started, it would be an abuse of process to allow the second action to proceed. There is a heavy burden on the defendants to demonstrate that the plaintiffs are abusing the process of the court by bringing the second action (at [57]).</p>
<p><span>6<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The plaintiffs’ claims in the present action are substantially the same claims as those brought in the 672 Action, save for additional claims for the bonus and the salaries that had been paid to Mr Goh prior to the plaintiffs’ realisation of the alleged breaches (at [65]–[70]). Those claims could and should have been brought in the 672 Action (at [71]–[95]). The plaintiffs’ failure to do so caused the defendants to face the prospect of having to bear the burden of a second action which was manifestly unfair and amounted to an abuse of process (at [99]–[122]). The present action had to be struck out (at [123]–[125]).</p>
<p><span>7<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span></span>The court went on to consider the defendants’ liability, in the event that the action had not been struck out. It held that, with one exception, Mr Goh did not by his actions breach his duties as a director or employee of the plaintiffs through his interactions with Nedec/Kodec. The exception was his failure to disclose to Beyonics that he was, through the second defendant, receiving payment from Nedec/Kodec for consultancy services which should have been paid to Beyonics (at [493]–[532]). The plaintiffs failed to prove that this breach caused a diversion of business from Beyonics to Nedec/Kodec or the loss of Seagate’s business [535]–[544]. However, the plaintiffs would have succeeded in their claims to recover the bonus and salaries paid to Mr Goh as, had they known of the breach, they would not have paid him those sums when he left the Beyonics Group (at [545]–[551]).</p>
