<font size="4" xmlns="">
<p align="justify"></p></font>1.    The first appellant, Syed Abdul Mutalip Bin

Syed Sidek ("Syed"), and the second appellant, Roetikno Bin Shariff

("Roetikno"), were jointly tried and found guilty of the following charge:

<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">That you, Syed Abdul Mutalip Bin Syed Sidek and Roetikno Bin Shariff,

  are charged that you, on or about the 17th day of April 2001, at about 5.20pm in room 406

  of Taipei Hotel, No 60 Lorong 8, Geylang Road, Singapore, and in furtherance of the common

  intention of you both, did traffic in a Class ‘A’ controlled drug specified in

  the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in your

  possession for the purpose of trafficking, 78.85 grams of diamorphine at the said place,

  without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you

  have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act,

  Chapter 185, read with section 5(2)of the aforesaid Act and section 34 of the Penal Code,

  Chapter 224, and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">2.    Both appellants, who were given the mandatory

sentence of death for the offence, appealed against the decision of the trial judge.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

Background</p></b>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">3.    On the evening of 17 April 2001, police officers

from the Anti-Vice Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department conducted a vice raid

at the Taipei Hotel at No 60, Lorong 8, Geylang Road. During the raid, a police officer,

Sgt Stanley Chan, used a master key to unlock the door of Room 406. When he found that the

door was latched from within, he identified himself as a police officer and ordered the

occupants of the room to open the door. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">4.    When the door of the room was not opened, the

police officers forced their way in. They found no one there and noticed that a window in

the room was open. Moments later, an employee of the hotel, one Wong Fong Yin, who was

manning the lobby counter, and a police officer, Sgt May Tan, who was stationed at the

staircase landing, encountered two Malay men, one with long hair and the other slightly

balding, who walked past them. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">5.    In Room 406, the police found yellowish granular

substances in packets on the floor and in the exposed false ceiling of the toilet. In

addition, they recovered a weighing scale and unused plastic sachets on the bed and

elsewhere in the room. Tests by the Department of Forensic Science confirmed that the

seized substances contained no less than 78.85 grams of diamorphine.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">6.    Syed was arrested by Central Narcotics Bureau

("CNB") officers on 20 April 2001 while he was returning a hired vehicle to its

owner. On 30 April 2001, Roetikno was arrested while he was at Room 202 of the Compass

Hotel at Lorong 22, Geylang .</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The case against the appellants </p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">7.    The prosecution contended that Syed and Roetikno

were packing diamorphine in Room 406 of Taipei Hotel when the anti-vice raid took place on

the evening of 17 April 2001. It was asserted that before the two of them escaped though

the window and fled to Room 305, which was directly below Room 406, they hid some drugs in

the false ceiling of the toilet of Room 406. They then walked briskly past Sgt May and

escaped from the premises.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">8.    The prosecution relied on a number of statements

by the appellants to the CNB. In their statements, Syed and Roetikno admitted that they

were in Room 406 of Taipei Hotel when the police knocked on the door of that room on 17

April 2001. To begin with, in his statement on 24 April 2001, Syed left no doubt as to his

role in Room 406 at the material time when he stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">On 17.4.2001, my friend "Dino" [Roetikno] and me (<i>sic) </i>were

  in Room 406 of Taipei Hotel. We were repacking the big packets of heroin into smaller

  sachets on the bed. Dina had asked me to help him. My job was just to seal the plastic

  sachets after Dino had filled them with heroin. I used a white candle to seal the sachets.

  While doing this, there was a knock on the door. Dino went to answer. He opened the

  latched door and then closed it again after the people outside identified themselves as

  police officers. He then said "Blah, blah!" to me and signalled me to get out of

  the room using his hands. I then picked up the yellow plastic tray filled with heroin and

  put it in the false ceiling in the toilet. The false ceiling was already opened. As I was

  doing this, I saw Dino climbed (<i>sic) </i>out of the window. I looked out of the window

  and saw Dino going into Room 305 below via the window. I also climbed down to the 3<sup>rd</sup>

  floor window of Room 305 and entered it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">9.    In another statement on 3 May 2001, Syed again

admitted that he and Roetikno were packing drugs in Room 406 when he stated as follows: <u></u></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">"… At Room 406, I knocked on the door. Dino opened it.

  When I entered the room, I saw a tray of heroin on the bed. I also saw some empty sachets,

  candles and a small digital weighing scale. Dino told me that he was packing the heroin

  and asked me to help him seal the packets after he filled them with heroin. I agreed to

  help him as the room was under registered (<i>sic</i>) my name. I also have never done it

  before and wanted to try it out of curiosity. That was the first time I saw Dino repacking

  a large amount of heroin…"<u></u></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">10.    As for Roetikno, he incriminated himself and Syed

in his statement on 3 May 2001 when he stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">On 17.04.2001, I was in room 406. My friend, ‘Talip’ was with

  me. We were putting the heroin into smaller packets. I helped to put the heroin in the

  small packets and weigh them. Talip helped to burn the plastic to seal the plastic

  packets. I had opened 2 big packets of heroin. I placed the heroin on a tray. We then laid

  out the weighing scale, empty sachets, candle, envelopes and the tray of heroin on the

  bed. Before we could start repacking, there was a knock on the door. I went to see who it

  was. Before I could reach the door, the person outside had opened it. The door was latched

  from inside and it could not be opened fully. The person outside identified themselves as

  police officers. I then panicked and ran back to the bed. I informed Talip that the police

  are outside. As I was doing that, I heard the sound of the door being break opened (<i>sic</i>).

  I then jumped out of the window to try and escape. I nearly fell but managed to hold on to

  the window frame at the third storey. I then climbed into the room. I did not know that

  the room is my own room 305. While I was hanging outside the window, I looked up and saw

  Talip climbing out of the fourth storey window. After I got into the third storey room, I

  opened the window frame to let Talip step on it. I then went to the door, opened it and

  went out of the room ….</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">11.    Roetikno’s other equally incriminating

statement of 5 May 2001 was in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">On 16.04.2001, I received a call from a male person by the name of

  ‘Mail’. He asked me to standby to receive some heroin to repack … A few

  hours later, a male Chinese called ‘Ah Boy’ called me at my handphone…. He

  then told me to go to the fourth floor pantry to look for a black box with a silver cover

  … I left room 305 and checked the fourth floor pantry. I found a black box with a

  silver cover in the pantry … Talip knows that we are waiting for the delivery of some

  heroin to be repacked. We have agreed to use room 406 to do the repacking … On

  17.04.2001, we had planned to do the repacking early but we had overslept … About 5

  pm, I went into room 406 and waited for Talip. While waiting for Talip, I brought down the

  items in the false ceiling in the toilet and placed them on the bed. While waiting for

  Talip to come, I cut open two packets of heroin and placed the contents on a tray…

  Talip then came to the room. We then start to repack the heroin. We had already repacked

  some plastic sachets of heroin when the police came …"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">12.    Apart from the aforesaid admissions by the

appellants, the trial judge took into account other relevant evidence. Wong Fong Yin

("Wong"), an employee of the Taipei Hotel, testified that Syed and Roetikno

checked into the hotel together and were the occupants of Rooms 406 and 305 at the

material time. Furthermore, both Wong and Sgt May Tan testified that they saw Syed and

Roetikno walking briskly past them and out of the hotel premises at the material time.

Wong recognised the duo as he had seen them a few times during their stay in the hotel.

The hotel register confirmed the date and time when the appellants checked into the hotel

and renewed their stay there. Furthermore, some items found in Room 406 belonged to the

appellants. These included three packets of medicine bearing Roetikno’s name. In

their statements to the CNB, the appellants admitted that the items in the room belonged

to them. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">13.    A police fingerprint expert, Snr Staff Sergeant

Lim Soy Poh, adduced two Fingerprint Examination Reports, which revealed that two of five

fingerprint marks discovered on exhibits recovered from Room 406 were made by Syed, while

the remaining three fingerprint marks were made by Roetikno. Of significance was the fact

that the appellants’ fingerprints were found on different parts of a box found in

Room 406. That box was referred to by Roetikno in his statements as the box that was used

for the delivery of the diamorphine.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The Defence</p></b>
</u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">14.    In their defence, the appellants contradicted the

admissions made by them in their statements to the CNB. Both of them denied possessing any

of the drugs seized by CNB. They asserted that a mysterious third party had brought the

drugs into Room 406 at the Taipei Hotel without their knowledge and consent.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">15.    Syed’s defence was that the box containing

the drugs was owned by a friend of his, a Chinese pimp called ‘Boy’, who had

requested him to run certain errands, such as hiring a motor vehicle and booking a hotel

room in the Taipei Hotel. Boy had left the box behind in the vehicle and asked him to keep

it. Syed said that he asked Roetikno to take the box to the Taipei Hotel. He added that

sometime after 4 p.m. on 17 April 2001, Boy telephoned him and invited him to Room 406 to

consume some heroin. He went to Room 406 and promptly handed the box and its contents to

Boy when the latter asked about the whereabouts of the box. Syed claimed that while he was

taking a shower in the bathroom, he heard a knock on the main door. He emerged from the

bathroom and it was only then that he noticed that there were drugs on the bed. Realising

that the police were trying to gain entry into the room, he panicked and escaped through

the window into Room 305 below where Roetikno was. As both of them had consumed drugs and

were under CNB supervision, they fled the hotel.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">16.    Roetikno’s defence complemented that of

Syed. According to him, his fingerprints were found on the box containing the drugs

because Syed had asked him to take the box from the rear seat of the rented motor vehicle

and carry it up to Room 406. He claimed to have been in Room 305 of the Taipei Hotel

throughout 17 April 2001 and that at around 5 p.m., Syed suddenly appeared in Room 305 and

told him that he had entered via the window whilst escaping from a police raid. Both of

them then made their escape as they were under CNB supervision.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">17.    While both Syed and Roetikno retracted their

confessions in their statements to the CNB, they did not allege that those statements had

not been made voluntarily. They merely claimed that the statements to the CNB were

untruthful. As for why Boy was not mentioned in his statements to the CNB, Syed explained

that he did not say anything about Boy as the CNB was looking for Roetikno and not Boy. In

any case, he was worried that the CNB would not believe him as he did not know the full

name and particulars of Boy. He therefore decided to make use of Roetikno by implicating

him as he thought that the latter had gone to Malaysia. He claimed that he was in a

confused state of mind and did not realise the consequences of his statements to the CNB. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">18.    As for Roetikno, he said that he had

substantially fabricated his voluntary statements to the CNB in order to help Syed, since

he felt obligated to the latter for help given to him in the past. He did not consider the

implications of his incriminating statements. It was only when he was aware of the

quantity of the drugs seized from Room 406 that he realised that he had made a grave

mistake. He said that as Syed advised him to tell the truth, he decided to retract his

statements to the CNB.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The trial judge’s decision</p>
</b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">19.    The trial judge said that the explanations

offered by Syed and Roetikno for retracting their incriminating statements to the CNB were

illogical and unbelievable. He had no doubt that Syed and Roetikno were packing drugs in

Room 406 of the Taipei Hotel when the police appeared on the scene during the course of

their anti-vice raid and that both of them were in possession of the diamorphine. In any

event, they had explicitly confessed to re-packing the drugs in smaller sachets in Room

406 at the material time. The judge said that both Syed and Roetikno had a common

intention to traffic in the drugs. As they offered nothing credible to rebut the

presumption of possession for the purpose of trafficking, under s 17 of the Misuse of

Drugs Act, he found them guilty of the charge and passed the mandatory sentence of death

on them.</p>
<u xmlns=""><b>
<p align="justify"><br/>

The appeal</p></b></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">20.    The main plank in the appellants’ appeal is

that with the retraction of their statements to the CNB, the trial judge had insufficient

evidence to convict them. They contended that the trial judge failed to consider the

ramifications of the retraction of their statements to the CNB, which were inconsistent

with their sworn testimony during the trial. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">21.    The admissions made by Syed and Roetikno in their

statements to the CNB were undoubtedly confessions of their guilt. In innumerable cases,

including <i>Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP </i><a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=47209&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1999] 1 SLR 25</a> and <i>Anandagoda v The Queen</i>

[1962] MLJ 289, it was made clear that the test as to whether or not a statement is a

confession is an objective one. It depends on whether to the mind of a reasonable person

reading the statement at the time and in the circumstances in which it was made, it can be

said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or suggest the

inference that he committed the offence (<i>Per </i>Lord Guest in <i>Anandagoda v The

Queen </i>at p 291). An accused person who retracts during his trial a confession he made

earlier on can still be convicted on the basis of the confession if the court is satisfied

that it was made voluntarily and that it was true. In <i>Yap Sow Keong v PP </i>[1947] MLJ 90, 91, Willan CJ who delivered the judgment of the Malayan Union Court of Appeal said as

follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">In our view the law as to the admissibility of retracted confessions in

  evidence is clear and put shortly it is that an accused person can be convicted on his own

  confession even when it is retracted, if the court is satisfied of its truth. We do not

  agree with those Indian decisions which lay down that before a person can be convicted on

  his retracted confession there must be corroborative evidence to support it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">22.    A similar position was taken by this Court in <i>Ismail

bin U K Abdul Rahman v PP</i> [1972-74] SLR 232. While the court should consider any

explanation that the accused person gives for his change of position, the explanation can

be rejected if it is found to be untrue. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">23.    It must be noted that neither Syed nor Roetikno

denied that they had given the statements to the CNB voluntarily. Syed’s reasons as

to why his confessions were fabricated were not credible. He claimed to have falsely

incriminated himself and Roetikno although he knew that the offence in question carried

the death penalty. In any case, the exculpatory version of facts given by Syed at the

trial did not appear anywhere in his statements to the CNB. As for Roetikno, his reasons

for lying in his statements to the CNB were understandably rejected by the trial judge.

Although he claimed that he wanted to help Syed, he incriminated the latter in his

statements. If he was, as he claimed, innocent, all that he had to do was to assert his

innocence. Instead, he chose to admit that he and Syed were packing drugs in Room 406 of

Taipei Hotel at the material time. In our view, the judge had good grounds for holding

that the appellants’ confessions in their statements to the CNB were true.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">24.    The other arguments advanced by the appellants

against their conviction also lacked merit. Syed asserted that the trial judge failed to

direct himself sufficiently on the issue of common intention under Section 34 of the Penal

Code, Cap 224. We were satisfied that the trial judge, who relied on, inter alia, the

decision of this Court in <i>Foong Seow Ngui &amp; Ors v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9711&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 3 SLR 785</a> and other

cases, including <i>Mahbub Shah v Emperor </i>(1945) 47 Bom LR 941 and <i>Barendra Kumar

Ghosh v Emperor </i>AIR<i> </i>1925 PC 1, carefully considered the applicable principles

and case law on common intention. The judge was clearly right when he concluded that, on

the basis of the finding that Syed and Roetikno handled and repacked the drugs in Room 406

of Taipei Hotel at the material time, they were in possession of the drugs in furtherance

of the common intention to traffic in them. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">25.    As for Roetikno, he alleged that the trial judge

erred when he failed to treat Syed’s statements with caution as the latter had a

reason for giving incriminating evidence against him. He pointed out that at the time of

the police raid, he was in room 305 of Taipei Hotel with one Sasha at the time of the

police raid. This was confirmed during the trial by Syed. Furthermore, Syed had testified

that the said drugs belonged to Boy. Roetikno also contended that the trial judge erred by

not drawing an adverse inference with respect to the prosecution’s failure to call

Sasha, who was in room 305 with him at the material time, to testify.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">26.    As far as Syed’s statements to the CNB are

concerned, it ought to be reiterated that an accused person’s confession, though

retracted, can be used against a co-accused so long as the court is satisfied after taking

into account the explanation given for the retraction, that the confession is true and

that it was made voluntarily. This was made clear by this Court in <i>PP v Rozman bin

Jusoh &amp; Anor</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9527&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 3 SLR 317</a> and <i>Panya Martmontree v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9532&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1995] 3 SLR 341</a>.

Needless to say, there is a question as to the proper weight to be ascribed to the

statement of one accused who implicates the co-accused.<i> </i>We are satisfied that the

trial judge gave this question sufficient attention and see no reason to disagree with his

conclusion.</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">27.    As for the prosecution’s failure to call

Sasha to testify, it should be borne in mind that by testifying that he was in Room 305,

and not in Room 406, at the material time, Roetikno relied on an alibi. In such a case,

Sasha’s particulars ought to have been furnished (see section 155(1) of the Criminal

Procedure Code). The purpose of such particulars is to enable the prosecution to verify

the genuineness of the alibi: <i>Lee Choon Chee v PP</i> <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9814&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 SLR 264</a>. This could not

have been a difficult task as Sasha was Roetikno’s girlfriend. It ought not be

overlooked that section 105 of the Evidence Act provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who

  wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the

  proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">Illustration (b) of the said section adds as follows:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">B wishes to the court to believe that at the time in question he was

  elsewhere. He must prove it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">28.    In our view, the trial judge adequately dealt

with the question of drawing an adverse inference from the fact that Sasha was not called

as a witness. In paragraph 83 of his Grounds of Decision, he explained why he was not

inclined to draw any adverse inferences that the prosecution was hiding unfavourable

evidence by not calling Sasha as a witness in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify">The second accused, having given a voluntary statement admitting to his

  involvement in the offence and his presence in room 406 when the raiding party was at the

  room door, had a measure of burden, however little, to render self-help and lift himself

  out of the quagmire which was entirely of his own making. In fact, his defence in court

  was one almost bordering on alibi. If it was indeed his defence, such a defence should

  have been disclosed to the prosecution at the earliest opportunity in order to give the

  prosecution time to investigate that defence. The tactics adopted by or for and on behalf

  of the second accused in springing a surprise defence of alibi midway through trial did

  not bode well for his defence."</p>
