ILC Dubai was a sole proprietorship owned by Ritter. Asia was seen as an upcoming market and Weber set up ILC Singapore as an expansion of ILC Dubai to Asia.

The table was provided to me on 11 October 2019 and was subsequently updated in December 2019 as appended to the parties’ respective written closing submissions. The plaintiff objected to several items in the table, largely for being unauthorised payments. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 It seemed to me that the parties were already prepared for the taking of accounts. As stated earlier, Dextra did not dispute its liability to give an account; in fact, its position was that it had given an account to the plaintiff.

</div> The only thing left to be done was the taking of accounts, and this the parties were ready to do. Gafoor’s report provided a detailed account of how the plaintiff’s funds had been utilised by Dextra and the plaintiff had falsified several items in the Table of Parties’ Positions (which was prepared based on Gafoor’s report). In addition, the AEICs that had been filed also dealt with issues that were relevant to a taking of accounts. In the circumstances, I was of the view that it would be more efficient for the taking of accounts to be dealt with during the trial. I indicated accordingly to the parties during a subsequent pre-trial conference.

In that case, the Court of Appeal also cited <span class="font-italic">Pearse v Green</span> (1819) 1 Jac &amp; W 135; 37 ER 327 in which it was held that a trustee has “to be constantly ready with his accounts”. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Accounts may be taken on two bases. The first is that of a common account, which does not require any misconduct on the trustee’s part. The second is an account on a wilful basis, which requires the beneficiary to allege and prove at least one instance of default on the trustee’s part: <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin and others v Eng Chiet Shoong and others</span> [2019] 4 SLR 714 (“<span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span>”) at [80]. Wilful default does not require the trustee to be conscious of his misconduct and it is sufficient that the trustee has been guilty of a want of ordinary prudence: <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin</span> at [81]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 The key differences between an account on a wilful default basis and an account on a common account basis pertain to the scope of the account and the trustee’s liability. As neatly set out in <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>(at [82]–[83]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">82 The scope of an account on a wilful default basis is wider than that of an account on the common account basis. As the Court of Appeal observed in [<span class="font-italic">Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa and others </span>[2005] SGCA 4] at [55], on a common account, the trustee need only account for what was actually received and for its disbursement and distribution. Conversely, on an account on a wilful default basis, the trustee has to account not only for what was actually received, but also for what he <span class="font-italic">might have</span> received had it not been for the default. The trustee’s potential liability on the common account is therefore limited to what has <span class="font-italic">actually </span>been received and paid out; while on the wilful default basis, the trustee’s exposure to liability is far greater, as he is liable not only for what he has <span class="font-italic">actually </span>received, but is also additionally liable for what he <span class="font-italic">might have </span>received.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">83 The trustee’s exposure to liability is also broadened on the wilful default basis because the trustee is subject to what has been called a ‘roving commission’ by the master taking the accounts … What this means is that the judge or registrar taking the account is entitled to look into all aspects of the trustee’s management of the trust property and the trustee will be required to explain any suspect transactions, even if the particular transaction has not been complained of by the beneficiary. </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[emphasis in original]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Where the beneficiary falsifies an entry in the account, he challenges or disputes the alleged use of his funds. The burden then falls on the trustee to prove that the disbursement was authorised: <span class="font-italic">Cheong Soh Chin </span>at [78]. Implicit in this is that the trustee also has to properly account for the use of the trust funds by showing that the funds were in fact used for the purpose stated in the account.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The plaintiff submits that the account in the present case should be taken on a wilful default basis. As will be seen later in this judgment, there are several instances of default on Dextra’s part. However, I do not think that whether the account is taken on a common basis or on a wilful default basis makes a difference in this case. There is no dispute as to the amount received by Dextra which has to be accounted for. The plaintiff has falsified several of the entries in the account provided by Dextra. The main dispute is whether the defendant has proved that the application of the plaintiff’s monies, in respect of each of the falsified entries, was authorised. I address the disputed transactions in turn. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">The Investment Swap </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The defendants claim that on 30 September 2013, a total amount of €13,315,749.42 of the plaintiff’s funds was applied towards the Investment Swap. The description of an “investment swap” used by the defendants is a misnomer. There was no swap of investments involved; the plaintiff was simply buying the investments from the previous investors. Pursuant to the Investment Swap, the plaintiff purportedly bought the following investments:

I agree with the plaintiff. The evidence supports his submission.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 First, the various statements provided by Dextra show that the Investment Swap did not take place on 30 September 2013. The entries that allegedly reflect the Investment Swap (see [46] and [48] above) did not appear in the August 2014 EUR Statement, the September 2014 EUR Statement and both of the November 2014 EUR Statements (together, “the 2014 EUR Statements”). These entries first appeared in the May 2018 EUR Statement and subsequently in the July 2018 EUR Statement (together, “the 2018 EUR Statements”). I find it incredulous that the 2014 EUR Statements did not reflect the Investment Swap, if indeed it did take place as alleged. As for the 2018 EUR Statements, I do not accept these statements as credible evidence of the Investment Swap; both these statements were prepared for the purposes of these proceedings.

Weber claimed that he was shocked by Athanasiou’s accusation during the meeting that he was stealing the plaintiff’s money and trying to cover it up.

</div> Clearly, Weber’s testimony did not explain why the payments were recorded as payments from the plaintiff’s account in the first place or how the alleged error in recording them as payments from the plaintiff’s account arose. The defendants did not call the accountant to testify. The fact that the accountant had ported the figures over merely confirmed that the payments continued to be reflected in Dextra’s account as payments from the plaintiff’s account until May 2018. In my view, the evidence shows that the defendants had wrongfully made use of the plaintiff’s monies on 3 May 2012 for the Villa K3 Loan, and the Investment Swap was concocted later in 2018 to explain, among other things, the use of the plaintiff’s monies for the Villa K3 Loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 Sixth, the plaintiff allegedly took over the Villa K6 Loan pursuant to the Investment Swap on 30 September 2013.

</div> The fact that all three loans (Villa K3 Loan, Villa K6 Loan and Belle Vue 1 Loan) were made using the plaintiff’s monies speaks volumes. It is not disputed that the use of the plaintiff’s monies for these loans was not specifically or expressly authorised.

When asked several times as to why he did not do so, Weber said that there was no need to because he did not consider the plaintiff’s remark about a potential arrest to be serious.

</div> Further, in their closing submissions, the defendants submit that the ILC Dubai-Far West Loans were uniquely protective because Far West was a start-up company and it is “common for start-up companies to require a substantial number of years to become profitable and, until then, there would be very little or no cash assets”.

</div> Therefore, until Far West started turning a profit, there would not be any money to seize. However, investing in investments that are illiquid or with low cash balances as a means of asset protection is very different from investing by using structures that protect the plaintiff’s identity. In any event, selecting investments for their illiquidity or their lack of cash is also inconsistent with Ritter’s evidence that the plaintiff was “very concerned that a prolonged lack of liquidity due to seizure of his assets would stymie his defence against the allegations, as well as his business interests”.

Authorising the use of asset protection structures for investments approved by the plaintiff is not the same thing as authorising the use of asset protection structures as a strategy pursuant to the 2012 Mandate under which Straits Invest would have the discretion to decide on the investments to be made so long as asset protection structures were used. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In fact, Ritter also testified in his AEIC as follows:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">19. [Weber] was concerned about discussing asset protection strategies over the telephone in case the telephone was being tapped. … </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">20. As such, [Dextra] did not take major steps to implement asset protection strategies in relation to the plaintiff’s funds for several months. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">24. Based on the [2012 Mandate] … and all the discussions that took place in November 2012, [Dextra] proceeded on the basis that [the plaintiff] would have expected steps to be taken to protect his assets. …</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">…</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">28. To reiterate, it was impossible at this juncture to confirm any proposed asset protection strategies with [the plaintiff] ... </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In my view, Ritter’s evidence shows that there was no approval given at the November 2012 meeting to invest in asset protection structures as a strategy pursuant to the 2012 Mandate.

I find that the evidence does not establish any such authorisation and that the Investment Swap was not authorised.

</div> However, this submission is not supported by Weber’s evidence; Weber did not give this as a reason for redeeming the assets under Jade AP1. This submission also contradicts Weber’s notion of asset protection structures.

Clearly, this was a decision taken by Weber in managing Dextra’s business and relationship with the plaintiff; this could not be justification for charging the abortive expenses to the plaintiff.

Although the amounts in dispute are described as “fiduciary fee” and “management fee”, it is not disputed that they are part of the fee charged pursuant to the 2012 Mandate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The plaintiff submits that Dextra is not entitled to any fees after 2012 because the 2012 Mandate provides that the fee shall be negotiated at the beginning of each business year. It is not disputed that there has been no such negotiation. I disagree with the plaintiff. Dextra clearly did not continue providing its services for free and the plaintiff undoubtedly did not expect Dextra to do so. The 2012 Mandate provides for automatic renewal at the end of each year. In my view, the logical conclusion is that the parties intended the 1% flat fee to continue if the 2012 Mandate was simply automatically renewed. In any event, I would infer from the parties’ conduct in continuing with their relationship that they did so on the same terms. Weber testified that Dextra only charged 0.5% “at all times” because the asset management involved was not complicated and the AUM was large.

</div>
</div> So far as the plaintiff was concerned, how the fee was to be split between Dextra and Straits Invest was a matter between them. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 In my view, the fee under the 2012 Mandate was intended to be computed based on the market value of the AUM. It is commonplace that the valuation of AUM is based on the market value of the assets. It does not make sense for the fee to continue to be based on the book value where the market value of the investment has dropped to below book value. However, Weber testified that he had used the book value instead of the market value of the assets in computing the fee.

</div>
</div>
</div> I agree with the plaintiff that Dextra was wrong to compute the fee based on the book value of the AUM; the fee should have been based on the market value of the AUM. However, there is no evidence of the market values of the AUM at the end of each of the quarters for which the fee was charged. It is also unclear whether it is still possible to obtain such information. It would be unfair to deprive Dextra of its fee completely. In my view, given the circumstances, leaving the fees as computed by Dextra based on book value would achieve an equitable result since Dextra is only charging at half the rate that it could have charged under the 2012 Mandate. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 Finally, the plaintiff submits that, in any event, Dextra should forfeit its fees because it has acted dishonestly as a fiduciary. If a fiduciary acts dishonestly, he will forfeit his right to fees paid or payable by the principal; however, a fiduciary’s fees may not be forfeited if the betrayal of trust has not been in respect of the entire subject matter of the fiduciary relationship and where forfeiture would be disproportionate and inequitable: <span class="font-italic">Snell’s Equity</span> (John McGhee gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2014) at para 7-062. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 Under the 2012 Mandate, Dextra and Straits Invest were entitled to a fee computed based on the market value of the AUM, which would include cash. Even if none of the plaintiff’s monies had been misapplied, Dextra was still entitled to its fee computed based on the amount of cash in the plaintiff’s account. In so far as the investments were concerned, Dextra had used the book value of the AUM to compute its fees. This means that Dextra did not earn more fees as a result of these investments than it would have if the investments had not been made. As for the payments for expenses and payments to third parties that were made without authorisation, these payments would have resulted in a reduction of the AUM and hence, Dextra’s fees. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 In the circumstances, I am of the view that Dextra should not forfeit its fees because it would be disproportionate and inequitable to require it to do so. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 As for the invoices for the disbursements, these comprise of various fees that appear to relate to perusing a Deed of Settlement and preparation of a Deed of Variation, amounting to a total of S$4,548.29 billed on 25 January 2012.

</div> Under the 2012 Mandate, such expenses are to be charged to the plaintiff at cost. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on Dextra, as the accounting party, to properly justify payments made with the plaintiff’s monies. All that Dextra has produced is its own invoice for phone charges from January to March 2013 with no details and no supporting invoices from the actual billing entity.

</div> However, this did not make sense. Dextra did not need to have segregated accounts with the bank. It just needed to account for the monies separately in its own books. Weber then said that he did not want to maintain separate ledgers because both the plaintiff and his account were “very complicated”.

</div> This was inconsistent with his earlier evidence that the management of the plaintiff’s account was not complicated (see [130] above). Dextra started maintaining separate ledgers for the GG Trust’s monies and the plaintiff’s monies after discussions with Athanasiou at the end of 2014.

</div> By 12 December 2014, Athanasiou had given all the necessary details to effect the transfer of the shares. However, Weber informed Athanasiou on 15 December 2014 that because WinTrust had full authority over all the Hellenic Bank shares, DBS was unable to execute the transfer of the shares, and that the plaintiff had to discuss the transfer of the Hellenic Bank shares directly with WinTrust. It is not clear why WinTrust would have had full authority over the Jade AP1 Hellenic Bank shares. In any event, the plaintiff did not follow up with the defendants on this issue thereafter.

In these proceedings, the defendants have not even disclosed the fund management agreement between Pearl Investment and Jade DCC. It is incumbent on Dextra, as the accounting party, to show that the plaintiff had agreed to Jade AP1 paying 1.5% of the AUM as a management fee to Pearl Investment. Dextra has failed to do so.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">182 I find that the payments for Pearl Investment’s management fees were unauthorised, but Dextra is entitled to include the AUM in Jade AP1 in computing its fees under the 2012 Mandate. I pause to note that the defendants had sought to charge the plaintiff a total management fee of 2% on the AUM in Jade AP1 through Carnelia (0.5%) and Pearl Investment (1.5%). This was double what the plaintiff had agreed to pay under the 2012 Mandate.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">183 As for the payments in respect of Weber and Chris, I accept the defendants’ evidence that under Brunei regulations, the Jade DCC structure was required to have a fund administrator, a fund manager and a fund custodian. Pearl Investment was simply a part of the Jade DCC structure, as required by law. I have found that the plaintiff is liable for the fees of the directors of Jade DCC in proportion to his investment in Jade AP1 (see [165] above). Similarly, I find that the plaintiff is also liable for the fees/expenses in respect of the directors of Pearl Investment, in proportion to his investment in Jade AP1. Jade Monega will have to bear the remaining fees. In my view, the €50,000 fee could not have been intended to cover recurring expenses that would necessarily be incurred by the Jade DCC structure, such as directors’ fees and audit fees.

Weber stated in a postscript to the e-mail that he had told the plaintiff’s lawyer that funds were running low. A handwritten note on a printout of the e-mail stated, “Call back Sunday, 1.9.”.

However, in my view, even if the plaintiff was aware of Weber’s interest in Far West, he did not give his informed consent to the conflicting interests because the loans to Far West were made without his express authorisation. I have rejected the defendants’ contention that they could rely on the 2012 Mandate for the requisite authorisation for these loans. I also agree with the plaintiff that even if Dextra could rely on the 2012 Mandate, there is nothing in the 2012 Mandate that authorised Dextra to act in conflict of the plaintiff’s and the defendants’ interests.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">225 In their closing submissions, the defendants pointed to the fact that the Calmness Trust had permitted self-dealing. The defendants argued that therefore, the plaintiff’s instruction to Weber and Ritter, at the November 2012 meeting, to do “whatever [they] need to do” to protect his assets from being seized, clearly included entering into structures controlled and managed by the defendants.

Villa K3 was owned (indirectly) by ILC Dubai but was controlled by Weber and Ritter. </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Weber claimed that the Villa K6 Loan was originally made by ILC Dubai’s clients. In fact, Weber used the plaintiff’s monies for the loan (see [62] above). Villa K6 was beneficially owned by Weber, his wife, Ritter and one Alamsyah Radjak.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">239 Third, Weber used funds held on trust by Dextra for the plaintiff to pay management fees and annual service fees to Pearl Investment and Carnelia without authorisation. At the material times, Pearl Investment was indirectly wholly-owned by Weber, and Weber held between 42.5% and 50% of the shares in Carnelia (see [6] above). As discussed earlier, Pearl Investment and Carnelia were not entitled to charge those fees. Weber would have known that. In fact, Weber admitted in his oral testimony that Dextra and Carnelia should not double bill (see [112] above).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">240 I find that Dextra was the alter ego of Weber and that therefore, he is personally liable to the same extent as Dextra.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Whether Weber is liable for dishonest assistance</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">241 The elements of a claim in dishonest assistance are (a) the existence of a trust, (b) a breach of that trust, (c) assistance rendered by the third party towards the breach, and (d) a finding that the assistance rendered by the third party was dishonest: <span class="font-italic">George Raymond Zage III and another v Ho Chi Kwong and another</span> [2010] 2 SLR 589 (“<span class="font-italic">Zage III</span>”)<span class="font-italic"> </span> at [20].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">242 Weber disputes only the second and fourth elements.

</div> </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">243 The second element is easily satisfied in this case. I have found that:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a)  Dextra applied the plaintiff’s funds towards various investments and payments for expenses and to third parties, and did so without authorisation;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) some of these investments breached the no-conflict rule; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) the sale of the assets in Jade AP1 was carried out without authorisation. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">All of the above constitute breaches of trust by Dextra. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">244 As for the fourth element, it is settled law that the requirement for dishonesty is satisfied if the defendant has such knowledge of the irregular shortcomings of the transaction that ordinary honest people would consider it to be a breach of standards of honest conduct if he failed to adequately query them: <span class="font-italic">Zage III</span> at [22]. The analysis involves a subjective determination of the defendant’s knowledge of the transaction and an objective determination as to whether his participation in the transaction with this knowledge offends ordinary standards: <span class="font-italic">M</span><span class="font-italic">+W Singapore Pte Ltd v Leow Tet Sin and another</span> [2015] 2 SLR 271 at [42]. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">245 In the present case, it cannot be denied that Weber was involved in all the decisions by Dextra. It cannot be disputed that he had the necessary subjective knowledge of the lack of proper authorisation or the breaches of duty. It also cannot be denied that his participation with this knowledge offends ordinary standards. Weber is therefore liable for dishonest assistance in relation to Dextra’s breaches of trust.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Summary of findings with respect to Weber</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">246 Weber is personally liable to the plaintiff to the same extent as Dextra because:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) he breached his fiduciary duties relating to the use of the plaintiff’s assets; and/or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) Dextra was his alter ego; and/or</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) he dishonestly assisted Dextra in its breaches of trust. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Sale of Villa K3 and Villa K6 </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">247 After the conclusion of the trial, the defendants’ lawyers informed me by way of a letter dated 25 June 2020 that Ruby (as the beneficial owner of Villa K3) and Villa K6 were sold in mid-November 2019, and that the defendants had repaid the sum of €3,554,558.44 being the total amount of the Villa K3 and Villa K6 Loans (see [46(b)] and [46(c)] above) to the plaintiff. The appended documents evidencing the sales were dated 15 November 2019, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, during the trial for this case.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">248 By way of a letter dated 7 July 2020 from his lawyers, the plaintiff denied having received any part of the sale proceeds. In their letter dated 25 June 2020, the defendants’ lawyers merely attached documents that showed that US$3,985,015.47 (amounting to €3,554,558.44) had been transferred from Dextra’s USD client account to Dextra’s EUR client account. This is by no means sufficient evidence that €3,554,558.44 has been repaid to the plaintiff. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">249 Be that as it may, neither the sale of Villa K3 (through the sale of Ruby) and Villa K6 nor the repayment of the Villa K3 and Villa K6 Loans to the plaintiff (assuming such repayment was in fact made) changes my conclusions that (a) the Investment Swap did not take place and that even if it did take place, it was not authorised, and (b) Dextra and Weber are liable pay the plaintiff €13,315,749.42 in relation to the Investment Swap. To the extent that the defendants have in fact repaid €3,554,558.44 to the plaintiff, the defendants’ liability should of course be reduced accordingly.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">250 Where I have found that the payments from the plaintiff’s account with Dextra were not authorised (see the summary of findings at [229] above), the plaintiff succeeds in falsifying the relevant entries in the account provided by Dextra.
