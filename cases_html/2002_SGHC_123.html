<p align="justify" xmlns="">A judgment creditor petitioned on 11 March 2002 for Dayang Construction

&amp; Engineering Pte Ltd (‘Dayang’) to be wound up under s 254(1)(e) of the

Companies Act (Cap 50) (the ‘Act’) on the ground that Dayang is unable to pay

its debts. The petitioner relied on the provisions of s 254(2)(a) of the Act as proof of

insolvency. The petitioner stated in the Amended Petition that judgment in the sum of

$200.090.30 together with pre-judgment interest and costs of $1,216.99 and $1,800

respectively were entered on 29 November 2001 against Dayang. On 5 December 2001, the

solicitors for the petitioner served on Dayang a letter demanding payment of the judgment

sum, interest and costs. At the adjourned hearing of the Amended Petition on 12 April

2002, counsel for Dayang sought an adjournment of four weeks as the company wished to

apply for Judicial Management. Goh Eng Soo (‘Goh’), a director of Dayang, filed

an affidavit to oppose the winding up, stating that legal proceedings against

Dayang’s two trade debtors, namely Tong Hup Seng Construction Co Pte Ltd (‘Tong

Hup Seng’) and Guobena Sdn Bhd (‘Guobena’) were intended, that the company

needed time to file for Judicial Mangement or apply for a Scheme of Arrangement and that

several creditors supported the adjournment. The petitioner and other creditors who

supported the winding-up opposed the adjournment. </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">        After hearing arguments and

on the evidence, the application for an adjournment was refused and an order was made for

Dayang to be wound up. On 18 April 2002, counsel for Dayang requested further arguments.

The judge permitted the company and those creditors opposing the Amended Petition another

opportunity to be heard. At the hearing, counsel for Dayang contended that the 5 December

letter was not a statutory demand within s 254(2)(a) of the Act, as it was defective in

two respects: firstly, it did not refer to a period of three weeks for payment but had

demanded repayment within five days; secondly, it contained no warning that the company

would be wound up if the company did not meet the demand. Consequently, the Amended

Petition must fail. </p>
<b xmlns="">
<p align="justify">Held</p></b>, maintaining the winding-up order: 

<p align="justify" xmlns="">(1) Having regard to the scheme, structure and language of s 254(2)(a),

there is clearly no merit whatsoever in either of the alleged defects raised by counsel

for Dayang. The letter of 5 December 2001 was an effective demand for the purposes of s

254(2)(a) (see  19).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(2) The three-week period is not a statutory requirement of the notice

of demand itself. It is relevant only in the context of a company failing or neglecting to

pay a debt within that period: <i>Re Simpson Devp Investment (HK) Co Ltd</i> [1999] 1 HKLRD 202 followed. It is also not a legal imposition of s 254(2)(a), express or implied,

that the creditor must indicate on the face of the demand the implications to the company

and the detriment it may suffer if it fails to comply, or the other two alternatives

available to it, namely securing or compounding. Ultimately, it is for the court to decide

whether a company should be wound up in the exercise of its discretion. The form in which

a statutory demand is expressed ought to be approached with the general discretion of the

court in mind and in this case, it was not suggested that Dayang was in fact misled by the

demand: <i>Helicarr Consolidated Ltd v Royal Insurance Fire &amp; General (NZ) Ltd</i>

[1993] 2 NZLR 46 followed (see  20 – 33). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(3) It was clear from the Amended Petition that the petitioner had an

undisputed judgment debt, it was due and Dayang had neglected to pay it. The court was

entitled to accept that as prima facie proof, and inference could be drawn, that the

company was unable to pay its debts within the meaning of s 254(2)(e): <i>Cornhill

Insurance Plc v Improvement Services Ltd And Others</i> [1986] 1 WLR 114 and <i>Taylors

Industrial Flooring Ltd v M &amp; H Plant Hire (Manchester) Ltd</i> [1990] BCLC 216

followed (see  35 and 36).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(4) The company was commercially insolvent. It had no available cash to

settle the judgment debt. There were no on-going projects in hand and no future contracts

in the pipeline. There was no reason to keep the company alive just to pursue a claim

against the two trade debtors when that could be left to liquidators who had consented to

act in the winding up of the company. In the hands of those liquidators, any possible

potential conflict of interest would be avoided, given that Goh’s brother and father

are directors of Tong Hup Seng (see  39 – 42).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(5) The initiatives to stop the winding-up for the reasons given were

viewed with some reservations. Dayang had made loans to its directors and directors’

fees were due from the company. With liquidators in place, the directors would face the

possibility of having to repay these loans and stand in the queue like the rest of the

unsecured creditors to recover any sum due to them from the company as directors (see 

44).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(6) The proposed Scheme of Arrangement exhibited in Goh’s second

affidavit was skimpy and unconvincing. It glaringly omitted to take into account the

substantial borrowings of the directors and solely focused on the trade debts of Tong Hup

Seng and Guobena. Creditors were left to wonder when the proposal would take effect and

the length of time they would have to wait for payment. The proposal was also dependent on

the company succeeding in any litigation against Tong Hup Seng and Guobena (see  47). </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(7) None of the creditors who opposed the grant of a winding-up order

filed affidavits stating reasons for their opposition. From what was said in court or seen

in letters exhibited by Dayang, they were all mere expressions of willingness to give the

company time to recover money from Tong Hup Seng and Guobena. That alone was not good

enough a reason for opposing the winding-up, even if it represented the wishes of the

majority (see  49).</p>
<p align="justify" xmlns="">(8) Accordingly, the order made on 12 April 2002 to wind up Dayang is

to stand. </p>

        Eastern Steel Services Pte Ltd, a judgment

creditor, petitioned on 11 March 2002 for Dayang Construction &amp; Engineering Pte Ltd

("Dayang") to be wound up under s 254(1)(e) of the Companies Act (Cap. 50) on

the ground that Dayang is unable to pay its debts. As proof of insolvency, the petitioner

<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">3.

        At the adjourned hearing of the Amended

Petition on 12 April 2002, Counsel for Dayang sought an adjournment of four weeks as the

company wished to apply for Judicial Management. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">4.

        Goh Eng Soo ("Goh"), a director of

Dayang, filed an affidavit on 4 April 2002 to oppose the winding-up. He admitted that the

company’s unsecured creditors were owed approximately $1.5 million. But the

company’s inability to pay its creditors was largely due to the company being owed

substantial sums of money by two main trade debtors, Tong Hup Seng Construction Co Pte Ltd

("Tong Hup Seng") and Guobena Sdn Bhd ("Guobena"). Legal proceedings

against both trade debtors were intended. Moreover, the company needed time to complete

and finalise the accounts and file for Judicial Management or apply for a Scheme of

Arrangement. Several creditors supported the adjournment. Goh claimed that creditors

representing 70% of the total value of the debts owed by the company opposed the

winding-up. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">5.

        The petitioner and other creditors who

supported the winding-up, opposed the adjournment. Ee Teck Siew ("Ee"), the

petitioner’s Finance Manager, in  5 and 11 of his affidavit filed on 11 April

2002 deposed that the petitioner had not received any payment or any concrete payment

proposal from Dayang; the petition was based on Dayang’s failure to pay on the

judgment. From notices received by the petitioner, creditors who supported the winding-up

amounted to $444,569.10 out of $771,342.63 of the updated list of parties wishing to

attend the hearing of the Amended Petition. This represented more than 50% in value of

those creditors wishing to attend. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">6.

        After hearing arguments and on the evidence

before me (and detailed below), the application for an adjournment was refused; an order

was made for Dayang to be wound up.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">7.

        On 18 April 2002, M/s Madhavan Partnership

acting in place of M/s Anthony Wee Jin requested further arguments. At that stage, the

winding-up order had not yet been perfected. I permitted the company and those creditors

opposing the Amended Petition, another opportunity to be heard. After hearing full

arguments, I maintained the winding-up order. I now publish the reasons for my decision.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">8.

        At the hearing on 30 April 2002, Counsel for

Dayang contended that there was no affidavit verifying the Amended Petition at the time

the order to wind-up the company was made. The Official Receiver, as it transpired, had

declined to act as liquidator and consent of private liquidators had to be sought. The

Petition was amended to cater to the Official Receiver’s decision. The other

amendment to the Petition was to correct an error in the registered address of Dayang. In

my view, a further affidavit was not required as there were no substantial changes to the

original Petition. The amendments were obvious and largely consequential.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">9.

        Counsel for Dayang also contended that the 5

December letter was not a statutory demand within s 254(2)(a) of the Act. The demand

letter was defective in two respects. Firstly, it did not refer to a period of three weeks

for payment. The notice period was five days. Secondly, it contained no warning that the

company would be wound up if the company did not meet the demand. Consequently, the

Amended Petition must fail.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">10.

        The objection raised questions concerning the

interpretation and operation of the Act relating to proof of the insolvency of the debtor

company in winding-up proceedings. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">11.

        There was no dispute that the letter dated 5

December 2001 demanding payment of a judgment debt was properly served on Dayang at its

registered office. The judgment, which was undisputed and was admittedly due, remained

unsatisfied. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">12.

        It was common ground that there is no form of

notice prescribed in the Companies Act or Companies Winding Up Rules.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">13.

        S 254(1) of the Companies Act (Cap.50) sets out

the various grounds under which a company may be wound up. In this case, the petitioner

relied on subsection (e), namely, a company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its

debts. The insolvency of a company may be established in different ways. A petitioning

creditor may or may not avail itself of the provisions of s 254(2) to prove the insolvency

of a company. S 254(2)(a) affords creditors who are owed more than $10,000 a simple and

convenient means of establishing ground (e). </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">14.

        On a plain and ordinary reading of s 254(2)(a),

two separate sets of statutory requirements are discernible; one for the creditor and the

other is for the debtor company to comply. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">15.

        The statutory requirements of sub-section (a)

that pertains to the creditor are: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a) the debt must be in excess of

    $10,000;</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b) the written demand to pay the

    sum due must be under the hand of the creditor or his authorised agent;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c ) the demand has to be served

    on the debtor company by leaving it at its registered address. </font></p>

        Unless the creditor has fully complied with the

requirements imposed by sub-section (a), the statutory demand would be defective. The

Court of Appeal in <i><b>Pac Asian Services Pte Ltd v European Asian Bank AG</b></i>
<a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=2963&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1989] 3 MLJ 385</a> held that in order to raise the presumption of insolvency, there must be

strict compliance with the statutory requirements. In that case, the statutory demand was

not served on the company’s registered address and that was found to be fatal. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">17.

        As for the debtor company, it has to be mindful

of the following statutory provisions under sub-section (a):</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a)    for three

    weeks after date of service of the demand letter, the debtor company fails to pay the sum

    due or to secure or compound it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">18.

        So, after service of the demand, the debtor

company has three weeks to pay or secure or compound the debt to the reasonable

satisfaction of the creditor. If the debtor company neglects to take any of those three

specified options, after expiry of that period of three weeks, a petition to wind up the

company may then be presented in reliance of the presumption of insolvency, which has

arisen. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">19.

        Having regard to the scheme, structure and

language of sub-section (a), there is clearly no merit whatsoever in either of the alleged

defects raised by Counsel for Dayang. In my view, the letter dated 5 December 2001 was an

effective demand for the purposes of s 254(2)(a).</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">20.

        The three-week period is not a statutory

requirement of the notice of demand itself. I agree with Le Pichon J who held in <i><b>Re

Simpson Devp Investment (HK) Co Ltd</b></i> [1999] 1HKLRD 202 at p 202 that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"There was nothing in

    s.178(a) that required there to be any reference to three weeks in the demand. The

    three-week period in s.178 (1)(a) was relevant only in the context of a company failing or

    neglecting to pay a debt that was not disputed on bona fide grounds within that

    period." </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">21.

        In <i><b>Re Simpson Devp Investment (HK) Co Ltd</b></i>,

the demand letter in question did not refer to the period of three weeks for payment. The

letter demanded payment within six days of all sums advanced by way of general banking

facilities. It went on to further state that failing repayment, proceedings would be

issued against the company for recovery of all sums outstanding, interest and legal costs

as well as possession of the properties mortgaged as security for the advances. The amount

outstanding and due to the petitioner, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was

in excess of HK$52 million. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">22.

        Like Dayang, the Hong Kong company opposed the

petition on the ground that there was no statutory demand within s178(1)(a) of the

Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32). Counsel submitted that the letter was "just a simple

demand letter". He argued that for the presumption of insolvency to arise under

s178(1)(a), there had to be a reference to a period of 21 days for payment. Le Pichon J

rejected his submissions. </font></p>

on 27 December 1988. It was argued that the statutory demand was bad as the company was

not given the statutory three weeks notice but instead a shorter time to comply with the

demand. Consequently, the presumption of insolvency did not arise. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">24.

        The Supreme Court held that the demand letter

with a shorter notice period than 21 days was not bad or invalid. At p 313 of the report:</font></p>

    before the presumption of inability to pay debts arises under the section and is not a

    requirement relating to the notice of demand itself."</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25.

        It is also not a statutory requirement of

sub-section (a) to spell out or indicate to the recipient in the demand letter the two

other specified options, other than payment: <i><b>Helicarr Consolidated Ltd v Royal

Insurance Fire &amp; General (NZ) Ltd</b> </i>[1993] 2NZLR 46. To that extent, the

sub-section does not require any explicit reference in the demand to the consequence the

sub-section imposes or to warn the company of the creditor’s intention of instituting

winding-up proceedings if satisfaction was not given. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">26.

        If there is some other unexpressed requirement

with which a demand must comply in order to fall within the subsection, it can only arise

by implication as a matter of statutory construction. Having regard to accepted guides to

legislative intention, no proper implication within the express words of subsection (a)

can arise to introduce in the demand letter a warning of winding–up proceedings. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">27.

        Counsel for Dayang relied on <i><b>Sri Hartamas

Court held:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">

        I declined to follow <i><b>Sri Hartamas</b></i>

on this point. With respect, there is no legal basis for that view. It is not a legal

imposition of s 254(2)(a), express or implied, that the creditor must indicate on the face

Coleridge Finance Co Ltd</b></i> [1969] NZLR 794. North P recounted and accepted

counsel’s reasoning there that since the object of the demand was to warn the debtor

that a winding–up petition may be presented, it did not matter whether or not the

demand was signed by or on behalf of the creditor. The decision in <i><b>Bateman

Television</b></i> was read as suggesting that the statutory demand must warn the debtor

company that a failure may lead to winding-up proceedings. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">30.

        That suggestion was commented upon and, rightly

so, not adopted by the Wellington Court of Appeal in <i><b>Helicarr Consolidated Ltd v

Royal Insurance Fire &amp; General (NZ) Ltd</b></i> [1993] 2NZLR 46. It is plain from the

observations of the Wellington Court of Appeal, that there is no legal requirement that a

statutory demand must contain a warning. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">31.

        The Wellington Court of Appeal held at p 46:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">" 1. Section 218(a) of the

    Companies Act 1955, sets out one of three circumstances in which a company is deemed to be

    sum due and then the company must have neglected for three weeks after service to pay the

    sum or to secure or compound it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor. The

    section does not require that the notice should do more than demand payment and there is

    no implied requirement that the notice inform the company of the other two alternatives

    available to it, namely securing or compounding. …"</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">32.

        McKay J at p 49 observed:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"The section was considered

    by this Court in <i>Bateman Television Ltd And Another</i> <i>v Colderidge Finance Co Ltd</i>,

    an agent. In his judgment North P said at p 803:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">‘As Mr. Fox pointed out,

<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This statement might suggest that

    debtor that failure to comply may lead to a petition for winding up. <b>The section does

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="right" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[emphasis added]</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">33.

        I am in complete agreement with McKay J’s

observations. The form in which a statutory demand is expressed ought to be approached

with the general discretion of the Court in mind. Ultimately, it is for the Court to

determine whether a company should be wound up in the exercise of its discretion. In this

case, it was not suggested at all that Dayang was in fact misled by the December demand. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">34.

        I hasten to add that unlike in Singapore, a

form of statutory notice is prescribed by English legislation. The corresponding provision

to s 254(2)(a) is s 123(1)(a) of the Insolvency Act 1986. The sub-section expressly states

that the written demand is to be in a form prescribed. The form prescribed in the

Insolvency Rules draws the debtor’s attention to 21 days to deal with the demand or a

winding-up order could be made in respect of the company. That is also the case in

Australia. Since 23 June 1993, the statutory notice is in a form prescribed. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">35.

        I would add that in the particular

circumstances of this case, from the matters set out in the Amended Petition and the two

affidavits that were filed before the hearing on 12 April 2002, I was satisfied that the

company was unable to pay its debts. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">36.

        It was clear from the Amended Petition that the

petitioner had an undisputed judgment debt, it was due and Dayang had neglected to pay it.

I am entitled to accept that as prima facie proof, and inference could be drawn, that the

company was unable to pay its debts within s 254(1)(e): <i><b>Cornhill Insurance Plc v

Improvement Services Ltd And Others</b></i> [1986] 1WLR 114; <i><b>Taylors Industrial

Flooring Ltd v M &amp; H Plant Hire (Manchester) Ltd</b> </i>[1990] BCLC 216. </font></p>

        Le Pichon J in <i><b>Re Simpson Devp Investment

<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"Proof by a creditor that

    the debt has not been paid within a reasonable time is prima facie evidence that the

    company is insolvent where the company has no bona fide basis on which to dispute the debt

    in question. See Re Globe New Pattern Iron and Steel Co (1875) LR 20 Eq 337. Therefore

    irrespective of whether the letter constitutes a statutory demand, it is open to the court

    to infer that the company is unable to pay its debts with s. 177(1)(d) where it was under

    an undisputed obligation to pay a specific sum and failed to do so. See Re United Strength

    Ltd [1992] 1 HKC 386 and Halsbury’s Laws of Hong Kong Vol6, para. 95.0978…"

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">38.

        The explanation offered for Dayang’s

failure to pay on the judgment was cash flow constraints. The reason given by the Company

to stave off the winding -up was for more time to pursue two trade debtors, Tong Hup Seng

and Guobena who each owed the company $1,616,947.58 and $267,441.28 respectively. If

Dayang was given this opportunity, the unsecured creditors stood a chance of full recovery

of all debts owed to them by the company. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">39.

        There were no on-going projects in hand and no

future contracts in the pipeline. In a letter dated 19 January 2002 to a prospective

client, Goh admitted the company had no working capital and therefore, it could not tender

for new projects. In other words, the company was unable to sustain business activity in

its situation. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">40.

        The company was commercially insolvent. It had

no available cash to settle the judgment debt. The Privy Council in <i><b>Malayan Plant

(Pte) Ltd v Moscow Narodny Bank Ltd</b></i> [1980] 2MLJ 53 at 54 approved a passage in

Buckley on Companies Act dealing with commercial insolvency, that is, of the company being

unable to meet current demands upon it. The passage reads:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"In such a case it is

    useless to say that if its assets are realized there will be ample to pay twenty shillings

    in the pound: This is not the test. A company may be at the same time insolvent and

    wealthy. It may have wealth locked up in investments not presently realisable; but

    although this be so, yet if it has not assets available to meet its current liabilities it

    is commercially insolvent and may be wound up." </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">41.

        Ee, in his affidavit filed on 11 April 2002,

explained that the petitioner took out garnishee proceedings in December 2001 to enforce

the judgment but was not successful. It was advised by M/s Rajah &amp; Tann representing

the garnishee, Tong Hup Seng, that there was no money due to Dayang. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">42.

        Goh explained that Dayang had not sued Tong Hup

Seng as the company’s cause of action had only arisen of late. Be that as it may, I

saw no reason to keep the company alive just to pursue a claim against Guobena and Tong

Hup Seng when that could be left to liquidators who had consented to act in the winding-up

of the company. In the hands of those liquidators, any possible potential conflict of

interest would be avoided. Dayang’s Counsel had earlier informed the Court that

Goh’s brother is a director of Tong Hup Seng. Counsel during further arguments

confirmed once again on 28 May 2002 that Goh’s brother and father are directors of

Tong Hup Seng. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">43.

        From the audited accounts for the financial

year ended 31 December 1999, amounts owing by directors stood at $332,185. Loans to

directors increased significantly in the following financial year to $962,186. The

unaudited balance sheet for the financial year ended 31 December 2001, exhibited in

Goh’s first affidavit, showed the directors’ borrowings reduced to $320,728.67.

That appeared to contradict the management accounts for the same period exhibited in

Goh’s second affidavit. The management accounts for the financial year ending 31

December 2001 revealed that the directors of the company owed $846,585.33 to the company

whilst directors’ fees due from the company were $400,000.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">44.

        In year 2001, when the company was experiencing

serious cash flow difficulties, directors’ borrowings were as high as $846,585.33. I

viewed the initiatives to stop the winding-up for the reasons given with some

reservations. With liquidators in place, the directors would face the possibility of

having to repay these loans and stand in the queue like the rest of the unsecured

creditors to recover any sum due to them from the company as directors. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">45.

        Goh in  9 of his second affidavit deposed: </font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">" It is respectfully stated

    that the fact that the Company and its directors are prepared to go to every length to

    save itself demonstrates the genuine manner in which the Company will strive to maintain

    and achieve its obligations." </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">46.

        I was not persuaded by that declaration when

the obvious thing for the directors to do, if they sincerely and genuinely wanted to

ensure the company’s survival, is repay their own substantial borrowings to the

company. There was never any hint of an offer or pledge to repay the loans. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">47.

        The proposed Scheme of Arrangement exhibited in

Goh’s second affidavit was skimpy and unconvincing. It glaringly omitted to take into

account the substantial borrowings of the directors and solely focused on the trade debts

of Tong Hup and Seng Guobena. Creditors were left to wonder when the proposal would take

effect and the length of time they would have to wait for payment. The proposal was

dependent on the company succeeding in any litigation against Tong Hup Seng and Guobena.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">48.

        D’Cotta J in <i><b>Wei Giap Construction

Co (Pte) Ltd v Intraco Ltd</b></i> [1979] 2MLJ 4 held that:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">"(2) in exercising its

    discretion, the court will have regard for the wishes of the majority of the creditors if

    they have good reason for opposing the petition.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(3) in the exercise of its

    discretion it is the duty of the court to weigh all the relevant matters and decide

    whether the <i>prima facie</i> right of the petitioning creditors to an order should give

    way to the wishes of some creditors who assign no reason for their opposition or who

    merely state that in their view the appellants might be in a position to pay their debts

    if allowed to continue to operate." </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">49.

        None of the creditors who opposed the grant of

a winding-up order filed affidavits stating reasons for their opposition. From what was

said in Court or seen in letters exhibited by Dayang, they were all mere expressions of

willingness (stemmed probably from a promise of full satisfaction of their debts or

claims) to give the company time to recover money from Tong Hup Seng and Guobena. That

alone, in my view, was not good enough a reason for opposing the winding-up, even if it

represented the wishes of the majority.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">50.

        Obviously, the directors recognised and

acknowledged the company’s insolvency. That is to be inferred from their desire to

place the company under Judicial Management or to apply for a Scheme of Arrangement. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">51.

        After seeing the second affidavit of Goh and

hearing further arguments, I was more convinced than ever that the company was

commercially insolvent and unable to pay its debts.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""> </p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">52.

        Accordingly, I ruled that the order made on 12

April 2002 to wind-up Dayang is to stand. I also awarded the petitioner costs (to be

treated as winding-up costs) fixed at $4,500.</font></p>
