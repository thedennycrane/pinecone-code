        Chan Sek Keong CJ (delivering the judgment of the
                court):</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       These two appeals stem from the elaborate fraud
                    perpetrated over a period of more than four years by Chia Teck Leng
                    (“Chia”), the second respondent in Civil Appeal No 121 of
                    2009 (“CA 121/2009”). They tell a cautionary tale of how two
                    foreign banks, in their eagerness to secure a banking relationship with Asia
                    Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“APBS”), a prominent local
                    blue-chip company, failed to exercise due diligence and extended substantial
                    credit facilities to APBS relying merely (and almost entirely) on
                    representations made by Chia, APBS’s finance manager at the material time.
                    Those representations were subsequently found to be fraudulent.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The appellant in CA 121/2009 is
                    Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch (“SEB”),
                    while the appellant in Civil Appeal No 122 of 2009
                    (“CA 122/2009”) is Bayerische Hypo-Und Vereinsbank
                    Aktiengesellschaft (“HVB”). APBS is the first respondent in
                    CA 121/2009 and the sole respondent in CA 122/2009. Chia did not play
                    any active part in either the proceedings in the court below or the proceedings
                    before this court, having been convicted of 14 charges of (<em>inter alia</em>) cheating (with 32 other charges taken into
                    consideration) and sentenced to 42 years’ imprisonment (see <em>Public Prosecutor v Chia Teck Leng</em> [2004] SGHC 68
                        (“<em>PP v Chia Teck
                Leng</em>”)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       APBS is the Singapore subsidiary of Asia Pacific
                    Breweries Limited (“APBL”), the holding company of a group of
                    companies engaged in the production and distribution of beer and other alcoholic
                    beverages throughout the region (“the APBL group of companies”).
                    APBL was set up as a joint venture between Heineken NV of the Netherlands
                    (“Heineken”) and Fraser and Neave Limited
                    (“F&amp;N”), a Singapore company. Both APBS and F&amp;N are
                    well-known blue-chip companies in the region, while Heineken is a Dutch global
                    company that is familiar to all European banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Chia was an inveterate gambler and had been
                    visiting casinos since 1994. APBS was not aware of Chia’s gambling history
                    when it employed him as its finance manager in January 1999. Using his position
                    as APBS’s finance manager, Chia devised and successfully implemented an
                    ingenious scheme to cheat four foreign banks (including SEB and HVB, the
                    appellants in the present appeals (“the Appellants”)) of about
                    S$117.1m (of which about S$34.8m has been recovered). In the present
                    proceedings, SEB is seeking to recover from APBS a sum of either
                    US$26,559,371.94 or S$29,468,723.30, while HVB is seeking to recover a sum of
                    US$32,002,332.85. The position of the Appellants is that they lent these sums to
                    APBS, which had authorised Chia to borrow the same. The position of APBS, in
                    contrast, is that Chia had no authority whatsoever to borrow money on its
                    behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       Chia’s wily deception of the Appellants
                    for more than four years was facilitated by a combination of APBS’s
                    failure of oversight over Chia’s activities and the gullibility and/or
                    trusting blindness of the Appellants’ officers. The evidence at the trial
                    showed that Chia was able to carry on his fraudulent activities for such a long
                    time without being detected by his superiors because they left him to run
                    APBS’s Finance and Accounting Department (“APBS Finance”)
                    without any supervision. We should point out at this juncture that although
                    there is, in our view, no doubt that the senior management of APBS was derelict
                    in its corporate governance duties, that is not the focus of the present
                    appeals. The question before us is instead who, as between the Appellants and
                    APBS, should bear the losses occasioned by Chia’s fraud. This involves an
                    examination of four areas of law, namely, agency, vicarious liability,
                    negligence and restitution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       The trial in the court below lasted for more
                    than 47 days. It involved 11 witnesses of fact and seven expert witnesses who
                    testified on banking practice and procedure, internal corporate and financial
                    controls, pre-employment screening and computation of accounts. The trial judge
                    (“the Judge”) reserved judgment at the end of the trial, and
                    eventually dismissed the claims of both the Appellants, except for a sum of
                    S$347,671.23 in respect of SEB’s restitutionary claim. Dissatisfied with
                    that outcome, the Appellants have appealed against the whole of the
                    Judge’s decision. The Judge’s factual and legal evaluation, findings
                    and analysis are set out in a comprehensive 219-page judgment accompanied by a
                    further ten-page appendix on the material facts (jointly reported in <em>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ), Singapore Branch v Asia
                        Pacific Breweries (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and another
                        suit</em> [2009] 4 SLR(R) 788 (“the HC Judgment”)).
                    We acknowledge the assistance which the Judge’s carefully-reasoned
                    judgment has given us in our examination of the legal issues raised in the
                    present appeals.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Appointment of Chia as APBS’s finance manager</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       Chia is an accountant by training who worked in
                    various finance-related positions for both international and local companies
                    from 1983 to 1999 prior to joining APBS in January 1999. He moved from being a
                    tax assistant to being a finance manager within the short span of a decade, and
                    was described by the judge at his criminal trial as a “financial
                    wizard” (see <em>PP v Chia Teck Leng</em> at
                        [33]). Unfortunately, he was also a
                    compulsive gambler. By 1998, Chia had accumulated gambling debts exceeding S$1m.
                    It was in those circumstances that Chia applied for the post of Finance Manager
                    of APBS on 25 November 1998. After several rounds of interviews, Chia was
                    offered the job on 23 December 1998 and was to officially start work on
                    20 January 1999. His new job gave him the opportunity to plan how to
                    defraud various banks (all of which, it may be noted, were foreign banks) by
                    relying on APBS’s corporate standing and on his title of Finance Manager.
                    The title “Finance Manager” is not an established title in the
                    corporate sector, unlike corporate titles like “Finance Director”,
                    “Chief Financial Officer”, “Managing Director”,
                    “Chief Executive Officer”, “Chairman of the Board of
                    Directors”, “President” or “Director”. In the
                    present case, the Appellants were aware that Chia was not a director of APBS,
                    but only a finance manager, a position which <em>prima
                        facie</em> connotes that the office-holder carries out managerial,
                    rather than executive, functions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Functions of Chia as APBS’s finance manager</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       As Finance Manager of APBS, Chia had two broad
                    functions: operational and financial. Operationally, he reported directly to the
                    general manager of APBS, a position held by Mr Ton Blum
                    (“Mr Blum”) until November 1999 and, thereafter, by
                    Dr Les Buckley. Chia had two broad areas of operational responsibilities in
                    APBS. First, he was Head of APBS Finance, which had a team of 22 employees
                    engaged in the accounting, costing, budgeting, bookkeeping and cash management
                    activities of APBS. In this regard, Chia, as Finance Manager, was expected to:
                    (a) ensure that there were adequate controls within APBS Finance to comply
                    with APBS’s financial policies; and (b) manage APBS’s
                    relationships with financial institutions. Second, Chia was in charge of the
                    Management Information Systems and Purchasing Department of APBS, which had 11
                    employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> his
                    financial functions, Chia reported to APBL’s group finance director.
                    Chia’s duties and functions as Finance Manager were set out in two
                    internal documents of APBS, namely: (a) a document entitled
                    “Position Description” (“the Position Description”);
                    and (b) a document entitled “Group Treasury Policy”
                    (“the GTP”), which was first implemented in 1998 and subsequently
                    updated in 2000. Under the GTP, responsibility for borrowing funds for and
                    investing surplus funds of APBS was distributed among the following entities:
                    (a) F&amp;N’s Group Treasury Department (“F&amp;N Group
                    Treasury”), which oversaw all treasury activities within the APBL group
                    of companies; (b) APBL’s Group Finance Department (“APBL Group
                    Finance”); and (c) APBS Finance.</p>

<p class="Judg-1">It is pertinent to note that cl 3.4.1 of the GTP did not give
                    APBS’s finance manager any authority to source for credit facilities, but
                    only conferred on him authority to forward (with the approval of APBS’s
                    general manager) any request for credit facilities to F&amp;N Group Treasury
                    (via APBL Group Finance) for review. If the request was found to be justified,
                    F&amp;N Group Treasury would then source for and negotiate the credit facilities
                    sought by APBS (see cl 3.4.2 of the GTP). As can be seen, the raising of
                    credit facilities by the APBL group of companies was subject to an elaborate
                    process.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     It should also be noted at the outset that
                    when the Appellants’ officers met Chia to discuss the credit facilities
                    ostensibly sought by APBS, they only knew him as the finance manager of APBS.
                    They had no knowledge of the Position Description and the GTP as those were
                    internal documents of APBS. Their knowledge of Chia’s functions and
                    responsibilities was based on what Chia told them. The Appellants were misled
                    into granting credit facilities to APBS by the fraudulent representations of
                    Chia as to (in essence) his authority as APBS’s finance manager. Chia then
                    misappropriated the proceeds of the credit facilities for his own
                    purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     We shall now outline the facts concerning and
                    the Judge’s findings on the manner in which Chia defrauded the
                    Appellants.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Chia’s dealings with SEB</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">How Chia obtained credit facilities from SEB</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   The overdraft facility and the foreign exchange
                facility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     Before Chia was due to start work officially
                    with APBS on 20 January 1999, he contacted Mr Eddie Amin
                    (“Amin”), Head of Sales in SEB’s Trading and Capital Markets
                    Department, in late December 1998. Chia knew Amin from their university days and
                    also professionally. Chia told Amin that he had just joined APBS as Finance
                    Manager, and indicated that he was keen for APBS to start a banking relationship
                    with SEB. During a lunch meeting on 28 December 1998, Chia briefly
                    explained his work as Finance Manager, and indicated that APBS urgently required
                    a three-month clean overdraft line of about S$500,000 to address its cash-flow
                    mismatches as well as foreign exchange needs. Chia explained that although
                    APBS’s treasury functions were then carried out by F&amp;N Group Treasury,
                    he had plans to take back these functions for APBS; he would also place a large
                    portion of APBS’s surplus funds on fixed deposit with SEB. In other words,
                    Chia in effect told Amin that when he (Chia) became APBS’s finance
                    manager, he would take back from F&amp;N Group Treasury APBS’s borrowing
                    function, including (by implication) the authority to take out loans. Chia
                    stated in his affidavit (which was admitted in evidence) that he made those
                    false statements to discourage Amin from independently approaching F&amp;N Group
                    Treasury directly. Amin did not at this point ask for any supporting documents
                    to verify what Chia told him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     After the lunch meeting between Amin and Chia
                    on 28 December 1998, SEB’s officers made some preliminary checks on
                    the corporate structure of APBS based on public documents obtained from the
                    Registry of Companies and Businesses (“the RCB”), such as
                    APBL’s annual report for 1997 and extracts of APBS’s company forms.
                    Those documents indicated that the general manager of APBS at that time was
                    Mr Blum, and set out the signatures of APBS’s directors, including
                    those of Mr Michael Fam and Mr Koh Poh Tiong
                    (“Mr Koh”). Chia and Amin (together with the latter’s
                    colleague, Ms Sharon Chow (“Ms Chow”)) met again at
                    Chia’s office on 22 January 1999. By then, Chia had officially
                    started work at APBS. To impress Amin and Ms Chow, Chia brought them to an
                    in-house pub at the office premises of APBS called “The Tavern”,
                    where Tiger Beer, APBS’s flagship beer, was served. At that meeting, Amin
                    handed to Chia SEB’s standard account opening documents to complete, and
                    said that he would seek SEB’s approval for a S$500,000 overdraft
                    (“the OD Facility”) and a US$5m foreign exchange facility
                    (“the FX Facility”) to be extended to APBS as requested by Chia.
                    Those credit facilities were approved by SEB on 1 February
                1999.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     On 2 February 1999, Amin handed to Chia
                    two letters of offer (“the Letters of Offer”), one relating to the
                    OD Facility and the other, to the FX Facility. He briefly explained the terms of
                    the Letters of Offer and told Chia that approval from APBS’s board of
                    directors (“the APBS Board”) would be required. The next day, Chia
                    returned to Amin SEB’s account opening forms duly completed, together with
                    the following documents bearing APBS’s letterhead: (a) a letter of
                    indemnity dated 25 January 1999; (b) a “Consent for Disclosure
                    of Information” dated 25 January 1999; and (c) a
                    “Certified Extract of Director[s’] resolution passed on
                    25th January 1999” authorising SEB to open accounts in APBS’s
                    name “in any currencies for transactions relating to
                        deposits”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> as well as authorising Chia to
                    operate those accounts (“the 25 January 1999 APBS Board
                    resolution”). Also handed over to Amin were the following APBS corporate
                    documents stamped with the words “Certified True Copy” and
                    initialled by Chia: (a) the memorandum and articles of association;
                    (b) the “Certificate of Incorporation of Private Company”;
                    (c) the “Certificate of Incorporation on Change of Name of
                    Company”; and (d) Form 49 (the “Return giving
                    Particulars in Register of Directors, Managers, Secretaries and Auditors and
                    Changes of Particulars”). The speed with which Chia procured the APBS
                    Board’s approval of the OD Facility and the FX Facility did not arouse any
                    suspicion in Amin. As it turned out, the signatures of the directors, <em>viz</em>, Mr Blum and Mr Koh, on (<em>inter alia</em>) the completed SEB account opening forms and
                    the 25 January 1999 APBS Board resolution were forgeries.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     In connection with the OD Facility and the FX
                    Facility, Chia opened two accounts with SEB in APBS’s name, <em>viz</em>, a S$ account (“the SEB S$ Account”)
                    and a US$ account (“the SEB US$ Account”). Both of those accounts
                    (“the SEB Accounts”), although opened and maintained in
                    APBS’s name, were operated solely by Chia, who was also the sole signatory
                    for both accounts. After SEB opened the SEB Accounts, Ms Chow discovered
                    that the 25 January 1999 APBS Board resolution had approved only the
                    opening of “accounts in any currencies for transactions <em>relating to deposits</em>”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>
                    [emphasis added], and not the obtaining of credit facilities. On 3 February
                    1999, she asked Chia to obtain a fresh resolution of the APBS Board (referred to
                    hereafter as an “APBS Board resolution” for convenience) affirming
                    APBS’s acceptance of the credit facilities set out in the Letters of Offer
                        (<em>ie</em>, the OD Facility and the FX Facility). The
                    next day (4 February 1999), Chia delivered to SEB a document entitled
                    “Certified Extract of Board Resolution Passed On 3 February,
                    1999”, which (<em>inter alia</em>) purportedly set
                    out APBS’s acceptance of the aforesaid credit facilities. As was the case
                    with Amin, the speed with which Chia obtained the new APBS Board resolution
                    purportedly passed on 3 February 1999 did not raise any suspicion in
                    Ms Chow. That new APBS Board resolution was also forged.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     Nine months later, on or about 3 November
                    1999, Chia requested Amin to increase the OD Facility and the FX Facility to
                    S$3m and US$10m respectively. The increase in the OD Facility was purportedly to
                    meet APBS’s short-term working capital needs, while the increase in the FX
                    Facility was to enable APBS to carry out larger foreign exchange transactions.
                    Chia also wanted the increases approved by 11 November 1999. On the stated
                    date, Amin met Chia in the latter’s office and delivered to Chia
                    SEB’s letter offering APBS an increased overdraft line of S$3m as
                    requested by Chia (SEB’s letter did not mention Chia’s request for
                    an increase of the FX Facility to US$10m,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_5" id="Ftn_5_1"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> but it appears from
                    para 9 of SEB’s second amended statement of claim filed on
                    18 March 2008 that that request was acceded to as well (see also [13] of the HC Judgment in this regard)). The
                    next day (12 November 1999), Chia handed to Amin another forged APBS Board
                    resolution headed “Certified Extract of Board Resolution Passed On
                    12 November 1999”, which purported to approve the increase in the OD
                    Facility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   The money market facility</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Approximately seven months years later, in
                    June 2000, Chia asked SEB for a new short-term facility of US$8m to finance the
                    acquisition of equipment for APBS’s subsidiaries in Cambodia and Vietnam.
                    Amin asked for supporting documents, such as a business plan projecting the
                    anticipated cash flow. Chia managed to satisfy Amin’s request with some
                    information given orally. By way of a letter dated 26 June 2000
                    (“the MM Facility Letter”), SEB offered APBS a US$8m revolving
                    money market facility (“the MM Facility”). Chia signed the MM
                    Facility Letter (supposedly on APBS’s behalf) and delivered to SEB a
                    forged “Certified Extract of Board Resolution Passed On 27 June
                    2000” which purported to approve the MM Facility.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Subsequently, the MM Facility was increased on
                    two occasions at Chia’s request. The first instance was on or about
                    6 November 2000, when the MM Facility was increased to US$10m. The reason
                    provided by Chia for requiring the increase was the financing of a joint venture
                    project in Cambodia and Vietnam. When Chia was asked why APBS, a cash-rich
                    company, did not want to use its own cash reserves to finance the project, Chia
                    fobbed SEB off with the explanation that APBS wished to use the interest rate
                    for the MM Facility as a benchmark interest rate for borrowers that APBS would
                    be lending money to. The second increase was in May 2002. Initially, Chia
                    requested for the MM Facility to be increased to US$15m, representing that APBS
                    needed the increase to cover working capital requirements for its factory in
                    Cambodia. At the same time, Chia also asked for a medium-term loan of US$20m to
                    finance improvements to be made to APBS’s bottling line in Singapore. As
                    before, Chia rebuffed Amin’s request for written verification of those
                    projects. SEB agreed to increase the MM Facility to US$15m on 19 June 2002,
                    but did not approve the request for a US$20m medium-term loan. Chia then asked
                    if SEB would consider increasing the MM Facility to US$25m instead, to which SEB
                    readily agreed. On 24 July 2002, SEB delivered to Chia a letter offering to
                    increase the MM Facility to US$25m, which offer was accepted by Chia (again
                    purportedly on APBS’s behalf) on 6 August 2002. Consistent with his
                        <em>modus operandi</em> in relation to the OD Facility
                    and the FX Facility, Chia provided SEB with forged APBS Board resolutions
                    approving the MM Facility and the subsequent increases in that
                facility.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Unusual features of SEB’s dealings with Chia</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(1)   Chia was SEB’s sole point of contact</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     SEB’s officers dealt with Chia alone
                    during the entire duration of the banking relationship which they believed SEB
                    had with APBS, <em>viz</em>, the period from early 1999 to
                    September 2003. They never met or communicated with the company secretary,
                    directors or any other officer of APBS senior to Chia. Although SEB’s
                    officers did ask to be introduced to APBS’s senior management, they never
                    asked themselves why Chia kept putting them off, insisting that he alone would
                    deal with them and that certain communications between SEB and APBS should be
                    directed to him alone.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(2)   SEB’s verification of the documents provided by
                Chia</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     As per the practice of every bank, SEB had its
                    own due diligence procedures to follow before it could grant APBS the credit
                    facilities requested by Chia (<em>ie</em>, the OD Facility,
                    the FX Facility and the MM Facility (collectively, “the SEB
                    Facilities”)). At the trial, Mr Gerard Lee (“Lee”),
                    Head of SEB’s Credits and Credit Analysis and Administration Department
                    (“Credits”), testified on SEB’s internal procedures in this
                    regard. Lee was an experienced officer, having been Head of SEB’s
                    Counterparty Risk Management Department (“CRM”) from November 1998
                    to March 2000, Manager of Credits from February 2001 to the end of June 2001
                    and, thereafter, Head of Credits. His evidence was that SEB had complied with
                    all its internal policies in extending the SEB Facilities to APBS. The Judge
                    found that most of the checks described by Lee were designed primarily to
                    address default risks, and not fraud risks. Further, Lee’s evidence showed
                    that there had merely been paper compliance, and not true compliance, with
                    SEB’s verification procedures. Lee himself had not carried out any
                    verification. Ms Chow, his subordinate, had performed most of the due
                    diligence checks in relation to the SEB Facilities, but not diligently.
                    Furthermore, Ms Chow was not called to testify on what she had actually
                    done. Similarly, Ms Karen Chan, the officer who had handled the
                    verification checks preceding the grant of the MM Facility, was also not called
                    to give evidence. In short, SEB adduced no credible evidence that any of its
                    officers had complied with its own verification procedures or had checked the
                    authenticity of any of the corporate documents handed over by
                Chia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In this regard, we should also draw attention
                    to the “Checklist for Opening of Accounts: Local Incorporated Non-Bank
                    Companies” issued by SEB’s CRM. That checklist stated that
                    “[a]ll copies of documents (including translations) [were] to be
                    certified true by Company Secretary, Director, Notary Public, Solicitor or
                    Originals sighted by Officer of [SEB]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_6" id="Ftn_6_1"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In the case of a new customer,
                    SEB had no prescribed procedure for checking the authenticity of the signature
                    of the customer’s “Company Secretary, Director, Notary Public
                    … [or] Solicitor”,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_7" id="Ftn_7_1"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> except by
                    visually comparing the signature of the person concerned as shown on documents
                    provided by the customer with the corresponding signature on documents filed in
                    the RCB. SEB’s officers did not ask for face-to-face verification because,
                    in their view, that could be counter-productive since it could antagonise the
                    person dealing with them.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-4">(3)   Interaction between SEB’s officers and APBS’s
                officers</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     SEB thought it had a normal banking
                    relationship with APBS as it regularly sent credit advices, debit advices,
                    monthly advices and bank statements to APBS. However, those communications were
                    sent to the division headed by Chia, who merely instructed his staff to pass the
                    communications to him. SEB also sent letters to APBS’s official address
                    until 19 May 2003, but was apparently not alarmed by Chia’s
                    instruction (which it complied with) that letters should thereafter be sent to a
                    P O Box address. SEB’s officers were invited by Chia to
                    participate in APBS’s social events, including a tour of APBS’s
                    brewery on 28 September 2000. During the tour, Chia introduced SEB’s
                    officers to one of his colleagues, Patrick Teo, as APBS’s “friendly
                        banker[s]”.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_8" id="Ftn_8_1"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Chia and Patrick Teo also
                    played host to SEB’s Global Head of Merchant Banking, Ms Annika Bolin
                    (“Ms Bolin”), when she came from Stockholm to visit
                    Singapore. During that visit, Chia showed Ms Bolin around APBS’s
                    brewery and explained APBS’s business strategy to her. SEB’s
                    officers also worked with APBS’s IT personnel when SEB arranged for an
                    Internet trading station to be set up on Chia’s office
                computer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     As alluded to earlier (at <a href="#p1_21">[21]</a> above), SEB wanted to deepen its relationship
                    with APBS and requested Chia to arrange for meetings between its (SEB’s)
                    officers and the directors or senior management of APBS. All such requests were
                    rebuffed by Chia with excuses. On one occasion, Chia told Amin that it was not
                    necessary for him (Amin) to contact anyone else in APBS except himself (Chia).
                    It never occurred to any of SEB’s officers to question why Chia was so
                    reluctant to introduce them to APBS’s senior management. Thus, SEB’s
                    sole point of contact with APBS was Chia himself. SEB at no time thought this
                    state of affairs unusual for an important corporate customer like APBS, despite
                    the size of the SEB Facilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Chia’s “round-tripping” scheme</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Chia was able to defraud SEB (and also APBS)
                    by employing a “round-tripping” scheme which he implemented using
                    surplus funds of APBS that were deposited in a genuine account which APBS had
                    with Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (“OCBC”). When
                    money borrowed from SEB was due to be repaid, Chia would transfer funds from
                    APBS’s account with OCBC (“the OCBC Account”) to the SEB S$
                    Account. (In this regard, it should be noted that the money drawn by Chia from
                    the SEB Facilities (including the FX Facility and the MM Facility, which were
                    US$ facilities) was ultimately all paid into the SEB S$ Account specifically.)
                    To cover up the deposits taken from the OCBC Account, Chia created a fictitious
                    account with Citibank (“the fictitious Citibank Account”).
                    Deposits taken out of the OCBC Account were recorded as having been deposited
                    into the fictitious Citibank Account. Chia told his subordinate, one Mr Teo
                    Hun Teck (“Teo”), that the reason for the ostensible transfer of
                    funds was because Citibank offered a higher interest rate than OCBC. He
                    instructed Teo not to inform F&amp;N Group Treasury of the fictitious Citibank
                    Account. Chia also created a fictitious document entitled “Schedule of
                    Fixed Deposits Committed”, supposedly from Citibank, to show that APBS
                    had fixed deposits with Citibank. Upon the “maturity” of the
                    fictitious deposits with Citibank, Chia transferred a sum from the SEB S$
                    Account to the OCBC Account to give the appearance that Citibank was paying the
                    appropriate interest. Although Chia never showed Teo any fixed deposit advices
                    from Citibank, the latter did not think that anything was amiss. Teo also did
                    not notice that the “interest” on the Citibank
                    “deposits” was being paid into the OCBC Account from the SEB S$
                    Account, rather than from the fictitious Citibank Account. Eventually, Teo
                    informed one Ms Goh Chee Yee (“Ms Goh”), a
                    representative of F&amp;N Group Treasury, about the fictitious Citibank Account
                    and the fact that no fixed deposit advice had ever been received in respect of
                    that account. Ms Goh, instead of checking with Chia, merely instructed Teo
                    to obtain such advices from Chia.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     In addition to the wily actions described
                    above, Chia gave false and misleading information to his subordinates and
                    intercepted all communications from SEB. Further, even though cheques drawn on
                    the OCBC Account required two signatures, Chia had no trouble getting his
                    subordinate co-signatories to countersign the cheques used to transfer funds
                    from the OCBC Account to the SEB S$ Account. Altogether, from 13 December
                    2000 to 24 October 2002, Chia carried out 27 “round-tripping”
                    transactions between the OCBC Account and the SEB S$ Account. Specifically,
                    S$45m was transferred from the OCBC Account to the SEB S$ Account between
                    13 December 2000 and 16 October 2002 by way of 18 cheques drawn on the
                    OCBC Account (“the OCBC Cheques”), whilst S$45,347,671.23 was
                    transferred from the SEB S$ Account to the OCBC Account between 16 July
                    2001 and 24 October 2002 by way of telegraphic transfers (see the table at
                        <a href="#p1_130">[130]</a> below).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Chia’s dealings with HVB </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Unlike SEB, HVB granted, or attempted to
                    grant, only one loan facility to APBS. Chia used the same <em>modus operandi</em> to obtain a loan facility from HVB. Sometime
                    between late 2000 and early 2001, he contacted HVB’s officer, Ms Tan
                    Hwee Koon (“Ms Tan”), whom he had met earlier when she was
                    working at Sakura Bank (now known as Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation
                    (“Sumitomo Bank”)). Ms Tan had then just joined HVB as a
                    senior officer of its International Desk. Chia must have sensed that
                    Ms Tan, being a new officer, would be anxious to acquire a banking
                    relationship for HVB with a blue-chip company like APBS. Chia and Ms Tan
                    met on 13 March 2001 at The Tavern. At the meeting, Chia asked Ms Tan
                    for a US$10m short-term revolving loan and a US$5m foreign exchange facility for
                    APBS, indicating to her that the loans could be the start of a bigger business
                    relationship between HVB and APBS. However, the meeting was unproductive as HVB
                    declined Chia’s requests because they did not fit in with its lending
                    strategy.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Notwithstanding the abortive meeting between
                    Chia and Ms Tan in March 2001, in August 2002, Ms Tan contacted Chia.
                    By that time, Chia’s gambling debts had mounted. Chia asked Ms Tan
                    for a US$30m three-year term loan for APBS, ostensibly to finance its new
                    bottling line. Ms Tan and HVB’s Head of International Desk,
                    Mr Matthias Zimmermann (“Zimmermann”), met Chia on
                    8 January 2003 at Raffles Hotel to discuss the proposal. At the meeting,
                    Chia informed Zimmermann and Ms Tan that he was in charge of the finance
                    operations of APBS, and that his job entailed handling all the credit facilities
                    and banking relationships of APBS. Chia also mentioned that OCBC was the main
                    banker for the APBL group of companies, but said that he did not like the
                    services provided by OCBC and wanted to give HVB a business opportunity as he
                    had known Ms Tan while she was working at Sumitomo Bank. In subsequent
                    negotiations with Chia, Ms Tan asked for supporting documents to verify the
                    purpose for which the loan was sought. While he provided some financial data to
                    Ms Tan, Chia did not give her any documents. On her part, Ms Tan
                    eventually dropped the issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     HVB eventually offered APBS a US$30m
                    three-year amortising term loan (“the HVB Facility”) on certain
                    terms and conditions. On 21 and 24 March 2003, Chia delivered to
                    Ms Tan HVB’s opening account forms, duly completed, and other
                    documents purportedly setting out APBS’s acceptance of the HVB Facility,
                    including a certified extract of the APBS Board resolution purportedly accepting
                    the facility. Those documents were all forged. It was also later disclosed that
                    the loan documentation for the HVB Facility was signed by Chia in his car on
                    21 March 2003 when he met Ms Tan at the car park of HVB’s office
                    building. In our view, this was a red flag that even the most bullish credit
                    officer could not have missed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Many of the features present in the manner in
                    which Chia defrauded SEB were also present in the way he defrauded HVB. However,
                    there were at least two differences. First, unlike SEB, HVB had a very short
                    banking relationship with Chia. The HVB Facility was drawn down in one tranche
                    on 25 March 2003, and Chia was arrested a few months later. Second,
                    HVB’s internal verification procedures were more stringent than those of
                    SEB. HVB’s “Corporate Banking Credit Policy, Asia” dated
                    27 August 2002 (“HVB’s Credit Policy”) stated at
                        para 13.1.1:<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_9" id="Ftn_9_1"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Upon receipt of the executed documents from the Customer by the CRM
                        [Credit Risk Manager], both the RM [Relationship Manager]/Product Specialist
                        and the CRM have to check and verify that documents have been properly

<p class="Judg-1">Needless to say, para 13.1.1 of HVB’s Credit Policy was
                    ignored by HVB’s officers, who simply accepted at face value whatever

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues and the findings in the court below </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The material issues before the Judge may be
                    summarised as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether APBS held out Chia as having
                        authority to represent to the Appellants that it had accepted the credit
                        facilities offered by them (collectively referred to hereafter as
                        “the Credit Facilities”) and that the forged APBS Board
                        resolutions which he (Chia) gave them in connection with those credit
                        facilities were genuine (“the Agency
                    Issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether APBS was vicariously liable for the fraud committed by Chia on the
                        Appellants (“the Vicarious Liability
                    Issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether APBS owed a duty of care to HVB to have in place reasonable
                        internal controls to prevent and detect fraud, and, if so, whether APBS was
                        in breach of this duty (“the Negligence
                    Issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether APBS was liable to make restitution to SEB of the sum of
                        S$29,468,723.30 (“the Restitution Issue”);
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_32-p2_e"></a>(e)     apropos
                        APBS’s restitutionary counterclaim against SEB, whether SEB was liable
                        for knowing receipt and/or dishonest assistance with respect to the sum of
                        S$45m transferred from the OCBC Account to the SEB S$ Account (“the
                        Restitutionary Counterclaim Issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">As can be
                    seen from the aforesaid list, the issues common to both the Appellants <em>vis-à-vis</em> APBS were the Agency Issue and the Vicarious
                    Liability Issue. The Negligence Issue was relevant only to HVB and APBS, whilst
                    the Restitution Issue and the Restitutionary Counterclaim Issue were relevant
                    only to SEB and APBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     As mentioned at <a href="#p1_6">[6]</a> above, the Judge ruled against the Appellants on all the
                    pleaded heads of claim, except for SEB’s claim in restitution, which she
                    allowed in the amount of S$347,671.23. She made no order on APBS’s
                    counterclaim against SEB in the light of her decision on the Restitution Issue.
                    Her rulings and reasoning on the various heads of claim are summarised in the
                    headnote of the HC Judgment, as follows (see the HC Judgment at
                    789–791):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Actual authority</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(1)    Chia did not have express authority by virtue of
                            the certified extracts of the various [APBS] [B]oard resolutions as they
                            were false and were of no legal effect: at [33] [of the HC
                            Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2)    Chia did not have general authority as Finance
                            Manager of APBS to commit APBS to the SEB Facilities and the HVB
                            Facility without the sanction of the APBS [B]oard based on the
                            construction of the “internal documents” (namely, the
                            [Position Description] and the rules and guidelines in the [GTP] which
                            together set out the duties of the Finance Manager): at [43] [of the HC
                            Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(3)    The condition precedent calling for the certified
                            extract of [an APBS] [B]oard resolution in and of itself carried the
                            implication that the [Appellants] appreciated and knew that Chia had no
                            actual authority to bind [APBS], and that the power to give approval to
                            an application for a loan and to execute the documents necessary to give
                            effect to the transaction was the domain of the [APBS Board]: at [31]
                            [of the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4)    In the absence of any express authority to act for
                            the particular purpose of the transaction in question (in this case to
                            establish a banking relationship with the [Appellants] by opening the
                            SEB Accounts, and by binding APBS in respect of the SEB Facilities and
                            [the] HVB Facility), it followed that there was no implied actual
                            authority which typically arose incidentally for the effective execution
                            and performance of the express authority in the usual way: at [34] [of
                            the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(5)    Chia[,] in putting forward the forged documents as
                            genuine[,] was not acting within his actual authority, whether express
                            or implied: at [48] [of the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(6)    At all material times, the [Appellants] decided to
                            accept the various certified extracts of the [APBS] [B]oard resolutions
                            on the strength of the certification, ostensibly signed by directors of
                            [APBS,] that the matters stated in the extracts had been passed as
                            recorded, and …
                            <em>not</em> because Chia was putting forward
                            forged documents as genuine. This was the verification of the documents
                            point which ran counter to the argument of Chia’s implied actual
                            authority to warrant that the certified extracts of the [APBS] [B]oard
                            resolutions were genuine or that the [APBS] [B]oard had approved the
                            transactions: at [72] [of the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(7)    Chia’s fraud on [APBS] and the [Appellants]
                            was necessarily determinative of the [Appellants]’ authority
                            debate. Chia’s actual authority (express or implied), if any, was
                            impliedly subject to a condition that it was to be exercised honestly
                            and on behalf of the principal: at [46] [of the HC
                        Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Ostensible authority</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(8)    A principal might in appropriate circumstances be
                            bound by the fraudulent acts of his agent where there <em>was</em> evidence of ostensible authority: at [102] [of the
                            HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(9)    On the evidence, <em>no</em>
                            authorised person in APBS held out Chia as having authority to enter
                            into and execute the SEB Facilities and [the] HVB Facility. As such APBS
                            was <em>not</em> estopped from denying the forgery:
                            at [102] [of the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(10)  Since the [Appellants] led no evidence of what
                            Chia was required to do, and in fact did, and whether [APBS] acquiesced
                            in what he did[,] … what was before the court was the fact of
                            Chia’s appointment as Finance Manager and that of itself was
                            insufficient “representation” by APBS of Chia’s
                            apparent authority to make representation[s] of fact such as [to]
                            warrant the genuineness of the certified extracts of the [APBS] [B]oard
                            resolutions, or to communicate [the APBS] [B]oard[’s] approval of
                            the transaction[s]: at [121] [of the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(11)  Evidentially, reliance on the apparent authority
                            of Chia was difficult to satisfy in the light of the [Appellants]’
                            standard requirement for [an APBS] [B]oard resolution: at [127] [of the
                            HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(12)  The [Appellants]’ impression – that
                            the certified extracts were genuine as they had been properly executed,
                            and consequently [were evidence of] the validity of Chia’s
                            authority to act on behalf of APBS – was founded purely on the
                            [Appellants]’ own narrow and limited verification and acceptance
                            of the condition precedent documents[,] [the Appellants] having chosen
                            to forego inquiry as to [Chia’s] authority: at [141] [of the HC
                            Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(13)  On the evidence, the [Appellants] willingly
                            accepted the certified extracts of the [APBS] [B]oard resolutions and
                            willingly took the risk of forgery and Chia’s lack of authority.
                            Consequently, (a) the rules of apparent authority would not apply
                            as they could not be fulfilled, and (b) the attendant risks or
                            factors that could vitiate the transactions including the risk of
                            forgery fell on the [Appellants]: at [141] [of the HC
                        Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(14)  Verification of signature was a matter of common
                            sense to safeguard the [Appellants]’ own interests, and in
                            forgoing the chance to do so, the [Appellants] assumed the risks of
                            fraud as was the case here: at [149] [of the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Vicarious liability</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(15)  The case of the [the Appellants] on vicarious
                            liability failed for the same reasons that the agency claim based on
                            ostensible authority failed: at [198] [of the HC
                        Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Neglige</em>nce</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(17)  In order to establish a duty of care, it was
                            necessary that [APBS] knew that the intending lender [<em>ie</em>, HVB] would rely on Chia’s representations for
                            the purpose of deciding whether to make the loan: at [237] [of the HC
                            Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(18)  There was no voluntary assumption of
                            responsibility by APBS and no relationship between APBS and HVB to
                            ground a finding of [a] sufficient degree of proximity by reference to
                            physical proximity, circumstantial proximity or causal proximity: at
                            [237] [of the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(19)  If there was a duty of care and [if] the breach
                            by APBS gave Chia the opportunity to cheat HVB, the breach did not cause
                            HVB’s loss. The proximate cause of the loss was the fraud
                            practised upon HVB by Chia, a risk that was willingly assumed by HVB
                            when it accepted the certified [APBS] [B]oard resolution without
                            verifying the directors’ signatures, and hence Chia’s
                            authority: at [243] [of the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>Restitution</em>
</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(20)  SEB’s restitutionary claim … failed
                            because APBS could not be said to have been unjustly enriched at the
                            expense of … SEB as the payments to APBS by way of telegraphic
                            transfers [from the SEB S$ Account to the OCBC Account between
                            16 July 2001 and 24 October 2002] discharged Chia’s
                            liability to APBS in respect of the sum of S$45m: at [282] [of the HC
                            Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(21)  APBS had been enriched by the receipt of
                            S$347,671.23 because APBS was not entitled to interest and Chia was
                            under no legal obligation to pay any interest on a deposit to APBS: at
                            [283] [of the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(22)  The two drawings of US$13m and US$12m [on the MM
                            Facility on 24 March 2003 and 21 May 2003] respectively were
                            fresh drawings and the previous drawings that were ascribed to the two
                            drawings had been repaid and replaced with new drawings at the
                            respective dates. Since the drawdowns in March 2003 and May 2003 were
                            not paid to or received by APBS, the effect of the rollover benefited
                            Chia at SEB’s expense: at [318] [of the HC
                        Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(23)  APBS’s change of position defence failed in
                            respect of the sum of S$347,671.23 because there was no extraordinary
                            change of position and the “but for” test of causation was
                            not made out on the facts: at [330] [of the HC Judgment].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(24)  It was unnecessary to deal with APBS’s
                            counterclaim in light of [the decision reached on] SEB’s claim in

<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The issues to be dealt with in the present appeals</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     The Judge’s factual findings are largely
                    not in dispute in the present appeals, which focus substantially on the legal
                    consequences of those findings. The issues which we have to deal with are the
                    same as those raised in the court below (as listed at <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above). We shall address these issues in turn, beginning
                    with the Agency Issue.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Agency Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellants’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     The Agency Issue, to recapitulate, is whether
                    APBS held out Chia as having authority to represent to the Appellants that it
                    had accepted the Credit Facilities and that the forged APBS Board resolutions
                    which he gave them in connection with those credit facilities were genuine. As
                    SEB adopted HVB’s arguments before this court on this issue, we shall
                    treat HVB’s arguments in this regard as the Appellants’ joint
                    arguments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     According to the Appellants, the Judge
                    misunderstood their case against APBS on the Agency Issue, and this affected her
                    decision on the issue of ostensible authority. The Appellants submit that their
                    case in the court below was not that Chia had actual and/or ostensible authority
                    to obtain credit facilities from banks on APBS’s behalf. Rather, their
                    case was that Chia, as the most senior finance officer in APBS, had authority,
                    whether actual, usual or apparent (<em>ie</em>,
                    ostensible), to make representations on behalf of APBS, including
                    representations that APBS had accepted the Credit Facilities and that the forged
                    APBS Board resolutions which he gave them were genuine. The Appellants argue
                    that this proposition is on all fours with the decision of the English Court of
                    Appeal (“the English CA”) in <em>First Energy (UK)
                        Ltd v Hungarian International Bank Ltd</em> [1993]
                    2 Lloyd’s Rep 194 (“<em>First
                    Energy</em>”). They contend that what <em>First
                        Energy</em> decided was that although the senior manager of the
                    Manchester office of the defendant bank in that case had expressly told the
                    plaintiff customer that he had no authority to sanction the credit facility
                    sought by the plaintiff, he had, by virtue of his position as the senior
                    manager, apparent authority to communicate to the plaintiff that the
                    defendant’s head office in London had given approval for that credit
                    facility. In essence, the Appellants argue, the English CA held in <em>First Energy</em> that the law recognised that in modern
                    commerce, an agent who had no apparent authority to conclude a particular
                    transaction on his principal’s behalf might sometimes nonetheless be
                    clothed with apparent authority to make representations of fact about that
                    transaction, including the representation that his principal had approved that
                    transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The Appellants have also made the following
                    points in relation to <em>First Energy</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>First
                            Energy</em> illustrates that a rigid requirement for a holding out
                        in the form of an unequivocal and express representation by the principal
                        directly to the third party is wholly inadequate and inapt when applied to
                        the complexities of transacting with impersonal corporate structures which
                        must deal through agents in today’s commercial
                    world.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_b"></a>(b)     In reality,
                        one would be hard-pressed to find an unequivocal and express representation
                        by the principal directly to the third party, and it would often be the case
                        that the representation is instead implied by the principal’s conduct
                        in clothing the agent with the trappings of authority by placing him in a
                        certain position in the organisation.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_c"></a>(c)     The Judge erred in law in failing to give sufficient
                        weight to the decision in <em>First Energy</em> and in
                        directing her mind singularly to the question of whether there had been an
                        express representation from APBS to the Appellants as to Chia’s
                        authority. In so doing, the Judge failed to appreciate the relevance and
                        importance of <em>First Energy</em>, where the emphasis
                        of the court’s legal analysis, instead of being placed (as per the
                        traditional position) on the need for an unequivocal and express
                        representation by the principal to the third party, shifted (rightly, in the
                        Appellants’ view) to the reasonable expectations of the third party as
                        they would objectively appear in the context of commercial convenience and
                        modern-day dealings.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_37-p2_d"></a>(d)     The position adopted by the English CA in <em>First
                            Energy</em> is in line with the principle of fair risk allocation
                        and recent developments in case law. <em>First
                            Energy</em> has been applied in Singapore in a number of cases
                            (<em>eg</em>, in <em>Hongkong &amp;
                            Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd v Jurong Engineering Ltd and others</em>
                        [2000] 1 SLR(R) 204 (“<em>Jurong
                            Engineering</em>”) and <em>Lee Feng Steel
                            Pte Ltd v First Commercial Bank</em> [1996] 3 SLR(R) 64), and
                        also recently in England in <em>Alan Lovett, Geoffrey Lambert
                            Carton-Kelly v Carson Country Homes Ltd, Barclays Bank Plc, Registrar of

                        [2009] EWHC 1143. The principle laid down in <em>First
                            Energy</em> has also been applied in the Australian case of
                            <em>Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas</em>
                        [2004] HCA 35, where the High Court of Australia acknowledged that a kind of
                        representation often arising in business dealings was one which flowed from
                        vesting an officer of a company with a certain title or status and equipping
                        him with certain facilities. Such a representation, the court noted, might
                        result in the principal permitting the agent to act in a certain manner
                        without proper safeguards against misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The decision in First Energy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     As the Appellants’ case on Chia’s
                    authority to make the fraudulent representations which were made is founded upon
                    the authority of <em>First Energy</em>, we now examine this
                    case in detail to see what the English CA actually decided and what the basis of
                    its decision was. Before doing so, we should reiterate the established principle
                    (which the Appellants do not dispute) that the law does not recognise the notion
                    of what is commonly termed a “self-authorising” agent –
                    <em>ie</em>, under the law of agency, an agent who has no
                    authority, whether actual or ostensible, to perform a certain act cannot confer
                    upon himself authority to do that act by representing that he has such
                    authority. This principle is well illustrated by the House of Lords’
                    decision in <em>Armagas Ltd v Mundogas SA</em> [1986] AC
                    717 (“<em>Armagas</em>”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In <em>Armagas</em>, the
                    plaintiff (“AL”) negotiated to purchase a ship from the defendant
                    (“MSA”). AL planned to let the ship back to MSA on a three-year
                    charterparty so as to finance the sale. The sale was brokered by an agent
                    (“J”), who stood to gain if the deal went through. At all material
                    times, J communicated with one Magelssen (“M”), who was
                    MSA’s vice-president (transportation) and chartering manager, regarding
                    the sale. M told J that MSA would only enter into a one-year charterparty. J
                    then offered M a bribe, and M signed a three-year charterparty to the
                    satisfaction of AL. M also signed a one-year charterparty so as to mislead MSA.
                    The ship was duly let to MSA, which returned it after one year. AL thought the
                    charterparty was for three years and therefore sued MSA for breach of contract.
                    AL argued that M had either implied actual authority or apparent authority to
                    sign the three-year charterparty on MSA’s behalf. The House of Lords held
                    that notwithstanding M’s appointment as MSA’s agent in relation to
                    the sale of the vessel, that position did not carry any usual or customary
                    authority to sign a three-year charterparty; neither was there a representation
                    by MSA that M had such authority. The only representation made was that made by
                    M himself. In the circumstances, the House of Lords dismissed AL’s claim
                    against MSA.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     In his judgment, Lord Keith of Kinkel,
                    after expressing his agreement with Robert Goff LJ’s observation in
                    the English CA (<em>viz</em>, that it was most unlikely to
                    be the law that a principal would be bound in a situation where its agent, who
                    had no ostensible authority to enter into a particular transaction on its
                    behalf, wrongly asserted after negotiations that he had gone back to the
                    principal and had obtained actual authority to enter into that transaction (see
                        <em>Armagas</em> at 731)), said (at 779 of <em>Armagas</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">
<em>It must be a most unusual and peculiar case where an
                            agent who is known to have no general authority to enter into
                            transactions of a certain type can by reason of circumstances created by
                            the principal reasonably be believed to have specific authority to enter
                            into a particular transaction of that type</em>. The facts of the
                        present case fall far short of establishing such a situation. I conclude
                        that the [English CA] rightly rejected [AL’s] claim based on
                        ostensible authority. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Subsequently, the English CA found <em>First Energy</em> to be such an “unusual and peculiar
                    case” (<em>per</em> Lord Keith in <em>Armagas</em> at 779). The plaintiff in <em>First Energy</em> (“FE”) specialised in the replacement
                    of old-fashioned heating systems with a more economical form of space heating.
                    In order to make its product financially attractive to customers, FE allowed its
                    customers to pay for the installation of the new system by instalments. FE
                    sought financing from the defendant bank (“HIB”), which had its
                    head office in London and which also had a branch office in Manchester. FE
                    negotiated with the senior manager of HIB’s Manchester office
                    (“Mr J”), who had authority to sanction large credit
                    transactions and sign facility letters. However, at an advanced stage of the
                    negotiations, Mr J informed FE that he had no authority to sanction a
                    credit facility of the amount asked for by FE.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     Thereafter, HIB sent FE a facility letter,
                    signed by its managing director and by an assistant director
                    (“Mr P”), offering a £2m credit facility for five years.
                    However, this facility letter did not come into force. Since FE required
                    financing for an initial project, the parties instead entered, successfully,
                    into an <em>ad hoc</em> arrangement whereby HIB provided
                    interim hire purchase (“HP”) financing to FE for that initial
                    project only. While discussions (which were known to Mr P) were ongoing
                    between FE and Mr J to implement a more permanent financing agreement, FE
                    secured three more projects. With respect to those three projects, Mr J
                    wrote to FE on 2 August 1990 offering three more interim HP facilities as
                    well as attaching the relevant agreements (“the 2 August HP
                    Agreements”) for FE’s completion. FE subsequently returned the
                    2 August HP Agreements duly completed. In the meantime, HIB’s senior
                    management decided that HIB should not be financially involved in FE’s
                    ventures, including the three projects which were the subject matter of the
                    2 August HP Agreements. FE, which was left without financing by that
                    decision, sued to enforce the 2 August HP Agreements. The trial judge ruled
                    in FE’s favour, whereupon HIB appealed.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The English CA dismissed HIB’s appeal.
                    It held, on the particular facts of the case, that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mr J’s position as the
                        senior manager of HIB’s Manchester office was such that Mr J was
                        clothed with ostensible authority to communicate that HIB’s head
                        office had approved the 2 August HP Agreements;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_b"></a>(b)     the fact that FE knew that
                        Mr J’s actual authority to offer credit facilities on HIB’s
                        behalf was limited did not necessarily mean that Mr J’s authority
                        to communicate decisions on HIB’s behalf <em>vis-à-vis</em> credit facilities was also limited;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_43-p2_c"></a>(c)     the trial judge
                        was entitled to find as a matter of fact that Mr J possessed ostensible
                        authority to communicate the approval by HIB’s head office of the
                        2 August HP Agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Accordingly, the English CA
                    upheld the trial judge’s decision that HIB was bound by the 2 August
                    HP Agreements.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Each member of the English CA in <em>First Energy</em> delivered a separate judgment.
                    Steyn LJ began his judgment by observing that a decision to the contrary
                    effect (<em>viz</em>, that HIB was not bound by the
                    2 August HP Agreements) would “frustrate the reasonable expectations
                    of the parties” (at 196) and would, moreover, “be based on an
                    unreal premise as to the way in which commercial men transact[ed] business
                        <em>of the particular kind involved in th[at]
                    case</em>” [emphasis added] (at 196). He held (at 204) that
                    “the law recognise[d] that in modern commerce[,] an agent who ha[d] no
                    apparent authority to conclude a particular transaction [might] sometimes be
                    clothed with apparent authority to make representations of fact [apropos that
                    transaction]”. He distinguished the decision in <em>Armagas</em> on the basis that it dealt with specific authority as
                    opposed to general authority, and stated (at 203) that that decision did not
                    foreclose the possibility of an agent having ostensible authority to communicate
                    his principal’s approval of a transaction even though he (<em>ie</em>, the agent) himself had no authority to enter into
                    that transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Evans LJ distinguished <em>Armagas</em> on the basis that the agent there (<em>ie</em>, M) had no authority either to enter into the relevant
                    transaction or to communicate his principal’s (<em>ie</em>, MSA’s) approval of that transaction. In contrast, in
                        <em>First Energy</em>, Mr J, <em>by
                        virtue of his position</em> as the senior manager of HIB’s
                    Manchester office, had general authority to communicate decisions made by his
                    superiors, and therefore had authority to communicate the specific
                    representation that HIB’s head office in London had sanctioned the
                    2 August HP Agreements. Evans LJ also expressed the view that such a
                    decision would reflect the practical realities of the commercial
                world.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Nourse LJ agreed with the reasons given
                    by both Steyn and Evans LJJ. He added that “[a] question of
                    ostensible authority [was] primarily one of fact” (at 207), and held that
                    on the facts, the trial judge’s conclusion in FE’s favour was
                    “the <em>only</em> one to which [the trial judge]
                    could have come on the evidence before him” [emphasis added] (at 207). He
                    further stated that HIB’s proposition –
                    <em>viz</em>, that “[FE’s] knowledge of
                    [Mr J’s] inability to sanction any facility was just as much
                    knowledge of [Mr J’s] inability to communicate head office’s
                    approval of a facility” (at 207) – involved “a non sequitur
                    which offend[ed] both commercial reality and common sense” (at
                    207).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     In their judgments, all three members of the
                    English CA in <em>First Energy</em> expressly stated that
                    their rulings were entirely consistent with <em>Armagas</em>. Accordingly, <em>First Energy</em>
                    is distinguishable from <em>Armagas</em> only on the facts.
                    As far as we can see, the distinguishing features are as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_a"></a>(a)     
            <em>Armagas</em> involved a situation where it was not difficult for
                        AL to check with MSA regarding M’s authority. In contrast, in
                            <em>First Energy</em>, given that Mr J was the
                        senior manager of HIB’s Manchester office, it would be impractical to
                        expect each customer of HIB’s Manchester office to check with
                        HIB’s head office in London regarding Mr J’s
                        authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_b"></a>(b)     In
                            <em>First Energy</em>, both the trial judge as well
                        as the English CA effectively found as a fact that Mr J had ostensible
                        authority to make the specific representation that HIB’s head office
                        in London had approved the credit facility sought by FE. In contrast, in
                            <em>Armagas</em>, M was found not to have any
                        authority, whether ostensible or otherwise, to enter into a three-year
                        charterparty on MSA’s behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_47-p2_c"></a>(c)     
            <em>Armagas</em> concerned an agent
                        who had limited authority, whereas <em>First
                            Energy</em> concerned an agent who effectively had wide-ranging
                        authority to perform a variety of tasks, including that of conveying his
                        principal’s approval of the transaction in
                question.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     Steyn LJ’s approach in <em>First Energy</em> was influenced in part by
                    Kerr LJ’s general observations on the nature of apparent authority in
                        <em>Egyptian International Foreign Trade Co v Soplex
                        Wholesale Supplies Ltd, and P S Refson &amp; Co Ltd (The
                        “Raffaella”)</em> [1985] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 36
                        (“<em>The Raffaella</em>”).
                    Kerr LJ’s observations went further than those of Lord Keith at
                    779 of <em>Armagas</em> (reproduced at <a href="#p1_40">[40]</a> above; see also <em>First
                        Energy</em> at 203 for Steyn LJ’s comments on Kerr
                    LJ’s observations in <em>The Raffaella</em>).
                    However, what had an even greater influence on Steyn LJ’s approach in
                        <em>First Energy</em> was
                    Browne-Wilkinson LJ’s reasoning in <em>The
                        Raffaella</em> (at 43), as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">As at present advised, I am not satisfied that the principle to be derived
                        from those cases [including <em>Armagas</em>] is as
                        wide as [the second defendant’s counsel] suggests [the submission of
                        the second defendant’s counsel was that a principal could not be held
                        liable as a result of the agent holding himself out as having an authority
                        which he did not in fact possess]: they were all cases or dicta dealing with
                        the position where the agent had neither authority to enter into the
                        transaction [in question] nor authority to make representations on behalf of
                        the principal. It is obviously correct that an agent who has no actual or
                        apparent authority either (a) to enter into a transaction or
                        (b) to make representations as to the transaction cannot hold himself
                        out as having authority to enter into the transaction so as to [a]ffect the
                        principal’s position. <em>But, suppose a company
                            confers actual or apparent authority on X to make representations and X
                            erroneously represents to a third party that Y has authority to enter
                            into a transaction; why should not such a representation be relied upon
                            as part of the holding out of Y by the company? By parity of reasoning,
                            if a company confers actual or apparent authority on A to make
                            representations on the company’s behalf but no actual authority on
                            A to enter into the specific transaction, why should a representation
                            made by A as to his authority not be capable of being relied on as one
                            of the acts of holding out?</em> There is substantial authority
                        that it can be: see <em>British Thomson-Houston Co. Ltd. v.

                        representation by the agent that he was managing director); and the

                            <em>If, as I am inclined to think[,] an agent with
                            authority to make representations can make a representation that he has
                            authority to enter into a transaction, then the [trial] [j]udge was
                            entitled to hold, as he did, that Mr. Booth, as the representative
                            of Refson [the second defendant] in charge of the transaction, had
                            implied or apparent authority to make the representation that only one
                            signature was required and that this representation was a relevant
                            consideration in deciding whether Refson had held out Mr. Booth as
                            having authority to sign the undertaking [given to the
                            plaintiff]</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     In <em>The
                    Raffaella</em>, the plaintiff (“EIFT”) contracted to buy a
                    cargo of cement from the first defendant (“Soplex”). Soplex
                    intended to fulfil that contract by purchasing a vessel together with her cargo
                    of cement. The second defendant (“Refson”), the trading bank which
                    acted as Soplex’s banker for the transaction, issued a guarantee in favour
                    of EIFT promising to make irrevocable payment if the vessel did not arrive at
                    the designated port by the stipulated date and/or if the cement supplied by
                    Soplex did not meet the contractual standard. The guarantee was signed only by
                    Mr Booth, Refson’s documentary credits manager, who did not in fact
                    have actual authority to sign the guarantee on Refson’s behalf and who
                    also concealed the giving of the guarantee from his superiors. EIFT subsequently
                    made a claim under the guarantee. Refson denied liability, contending (<em>inter alia</em>) that Mr Booth had no authority to sign
                    any guarantee which would be binding on it. This argument was rejected by the
                    trial judge, who held Refson liable under the guarantee. On appeal, the English
                    CA (consisting of Lawton, Kerr and Browne-Wilkinson LJJ) affirmed the trial
                    judge’s decision. It held that on the facts of that case:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_a"></a>(a)     Mr Booth had apparent authority
                        to sign the guarantee on behalf of Refson as the latter had held out
                        Mr Booth as being a manager of the kind who dealt with its affairs
                        generally and who could reasonably be expected to have general authority;
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_49-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        evidence taken as a whole was sufficient to entitle the trial judge to find
                        that Mr Booth had been held out by Refson as having apparent authority
                        to sign the guarantee issued in favour of EIFT.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_50"></a>50     Kerr LJ also said that the issue before
                    the court “raise[d] no question of principle[,] but merely the proper
                    inference to be drawn from the evidence” (see <em>The
                        Raffaella</em> at 43). He held that “Mr. Booth had
                    Refson’s actual authority to do everything on which [EIFT] rel[ied] as
                    clothing him with the apparent authority to sign the [guarantee] without the
                    addition of any other signature” (see <em>The
                        Raffaella</em> at 43–44).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our ruling on the Agency Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_51"></a>51     It is clear from the foregoing examination of
                        <em>The Raffaella</em> and <em>First
                        Energy</em> that in both cases, the court’s decision was based
                    on a specific finding of fact that the principal concerned had held out its
                    agent as having authority to make, in relation to the transaction in question,
                    representations of the class or kind of representations that the agent actually
                    made, even though the agent knew he had no actual authority to enter into the
                    transaction itself. In particular, it was made abundantly clear in <em>First Energy</em> that Mr J, as the senior manager of
                    HIB’s Manchester office, had overall responsibility of that office. In
                    such circumstances, it made good commercial sense that a customer of HIB’s
                    Manchester office should be able to rely on what was conveyed to him by
                    Mr J. In contrast, in the present case, Chia was merely the finance manager
                    of APBS, a title which does not connote the possession of any specific
                    authority. The senior management of APBS, including the APBS Board, was also
                    within easy reach of the Appellants. In the circumstances of the case, the Judge
                    found as a fact that APBS had not held out to the Appellants, whether by its
                    actions or by Chia’s position as Finance Manager, that Chia had any
                    authority to make on its behalf any representations of the class or kind of
                    representations that Chia actually made. The Judge’s finding is purely one
                    of fact; therefore, unless the Appellants are able to show that this finding of
                    fact is plainly wrong or is against the weight of the evidence, their appeals
                    based on apparent authority must fail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_52"></a>52     The Appellants rely on the following evidence
                    as amounting to a holding out by APBS of Chia’s authority to represent
                    that APBS had accepted the Credit Facilities and that the forged APBS Board
                    resolutions provided by Chia were genuine:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_a"></a>(a)     Chia, apart from being the most
                        senior finance officer in APBS, was a member of APBS’s senior
                        management as stated in the Position Description.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_b"></a>(b)     Ms Tan had dealt with Chia
                        previously in 2000, when she was at Sumitomo Bank, in relation to credit
                        facilities sought on behalf of APBS. Thus, in her dealings with Chia after
                        she joined HVB, she had every reason to believe that Chia was similarly
                        authorised by APBS to request for credit facilities on its
                    behalf.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_c"></a>(c)     Chia had
                        unlimited authority to operate and control the OCBC Account, except that he
                        was a co-signatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_d"></a>(d)     Chia had authority to open fixed deposit accounts in APBS’s
                        name for the purposes of investing APBS’s temporary surplus funds, and
                        also had a compliance function with respect to the covenants and obligations
                        of APBS under credit facilities which it took out. Both of those areas of
                        work would require Chia to communicate with banks.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_e"></a>(e)     Chia frequently dealt with banks and
                        acted as the point of communication between APBS and banks. In fact,
                        Mr Brand Jan van den Berg, an APBL director, had told Zimmermann
                        (HVB’s Head of International Desk) on one occasion that Chia was the
                        appropriate person in APBS to discuss banking facilities
                    with.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_52-p2_f"></a>(f)     Chia had wide
                        powers with regard to his subordinates as well as APBS’s facilities
                        and properties. He had met and entertained SEB’s officers at
                        APBS’s premises, and had shown them around the premises. Further, he
                        had allowed SEB’s officers to set up SEB’s Internet trading
                        system on his own office computer with the assistance of APBS’s IT
                        personnel.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_53"></a>53     In the court below, the Judge, after
                    considering all of the above factors, held that they were insufficient to show
                    that APBS had held out Chia as having authority to make the false
                    representations which he made to the Appellants. We are substantially in
                    agreement with her ruling. Accordingly, as far as the facts are concerned, the
                    Judge was entitled to find on the evidence that APBS <em>did
                        not</em> hold out Chia as having the authority contended by the
                    Appellants, <em>ie</em>, actual and/or ostensible authority
                    to represent that APBS had accepted the Credit Facilities and that the forged
                    APBS Board resolutions which he provided in connection with those credit
                    facilities were genuine.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_54"></a>54     In view of our finding that APBS did not make
                    the holding out submitted by the Appellants, the principle laid down in
                        <em>First Energy</em> –
                    <em>viz</em>, that an agent who has no authority, whether
                    actual or apparent, to conclude a particular transaction on his
                    principal’s behalf may nevertheless have apparent authority to represent
                    that his principal has approved the transaction – has no application in
                    the present case. It is accordingly not necessary for us to decide whether that
                    principle should be accepted as good law in Singapore. However, given the
                    importance of <em>First Energy</em> to the
                    Appellants’ arguments and given, also, that the principle laid down in
                    that case is likely to surface again in our courts, we think it desirable that
                    we state our views on the case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our observations on First Energy</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_55"></a>55     As mentioned at sub-para (d) of <a href="#p1_37">[37]</a> above, <em>First
                        Energy</em> has been applied in Australia, and was recently followed
                    in England. In addition, as the Judge observed (at [115] of the HC Judgment), <em>First
                        Energy</em> has also been relied on in Singapore in <em>Jurong Engineering</em> by the High Court for the principle that (see
                        <em>Jurong Engineering</em> at [68]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]f the [principal] has <em>expressly</em>
                        authorised the agent to make representations on its behalf, then any
                        representation made by that agent that he himself has authority to do an act
                        is a good representation for the purposes of conferring apparent authority
                        on the agent to do that act, even if he has been expressly prohibited to do
                        it, and even if it is not something that agents in his position usually have
                        power to do. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_56"></a>56     With respect to the above passage from
                        <em>Jurong Engineering</em>, the Judge said (at
                        [116] of the HC Judgment), without
                    coming to any conclusion on the correctness of the principle set out
                    therein:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If one adopts the narrower reading of [<em>First
                            Energy</em>] (seemingly favoured in …
                        <em>Jurong Engineering</em>), <em>First
                            Energy</em> would be inapplicable to the present case because
                        there was no express authorisation whatsoever by APBS that Chia could make
                        the alleged representation[s] of fact on its behalf. If one says that
                            <em>First Energy</em> stands for the proposition
                        that the representation as to authority made by the principal is completely
                        not required so as to advance the public policy consideration of protecting
                        third parties, this departs too radically from the conceptual basis of the
                        doctrine of apparent authority, as the doctrine is premised fundamentally on
                        such [a] representation having been made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_57"></a>57     There are four observations which we wish to
                    make apropos <em>First Energy</em>. The first is that, as
                    mentioned at <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above, the English CA did
                    not consider that its decision departed from established authority. If the
                    English CA’s view is correct, then <em>First
                        Energy</em> would be considered good law here. It may, however, be
                    that <em>First Energy</em> is <em>not</em> in fact consonant with established authority, but is instead
                    a radical departure from the traditional conceptual basis of the doctrine of
                    apparent authority as well as inconsistent with <em>Armagas</em> (as suggested by the Judge at [116] of the HC Judgment and by
                    Prof F M B Reynolds in “The Ultimate Apparent
                    Authority” (1994) 110 LQR 21). In this regard, we note that
                    criticism of <em>First Energy</em> has been made in
                        (<em>inter alia</em>) Peter Watts &amp;
                    F M B Reynolds, <em>Bowstead and Reynolds on
                        Agency</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 19th Ed, 2010), which states
                    (at para 8-023) that that case “involves a departure from the basic
                    principles of apparent authority, for which no general justifying principle
                    seems ready [at] hand”, as well as Tan Cheng Han, <em>The
                        Law of Agency</em> (Academy Publishing, 2010), where the learned
                    author opines that <em>First Energy</em> “was an
                    example of a difficult case possibly making bad law” (at para 5.047)
                    and that “courts should be slow to adopt the approach in <em>First Energy</em> … unless there are exceptional
                    facts” (at para 5.043). If these criticisms of <em>First Energy</em> are justified, then that decision should not be
                    followed by our courts. Therefore, if it becomes necessary in a future case for
                    a Singapore court to decide whether or not <em>First
                        Energy</em> is good law in this country, the court will have to first
                    identify, in so far as is possible, what principle (if any) was established in
                        <em>First Energy</em> that is not (according to the
                    English CA) inconsistent with <em>Armagas</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_58"></a>58     Our second observation is that, as mentioned
                    at <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> above, in <em>First
                        Energy</em>, Steyn LJ followed in the footsteps of
                    Browne-Wilkinson LJ in <em>The Raffaella</em>.
                    Referring to Browne-Wilkinson LJ’s analysis of apparent authority at
                    43 of <em>The Raffaella</em> (reproduced earlier at
                        <a href="#p1_48">[48]</a> above), Steyn LJ said that
                    that passage “[threw] light on the approach [which the court] ought to
                    adopt” (see <em>First Energy</em> at 204). He
                    concluded (likewise at 204):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In agreement with the [trial] [j]udge[,] I have come to the conclusion, on
                        the particular facts of this case, that [Mr J’s] position as
                        senior manager in Manchester was such that he was clothed with ostensible
                        authority to communicate that head office approval had been given for the
                        facility set out in the [2 August HP Agreements]. Although his status
                        was below that of a managing director or general manager, it was
                        nevertheless considerable. And, in the circumstances of this case, the idea
                        that [FE] should have checked with the managing director in London whether
                        HIB had approved the transaction seems unreal. This factor is, of course,
                        not decisive, but it is relevant to the ultimate decision.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Having come to [the] conclusion, on the application of what I regard as
                        orthodox principles of law, that the [trial] [j]udge was entitled and indeed
                        right to find as a matter of fact that ostensible authority to communicate
                        head office approval of the transaction had been established, I return to
                        the place where I started. In my judgment a decision that [Mr J] did
                        not have apparent authority to communicate head office approval would defeat
                        the reasonable expectations of the parties. And it would fly in the face of
                        the way in which[,] in practice[,] negotiations are conducted between
                        trading banks and trading customers who seek commercial loans.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In other words, as we pointed out earlier (see sub-para (b) of
                        <a href="#p1_47">[47]</a> above), Steyn LJ (and,
                    likewise, the other two members of the English CA in <em>First
                        Energy</em>) specifically found that Mr J had ostensible
                    authority to represent that HIB’s head office in London had approved the
                    2 August HP Agreements. If the decision in <em>First
                        Energy</em> is so understood, then it should pose no doctrinal
                    difficulty.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_59"></a>59     Our third point is that in <em>First Energy</em>, the English CA treated Mr J’s
                    representation (<em>viz</em>, that HIB’s head office
                    in London had approved the 2 August HP Agreements) as merely another
                    representation, like any other representation that an agent may be authorised to
                    make. In our view, however, a representation by an agent that his principal has
                    approved a transaction is not like other representations. A representation as to
                    the principal’s approval of a transaction goes to the heart of the agency
                    relationship. While an agent may possess authority (whether actual or
                    ostensible) to make general representations pertaining to a certain transaction
                    (such as, for example, a representation about the condition of the goods
                    involved in a sale transaction), this authority, in a situation where the agent
                        <em>does not</em> also possess authority (whether
                    actual or ostensible) to enter into the said transaction on the
                    principal’s behalf, <em>cannot</em> include authority
                    to make the specific representation that the principal has approved that
                    transaction. To argue that an agent has authority to represent that his
                    principal has approved a transaction – which is, in effect, authority to
                    bind the principal to the transaction – because he (the agent) has
                    authority to make general representations about the transaction and, hence, also
                    has authority to represent that his principal has approved the transaction is
                    contrary to the established principle that there cannot be self-authorisation by
                    an agent. Of course, if an agent has been conferred authority, whether actual or
                    ostensible, to make the <em>specific</em> representation
                    that his principal has approved a transaction (which authority Mr J was
                    found to have in <em>First Energy</em>), he would also have
                    been vested with at least ostensible authority to enter into the transaction on
                    his principal’s behalf. But, if the agent merely has authority to make
                        <em>general</em> representations about the transaction
                    and does not have any authority (whether actual or ostensible) to enter into the
                    transaction on the principal’s behalf, it is not possible for him to give
                    himself such authority by falsely representing that his principal has approved
                    the transaction, which representation carries with it the implication that the
                    principal has given him (the agent) the requisite authority to bind the
                    principal to the transaction.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_60"></a>60     Our fourth observation is that from an
                    economic point of view, there is a significant difference between the commercial
                    relationship of the parties in <em>First Energy</em> and
                    that of the parties in the present case. In <em>First
                        Energy</em>, FE needed financing to develop its business. Mr J,
                    the senior manager of HIB’s Manchester office (who, in
                    Steyn LJ’s view (at 197), had greater general authority than the
                    general manager of HIB’s commercial department in London), offered credit
                    facilities to FE because he wanted HIB to invest in FE’s business. Cutting
                    off FE’s credit facilities would probably have caused to FE more harm than
                    the harm which validating those facilities might have caused to HIB; in fact,
                    HIB might not necessarily have incurred any loss despite being held liable to
                    honour the 2 August HP Agreements. The situation in the present case is the
                    converse – APBS is bound to suffer serious losses (which have already
                    materialised) if it is held liable for the fraudulent representations of Chia
                    that (<em>inter alia</em>) APBS had accepted the Credit
                    Facilities, which facilities APBS in fact never needed. We note, by way of
                    further comparison, that in <em>The Raffaella</em>, Refson
                    benefited from the transaction (<em>viz</em>,
                    Soplex’s purchase of the ship in question and her cargo of cement) as it
                    acted as Soplex’s banker for that transaction. This point is, of course,
                    not decisive of the issue at hand, but, in our view, it is a relevant factor in
                    determining whether the loss occasioned by an agent’s fraud or
                    unauthorised conduct should be borne by the principal or by the third party who
                    deals with the agent, where both the principal and the third party are innocent
                    parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_61"></a>61     For the foregoing reasons, it is our view that
                        <em>First Energy</em> should be understood as a case
                    that was decided on the basis of the wide-ranging authority that Mr J, as
                    the senior manager of HIB’s Manchester office, was found to have.
                    Different kinds of agents have different authority in different settings. In the
                    present case, it cannot be said that the Judge was wrong in declining to accord
                    to Chia the same extent of authority as that accorded to Mr J in <em>First Energy</em>. There was little evidence, unlike in the
                    case of <em>First Energy</em>, to demonstrate that Chia
                    possessed ostensible authority to make representations that APBS had accepted
                    the Credit Facilities. Chia was only a finance manager of one company in a large
                    corporate group, a position that would carry with it less general authority than
                    the position of a general manager (in this regard, it should be noted that APBL
                    had a group general manager), a finance director or a managing director.
                    Furthermore, Chia’s authority as Finance Manager was not well known to the
                    commercial world, and was certainly unknown to both the Appellants, which knew
                    only what Chia had told their officers. Given these circumstances, there was no
                    reason for any lending bank to assume, based on the appearance of things, that
                    Chia had authority to represent that APBS had accepted credit facilities offered
                    by the bank.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Vicarious Liability Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_62"></a>62     We turn now to the Vicarious Liability Issue,
                    where the question to be determined is whether APBS should be held vicariously
                    liable for Chia’s fraud on the Appellants. In our discussion of this
                    issue, we shall, for convenience, use the terms “employer” and
                    “employee” to also denote a principal and an agent
                    respectively.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_63"></a>63     In analysing the Vicarious Liability Issue,
                    the Judge considered the relevant leading authorities to be <em>Lloyd (Pauper) v Grace, Smith &amp; Co</em> [1912] AC 716
                        (“<em>Lloyd v Grace Smith</em>”) and
                        <em>Armagas</em>. She stated (at [194] of the HC
                    Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If vicarious liability of [APBS] is to be established, the act of deceit
                        – fraudulently representing the [APBS] [B]oard resolutions as genuine
                        – must be made in the course of Chia’s employment … The
                        question of whether an employee was acting in the course of his employment
                        (and in the case of an agent, in the course of his authority) is to be
                        decided according to the same test as [the test for determining] whether the
                        matters complained of were within the employee’s express, implied or
                        ostensible authority. The House of Lords in <em>Armagas</em> … confirmed what had been stated in <em>Lloyd v Grace Smith</em>[,] [<em>viz</em>,] that there is no difference between the question
                        whether the employee was acting in the course of his employment and the
                        question whether he was acting within the scope of his actual or ostensible
                        authority … In short, on both issues, the same test applies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Applying the aforesaid principle, the Judge rejected the
                    Appellants’ case on vicarious liability because (see [198] of the HC
                    Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… Chia did not have authority to enter into a binding agreement and
                        was not held out as having such authority; or as having apparent authority
                        to communicate approval of the transaction on the part of someone more
                        senior (<em>ie</em>, the [APBS Board]) or to warrant
                        the genuineness of the extracts of the [APBS] [B]oard resolutions.
                        Therefore, the act of deceit which was the false representation was not
                        practised in the course of Chia’s employment. Accordingly, the case of
                        the [Appellants] on vicarious liability fails for the same reasons as [the
                        reasons for which] I have rejected the agency claim based on ostensible
                        authority.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Appellants’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_64"></a>64     Before this court, the Appellants’ case
                    on vicarious liability is that the Judge should not have relied on the principle
                    laid down in <em>Lloyd v Grace Smith</em> (and reaffirmed
                    in <em>Armagas</em>) as it has been superseded by what is
                    commonly termed “the ‘close connection’ test” (also
                    known as “the <em>Lister</em> test” because
                    the test was first applied in England in the House of Lords case of <em>Lister and others v Hesley Hall Ltd</em> [2002] 1 AC 215
                        (“<em>Lister</em>”)). The “close
                    connection” test is currently the accepted test in English law for
                    establishing vicarious liability. The Appellants argue that on the basis of the
                    “close connection” test, APBS is vicariously liable to them for
                    Chia’s fraudulent acts as there was a close connection between those acts
                    and Chia’s employment as APBS’s finance manager. APBS’s
                    counter-argument is that the “close connection” test should be
                    confined to sexual abuse cases involving young and vulnerable victims, and that,
                    in any case, APBS would not be vicariously liable for the fraudulent acts of
                    Chia even if the “close connection” test were applied. It should
                    be noted that in the court below, the Judge did not consider it necessary to
                    rule on the applicability or otherwise of the “close connection”
                    test. (Her view was that the House of Lords in <em>Lister</em> adopted the “close connection” test, which
                    was “a looser test of connection between the [tortious] acts in question
                    and the employment” (see the HC Judgment at [199]), because that case
                    involved the sexual abuse of young and vulnerable victims in circumstances where
                    victim compensation was a legitimate policy consideration and where the ability
                    of the employer to pay compensation militated against shielding it from
                    liability.)</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The origin and development of the “close connection”
                test</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_65"></a>65     It is not necessary for us to either examine
                    or discuss in detail the origin of the “close connection” test.
                    There is a great deal of judicial pronouncement and academic writing on it. It
                    suffices to say that according to the House of Lords in <em>Lister</em> (at [36]–[37] <em>per</em> Lord Clyde and at [69]–[70] <em>per</em> Lord Millett), the “close
                    connection” test is merely a reformulation of what we shall hereafter
                    call “the Salmond test” (<em>ie</em>, the
                    test first enunciated in John William Salmond, <em>The Law of
                        Torts</em> (Stevens &amp; Haynes, 1907)), which common law courts have
                    applied for decades, and not a radical departure from it. This test, as
                    currently restated in R F V Heuston &amp; R A Buckley,
                        <em>Salmond and Heuston on the Law of Torts</em> (Sweet
                    &amp; Maxwell, 21st Ed, 1996) (“<em>Salmond and
                        Heuston</em>”) at p 443, rests on the principle
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">A master is not responsible for a wrongful act done by his servant unless
                        it is done in the course of [the servant’s] employment. It is deemed
                        to be so done if it is either (1) a wrongful act authorised by the
                        master, or (2) a wrongful and unauthorised mode of doing some act
                        authorised by the master.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_66"></a>66     The first limb of the Salmond test is
                    uncontroversial. However, the second limb has always posed difficulties in terms
                    of application. In particular, it is often difficult to determine whether the
                    tortious act in question is an unauthorised mode of doing an act authorised by
                    the employer, or an act outside the scope of the employee’s employment
                    altogether. As P S Atiyah commented in <em>Vicarious
                        Liability in the Law of Torts</em> (Butterworths, 1967), the Salmond
                    test is (at p 172):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… an apparently simple test whose simplicity is largely deceptive.
                        Indeed, to reconcile this test with the whole body of case law on this
                        subject requires a good deal of verbal sleight of hand.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_67"></a>67     While the Salmond test may produce just
                    results in cases of negligence, it has been recognised for a long time that it
                    may not do so in cases of intentional torts. This is because it is often
                    difficult to regard a deliberate attempt by an employee to commit a tort (and
                    thereby contravene the terms of his employment) as an “unauthorised mode
                    of doing some act authorised by the master” (see <em>Salmond and Heuston</em> at p 443), even though justice demands,
                    under certain circumstances, that the employer should be made liable. Indeed,
                    the Salmond test has been criticised as being artificial and inadequate in
                    determining vicarious liability for intentional torts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_68"></a>68     The difficulty with the Salmond test has been
                    most strikingly brought home in cases involving sexual abuse of young and
                    vulnerable victims by employees of social welfare homes. Such cases have
                    recently increased in Canada and England. Up to 1999, the English courts applied
                    the Salmond test in its traditional formulation (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Trotman v North Yorkshire County
                        Council</em> [1999] LGR 584 (“<em>Trotman</em>”), where the English CA, applying the traditional
                    formulation, held that a school was not liable for the indecent assault
                    committed by its deputy headmaster on a pupil who shared a room with him while
                    they were on a school-sanctioned trip as what the deputy headmaster did was not
                    an unauthorised mode of performing an authorised act, but an independent act
                    outside the scope of his employment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_69"></a>69     The English CA’s approach in <em>Trotman</em> was rejected by the Canadian Supreme Court in
                        <em>The Children’s Foundation, the Superintendent of
                        Family and Child Services in the Province of British Columbia and Her
                        Majesty The Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia as
                        represented by the Ministry of Social Services and Housing v Patrick Allan
                        Bazley</em> [1999] 2 SCR 534 (referred to hereafter as
                        “<em>Bazley v Curry</em>”, as this case
                    is more commonly known), where, on substantially similar facts, the court
                    declined to follow <em>Trotman</em> and held the employer
                    liable. The court (<em>per</em> McLachlin J) said (at
                        [24]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]he opinion’s [<em>ie</em>,
                            <em>Trotman</em>’s] reasoning depends on the
                        level of generality with which the sexual act is described. Instead of
                        describing the act in terms of the employee’s duties of supervising
                        and caring for vulnerable students during a study trip abroad, the [English
                        CA] cast it in terms unrelated to those duties. Important legal decisions
                        should not turn on such semantics.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court propounded a new test –
                    <em>viz</em>, the “close connection” test
                    – as follows (at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The fundamental question is <em>whether the wrongful act
                            is</em><em><u>sufficiently related</u></em><em>to conduct authorized by the employer to justify the
                            imposition of vicarious liability</em>. Vicarious liability is
                        generally appropriate where there is <em>a significant
                            connection between the</em><em><u>creation or enhancement of a risk</u></em><em>and the wrong that accrues therefrom</em>, even if
                        unrelated to the employer’s desires. [underlining in original;
                        emphasis added in italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Since then, the courts in Canada have applied the “close
                    connection” test to all cases involving religious bodies whose employees
                        (<em>ie</em>, priests, deacons, <em>etc</em>) have sexually assaulted or abused young and vulnerable
                    victims under their charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_70"></a>70     In <em>Roman Catholic Episcopal
                        Corporation of St George’s v John Doe (a pseudonym) and John Doe
                        (a pseudonym)</em> [2004] 1 SCR 436 (referred to hereafter
                    by its more commonly used case name, “<em>John Doe v
                        Bennett</em>”), where an Episcopal corporation was held liable
                    for the sexual misconduct of a parish priest <em>vis-à-vis</em> young boys under his charge, the Supreme Court of
                    Canada (<em>per</em> McLachlin CJ) restated the
                    rationale of vicarious liability as follows (at [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Vicarious liability is based on the rationale that the person who puts a
                        risky enterprise into the community may fairly be held responsible when
                        those risks emerge and cause loss or injury to members of the public.
                        Effective compensation is a goal. Deterrence is also a consideration. The
                        hope is that holding the employer or principal liable will encourage such
                        persons to take steps to reduce the risk of harm in the future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The court applied a two-stage test to determine whether and when an
                    employer would be held vicariously liable for the wrongdoing of an employee.
                    This involved examining, first, “whether there [were] precedents which
                    unambiguously determine[d] whether the case should attract vicarious
                    liability” (at [20]), and,
                    second, if there were no such precedents, “whether vicarious liability
                    should be imposed in light of the broader policy rationales behind strict
                    liability” (at [20], citing,
                        <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Bazley v
                        Curry</em> at [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_71"></a>71     In <em>Lister</em>, the
                    House of Lords adopted the “close connection” test and applied it
                    to facts similar to those in <em>Bazley v Curry</em>. In
                        <em>Lister</em>, the residents of a boarding house, who
                    had been put there because of their emotional and behavioural difficulties, were
                    sexually abused by the warden of the boarding house. The House of Lords held
                    that the owner of the boarding house was vicariously liable for the torts of the
                    warden, and rejected the reasoning in <em>Trotman</em> that
                    sexual abuse by an employee of young and vulnerable persons under his care was
                    not a mode, whether authorised or not, of carrying out his duties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_72"></a>72     Lord Steyn expressed the view (with which
                    Lord Hutton agreed) that “[t]he question [was] whether the
                    [employee]’s torts were so closely connected with his employment that it
                    would be fair and just to hold the [employer] vicariously liable” (at
                        [28] of <em>Lister</em>). In a similar vein, Lord Clyde stated (at [37]) that “[w]hat ha[d] essentially to
                    be considered [was] the connection, if any, between the act in question and the
                    employment”; in this regard, his Lordship cautioned that “the mere
                    opportunity to commit the act” (at [45]) was not sufficient. Lord Millett enunciated the
                    relevant test in terms of “[whether] the unauthorised acts of the
                    employee [were] so connected with acts which the employer ha[d] authorised that
                    they [might] properly be regarded as being within the scope of [the
                    employee’s] employment” (at [69]), and stressed that “[w]hat [was] critical [was]
                    … the closeness of the connection between the employee’s duties and
                    his wrongdoing” (at [70]).
                    Focusing on the connection between the duties of the employee and his
                    wrongdoing, Lord Millett opined, would accord with the underlying rationale
                    of the doctrine of vicarious liability (which his Lordship accepted was
                    “a loss-distribution device” (at [65])).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_73"></a>73     Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough, on the
                    other hand, appeared to take a different approach from that of the other four
                    law lords. His Lordship described the sexual abuse cases (including <em>Trotman</em> and <em>Bazley v
                    Curry</em>) as cases where “the employer ha[d] assumed a
                    relationship to the plaintiff which impose[d] specific duties in tort upon the
                    employer and the role of the employee (or servant) [was] that he [was] the
                    person to whom the employer ha[d] entrusted the performance of those
                    duties” (see <em>Lister</em> at [54]), and expressed the view that “the
                    correct approach … [was] to ask what was the duty of the servant towards
                    the plaintiff which was broken by the servant and what was the contractual duty
                    of the servant towards his employer” (at [60]). However, it would seem that the approach taken by
                    Lord Hobhouse was ultimately still predicated on the “close
                    connection” test as, immediately before setting out the aforesaid
                    “correct approach” at [60]
                    of <em>Lister</em>, his Lordship stated (at [59]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">If … the servant’s employment merely gave the servant the
                        opportunity to do what he did without more, there will be no vicarious
                        liability[;] hence the use [in the] Salmond [test] and in the Scottish and
                        some other authorities of the word “<em>connection</em>” to indicate something which is not a
                        casual coincidence but [which] has the requisite relationship to the
                        employment of the tortfeasor (servant) by his employer … [emphasis

                        party which had appointed him as its nominee director.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Our views on the “close connection” test </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_75"></a>75     In our view, the “close
                    connection” test is, as Bokhary PJ commented in <em>Ming An</em>, “an intellectually satisfying and practical
                    criterion” (at [19]) for
                    determining whether vicarious liability should be imposed on an employer for
                    “all torts committed by an employee during an unauthorised course of
                    conduct, whether intentional wrongdoing or mere inadvertence is involved”
                    (at [25]). This is because the test
                    “imposes vicarious liability when, but only when, it would be fair and
                    just to do so” (at [19]) and,
                    moreover, “provides a workable concept, namely[,] a sufficiently close
                    connection, for determining in each case whether [imposing vicarious liability]
                    would be fair and just” (at [19]). This test requires the court to “openly confront the
                    question of whether liability should lie against the employer, rather than
                    obscuring the decision beneath semantic discussions of ‘scope of
                    employment’ and ‘mode of conduct’” (<em>per</em> McLachlin J in <em>Bazley v
                        Curry</em> at [41]). What the
                    court has to do in each case is to examine all the relevant circumstances
                    –
                    <em>including policy considerations</em> – and
                    determine whether it would be fair and just to impose vicarious liability on the
                    employer. For instance, it is difficult to argue, on policy grounds, that victim
                    compensation should not prevail in cases involving defenceless and vulnerable
                    victims, such as young children who have been sexually abused by employees of
                    welfare homes, however innocent the employer might be. But, the same policy
                    consideration may not be valid in the case of an international bank which is the
                    victim of a commercial fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_76"></a>76     In <em>John Doe v
                        Bennett</em> at [20]
                    (reproduced at <a href="#p1_70">[70]</a> above),
                    McLachlin CJ highlighted two policy considerations underlying the doctrine
                    of vicarious liability, namely: (a) effective compensation for the victim;
                    and (b) deterrence of future harm by encouraging the employer to take steps
                    to reduce the risk of similar harm in future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_77"></a>77     
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    first of the aforesaid policy considerations, we are of the view that an
                    innocent victim of an employee’s tort should, under ordinary
                    circumstances, be compensated. In this regard, the employer is usually the
                    person best placed and most able to provide effective compensation to the
                    victim. In our view, making the employer vicariously liable is not only a
                    practical solution, but also fair and just. After all, a person who employs
                    another to advance his own interests and thereby creates a risk of his employee
                    committing a tort should bear responsibility for any adverse consequences
                    resulting therefrom. This view is buttressed by the consideration that the
                    employer may redistribute the cost of providing compensation for his
                    employee’s torts through mechanisms such as insurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_78"></a>78     We should at the same time point out, however,
                    that the objective of victim compensation rests on the implicit premise that the
                    victim of the tort is not at fault for the tort, or at least bears less fault
                    for the tort than the party who is morally responsible for the tort (“the
                    blameworthy party”). The main touchstone of legal liability at common law
                    is usually, and justifiably, moral culpability. Where possible, the law
                    endeavours to make the blameworthy party bear, to a commensurate extent, the
                    financial consequences of his wrongdoing. Vicarious liability, in contrast,
                    operates regardless of whether there is any fault on the part of the person who
                    is ultimately made to provide compensation for the blameworthy party’s
                    wrongdoing (“the ultimate defendant”). More specifically,
                    vicarious liability only comes into play when the law is unable, for practical
                    reasons, to make the blameworthy party bear the financial costs of the tort. As
                    a form of “strict” liability in the sense of liability imposed
                    without necessarily requiring any fault on the ultimate defendant’s part,
                    vicarious liability is an anomaly in the common law. For this reason, vicarious
                    liability can only be justified if the victim of the tort is himself not at
                    fault, or is less at fault than the blameworthy party and/or the ultimate
                    defendant. It is only in a situation where the primary device for imposing
                    liability –
                    <em>ie</em>, fault – is incapable of providing the
                    victim with effective compensation from the blameworthy party that resort to
                    other factors to assign liability (and, thus, provide effective victim
                    compensation) may be justified. In other words, a precondition for the
                    imposition of vicarious liability is that the victim seeking compensation should
                    either be without fault himself, or be less at fault than the blameworthy party
                    and/or the ultimate defendant; otherwise, the policy of victim compensation as a
                    justification for imposing vicarious liability loses much of its moral
                    force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_79"></a>79     Turning now to the second policy consideration
                    highlighted by McLachlin CJ at [20]
                    of <em>John Doe v Bennett</em>, <em>viz</em>, deterrence of future harm, this rests on the premise that
                    penalising an employer for his employees’ torts will provide him with an
                    incentive to take steps to reduce the incidence of accidents and tortious
                    behaviour by his employees. As McLachlin J astutely noted in <em>Bazley v Curry</em> (at [33]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Beyond the narrow band of employer conduct that attracts direct liability
                        in negligence lies a vast area where imaginative and efficient
                        administration and supervision can reduce the risk that the employer has
                        introduced into the community. Holding the employer vicariously liable for
                        the wrongs of its employee may encourage the employer to take such steps,
                        and hence, reduce the risk of future harm.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_80"></a>80     In our view, the aforesaid policy
                    consideration, which is aimed at promoting efficiency in business enterprises
                    through deterrence, is a legitimate one. However, like victim compensation, it
                    rests on the fundamental premise that the employer is best placed, relative to
                    everybody else, to manage the risks of his business enterprise and prevent
                    wrongdoing from occurring. In many cases, this premise may hold true. Employers
                    are often well positioned to stem the occurrence of accidents as they have the
                    ability to control their employees (see Fleming James Jr, “Vicarious
                    Liability” (1953–1954) 28 Tul L Rev 161 at
                    p 168). However, this is not always the case. In some situations, the
                    person best placed, or at least better placed, to prevent the tort may well be
                    the victim himself or a third party. This may occur, for example, where an
                    independent contractor or some other third party independent of the employer
                    supplies all the equipment required to perform a job which is part and parcel of
                    the employer’s business enterprise. In yet other cases, the type of tort
                    that occurs is, realistically speaking, uncontrollable and, therefore, not
                    amenable to deterrence. This is particularly relevant to torts committed in the
                    course of excessively risky business enterprises, spur-of-the-moment torts and
                    intentional torts. In such situations, it may well be possible to find that the
                    employer has done all that is reasonable to deter the tort and yet has failed to
                    prevent the commission of the tort. In such situations, deterrence as a
                    justification for imposing vicarious liability loses much of its
                force.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_81"></a>81     In addition to the above points, it is also
                    important to note that while victim compensation and deterrence are relevant and
                    desirable policy considerations in deciding whether vicarious liability should
                    be imposed, they cannot in themselves be determinative of every case. The courts
                    are, after all, neither welfare agencies nor workplace safety regulators. The
                    applicability of victim compensation and deterrence as valid policy
                    considerations in a particular case does not inevitably lead to the conclusion
                    that the employer should be held vicariously liable; <em>vice
                        versa</em>, the inapplicability of these considerations does not mean
                    that the employer may not be made vicariously liable. There may well be other
                    potentially relevant policy considerations which may act as a counterweight to
                    victim compensation and deterrence. As to what these other policy considerations
                    are, it is impossible for us to anticipate or list them exhaustively. Each case
                    must be decided on its facts. We can provide no guidance of greater specificity
                    than to reiterate the sentiment expressed by Bokhary PJ in <em>Ming An</em> (at [19]) that in the final analysis, the ultimate goals of fairness and
                    justice must be paramount:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">By “close connection” is meant a connection between the
                        employee’s unauthorised tortious act and his employment which is so
                        close as to make it <em>fair and just</em> to hold his
                        employer vicariously liable. … [V]icarious liability [is imposed]
                        when, but only when, it would be <em>fair and just</em>
                        to do so. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_82"></a>82     We are aware that many people may be
                    uncomfortable with the idea of judges making decisions based on policy
                    considerations of what is fair and just in the circumstances.
                    Lord Hobhouse, for one, was of the view that it was not appropriate to
                    follow the policy-based approach taken by the Canadian Supreme Court in
                        <em>Bazley v Curry</em>. His Lordship stated (at
                        [60] of <em>Lister</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… I do not believe that it is appropriate to follow the lead given
                        by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Bazley v
                            Curry</em> … The judgments [given by the various members of
                        the bench in <em>Bazley v Curry</em>] contain a useful
                        and impressive discussion of the social and economic reasons for having a
                        principle of vicarious liability as part of the law of tort which extends to
                        embrace acts of child abuse. But an exposition of the policy reasons for a
                        rule (or even a description) is not the same as defining the criteria for
                        its application. Legal rules have to have a greater degree of clarity and
                        definition than is provided by simply explaining the reasons for the
                        existence of the rule and the social need for it, instructive though that
                        may be. In English law that clarity is provided by the application of the
                        criterion to which I have referred derived from the English authorities
                            [<em>ie</em>, the criterion of “comparison
                        of the duties respectively owed by the servant to the plaintiff and to [the]
                        employer” (see, likewise, [60] of <em>Lister</em>)].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_83"></a>83     In our view, Lord Hobhouse’s
                    concern is a valid one – but only up to a point. There is, of course, a
                    difference between the policy reasons for a legal rule and the criteria for the
                    application of that rule. The courts will apply a legal rule without reference
                    to the policy reasons underlying it where the rule is clear and the facts fall
                    within the rule. But, the problem here is that the English courts have thus far
                    not been able to forge a legal rule of sufficient clarity for deciding, without
                    having any regard to policy considerations, all vicarious liability cases. In
                    our view, since the “close connection” test requires an
                    employee’s tort to be sufficiently closely connected with the
                    employee’s employment before vicarious liability can be imposed on the
                    employer, policy considerations would and should have an important role in
                    determining whether, in any particular case, it would be fair and just to hold
                    the employer vicariously liable. In this connection, we should point out that
                    the criterion which Lord Hobhouse referred to at [60] of <em>Lister</em>
                    (reproduced in the preceding paragraph), when applied in the specific context of
                    sexual abuse cases, would coincide with the policy consideration of victim
                    compensation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_84"></a>84     We should also add that the “close
                    connection” test, which emphasises the degree of connection between risk
                    and harm (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Bazley v
                        Curry</em> at [41]), is
                    – conceptually – closely related to the test laid down by this court
                    in <em>Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science &amp;
                        Technology Agency</em> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 100 (“<em>Spandeck</em>”) for determining whether a duty of care
                    exists under the law of negligence. That test (“the <em>Spandeck</em> test”) is a “two-stage test premised on
                    proximity and policy considerations, … [and] preceded by a preliminary
                    requirement of factual foreseeability” [emphasis in original omitted]
                    (see <em>Spandeck</em> at [73]). If a claim based on vicarious liability fails the
                    “close connection” test, it is <em>not
                        likely</em> that that claim will pass the <em>Spandeck</em> test <em>vis-à-vis</em> a claim in
                    negligence, and <em>vice versa</em>, as both tests take
                    into account the criterion of foreseeability of harm occurring to the victim.
                    This, of course, does not entail that a finding of liability in negligence can
                    never be made where a claim in vicarious liability fails, and <em>vice versa</em>. The two doctrines are, after all, not exactly
                    identical. Our point is simply that the doctrines of negligence and vicarious
                    liability are closely related, and the courts should be slow to find liability
                    under one doctrine when they are unable to find a corresponding liability under
                    the other.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_85"></a>85     Over and above the points discussed above, it
                    is important to bear in mind, when applying the “close connection”
                    test, that this test is not a rigid definition of the circumstances which give
                    rise to vicarious liability, but a guide to the principled application of the
                    law to diverse factual situations. In the words of Bokhary PJ in <em>Ming An</em> at [25]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">This is not to say that this criterion [of a close connection between the
                        tort committed by the employee and his employment] is to be treated like a
                        statutory formula. Its application is always to be undertaken in context. I
                        dare say that the requisite connection will prove in practice to be more
                        readily found in certain types of case[s] than in others. But the basic
                        criterion having been applied, the disposal of each case will always turn
                        ultimately on its own facts and the particular considerations which they
                        raise. This is saying no more than what Lord Eldon LC famously
                        intervened to observe in the course of the argument in <em>Gee v Pritchard</em> (1818) 2 Swans 402 at p.414; 36 ER
                        670 at p.674, namely[,] that doctrines ought to lay down “fixed
                        principles” while “taking care that they are to be applied
                        according to the circumstances of each case”.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Application of the “close connection” test in cases of
                fraud</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_86"></a>86     The present case concerns the fraud of Chia,
                    who was the finance manager of APBS at the material time. In <em>Lister</em>, their Lordships made no distinction between intentional
                    acts and inadvertent acts in applying the “close connection” test
                    as they did not consider it necessary to put any particular type of case into a
                    special category where a different rule of liability should apply. We agree with
                    this approach. Given the reality that any employee may commit a tort
                    intentionally in the course of his employment even where he is prohibited from
                    doing the act constituting the tort, we see no justification for distinguishing
                    cases of fraud from other intentional torts. Fraud is just another kind of
                    intentional tort. It is different from, for instance, an intentional tort like
                    assault only in so far as it usually gives rise to economic loss rather than
                    physical harm to the victim. The test for whether vicarious liability should be
                    imposed on the employer will still be whether the fraud of the employee is so
                    closely connected with his employment that it is fair and just that the employer
                    should be held vicariously liable for the employee’s fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Relevant factors in applying the “close connection”
                test </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_87"></a>87     Under the “close connection”
                    test, vicarious liability is imposed on an employer where, in the words of
                    McLachlin J at [41] of <em>Bazley v Curry</em>, “there is a significant
                    connection between the <u>creation or enhancement of a
                        risk</u> and the wrong that accrues therefrom, even if unrelated to
                    the employer’s desires” [underlining in original]. Her Honour went
                    on to outline some of the factors relevant in determining whether the requisite
                    degree of connection exists in a particular case, as follows (see <em>Bazley v Curry</em> at [41]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the opportunity that the enterprise afforded the
                            employee to abuse his or her power;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    the extent to which the wrongful act may have
                            furthered the employer’s aims (and hence be more likely to have
                            been committed by the employee);</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the extent to which the wrongful act was related
                            to friction, confrontation or intimacy inherent in the employer’s
                            enterprise;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the extent of power conferred on the employee in
                            relation to the victim;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    the vulnerability of potential victims to wrongful
                            exercise of the employee’s power.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_88"></a>88     In all the cases involving sexual abuse of
                    young and vulnerable victims, such as <em>Bazley v
                        Curry</em>, <em>Lister</em>, <em>John Doe v Bennett</em>, <em>Maga</em> and
                        <em>Lepore</em>, most of the five criteria listed above
                    were satisfied. Opportunity, time and circumstance were all present. Even in
                        <em>Ming An</em>, which was not a sexual abuse case
                    (that case concerned, instead, negligent driving by an employee), the court
                    found the above criteria fulfilled. It may also be noted that in all those
                    cases, the employee’s tort was committed unilaterally on the victim, in
                    the sense that the victim played no part in the commission of the tort. In
                    contrast, the case of a commercial fraud perpetrated by an employee of a trading
                    company against international banks <em>which could have
                        prevented the fraud by taking basic precautions</em> presents quite a
                    different situation, as we shall show below.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_89"></a>89     Applying the “close connection”
                    test to the facts of this case, and taking into account the policy
                    considerations relevant to its application, we are of the view that APBS should
                        <em>not</em> be held vicariously liable to the
                    Appellants for the fraud committed by Chia. We have arrived at this conclusion
                    for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_90"></a>90     First, although it can be superficially argued
                    that there was a functional connection between Chia’s employment as
                    APBS’s finance manager and Chia’s fraudulent scheme, the connection
                    was in fact illusory. This is because although the position of Finance Manager
                    gave Chia substantial operational authority, it gave him very limited financial
                    authority – in respect of the latter, Chia’s authority was limited
                    to placing APBS’s surplus funds in fixed deposits, forwarding (with the
                    approval of APBS’s general manager) requests for credit facilities to
                    F&amp;N Group Treasury (via APBL Group Finance) for review and ensuring
                    compliance by APBS with covenants and obligations under loans and other credit
                    facilities taken out by APBS (see <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>–<a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). Chia
                    himself had no power to source for credit facilities for ABPS, much less to
                    borrow money on its behalf. Chia’s fraudulent acts lay in falsely
                    representing to the Appellants that APBS had accepted the Credit Facilities and
                    that the forged ABPS Board resolutions which he gave them were genuine. Those
                    fraudulent acts were not connected with Chia’s employment at
                all.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_91"></a>91     Second, it would not be reasonable for this
                    court to hold that it was within APBS’s contemplation that there was a
                    risk that Chia might defraud a third party which he had no authority to deal
                    with as Finance Manager. If Chia had defrauded either OCBC (the main banker of
                    the APBL group of companies) or some other bank which APBS had existing dealings
                    with, then the nexus between his fraud and his employment would have been
                    closer. The same may be said if Chia had defrauded APBS itself. Indeed, as a
                    cash-rich company, APBS should, if anything, have been more concerned about Chia
                    defrauding it (however, APBS apparently believed (or at least acted in the
                    belief), to its own cost, that Chia was an honest employee). It is important to
                    remember, in the present case, that Chia had no authority to even source for
                    credit facilities for APBS, let alone borrow money on its behalf. Further, no
                    credit facilities could be accepted on APBS’s behalf without a valid APBS
                    Board resolution. In this regard, forging a board resolution to defraud is a
                    serious offence. Given these circumstances, it would not be reasonable to hold
                    that APBS should have expected that Chia would be so audacious as to commit, and
                    commit successfully, a fraud on banks with which it had no prior dealings.
                    Chia’s fraud was, in our view, entirely unforeseeable as far as APBS was
                    concerned.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_92"></a>92     Third, the policy consideration of victim
                    compensation is not relevant in this case. The Appellants are banks with
                    international branches and are financially in a much stronger position than APBS
                    to bear the losses caused by Chia’s fraud. Further, the Appellants are not
                    vulnerable victims: they have all the means and resources, both administrative
                    and legal, to protect themselves from fraudulent acts such as those committed by
                    Chia. Indeed, the greater part of the fault for the successful commission of the
                    fraud by Chia lies with the Appellants as they failed to adopt and/or maintain
                    adequate fraud prevention measures. Vicarious liability is a convenient
                    loss-distribution device to compensate an innocent victim. However, in a case
                    where the tort committed by the blameworthy party has caused loss to both the
                    victim and the ultimate defendant (<em>ie</em>, where the
                    ultimate defendant is also a victim of the same tort), the imposition of
                    vicarious liability is not justified if the victim bears more fault for the tort
                    than the ultimate defendant (see <a href="#p1_78">[78]</a>
                    above). In this connection, it bears reiteration that on the facts of this case,
                    there is little doubt that much of the blame for the successful perpetration of
                    Chia’s fraud on the Appellants lay with the Appellants themselves rather
                    than with APBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_93"></a>93     Fourth, <em>vis-à-vis</em> the policy consideration of deterrence, it works both
                    ways in the present case. Whilst imposing vicarious liability on APBS may induce
                    employers to take more stringent measures when appointing officers to senior
                    positions and/or to be more vigilant in supervising their senior officers’
                    activities, this consideration applies equally (if not with even greater force)
                    to the Appellants against the backdrop of banks lending money to corporate
                    borrowers without first carrying out proper checks and due diligence procedures
                    and/or without first obtaining all the required documentation. Banks play a
                    vital role in the economic life of a community as deposit-taking institutions
                    and suppliers of investment capital for the economy. There is, therefore, a
                    greater need for banks (as compared to trading companies such as APBS) to act
                    responsibly and not take undue risks with their depositors’ funds so that
                    the public will have confidence in the banking system.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_94"></a>94     In the present case, Chia’s fraud could
                    have been prevented by the Appellants taking very elementary precautions, such
                    as contacting any of APBS’s directors before granting the Credit
                    Facilities to verify that APBS had indeed accepted those credit facilities.
                    Although (as noted at <a href="#p1_5">[5]</a> above) APBS was
                    careless in its lax supervision of Chia’s activities, the Appellants were,
                    in our view, certainly much more careless in readily lending money to
                    (ostensibly) APBS at Chia’s request without first complying with their own
                    internal controls and due diligence measures. The Appellants practically allowed
                    Chia to defraud them in their eagerness to do business with APBS. Imposing
                    vicarious liability on APBS for Chia’s fraud in the circumstances of this
                    case may create an unacceptable moral hazard, in that banks may, as a result, be
                    encouraged to take only minimal precautions against fraud when dealing with
                    employees holding grand-sounding positions (but with very limited corporate
                    powers), and to merely rely on such employees’ employers to have adequate
                    management structures in place for hiring honest and trustworthy staff as well
                    as on the courts to shield them from losses should they be defrauded. Given the
                    vital role of banks in our economy, there is every reason for the law to hold
                    them to a higher standard of financial prudence and responsibility –
                    especially in relation to fraud prevention – than the standard applicable
                    to trading companies such as APBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_95"></a>95     Finally, if we apply the five factors proposed
                    by McLachlin J in <em>Bazley v Curry</em> at [41] (reproduced at <a href="#p1_87">[87]</a> above) for determining whether the “close
                    connection” test is satisfied in any given case, it can be seen that
                    except for the first factor (which we have found to be at most only tenuously
                    present, if not entirely absent), none of the other four factors are present
                        <em>vis-à-vis</em> Chia’s fraud against the
                    Appellants. Chia’s fraud did not further APBS’s aims, nor was it
                    related to any friction, confrontation or intimacy inherent in APBS’s
                    enterprise. The extent of the power conferred on Chia was limited to banks that
                    APBS had always dealt with (and, being a cash-rich company, APBS did not have to
                    deal with many banks); Chia also had very limited authority where his functions
                    as APBS’s financial manager were concerned (see, <em>inter
                        alia</em>, <a href="#p1_10">[10]</a>–<a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above). Lastly, as we noted earlier (see
                        <a href="#p1_92">[92]</a> above), the Appellants were not
                    vulnerable victims, but were instead in a position to dictate terms to
                    prospective borrowers and thereby protect themselves against fraud, which is
                    what every prudent bank would or should do when granting loans to new
                    customers.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_96"></a>96     For all of the above reasons, we do not accept
                    the Appellants’ argument that it is fair and just to impose vicarious
                    liability on APBS for Chia’s fraud in the present case. Having regard to
                    the circumstances in which the fraud was perpetrated by Chia, we do not find it
                    just and equitable to shift the burden of the losses suffered by the Appellants
                    to APBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Negligence Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_97"></a>97     We turn now to the Negligence Issue as set out
                    at sub-para (c) of <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above. As
                    mentioned earlier, this issue is relevant only between HVB and APBS because
                    negligence was raised as a cause of action by HVB alone (SEB made no claim under
                    this head). HVB’s arguments before us are substantially a reiteration of
                    the arguments presented to but rejected by the Judge. The thrust of HVB’s
                    case is that APBS owes a common law duty of care to HVB because:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_a"></a>(a)     APBS selected Chia specifically to
                        be its finance manager and was in a better position than HVB to exercise
                        control over his activities, but left him unsupervised during the period
                        when he was defrauding the Appellants (among other
                    banks).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_b"></a>(b)     APBS had
                        constructive knowledge, if not actual knowledge through deliberate
                        blindness, that Chia was committing unauthorised acts in the course of his
                        work.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_c"></a>(c)     APBS
                        assumed responsibility towards HVB as a result of its statutory duty under
                        s 199(2A) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), and as
                        a result of its hiring and then failing to properly supervise
                    Chia.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_d"></a>(d)     HVB was not
                        obliged, as a matter of banking practice, to take steps to check whether the
                        forged APBS Board resolution which it received from Chia in connection with
                        the HVB Facility was genuine. Its conduct in its dealings with Chia was
                        entirely consistent with reasonable banking practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_e"></a>(e)     Public policy would not weigh against
                        finding that a duty of care exists in this case as APBS deals, not with an
                        unlimited class of banks, but only with licensed banks in
                    Singapore.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_97-p2_f"></a>(f)     The
                        importance of holding negligent senior management to account and encouraging
                        high standards of corporate governance weighs in favour of finding that APBS
                        owes HVB a duty of care. Since APBS was in a far better position to exercise
                        supervision over Chia and enforce its own internal controls, it would be
                        unjust for the entire risk of Chia’s fraud to fall upon an external
                        party such as HVB, especially considering that this would also have the
                        broader effect of undermining Singapore’s reputation for good
                        corporate governance and as a commercial and financial
                centre.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_98"></a>98     We do not propose to deal in detail with the
                    above arguments as we agree with the Judge’s reasons for rejecting them.
                    We agree with the Judge, for the reasons which she gave, that no common law duty
                    arises under s 199(2A) of the Companies Act. That provision was enacted to
                    safeguard the assets of a company and, hence, was enacted for the
                    company’s benefit, and not for the benefit of any third party who might
                    deal with the company’s officers and employees.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_99"></a>99     In so far as a common law duty under the law
                    of negligence is concerned, we likewise agree with the Judge, for the reasons
                    which she gave, that in the circumstances of the present case, there was no
                    relationship between APBS and HVB sufficient to create the requisite degree of
                    proximity, whether physical, circumstantial or causal, needed to satisfy the
                        <em>Spandeck</em> test. APBS did not assume any
                    responsibility to HVB in relation to its (APBS’s) internal controls and
                    its supervision of Chia. Further, APBS could not have reasonably foreseen that
                    as a consequence of alleged failures in its internal pre-employment procedures
                    and internal controls, an unknown bank in the unknown future would grant in its
                    (APBS’s) name an unauthorised credit facility based on a forged APBS Board
                    resolution and false representations from a finance manager with such limited
                    financial authority as Chia. In this regard, we reiterate that APBL,
                    APBS’s parent company, had set up an elaborate internal procedure under
                    the GTP to control the obtaining of loans from banks by the APBL group of
                    companies. Chia, as the finance manager of APBS, had no authority to source for
                    funds, but only had authority “(with approval from the General Manager)
                    [to] forward request[s] for new or increase in credit facilities to [F&amp;N]
                    Group Treasury (via [APBL] Group Finance) for review”<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_10" id="Ftn_10_1"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> (see cl 3.4.1 of the GTP
                    (reproduced at <a href="#p1_11">[11]</a> above)).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_100"></a>100    Indeed, the limitation on Chia’s
                    authority to deal with banks on APBS’s behalf was so severe that even in
                    the absence of any supervisory lapses on APBS’s part, Chia would not have
                    had the opportunity to defraud a bank like OCBC (with whom APBS had an existing
                    relationship because of the OCBC Account), much less the opportunity to defraud
                    banks with whom APBS had no prior relationship whatsoever. In our view, the
                    imposition of a duty of care on APBS <em>vis-à-vis</em> HVB
                    would mean that any company which employs an employee whose functions include
                    contacting banks might, in the event of the employee defrauding any bank,
                    potentially be liable for the employee’s criminal acts if it has not
                    exercised due care in employing the employee. We do not think there are any
                    policy considerations that warrant imposing, in favour of banks, such a duty of
                    care on companies which borrow money from them. By the nature of their business,
                    banks are regular targets of fraudsters. The law should be slow to shield banks
                    from the consequences of their own carelessness or incompetence (see, in this
                    regard, <a href="#p1_94">[94]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_101"></a>101    In this connection, we also agree with the
                    Judge that HVB belonged to an unlimited class of banks (see the decision of the
                    Privy Council in <em>Robert William John Davis and Another v
                        Percy Radcliffe and Others</em> [1990] 1 WLR 821
                        (“<em>Robert Davis</em>”), which the
                    Judge cited at [227] of the HC Judgment in support of her finding on this
                    point). HVB contends that this finding is not factually correct, and that the
                    relevant class of banks to which a duty of care is owed would be limited to
                    licensed banks in Singapore. In our view, this contention is misconceived. The
                    issue here is whether the class of potential claimants is so unacceptably large
                    as to militate against imposing a duty of care on companies which need to borrow
                    money from banks for their businesses. In <em>Robert
                        Davis</em>, the appellants sued the government body in charge of
                    regulating banks in the Isle of Man when a bank with which they had deposited
                    money was wound up. It was argued by the appellants that the class of companies
                    which the government body allegedly owed a duty of care to was limited to those
                    doing business in the Isle of Man. The Privy Council disagreed, holding that the
                    alleged duty of care would be owed to an unlimited class of companies, and
                    struck out the appellants’ case. Similarly, we are of the view that any
                    duty of care that APBS may owe based on HVB’s arguments would be owed to
                    an unlimited class of banks. This would militate against imposing the said duty
                    of care.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_102"></a>102    Another relevant consideration which the
                    Judge took into account is the established law on the duty of care that bank
                    customers owe to banks (see <em>The Kepitigalla Rubber Estates,
                        Limited v The National Bank of India, Limited</em> [1909] 2 KB
                    1010, <em>Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd and
                        Others</em> [1986] AC 80 (“<em>Tai Hing Cotton
                        Mill</em>”) and <em>United Asian Bank Bhd v Tai
                        Soon Heng Construction Sdn Bhd</em> [1993] 1 MLJ 182). In
                        <em>Tai Hing Cotton Mill</em>, the accounts clerk of a
                    bank’s corporate customer forged the signatures of the customer’s
                    authorised signatories on about 300 cheques and presented those cheques for
                    payment. The customer’s system of internal controls was inadequate to
                    detect the fraud, and the bank honoured the cheques. Nevertheless, the Privy
                    Council held that the customer did not owe a duty to the bank to prevent forgery
                    of its authorised signatories’ signatures. As the Judge ruled, this must
                        <em>a fortiori</em> be the case <em>vis-à-vis</em> the duty (if any) owed by a non-customer (such as
                    APBS) to a bank (see [234] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_103"></a>103    Furthermore, there is a crucial difference
                    between cases like <em>Tai Hing Cotton Mill</em> and the
                    present case. <em>Tai Hing Cotton Mill</em> involved forged
                    signatures on cheques. It is very difficult for banks to detect such forgeries
                    by a visual examination of the signatures appearing on cheques that they are
                    asked to honour. Yet, the courts hold banks liable for any failure to spot
                    forgeries because, as Lord Scarman said in <em>Tai Hing
                        Cotton Mill</em> (at 106):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The business of banking is the business not of the customer but of the
                        bank. They offer a service, which is to honour their customer’s
                        cheques when drawn upon an account in credit or within an agreed overdraft
                        limit. If they pay out upon cheques which are not his, they are acting
                        outside their mandate and cannot plead his authority in justification of
                        their debit to his account. This is a risk of the service which it is their
                        business to offer.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In comparison, in the present case, it was relatively easy for HVB to
                    check whether Chia was authorised to represent that APBS had accepted the HVB
                    Facility. All it had to do was to comply with its own due diligence procedures
                    for verifying the signatures of the directors on the forged APBS Board
                    resolution provided by Chia to show that APBS had (ostensibly) accepted the HVB
                    Facility (especially given that APBS was a customer with whom HVB did not have a
                    prior relationship). That HVB had the ability to prevent Chia’s fraud by
                    using reasonable means of verification provides even less reason for this court
                    to impose a duty of care on APBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_104"></a>104    Finally, we agree with the Judge that even
                    if APBS did owe HVB a duty of care and, further, breached this duty by its lax
                    supervision of Chia, thereby giving Chia the opportunity to cheat HVB, such
                    breach did not cause HVB’s loss. The proximate cause of the loss was
                    HVB’s own negligence in believing the representations made by Chia apropos
                    the HVB Facility and in readily accepting as genuine the forged APBS Board
                    resolution which Chia provided in connection with that facility without
                    verifying the directors’ signatures on that resolution.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_105"></a>105    We earlier stated (at <a href="#p1_84">[84]</a> above) that, conceptually, the “close
                    connection” test under the law of vicarious liability is closely related
                    to the <em>Spandeck</em> test under the law of negligence.
                    In our view, given our ruling that APBS is not vicariously liable to the
                    Appellants for Chia’s fraud because the fraud was not so closely connected
                    with Chia’s employment as to make it fair and just to impose vicarious
                    liability on APBS, the court should exercise caution in imposing liability on
                    APBS under the law of negligence. This is because the “close
                    connection” test requires the court to consider, amongst other factors,
                    whether the tortious acts committed by the employee in the course of his
                    employment were foreseeable, and foreseeability is likewise a key ingredient of
                    liability in negligence (see <a href="#p1_73">[73]</a> of
                        <em>Spandeck</em>). We see no compelling reason why the
                    doctrines of vicarious liability and negligence should arrive at different
                    conclusions in the present case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_106"></a>106    For the above reasons, we affirm the
                    Judge’s decision to reject HVB’s claim based on
                negligence.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Restitution Issue and the Restitutionary Counterclaim
                Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Overview</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_107"></a>107    We turn now to SEB’s restitutionary
                    claim, which is being pursued as an alternative to the claims based on agency
                    and vicarious liability, and APBS’s restitutionary counterclaim (<em>ie</em>, the Restitution Issue and the Restitutionary
                    Counterclaim Issue outlined at, respectively, sub-paras (d) and (e) of
                        <a href="#p1_32">[32]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_108"></a>108    The factual context of SEB’s
                    restitutionary claim is as follows. As mentioned at <a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above, between December 2000 and October 2002, Chia
                    withdrew S$45m from the OCBC Account and paid it into the SEB S$ Account. During
                    the same period, he also withdrew S$45,347,671.23 from the SEB S$ Account and
                    paid it into the OCBC Account. (For convenience, we shall hereafter refer to the
                    S$45m transferred from the OCBC Account to the SEB S$ Account as “the
                    APBS S$45m”, and the S$45,347,671.23 transferred from the SEB S$ Account
                    to the OCBC Account as “the SEB S$45.3m”.) A portion of the APBS
                    S$45m was used to repay drawings under the MM Facility, which drawings formed
                    part of the SEB S$45.3m paid into the OCBC Account, leaving a balance of
                    S$29,468.723.30 (“the S$29.5m”) unpaid under that facility. SEB
                    asserts that it paid the S$29.5m (together with the rest of the SEB S$45.3m)
                    into the OCBC Account under a mistake of law induced by Chia’s fraud, and
                    is seeking to recover the S$29.5m from APBS as money had and
                received.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_109"></a>109    APBS denies liability, and has also brought
                    a restitutionary counterclaim against SEB for the whole of the APBS S$45m, which
                    it asserts was unjustly received by SEB at its expense. As counsel for APBS has
                    made it clear that this counterclaim will be pursued only if SEB succeeds in its
                    restitutionary claim for the S$29.5m, we shall first consider the latter
                    claim.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The essential elements of a restitutionary claim</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_110"></a>110    The essential elements of a claim in
                    restitution are well settled. As stated by the Judge at [260]–[261] of the
                    HC Judgment, money paid under a mistake, whether of fact or of law, is generally
                    repayable as money had and received (as just mentioned at <a href="#p1_108">[108]</a> above, the present case concerns money paid
                    under a mistake of law induced by fraud). The defendant must account for and
                    repay the money if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_a"></a>(a)     the defendant has received a
                        benefit (<em>ie</em>, he has been
                    enriched);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_b"></a>(b)     the
                        enrichment is at the plaintiff’s expense;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_c"></a>(c)     it is unjust to allow the defendant to retain
                        the enrichment; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_110-p2_d"></a>(d)     there are no defences available to the defendant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">These four elements are well-recognised (see, <em>eg</em>,
                    the House of Lords case of <em>Banque Financière de la Cité v
                        Parc (Battersea) Ltd and Others</em> [1999] 1 AC 221 at 227 and
                    the Singapore High Court case of <em>Info-communications
                        Development Authority of Singapore v Singapore Telecommunications
                        Ltd</em> [2002] 2 SLR(R) 136 at [70]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The arguments in the court below</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_111"></a>111    In the court below, SEB contended that APBS
                    had been enriched by the S$29.5m as a result of the payment of the SEB S$45.3m
                    (of which the S$29.5m formed a part) into the OCBC Account as it had used the
                    money received to pay its debts and dividends. In support of this argument, SEB
                    relied on the “adoption of benefit” principle, <em>ie</em>, the principle that (<em>per</em>
                    Lord Selborne LC in <em>Blackburn Building Society v
                        Cunliffe, Brooks, &amp; Co</em> (1882) 22 Ch D 61 at
                    71):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [T]hose who pay legitimate demands which they are bound in some
                        way or other to meet, and have had the benefit of other people’s money
                        advanced to them for that purpose, shall not retain that benefit so as, in
                        substance, to make those other people pay their debts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">SEB also cited, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Bannatyne v D &amp; C Maclver</em> [1906]
                    1 KB 103 (“<em>Bannatyne</em>”) and
                        <em>Reid v Rigby &amp; Co</em> [1894] 2 QB 40
                        (“<em>Reid v Rigby</em>”). Both of those
                    cases involved the factual scenario of an agent borrowing money, ostensibly on
                    behalf of his principal, despite having no authority to do so. Part of the money
                    borrowed was used by the agent to discharge his principal’s liabilities,
                    and the balance was used for the agent’s own purposes. In both cases, it
                    was held that the lender could recover from the principal the sum advanced to
                    the agent to the extent to which that sum had been used to discharge the
                    principal’s liabilities. The relevant legal principle was articulated by
                    Romer LJ in <em>Bannatyne</em> (at 109) as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where money is borrowed on behalf of a principal by an agent, the lender
                        believing that the agent has authority though it turns out that his act has
                        not been authorized, or ratified, or adopted by the principal, then,
                        although the principal cannot be sued at law, yet in equity, to the extent
                        to which the money borrowed has in fact been applied in paying legal debts
                        and obligations of the principal, the lender is entitled to stand in the
                        same position as if the money had originally been borrowed by the
                        principal.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_112"></a>112    APBS sought to rebut SEB’s submissions
                    on the “adoption of benefit” principle by pointing out that unlike
                    the factual situation in <em>Bannatyne</em> and <em>Reid v Rigby</em>, in the present case, Chia, who was the
                        <em>de facto</em> borrower under the SEB Facilities
                    (and also under the HVB Facility), did not use the S$29.5m (or, for that matter,
                    any part of the SEB S$45.3m) to discharge <em>APBS’s</em> liabilities; instead, his intention was to use the
                    money to discharge <em>his own</em> liability to APBS in
                    respect of the APBS S$45m which he had misappropriated from the OCBC Account. It
                    was submitted that since the payment of the SEB S$45.3m (including the S$29.5m)
                    into the OCBC Account (which was made on Chia’s instructions) merely
                    served to return to APBS money which it had a legal right to recover from Chia,
                    APBS could not be said to have been unjustly enriched by that
                payment.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_113"></a>113    Additionally, APBS contended that it had not
                    been enriched by the S$29.5m as that sum came from two fresh drawings made on
                    the MM Facility on, respectively, 24 March 2003 for US$13m and 21 May
                    2003 for US$12m (“the Disputed Drawings”). According to APBS, it
                    did not receive the Disputed Drawings as they were made after 24 October
                    2002, the last day on which money was transferred from the SEB S$ Account to the
                    OCBC Account (see the table at <a href="#p1_130">[130]</a>
                    below). SEB’s rebuttal to this argument was that the Disputed Drawings
                    were not fresh drawings on the MM Facility, but “rollovers” of
                    drawings made on the MM Facility prior to 24 October 2002 which had been
                    paid into the OCBC Account as part of the SEB S$45.3m (“the Previous
                    Drawings”); <em>ie</em>, according to SEB, the
                    Disputed Drawings were, in essence, the Previous Drawings with their original
                    maturity dates extended. SEB contended that since APBS had received the Previous
                    Drawings and since those drawings had not been repaid, APBS had been enriched by
                    the S$29.5m at its expense.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Judge’s decision and the issues arising therefrom </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_114"></a>114    Although SEB’s restitutionary claim
                    was for only the S$29.5m, the Judge assessed the merits of the claim with
                    reference to the SEB S$45.3m as a whole since that sum included the S$29.5m. She
                    accepted APBS’s argument that it (APBS) had not been enriched by the SEB
                    S$45.3m (except to the extent of S$347,671.23). Accordingly, she dismissed
                    SEB’s restitutionary claim for the S$29.5m (save to the extent of
                    S$347,671.23) as the S$29.5m was part of the SEB S$45.3m. The Judge gave the
                    following reasons for her decision (see also <a href="#p1_33">[33]</a> above):</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_a"></a>(a)     APBS could not be said to have been
                        enriched at SEB’s expense (save to the extent of S$347,671.23) because
                        S$45m out of the SEB S$45.3m went towards discharging <em>Chia’s</em> liability to APBS, and not <em>APBS’s</em> liabilities to other parties (see [269], [275]
                        and [282] of the HC Judgment). This distinguished the present case from
                            <em>Bannatyne</em> and <em>Reid v
                            Rigby</em>, where the unauthorised loan procured by the agent was
                        used in part to discharge the principal’s liabilities, with the result
                        that the principal was held to have adopted the benefit of a corresponding
                        portion of the loan. (The Judge also pointed out (at [269]–[270] of
                        the HC Judgment) two other factual distinguishing features in <em>Bannatyne</em> and <em>Reid v
                            Rigby</em>, namely: (i) the agent in those two cases was
                        authorised to pay off the principal’s debts; and (ii) the
                        unauthorised loan was paid into a bank account that genuinely belonged to
                        the principal, as opposed to a bank account which, although nominally in the
                        principal’s name, was in reality the agent’s personal bank
                        account (as was the position <em>vis-à-vis</em> the SEB
                        Accounts).) In the circumstances, APBS could not be said to have adopted the
                        benefit of S$45m out of the SEB S$45.3m. This in turn meant that APBS was
                        enriched by only S$347,671.23 (see [283] of the HC
                    Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_b"></a>(b)     APBS’s enrichment of S$347,671.23 was unjust because APBS had not
                        provided any consideration for its receipt of that sum (see [291] of the HC
                        Judgment). Mistake, however, was not an applicable unjust factor because SEB
                        had not been labouring under any operative mistake when it paid the SEB
                        S$45.3m (including the S$29.5m) into the OCBC Account (see [287] of the HC
                        Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_114-p2_c"></a>(c)     APBS could not rely on the defence of change of position to defeat
                        SEB’s restitutionary claim. There was no anticipatory change of
                        position by APBS as it did not pay the APBS S$45m to SEB (via the SEB S$
                        Account) in clear expectation of an imminent payment in by SEB (see [322] of
                        the HC Judgment). The defence of extraordinary change of position was also
                        not made out as APBS had not proved the requisite “but for”
                        causal link between its receipt of the SEB S$45.3m and its alleged change of
                        position (see [329] of the HC Judgment). APBS thus had to make restitution
                        of S$347,671.23 to SEB (see [330] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_115"></a>115    Two other aspects of the Judge’s
                    decision should be noted. First, in holding that the quantum of APBS’s
                    enrichment was limited to S$347,671.23, the Judge expressly stated that she was
                    not applying the running account method of quantifying enrichment (“the
                    running account method”) as she considered that it “[did] not sit
                    well” (see [301] of the HC Judgment) with the facts of this case. (The
                    running account method would involve setting off the cross-payments between the
                    SEB S$ Account and the OCBC Account, with the excess identified as the net
                    extant enrichment in APBS’s hands.) Second, without expressly deciding
                    whether or not the S$29.5m came from the Disputed Drawings, the Judge held that,
                    in any case, the Disputed Drawings were fresh drawings on the MM Facility which
                    were never paid to APBS, and not “rollovers” of the Previous
                    Drawings (see [316]–[318] of the HC Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_116"></a>116    Arising from the Judge’s decision, the
                    issues which SEB and APBS have raised in relation to the Restitution Issue are
                    as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_a"></a>(a)     whether the payment of the SEB
                        S$45.3m into the OCBC Account discharged Chia’s liability to APBS in
                        respect of the APBS S$45m misappropriated from that account (“the
                        discharge of liability issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_b"></a>(b)     whether APBS was enriched by the S$29.5m claimed by SEB
                        in terms of having adopted the benefit of that sum (“the
                        ‘adoption of benefit’ issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_c"></a>(c)     whether the Judge was correct in
                        ruling that the running account method was not the appropriate method for
                        ascertaining the quantum of enrichment received by APBS from SEB
                        (“the quantification of enrichment issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_d"></a>(d)     whether the Disputed Drawings were
                        fresh drawings made on the MM Facility after 24 October 2002, such that
                        they did not form part of the SEB S$45.3m paid into the OCBC Account
                        (“the Disputed Drawings issue”);</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_e"></a>(e)     whether there is any unjust factor to support
                        SEB’s restitutionary claim (“the unjust factor issue”);
                        and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_116-p2_f"></a>(f)     whether
                        the Judge was right to reject APBS’s defence of change of position
                        (“the change of position issue”).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">We shall
                    now address these issues in turn.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The discharge of liability issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_117"></a>117    
          <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                    issue of whether the payment of the SEB S$45.3m into the OCBC Account discharged
                    Chia’s liability to repay APBS the APBS S$45m misappropriated from that
                    account, SEB’s submission is that the said payment did not have that
                    effect for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_a"></a>(a)     There was no evidence that Chia
                        instructed SEB to pay the SEB S$45.3m into the OCBC Account in order to
                        discharge his liability to APBS in respect of the APBS S$45m. Instead, his
                        only intention was to replenish the OCBC Account so that he could continue
                        “round-tripping” money between that account and the SEB S$
                        Account.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_b"></a>(b)     There
                        was also no evidence that SEB agreed on behalf of Chia that the payment of
                        the SEB S$45.3m into the OCBC Account would be for the purpose of
                        discharging his liability to APBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_c"></a>(c)     APBS itself never regarded the said payment as
                        discharging Chia’s liability to it, and therefore never accepted the
                        SEB S$45.3m as repayment of Chia’s debt.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_117-p2_d"></a>(d)     In any case, there was, in law, no liability
                        owed by Chia to APBS to be discharged in the first place because while
                        Chia’s misappropriation of the APBS S$45m gave rise to criminal and
                        tortious wrongs, those wrongs were entirely different from a recognised
                        legal debt derived from a contractually-binding obligation between the
                        parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_118"></a>118    The Judge rejected all of SEB’s
                    arguments and held that the payment of the SEB S$45.3m into the OCBC Account did
                    discharge Chia’s liability to APBS in respect of the APBS S$45m
                    misappropriated from that account. We agree with the Judge’s conclusion on
                    this issue. There is no doubt that Chia was liable to repay APBS the APBS S$45m,
                    irrespective of his criminal liability apropos his misappropriation of that sum.
                    There is also no doubt that, as SEB submitted, Chia paid (or rather, procured
                    SEB to pay) the SEB S$45.3m into the OCBC Account in order to replenish that
                    account so that he could continue to draw on it for the purposes of his
                    “round-tripping” scheme and thereby sustain his fraudulent
                    activities. But, the very act of replenishing the OCBC Account meant that the
                    existing shortfall therein, <em>ie</em>, the corresponding
                    amount misappropriated by Chia, would have been repaid. Every payment into the
                    OCBC Account for the purpose of replenishing it therefore <em>did</em> discharge Chia’s liability to APBS in respect of the
                    APBS S$45m by a corresponding amount.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_119"></a>119    With respect to SEB’s argument that
                    APBS did not regard the payment of the SEB S$45.3m as discharging Chia’s
                    liability to it and therefore never accepted the SEB S$45.3m as repayment of
                    Chia’s debt, our view is that this argument is based on a fiction. It is
                    an entirely unrealistic argument as it bears no relevance to the facts of this
                    case. It is not disputed that neither SEB nor APBS knew of Chia’s
                    “round-tripping” of money between the OCBC Account and the SEB S$
                    Account. Chia was able to do what he liked with these two accounts because he
                    was in full control of both accounts, and thus could – and did –
                    treat them as though they were his personal accounts. For this reason, in
                    analysing the discharge of liability issue, what is important is Chia’s
                    intention in “round-tripping” money between these two accounts
                    (which was to reduce the shortfall in the OCBC Account in order to draw on it
                    again), and not SEB’s intention in paying the SEB S$45.3m into the OCBC
                    Account as SEB was merely carrying out Chia’s instructions. Similarly,
                    given that both SEB and APBS were unaware at all material times of Chia’s
                    “round-tripping” scheme, APBS’s argument based on
                    Hobhouse J’s “tender and acceptance” analysis in
                        <em>TSB Bank of Scotland Plc v Welwyn Hatfield District
                        Council</em> [1993] 2 Bank LR 267 at 271–273
                        (<em>viz</em>, that APBS had “accepted”
                    Chia’s “tender” of repayment of the APBS S$45m by retaining
                    the SEB S$45.3m in the OCBC Account and dealing with it) is entirely unrealistic
                    and irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The “adoption of benefit” issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_120"></a>120    We move on now to the “adoption of
                    benefit” issue, in respect of which the question to be decided is whether
                    APBS was enriched by the S$29.5m claimed by SEB in terms of having adopted the
                    benefit of that sum. In this regard, SEB has reiterated before us its contention
                    in the court below, namely, that APBS adopted the benefit of (and was thus
                    enriched by) the payment of the SEB S$45.3m (including the S$29.5m) into the
                    OCBC Account as it used the money to pay its debts and dividends (see <a href="#p1_111">[111]</a> above). SEB submits that the
                    “adoption of benefit” principle would still apply even if this
                    court were to hold (contrary to SEB’s argument) that the payment of the
                    SEB S$45.3m into the OCBC Account discharged Chia’s liability to APBS in
                    respect of the APBS S$45m misappropriated from that account. In support of its
                    argument, SEB, apart from citing the cases which it relied on in the court
                    below, has also referred to (<em>inter alia</em>) <em>Re The Japanese Curtains and Patent Fabric Company (Limited), Ex
                        parte Shoolbred</em> (1880) 28 WR 339 (“<em>Re Japanese Curtains</em>”), <em>Barrow v Bank
                        of New South Wales</em> [1931] VLR 323 (“<em>Barrow</em>”) and <em>Hazlewood et al v West
                        Coast Securities Ltd</em> (1974) 49 DLR (3d) 46
                        (“<em>Hazlewood</em>”). The factual
                    scenario in these three cases (in simplified form) was that an agent obtained
                    money by fraudulent means and used part of the money for his principal’s
                    purposes. It was held in all three cases that the principal had to make
                    restitution of that part of the fraudulently obtained money which it had either
                    directly or indirectly benefited from.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_121"></a>121    In rebuttal to SEB’s submissions, APBS
                    has made three arguments, as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_a"></a>(a)     The “adoption of
                        benefit” cases cited by SEB are all distinguishable from the instant
                        case. In particular, all those cases involved money flowing in one direction
                        only (<em>viz</em>, from the defrauded plaintiff to the
                        defendant), whereas in the present case, there have been cross-payments
                        between APBS and SEB, which are both victims of Chia’s fraud. APBS and
                        SEB are simultaneously defrauded parties as well as recipients of
                        fraudulently obtained money.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_b"></a>(b)     The true test applied by the courts in the
                        “adoption of benefit” cases relied on by SEB is whether the
                        defendant would be left worse off if it were ordered to make restitution of
                        the alleged benefit received. Applying this test, it is clear that to order
                        APBS to make restitution of the S$29.5m claimed by SEB would be to increase
                        APBS’s liabilities <em>vis-à-vis</em>
                    SEB.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_121-p2_c"></a>(c)     As a matter
                        of common sense, APBS cannot be said to have adopted the benefit of S$45m
                        out of the SEB S$45.3m paid into the OCBC Account. The factual scenario in
                        this case (as far as S$45m out of the SEB S$45.3m is concerned) is akin to
                        that of a thief stealing S$100 from X, handing the S$100 to Y and then
                        stealing S$100 from Y for the purpose of returning S$100 to X in order to
                        cover his tracks: in such a situation, it cannot be said that X has been
                        enriched by the S$100 stolen from Y and must make restitution of that sum to
                        the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_122"></a>122    We agree with APBS’s argument at
                    sub-para (c) of <a href="#p1_121">[121]</a> above. As a
                    matter of common sense, it is difficult to see how APBS can be said to have
                    obtained any benefit from S$45m out of the SEB S$45.3m paid into the OCBC
                    Account as the only effect of APBS’s receipt of the sum of S$45m was to
                    restore APBS to essentially the same position that it was in before Chia
                    misappropriated the APBS S$45m. The end result of Chia’s
                    “round-tripping” of money between the OCBC Account and the SEB S$
                    Account was that, leaving aside the sum of S$347,671.23, APBS was left neither
                    better off nor worse off, whereas if APBS is now ordered to pay SEB the S$29.5m,
                    APBS will end up worse off.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_123"></a>123    In our view, although <em>Bannatyne</em>, <em>Reid v Rigby</em>, <em>Re Japanese Curtains</em>, <em>Barrow</em> and <em>Hazlewood</em> appear to
                    establish a plaintiff’s right of recovery against a defendant who benefits
                    (whether directly or indirectly) from money fraudulently obtained from the
                    plaintiff by a fraudster, those decisions were, as counsel for APBS pointed out,
                    all arrived at in a factual context wholly different from that before this
                    court. In all those cases, the plaintiff, who had been defrauded into making
                    payment by the fraudster, had not at any point itself been in receipt of money
                    misappropriated from the defendant by the same fraudster. In our view, this
                    critical feature distinguishes the present case from the aforesaid
                    authorities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_124"></a>124    Furthermore, where <em>Bannatyne</em> and <em>Reid v Rigby</em> are
                    concerned, they are (as the Judge noted) distinguishable on the ground that the
                    unauthorised loan obtained by the agent in those two cases was used to pay off
                    the principal’s debts, whereas in the present case, Chia used the SEB
                    S$45.3m not to pay off APBS’s debts, but to discharge his own liability to
                    APBS. In any event, even if the SEB S$45.3m had been used to pay off
                    APBS’s debts, given that APBS never requested for the SEB S$45.3m to be
                    paid into the OCBC Account, never authorised Chia to request for or procure such
                    payment and was unaware at all material times of the said payment, the mere fact
                    that APBS obtained a benefit from the payment (assuming the SEB S$45.3m was
                    indeed used to pay off APBS’s debts) is not in itself sufficient to give
                    rise to an equity against APBS (see, in this regard, the majority decision in
                        <em>In re Cleadon Trust, Limited</em> [1939] Ch 286
                    (especially at 322–326), which distinguished <em>Bannatyne</em> and <em>Reid v Rigby</em> on this
                    ground; see also <em>English Private Law</em> (Andrew
                    Burrows ed) (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2007) at paras 14.33 and
                    18.38).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_125"></a>125    Given our ruling that APBS cannot be said to
                    have <em>adopted the benefit</em> of S$45m out of the SEB
                    S$45.3m, it follows that APBS also cannot be said to have adopted the benefit of
                    the S$29.5m claimed by SEB. This does not, however, mean that APBS has therefore
                    not been <em>enriched</em> by the S$29.5m. The
                    quantification of enrichment issue is relevant in this regard, and we now turn
                    our attention to it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The quantification of enrichment issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_126"></a>126    In the court below, the Judge ruled that the
                    running account method was inappropriate for determining the quantum of
                    enrichment received by APBS from SEB as this was a case where “the
                    victims of [a] fraud [were] suing each other in a personal claim for money had
                    and received, and the restitutionary claim [was] subject to the change of
                    position defence” (see [301] of the HC Judgment). In support of her view,
                    the Judge cited the following passage from Peter Birks, <em>Unjust Enrichment</em> (Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2005)
                    at p 226:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">One claimant may fortuitously encounter an obstacle or bar which the other
                        escapes, with the consequence that for very slight reasons[,] the parties to
                        the one exchange may end up in very different situations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_127"></a>127    Before us, APBS has contended that the Judge
                    wrongly rejected the running account method on the facts of this case. It points
                    out that the Judge quoted only a portion of Prof Birks’ discussion of
                    the defence of change of position, and submits that the full passage at
                    pp 225–226 of <em>Unjust Enrichment</em> in fact
                    advocates the converse position. Specifically, APBS argues that it is
                    Prof Birks’ view that it is precisely in cases where the plaintiff
                    and the defendant have potential restitutionary claims against each another for
                    cross-payments made that the running account method should be adopted to
                    ascertain the net quantum of enrichment received by the defendant. In this
                    regard, APBS submits that no distinction should be drawn between cases of void
                    contracts due to ineffective transactions (such as the interest rate swap cases
                    in England, where several local authorities made payments to banks pursuant to
                    interest rate swap agreements which were subsequently held by the English courts
                    to be outside the scope of the local authorities’ powers and, thus, void
                        <em>ab initio</em> (see, <em>eg</em>, <em>Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v
                        Islington London Borough Council</em> [1994] 4 All ER 890
                        (“<em>Westdeutsche Landesbank v Islington
                        LBC</em>”)) and cases involving fraud.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_128"></a>128    In support of the aforesaid arguments, APBS
                    has cited the following passage from pp 225–226 of Prof Birks’
                    <em>Unjust Enrichment</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where a benefit has been received by the claimant from the defendant in
                        exchange for the enrichment which he is seeking to recover from the
                        defendant, that exchange-benefit can be seen as a disenrichment of the
                        defendant …</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [W]here there has been an exchange[,] it must be true that, if
                        one side recovers the value which he has transferred, the basis of his own
                        receipt of the exchange-benefit must also have failed. In short, if the
                        defendant is unjustly enriched at [the claimant’s] expense, so also is
                        the claimant enriched at the defendant’s expense. I give you gold in
                        exchange for money. The contract is invalid. The basis of my receipt of the
                        money fails. You can claim restitution. But, necessarily, the basis of your
                        receipt of the gold also fails.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">That bilateral unjust enrichment shows that both sides have claims
                        …
                        <em>Each party could be left to its own claim. But nowadays,
                            as is illustrated in all the swaps cases</em> [<em>ie</em>, the interest rate swap cases]<em>, that
                            is not allowed, and the effect is to reduce them</em> [<em>ie</em>, the two sides’ claims] <em>to a single claim for the difference in value between the two
                            performances. The defendant’s enrichment in the swaps cases was
                            the rolling balance between the payments on both
                        sides</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The reason for tying the two claims together is explained by German
                        jurists. They have shown that the two-claim approach can produce bizarre
                        results. One claimant may fortuitously encounter an obstacle or bar which
                        the other escapes, with the consequence that for very slight reasons[,] the
                        parties to the one exchange may end up in very different situations. For
                        example, if the law does not focus on the one enrichment which consists in
                            [<em>sic</em>] the difference between the two
                        performances, one party may be able to use the disenrichment defence and the
                        other [may] not. In the common law[,] the old way of escaping from these
                        problems was the very fierce rule that denied restitution altogether unless
                        the parties could be put back into exactly their original position. Under
                        that regime[,] ‘counter-restitution impossible’ was a peremptory
                        and absolute defence. That blunt instrument has been given up. The same
                        problems are now evaded by applying, in money, what German law calls the
                            ‘<em>Saldo</em>’ theory (<em>Saldo</em> being an old Italian banking word for a
                        balance or difference, here borrowed to denote the balance or difference
                        between the exchanged performances). In short[,] restitution is allowed
                        subject to pecuniary counter-restitution, thus achieving <em>restitution of the difference</em>.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_129"></a>129    We agree with APBS’s submission that
                    the Judge erred in rejecting the running account method for the reasons given by
                    her. The Judge’s concern was that where the victims of the same fraudster
                    brought restitutionary cross-claims against each other, the outcome of each
                    victim’s claim might be different because one victim might be able to rely
                    on the defence of change of position whereas the other might not. This factor,
                    the Judge considered, rendered the running account method inappropriate in the
                    aforesaid scenario. With respect, we differ from the Judge on this point. In our
                    view, for the reasons stated by Prof Birks at pp 225–226 of
                        <em>Unjust Enrichment</em> (reproduced at <a href="#p1_128">[128]</a> above), it is precisely where the victims
                    of the same fraudster are suing each other in restitution (as in the present
                    case) that the victims’ claims should be tied together, which is the
                    effect that applying the running account method would have. We also agree with
                    APBS that the present case, although involving cross-payments between victims of
                    the same fraudster, is no different from a case involving cross-payments under a
                    contract which is subsequently found to be void <em>ab
                        initio</em> (such as the interest rate swap case of <em>Westdeutsche Landesbank v Islington LBC</em>). As all the
                    transactions effected by Chia <em>vis-à-vis</em> the SEB S$
                    Account and the OCBC Account were fraudulent, the cross-payments between SEB and
                    APBS pursuant to those transactions were analogous to payments made under void
                    contracts.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_130"></a>130    Applying the running account method, APBS
                    was enriched by S$347,671.23, that being the net amount which APBS retained
                    after all the cross-payments between the OCBC Account and the SEB S$ Account
                    were set off against one another. This result can be immediately seen from the
                    undisputed “Table of Fund Transfers” set out at [252] of the HC
                    Judgment, which is reproduced in full below:</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Disputed Drawings issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_131"></a>131    Turning now to the Disputed Drawings issue,
                    as mentioned earlier (at <a href="#p1_113">[113]</a> above), one
                    of the arguments raised by APBS in contending that it was not enriched by the
                    S$29.5m claimed by SEB was that that sum came from the Disputed Drawings, which,
                    being fresh drawings made on the MM Facility after 24 October 2002 (the
                    last day on which money was transferred from the SEB S$ Account to the OCBC
                    Account), were not paid into the OCBC Account. On this point, the Judge held
                    that the Disputed Drawings were “new drawings … [that] were not
                    paid to or received by APBS[;] … [t]he restitutionary claim [was]
                    therefore against Chia and not APBS” (see [318] of the HC
                    Judgment).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_132"></a>132    We agree with the Judge, for the reasons
                    which she gave, that the Disputed Drawings were fresh drawings on the MM
                    Facility. The arrangement between SEB and Chia was that the Previous Drawings
                    should be treated as having been repaid (as opposed to “rolled
                    over”) so that Chia could draw on the MM Facility again for whatever
                    purposes he had in mind.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_133"></a>133    The above conclusion suffices to dispose of
                    the Disputed Drawings issue. We do not think it is necessary for us to go on to
                    determine whether the fact that the Previous Drawings were treated as having
                    been repaid and that the Disputed Drawings were fresh drawings which were not
                    paid into the OCBC Account would have constituted a sufficient defence to
                    SEB’s restitutionary claim for the S$29.5m. It is only necessary to say
                    that since APBS did actually receive the S$29.5m as part of the SEB S$45.3m,
                    this fact cannot be changed by the arrangement between SEB and Chia to treat the
                    Previous Drawings as having been repaid. In other words, it is arguable that the
                    S$29.5m would have been an extant enrichment in APBS’s hands but for the
                    fact that S$45m out of the SEB S$45.3m went towards discharging Chia’s
                    liability to APBS in respect of the APBS S$45m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The unjust factor issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_134"></a>134    We turn next to the unjust factor issue.
                    Given our ruling that APBS has been enriched at SEB’s expense by only
                    S$347,671.23 (and not by the S$29.5m claimed), we need only consider whether
                    there is any unjust factor to support SEB’s restitutionary claim to the
                    extent of S$347,671.23. In this regard, it is common ground that SEB bears the
                    burden of proving that the circumstances surrounding APBS’s enrichment
                    render it unjust for APBS to retain the said sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_135"></a>135    In the court below, the Judge held that SEB
                    could rely on the unjust factor of <em>total failure of
                        consideration</em> as APBS had not provided any consideration for its
                    receipt of S$347,671.23 out of the SEB S$45.3m paid into the OCBC Account,
                        <em>but</em> SEB could not rely on the unjust factor of
                        <em>mistake</em> because there was no operative mistake
                    on its part when it made the said payment of the SEB S$45.3m. Our earlier ruling
                    (at <a href="#p1_118">[118]</a> above) that the payment of the
                    SEB S$45.3m into the OCBC Account did discharge Chia’s liability to APBS
                    in respect of the APBS S$45m affirms the Judge’s decision that APBS
                    provided consideration for only S$45m out of the SEB S$45.3m; <em>ie</em>, the Judge was correct to hold that the unjust factor of
                    total failure of consideration operated in respect of the remaining sum of
                    S$347,671.23. We shall thus discuss only the Judge’s rejection of mistake
                    as an unjust factor.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_136"></a>136    In this connection, the Judge said (at [287]
                    of the HC Judgment):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In my judgment, there is <em>no</em> operative
                        mistake as SEB accepted the certified extracts of the [APBS] [B]oard
                        resolutions without verification of the documents as to [the] identity and
                        [the] signature of the persons signing … In other words, [SEB]
                        accepted the certified extracts of the [APBS] [B]oard resolutions without
                        verification of the authority of Chia. I concluded on the evidence that
                        [SEB] willingly took the risk of Chia acting fraudulently, and in doing so,
                        and with the risk materialising, [SEB] must bear the consequences of
                        Chia’s deceit practised on SEB. In the words of Lord Hoffmann in
                            <em>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc v Inland Revenue
                            Commissioners</em> [2007] 1 AC 558[,] “the real point
                        is whether the person who made the payment took the risk that he might be
                        wrong” (at [26]). <em>Goff &amp; Jones</em> [<em>viz</em>,
                        Lord Goff of Chieveley &amp; Gareth Jones, <em>The Law
                            of Restitution</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2007)]
                        (… at para 4-031) suggests that one is reckless if one failed to
                        make a full inquiry to allay his or her suspicions, or where there were no
                        clear conclusions; but yet, nevertheless, transferred the benefit. On either
                        test, for the reasons given, SEB took the risk of Chia’s acting
                        fraudulently as regards his authority and accordingly there is <em>no</em> operative mistake, and I so find. [emphasis in
                        original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_137"></a>137    SEB submits that the Judge erred in reaching
                    the above conclusion because, in the context of payments made under a mistake of
                    fact or a mistake of law, leaving aside those extreme circumstances where the
                    carelessness of the plaintiff is so gross that he must be considered to have
                    assumed responsibility for his own mistake in making payment (see <em>Saunders &amp; Co (a firm) v Hague</em> [2004] 2 NZLR
                    475 at [121] and Andrew Burrows,
                        <em>The Law of Restitution</em> (Oxford University
                    Press, 3rd Ed, 2011) at p 212), the plaintiff may be said to have
                    voluntarily assumed the risk of making a mistaken payment only if either, as
                    stated in <em>Kelly v Solari</em> (1841)
                    9 M &amp; W 54; 152 ER 24:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_137-p2_a"></a>(a)     the plaintiff, “although he
                        might by investigation learn [of] the state of facts [or law] more
                        accurately, … declines to do so, and chooses to pay the money
                        notwithstanding” (at 58; 26); or</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_137-p2_b"></a>(b)     the payment is made “intentionally
                        … without reference to the truth or falsehood of the fact [or legal
                        premise upon which the payment is based], the plaintiff meaning to waive all
                        inquiry into it” (at 59; 26).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_138"></a>138    We agree with SEB’s submissions on
                    this point. In our view, the evidence does not justify a finding that
                    SEB’s officers, in accepting as genuine the forged APBS Board resolutions
                    provided by Chia without first verifying his authority to submit documents on
                    APBS’s behalf, voluntarily assumed the risk that Chia might have forged
                    those resolutions. SEB’s officers were undoubtedly careless or imprudent
                    in not going further to check whether Chia in fact had authority to submit
                    documents on APBS’s behalf, but they were lulled into a false sense of
                    security by the position that Chia was holding (<em>viz</em>, that of Finance Manager), and proceeded on the basis that a
                    finance manager must or should have the authority to do what Chia did. The false
                    sense of security on the part of SEB’s officers arose in the context of a
                    bank granting credit facilities to a new customer which it considered to be
                    reputable and creditworthy. The very laxity shown by SEB’s officers in
                    verifying the authenticity of the documents provided by Chia amply shows that
                    far from contemplating or perceiving the danger of being defrauded by Chia (and,
                    in turn, the risk of making mistaken payments on Chia’s instructions),
                    SEB’s officers assumed that since Chia was APBS’s finance manager,
                    they were dealing with an authorised and trustworthy agent of
                APBS.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The change of position issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_139"></a>139    Moving on now to the change of position
                    issue, the question to be addressed is whether the Judge was right to reject
                    APBS’s defence of change of position.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_140"></a>140    In the court below, APBS pleaded, by way of
                    defence to SEB’s restitutionary claim, both <em>anticipatory</em> change of position and <em>extraordinary</em> change of position. Both defences were rejected by
                    the Judge (see sub-para (c) of <a href="#p1_114">[114]</a>
                    above). With respect to the defence of <em>extraordinary</em> change of position, the Judge rejected it on the
                    ground that APBS had failed to demonstrate that “but for” its
                    receipt of the SEB S$45.3m, it would not have paid the dividends, excise duties,
                    rebates and debts which it paid (APBS’s case was that the whole of the SEB
                    S$45.3m was spent on such payments). Although APBS has not tried to revive this
                    defence before us, we should state, for completeness, that we agree with the
                    Judge’s rejection of it. This is because, as mentioned at <a href="#p1_119">[119]</a> above, both APBS and SEB were unaware at
                    all material times of Chia’s “round-tripping” of money
                    between the SEB S$ Account and the OCBC Account. It follows that APBS would not
                    have known of the payment of the SEB S$45.3m into the OCBC Account, and
                    therefore could not have consciously or deliberately changed its position
                    following its receipt of that sum.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_141"></a>141    With regard to the defence of <em>anticipatory</em> change of position, the Judge rejected it
                    on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that APBS had
                    paid the APBS S$45m to SEB “in ‘clear expectation of an <em>imminent</em> payment in’ by SEB” [emphasis
                    added] (see [322] of the HC Judgment, where reference was made to <em>Parkway Properties Pte Ltd and another v United Artists Singapore
                        Theatres Pte Ltd and another</em> [2003] 2 SLR(R) 103
                        (“<em>Parkway Properties</em>”) at
                        [46]). The material part of [322] of
                    the HC Judgment reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Anticipatory change of position is recognised in both Singapore and
                        England (see <em>Jones v Commerzbank AG</em> (2003)
                        EWCA Civ 1663 … and <em>Parkway Properties Pte Ltd v
                            United Artists Singapore Theatres Pte Ltd</em> [2003]
                        2 SLR(R) 103 (“<em>Parkway
                        Properties</em>”). In order for the anticipatory change of
                        position defence to apply, <em>Parkway Properties</em>
                        requires that the payment out by the defendant be made in clear expectation
                        of an <em>imminent</em> payment in by the plaintiff. In
                        this present case, there is insufficient evidence before the court to
                        demonstrate that APBS paid money to SEB in “clear expectation of an
                            <em>imminent</em> payment in” by SEB.
                        [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_142"></a>142    Before us, APBS has argued that the
                    Judge’s finding on the defence of anticipatory change of position is wrong
                    as there is evidence that “but for” the expectation that the APBS
                    S$45m would be returned with interest, its officers would not have co-signed the
                    OCBC Cheques by which Chia fraudulently withdrew the APBS S$45m from the OCBC
                    Account, ostensibly for deposit with Citibank (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a>–<a href="#p1_27">[27]</a> above). In
                    support of this argument, APBS has referred to the following passage at [289] of
                    the HC Judgment:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [SEB] accepts that Chia misappropriated moneys from APBS, and he
                        deposited the OCBC [C]heques into the SEB S$ Account. It is not disputed,
                        and it is SEB’s evidence that the telegraphic transfers from the SEB
                        S$ Account to the OCBC Account were on Chia’s instructions, and the
                        SEB S$ Account was debited accordingly. Jimmy Tan [a senior financial
                        analyst in APBL Group Finance] and Teo Hun Teck [Chia’s subordinate in
                        APBS Finance (see <a href="#p1_26">[26]</a> above)] testified
                        that <em>they had co-signed the OCBC [C]heques on
                            Chia’s representation that he was placing the moneys drawn on the
                            OCBC Account on fixed deposits with Citibank</em>. Teo Hun
                        Teck’s evidence is that <em>moneys that Chia ostensibly
                            placed on fixed deposits with Citibank were returned to the OCBC Account
                            with interest</em>. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_143"></a>143    In our view, APBS’s argument has no
                    merit for two reasons. The first is that the above passage merely describes how
                    Chia persuaded his co-signatories (“the Co-Signatories”) to sign
                    the OCBC Cheques; it says nothing about whether the Co-Signatories anticipated
                    anything and, if so, what they anticipated when they signed those cheques. It
                    appears from the evidence that the Co-Signatories signed the OCBC Cheques
                    because they believed Chia’s representation that the money withdrawn from
                    the OCBC Account would be deposited with Citibank to earn higher interest than
                    the interest offered by OCBC. The Co-Signatories were accustomed to signing
                    cheques to withdraw money from the OCBC Account for deposit with other banks;
                    therefore, they would have signed the OCBC Cheques as a matter of course, and
                    would have taken it for granted that the money deposited with (ostensibly)
                    Citibank would be returned with interest upon maturity. Given these
                    circumstances, we find APBS’s argument on the defence of anticipatory
                    change of position quite unrealistic, just as we earlier found (at <a href="#p1_119">[119]</a> above) APBS’s “tender and
                    acceptance” argument <em>vis-à-vis</em> the
                    discharge of liability issue unrealistic and irrelevant on the facts of this
                    case.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_144"></a>144    The second reason why we do not accept
                    APBS’s submissions on the defence of anticipatory change of position is
                    that this defence will succeed only if the change of position relied on is a
                    change for the worse, and not for the better; a detriment must result from the
                    alleged change of position. In the present case, this essential requirement has
                    not been satisfied as, on APBS’s own account of the material events, the
                    Co-Signatories, when signing the OCBC Cheques, believed that APBS would change
                    its position for the better, in that the money deposited with (ostensibly)
                    Citibank would be returned in due course with higher interest than if the money
                    had been deposited with OCBC.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_145"></a>145    We conclude our discussion of the defence of
                    anticipatory change of position with an observation on this court’s
                    statement in <em>Parkway Properties</em> that for this
                    defence to succeed, there must be “payment out by the defendant …
                    in clear expectation of an imminent payment in by the plaintiff” (at
                        <a href="#p1_46">[46]</a>). In our view, the requirement of
                        <em>imminence</em> of the anticipated payment (or other
                    benefit) from the plaintiff is not supported by any authority. The case in which
                    the defence of anticipatory change of position was first accepted by the Privy
                    Council, <em>viz</em>, <em>Dextra Bank &amp;
                        Trust Co Ltd v Bank of Jamaica</em> [2002] 1 All ER (Comm)
                    193 (“<em>Dextra Bank</em>”), did not mention
                    such a requirement. In their leading joint judgment in that case, Lord Goff
                    of Chieveley and Lord Bingham of Cornhill said with regard to this defence
                    (at [38]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">… [I]t is difficult to see what relevant distinction can be drawn
                        between (1) a case in which the defendant expends on some extraordinary
                        expenditure all or part of a sum of money which he has received from the
                        plaintiff, and (2) one in which <em>the defendant incurs
                            such expenditure in the expectation that he will receive the sum of
                            money from the plaintiff, which he does in fact receive</em>.
                        …
                        <em>It is surely no abuse of language to say, in the second
                            case as in the first, that the defendant has incurred the expenditure in
                            reliance on the plaintiff’s payment or, as is sometimes said, on
                            the faith of the payment. It is true that, in the second case, the
                            defendant relied on the payment being made to him in the future (as well
                            as relying on such payment, when made, being a valid payment); but,
                            provided that his change of position was in good faith, it should
                            provide, pro tanto at least, a good defence</em> because it would
                        be inequitable to require the defendant to make restitution, or to make
                        restitution in full. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_146"></a>146    In <em>Commerzbank AG v
                        Gareth Price-Jones</em> [2003] EWCA Civ 1663 (“<em>Commerzbank AG</em>”), where the defence of
                    anticipatory change of position was accepted as part of English law, the English
                    CA rejected the element of imminence of the anticipated payment from the
                    plaintiff as a requirement of the defence. In that case, counsel for the
                    defendant suggested that this requirement was essential to the defence by
                    submitting that the anticipatory change of position and the subsequent receipt
                    of payment in <em>Dextra Bank</em> were transactions which
                    were “so close together in point of time that they could really be
                    treated as part and parcel of one transaction” (see <em>Commerzbank AG</em> at [63]).
                    Munby J rejected this argument and stated (see, likewise, [63] of <em>Commerzbank
                        AG</em>):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The only point [made by the Privy Council in <em>Dextra Bank</em>] is that expressed by the learned
                        editors of [Lord Goff of Chieveley &amp; Gareth Jones, <em>The Law of Restitution</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
                        5th Ed, 1998)] at para 40-005:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">“…
                            <em>The burden of establishing the defence will become
                                much greater if the evidence does not suggest a link with the
                                anticipatory payment and the subsequent receipt of a payment,
                                particularly if the receipts are received sometime after the
                                anticipatory change of position</em>. <b><em>But
                                in each case it will be a question of fact for the court to
                                determine</em></b>.” Precisely so: there is no point of
                            legal principle here; it is a question of fact.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added in italics and bold italics]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_147"></a>147    In our view, imminence of the anticipated
                    payment from the plaintiff is not an essential element of the defence of
                    anticipatory change of position. The critical element is, instead, the causal
                    link between the change of position by the defendant and his reliance on the
                    receipt of an anticipated payment (or other benefit) from the plaintiff. It is a
                    question of fact in each case whether this causal link is present.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Summary of our decision on the Restitution Issue</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_148"></a>148    To summarise our rulings on the various
                    issues discussed in relation to the Restitution Issue, we hold as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_a"></a>(a)     The payment of the SEB S$45.3m into
                        the OCBC Account did discharge Chia’s liability to APBS in respect of
                        the APBS S$45m misappropriated from that account (see <a href="#p1_118">[118]</a> above). Therefore, APBS cannot be said
                        to have been enriched at SEB’s expense by S$45m out of the SEB
                        S$45.3m.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_b"></a>(b)     APBS
                        also cannot be said to have adopted the benefit of the S$29.5m claimed by
                        SEB (which formed part of the SEB S$45.3m) as the “adoption of
                        benefit” principle is completely unrealistic in the circumstances of
                        this case (see <a href="#p1_122">[122]</a>–<a href="#p1_124">[124]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_c"></a>(c)     Although APBS cannot be said to have adopted
                        the benefit of the S$29.5m, it has, based on the running account method,
                        nonetheless been enriched by the sum of S$347,671.23 at SEB’s expense
                        (see <a href="#p1_130">[130]</a> above). In this regard,
                        contrary to the Judge’s view, the running account method is the
                        appropriate method for quantifying APBS’s enrichment in the present
                        case (see <a href="#p1_129">[129]</a>
                    above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_d"></a>(d)     As between
                        SEB and Chia, the Previous Drawings were treated as repaid, and the Disputed
                        Drawings were fresh drawings on the MM Facility that were never paid into
                        the OCBC Account (see <a href="#p1_132">[132]</a> above).
                        However, it is not necessary for us to decide whether this fact would, in
                        itself, provide APBS with a defence to SEB’s restitutionary claim if
                        APBS had indeed been enriched by the S$29.5m (see <a href="#p1_133">[133]</a> above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_e"></a>(e)     APBS’s enrichment by the sum of S$347,671.23 was
                        unjust because APBS received this sum without providing any consideration
                        (see <a href="#p1_135">[135]</a> above), and because SEB paid
                        this sum (and, likewise, the rest of the SEB S$45.3m) into the OCBC Account
                        under an operative mistake (see <a href="#p1_137">[137]</a>–<a href="#p1_138">[138]</a>
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_148-p2_f"></a>(f)     APBS
                        has not succeeded in establishing the defence of change of position in terms
                        of both extraordinary change of position and anticipatory change of position
                        (see <a href="#p1_140">[140]</a> and <a href="#p1_143">[143]</a>–<a href="#p1_144">[144]</a> above). <em>Vis-à-vis</em> the
                        latter defence, imminence of the anticipated payment or other benefit from
                        the plaintiff is not an essential element (see <a href="#p1_145">[145]</a>–<a href="#p1_147">[147]</a>
                        above).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_149"></a>149    Since APBS has been unjustly enriched by the
                    sum of S$347,671.23 at SEB’s expense and cannot rely on the defence of
                    change of position, it must make restitution of the said sum to SEB. SEB’s
                    restitutionary claim succeeds only to this extent (<em>cf</em> the S$29.5m claimed by SEB). In the circumstances, it is not
                    necessary for us to deal with APBS’s restitutionary counterclaim against
                    SEB in respect of the APBS S$45m.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_150"></a>150    For the above reasons, both SEB’s
                    appeal (<em>viz</em>, CA 121/2009) and HVB’s
                    appeal (<em>viz</em>, CA 122/2009) are dismissed with
                    costs and the usual consequential orders.</p>
