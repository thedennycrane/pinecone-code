The husband, now aged 43 and who originally hailed from Turkey, is currently resident and employed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

She was a homemaker for a large part of the marriage, but is currently employed as a part-time bookkeeper and earns about $2,500 every month. The wife resides in Singapore with their two sons, who are 16 and 11 years of age. Both children are enrolled in an international school in Johor Bahru. They were boarders at that school when the matter was before the Judge, but had ceased boarding arrangements by the time the matter came before us.

The wife was then a banker in England and earning a substantial salary. The husband lived and worked in Turkey. Just prior to the marriage, the husband moved to London to live with the wife. He became a full-time student reading for a university degree, and he also enrolled in an English language course.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">6 The wife claims that during the early years of their marriage, she was the “sole financial provider”. She funded the husband’s passage to England and his education there.

Second, the wife was made redundant by her then employer, a European bank. Third, the wife became pregnant with their second son, and gave birth to him in December that year. The wife stopped working to become a homemaker soon after.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">10 Parties disagree over the reason the wife became a homemaker. The wife says that she sacrificed her career so that she could focus on the family.

</div></div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The Judge divided the pool of assets equally, resulting in each party receiving approximately $738,000.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">17 In respect of the maintenance for the wife and children:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) The Judge awarded monthly maintenance of $7,700 to the wife, which comprised $3,000 for her personal and household expenses and $4,700 for rent for herself and the children.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) The Judge rejected the wife’s claim for a supplementary card, a car, and a monthly sum of $1,000 for holiday expenses.</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) The husband agreed to pay for the children’s school and boarding fees (which amounted to $7,250 monthly), school-related expenses, medical insurance and pocket money.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The husband appeals against the Judge’s decision on division. His challenge to the decision on division is mounted at three levels. First, he argues that the operative date should not be the date of commencement of ancillary proceedings, but rather, the date the parties separated. Second, he argues that the Judge erred by including a Turkish property in the matrimonial assets. Third, he argues against an equal division of the matrimonial assets. He says that the division should be in the proportions of 70:30 in his favour, which is more closely aligned to the parties’ financial contributions.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Both the husband and wife appeal against the Judge’s decision on maintenance. The wife says that maintenance should be increased to $10,200 monthly comprising $4,500 for her personal and household expenses, $4,700 for rent, and $1,000 for holiday expenses. The husband, on the other hand, argues that the maintenance should be reduced to $5,000 monthly.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">20 We will address the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance separately because they raise discrete legal principles and facts.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Issues relating to the division of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 The husband’s appeal against the Judge’s decision on division raises the same three issues (see [18] above). First, what the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets should be. Second, whether a property in Turkey (“the Turunc property”) should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. Third, whether the Judge’s division of the matrimonial assets in equal proportions is just and equitable.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">What the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets should be</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">22 The appropriate operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets received extensive argument in the court below. It was a pivotal point because there was a surge of about 50% in the total matrimonial assets between the parties’ separation in June 2009 and the commencement of ancillary proceedings on 30 June 2012. The surge was due to the husband’s receipt of some $520,000 in salary and bonuses during that period.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 The Judge accepted the wife’s position that the operative date should be when the ancillary proceedings commenced. The Judge held that the court had a “broad discretion” in selecting an operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets (the Judgment at [22]). The wife was responsible for the welfare of the children even after the breakdown of the marriage and the grant of interim judgment (the Judgment at [31]). This allowed the husband to focus on his work, and obtain the salary and bonuses. Those monies should therefore be included in the pool of matrimonial assets for division.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The parties’ cases on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">24 On appeal, the husband maintains his position that the operative date should be the date the parties separated. He gave four reasons. First, the parties’ intentions are an important factor in determining the operative date. By June 2009, the parties manifested a clear intention not to contribute to the matrimonial assets. They were living apart and had closed their joint accounts (except for one to deduct rent and utilities and a second overseas account to collect rental proceeds). Thereafter, they managed their assets separately.

</div>
</div> Second, the Judge double-counted the wife’s non-financial contributions. The Judge relied on the wife’s non-financial contributions to justify a later operative date, and also relied on those same contributions when dividing the matrimonial assets.

</div></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Our decision</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">26 We agree with the Judge that the court has the discretion to select the appropriate operative date. However, that discretion is not a free or an unguided one. So the first question we need to address is whether there is a starting point from which the court should determine the operative date</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">27 The analysis has to begin with the statutory definition of a “matrimonial asset” in s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Women’s Charter”). It includes an asset “of any nature acquired <span class="font-italic">during the marriage</span> by one party or both parties to the marriage” [emphasis added].</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 In <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy and another appeal</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span>”), we considered the meaning of s 112(10)(<span class="font-italic">b</span>) of the Women’s Charter in the context of the operative date for determining the matrimonial assets. We observed that there were four possible dates: (a) the date of separation; (b) the date the writ of divorce was filed; (c) the date of interim judgment; and (d) the date of the ancillary matters hearing (<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span> at [39]). Parliament had not prescribed any of these four options as the appropriate cut-off date, but had left the choice to the court. We preferred not to come down definitively in favour of any of the four potential operative dates, because the circumstances in which a divorce could occur were too diverse to do so (<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span> at [36]). We however opined that “it would be sensible to apply either the date of the decree <span class="font-italic">nisi</span> or the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters” (<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span> at [39]). The date of interim judgment was particularly appealing because it would be “wholly unreal” to treat assets acquired post-interim judgment as matrimonial assets. Once interim judgment is granted, “the marriage contract has for all practical purposes come to an end and there is no longer any marriage” (<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span> at [39]). On the facts, and in line with that final observation, we applied the date of the interim judgment as the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">29 We revisited the issue more recently in <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon v Lee Siew Lin</span> [2014] 1 SLR 629 (“<span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span>”). That case is instructive because we adopted the date of the interim judgment as the operative date despite the long period between the breakdown of the marriage and the divorce proceedings. The parties in <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span> were married in 1993. The relationship broke down, and the husband moved out of the matrimonial home in 1999. He filed for divorce only 11 years later, in 2010. Interim judgment was granted the following year, in 2011. After leaving the matrimonial home and prior to the grant of interim judgment, the husband had purchased a car and a property in joint names with his mistress. The husband argued that the operative date should have been the date of separation in 1999. This would have excluded the car and the property from the pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 We rejected his argument and instead adopted the date of the interim judgment. We stressed that there was no bright-line rule as to which of the four potential dates should be preferred as the operative date, and that everything turned on the facts of the case (<span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span> at [14]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">14 Given our analysis thus far, it follows that we would respectfully reject [the husband’s] argument ... that the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets in the present case ought to be the date of “separation” ... Indeed, as the relevant case law makes clear, <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">there is no hard and fast cut-off date for the determination of the pool of matrimonial assets and everything would, in the final analysis, depend on the precise facts of the case itself</span> (see, for example, the decision of this court in <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy</span> [2011] 2 SLR 1157 (“<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span>”) at [32]–[36]). In <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span>, this court noted (at [36]) that “[m]ultiple dates are distinctly possible, depending on the nature of the assets and the circumstances surrounding their acquisition”. This court also observed (at [36]) that “[u]ltimately, perhaps the adoption of an operative date or dates <span class="font-italic">may not </span><span class="font-italic">really be that critical as compared to arriving at a just and equitable division</span>” ... </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">[original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold italics]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">On the facts of that particular case, we held that the date of the interim judgment was appropriate for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets because there “was a <span class="font-italic">continuous (albeit clearly attenuated) relationship</span> between the [husband and wife] throughout” [emphasis in original] even after the husband left the matrimonial home and before he filed for divorce (<span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span> at [12]). This was clear from the fact that the husband had visited the wife at the matrimonial home monthly and paid her maintenance of $1,200.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 We would venture even further than <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span> and <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span> in this case. In our judgment, while the court retains the discretion to select the appropriate operative date to determine the pool of matrimonial assets, there is much to be said that, unless the particular circumstances or justice of the case warrant it, the <span class="font-italic">starting point</span> or <span class="font-italic">default position</span> should be the date that interim judgment is granted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 There is a strong justification for this position as a matter of principle. The interim judgment “puts an end to the marriage contract and indicates that the parties no longer intend to participate in the joint accumulation of matrimonial assets ...” (<span class="font-italic">AJR v AJS</span> [2010] 4 SLR 617 (“<span class="font-italic">AJR</span>”) at [4]). The grant of interim judgment is a recognition by the court that there is “no longer any matrimonial home, no <span class="font-italic">consortium vitae</span> and no right on either side to conjugal rights” (<span class="font-italic">Sivakolunthu Kumarasamy v Shanmugam Nagaiah</span> <span class="font-italic">and another </span>[1987] SLR(R) 702 at [25]). The interim judgment “put[s] an end to the whole content of the marriage contract, leaving only the shell, that is, the technical bond” (<span class="font-italic">Fender v St John-Mildmay</span> [1936] 1 KB 111 at 115–117). In a general sense, it would be artificial to speak of any asset acquired <span class="font-italic">after</span> the interim judgment has been granted as being a matrimonial asset. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 Further, as Kan Ting Chiu J observed in <span class="font-italic">Yap Hwee May Kathryn v Geh Thien Ee Martin</span> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 663 at [25], there is “no reason why the actual division should not be done when [interim judgment] is granted” if all the relevant material is before the court at that time. It does not accord with good sense to encourage parties to drag out ancillary proceedings. However, depending on the party responsible, this factor could be a ground to adopt a later date as the operative date in order to achieve justice as between the parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 Adopting the date of the interim judgment as a starting point will also better enable parties to a divorce to arrange their financial affairs. It will give them the comfort of knowing when they will be taken as having moved into a different phase in their lives. It will also make it easier for their counsel to advise them. Judicial Commissioner Debbie Ong, writing as an academic prior to her elevation to the bench, expressed the view that the operative date should be fixed at the date of interim judgment as a matter of fairness to the parties to the divorce (Debbie Ong, “Family Law” (2011) 12 SAL Ann Rev 298 at para 15.23):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">15.23 The use of the date of the interim judgment of divorce is most consistent with the statutory definition of “matrimonial asset”. ... Upon the grant of [interim judgment], the marriage is practically at an end and it is in the interests of parties to settle all ancillary matters and bring closure to the divorce process. <span class="font-italic">Applying this date </span>… <span class="font-italic">brings certainty to parties who need to plan their financial affairs as they move on to post-divorce life.</span> [emphasis added]</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">We will not go so far as to <span class="font-italic">fix</span> the date of the interim judgment as the operative date for determining the pool of matrimonial assets. We think the right balance between certainty and flexibility is struck if the date of the interim judgment is set as a starting point, with the court possessing the discretion to depart from it in deserving cases.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">35 This will preserve the court’s flexibility to ensure that justice is done in every case. The court may depart from the starting point when there are cogent reasons to do so. These include situations where, for example, a party incurs a large amount of expenditure from having “indulged in certain vices” such that the matrimonial assets have been “unfairly or unjustly depleted by the unacceptable actions of that party” (<span class="font-italic">AJR v AJS</span> at [6]). Even when the court chooses not to depart from the starting point, it remains able to take into account accruing benefits (<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span> at [21]) and restore expenditure notionally to the pool of matrimonial assets (<span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin</span> at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">36 The court must exercise care when it decides to depart from the starting point, and should provide reasons whenever it does. This is because the court has not only the discretion to select the operative date to <span class="font-italic">determine</span> the pool of matrimonial assets, it also has the discretion to determine the date at which those assets should be <span class="font-italic">valued</span> (<span class="font-italic">Anthony Patrick Nathan v Chan Siew Chin</span> [2011] 4 SLR 1121 at [21]–[33]), and the discretion to determine how those assets should be <span class="font-italic">divided</span>. Having the discretion at multiple levels also means there could be an inherent danger of double-counting in relation to a factor to achieve what is perceived to be a just result. Such a concern was raised in this case, and we will come to that in a moment. Adopting a starting point in respect of the operative date will ensure that the inquiry will be systematic. It will prevent an exercise of an “unguided discretion” (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> [2015] 4 SLR 1043 (“<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>”) at [21]) to achieve justice and equity in each case.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Turning to the facts of this case, the question was whether the starting point should be departed from. In <span class="font-italic">Yeo Gim </span><span class="font-italic">Tong Michael v Tianzon Lolita</span> [1996] 1 SLR(R) 633 (“<span class="font-italic">T</span><span class="font-italic">ianzon</span>”), this court adopted the date of the ancillary hearing as the operative date because the wife continued to look after the child of the marriage after the grant of interim judgment. In the present case, the Judge, having carefully reviewed past cases, including those of this court, namely, <span class="font-italic">Tianzon</span>, <span class="font-italic">Yeo Chong Lin </span>and <span class="font-italic">Oh Choo</span>,<span class="font-italic"> </span>came to the conclusion at [31] that:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">As in the case of <span class="font-italic">Tianzon</span>, I noted that the defendant continued to be responsible for the welfare of the children even after the breakdown of the marriage and Interim Judgment which, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, enabled the plaintiff to concentrate on his work and hence accumulate cash from his salaries and bonuses (see [46] below).  I was of the view that the indirect contributions of the defendant as described had to be recognised.  Therefore, applying the principle derived in <span class="font-italic">Tianzon</span> and <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span> at [13]), I decided that the Operative Date should be 30 June 2012. …</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38  We deal first with the husband’s arguments that the date of separation should apply before turning to the Judge’s reasons that the date of commencement of ancillary proceedings should instead apply.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">39 The crux of the husband’s case is that after June 2009, parties “manifested [a] clear intention” that they did not want to “contribute to the pool of matrimonial assets” and that the parties “had a clean break”.

</div> With respect, this argument is flawed because even the husband himself acknowledges that subsequent to June 2009, he “paid for ... the rent for the [wife] and the children, the living expenses of the children, the [wife’s] household expenses and gave a maintenance sum of $1,200 to the [wife] …”.

</div>
</div> These acts, as in <span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span> (see [30] above), in fact demonstrate that “there was a <span class="font-italic">continuous (albeit clearly attenuated) relationship</span> between the parties throughout” (<span class="font-italic">Oh Choon</span> at [12]). It was not one where parties had a clean break and severed all contact whatsoever after they separated.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 Further, as the wife points out, the facts that the husband relies on are the ordinary factual concomitants of a failed marriage. If the husband’s argument is accepted, then in almost every divorce the operative date will be that of the parties’ separation. That, with respect, confuses the factual position with the position at law, which regards the parties as being in a subsisting legal union even though that union may have undergone factual disintegration.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41 The Judge, on the other hand, chose the date of the commencement of ancillary proceedings because the wife continued to care for the children even after the grant of interim judgment. This enabled the husband to focus on his work and obtain the salaries and bonuses he received in the intervening period (we quote again the Judgment at [31]):</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">31 ... the defendant continued to be responsible for the welfare of the children even after the breakdown of the marriage and Interim Judgment which, <span class="font-italic">inter alia</span>, enabled the plaintiff to concentrate on his work and hence accumulate cash from his salaries and bonuses. ... </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 Like in <span class="font-italic">Tianzon</span>, we think that this is a valid reason for the Judge to regard the earnings of the husband as being still part of the matrimonial pool. While the mere fact that the wife looked after the children after the granting of interim judgment may, in itself, be unexceptional, we emphasise two <span class="font-italic">further</span> points which, in our view, make the commencement of the ancillary hearing a fairer operative date. First, the amount of the salary and bonuses the husband received during the intervening period was tremendous, when considered in relation to the value of the matrimonial assets. We alluded to this at [22] above, where we mentioned that the pool of assets grew by approximately <span class="font-italic">50%</span> within the short period between the parties’ separation and the commencement of ancillary proceedings. Second, the wife’s care of the children and household <span class="font-italic">prior</span> to the granting of interim judgment may well have been a contributing factor to the husband’s ability to earn and attain the salary and bonuses that he then received <span class="font-italic">after</span> the granting of interim judgment. These factors viewed in their totality made it fairer in the circumstances of this particular case to adopt the later date of the commencement of ancillary proceedings, 30 June 2012, as the operative date. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43 In departing from the starting point or the default position, we recognise that the wife’s efforts during this period will also be taken into account when determining the wife’s indirect contributions. But this in no way amounts to double-counting as that is a distinct exercise. What is most important at the end of the day, having determined what is the pool of matrimonial assets, is to make a division which will achieve a just and equitable outcome having regard to both the financial and non-financial contributions of the parties and all the circumstances as set out in s 112 of the Women’s Charter. It is true that during the post-interim judgment period the wife continued to receive support from the husband who continued to pay for the rent of the matrimonial home needed by the wife and children as well as the wife’s and children’s other expenses. But nothing in this alters the fact as to what ought to be regarded as matrimonial assets. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Whether the Turunc property should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The decision below</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The husband argued that the Turunc property, which is situated in Turkey and valued at $70,357.50, belonged to his mother and should not be included in the pool of matrimonial assets. He produced a Turkish title deed which appeared to indicate that his mother was the registered owner of the property (the Judgment at [32]). The wife argued that the Turunc property was a matrimonial asset that the parties had purchased through the husband’s mother. The wife produced mortgage documents and bank statements showing that she had transferred substantial sums of money to the husband’s mother at or around the period that the Turunc property was purchased (the Judgment at [33]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The Judge preferred the wife’s position because of the documentary evidence which she produced.

The wife has produced credible documentary evidence that corroborates her account that she mortgaged a property in London belonging to her to purchase a holiday home in Turkey. She has also produced documentary evidence that she transferred substantial sums of money to the husband’s mother during that period.

While the wife had to be given some credit for helping the husband to improve himself in the early years of the marriage, beyond a certain point, the husband’s success had to be attributed to his own ability and drive (the Judgment at [57]). The Judge also gave the wife recognition for uprooting from London to move to Asia so that the family could be together.

The court is required to do so in proportions that it thinks “just and equitable” (s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter). It should consider “all the circumstances of the case”, including parties’ financial contributions, the needs of the children, contributions to the welfare of the family, and the factors referred to in s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter insofar as they are relevant (s 112(2) of the Women’s Charter).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">55 In <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>, we emphasised that both financial and non-financial contributions should be considered. We suggested a three-step framework for dealing with the division of matrimonial assets (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [22]). First, a ratio had to be ascribed to the parties’ direct contributions, having regard to the financial contributions made towards the acquisition and improvement of matrimonial assets. Second, a ratio had to be ascribed to the parties’ indirect contributions, in respect of the non-financial or indirect financial contributions of the parties. Third, these two ratios had to be averaged against each other to derive an “average percentage”. At none of these stages is the exercise a mathematical or mechanistic one. Ascertaining the parties’ direct financial contributions requires “rough and ready approximation” (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [23]). Determining the parties’ indirect contributions is all the more so an exercise in “broad strokes” (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [24]). Even at the third stage of averaging the ratios, the weight to be accorded to each ratio need not necessarily be equal. Circumstances could shift the average in favour of one ratio over the other. These include the length of the marriage, the size of the matrimonial pool, and the extent and nature of indirect contributions (<span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span> at [27]). In the present case, our ensuing discussion on the parties’ indirect contributions centres on their respective non-financial contributions. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(1) The first stage: ratio of financial contributions</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 The ratio of the parties’ total incomes, which they have accepted represent their financial contributions to the marriage, had been agreed to be 73:27.

</div> The label “homemaker” was a “pure façade”.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 We find it hard to accept the husband’s contentions for three reasons. First, the husband’s case in respect of the wife’s indirect contributions has been a negative one from the outset. His affidavits filed in the ancillary matters and his arguments (both in the court below and before this court) sought to undermine the wife’s alleged non-financial contributions “instead of dealing with his own indirect contributions” (the Judgment at [50]). His five affidavits on the ancillary matters are threadbare in respect of his non-financial contributions, even though they rely on the fact that he supported the family financially. Even in his Appellant’s Case, there are only isolated instances of his own non-financial contributions. It is only in his Appellant’s Reply that he belatedly claims that “the evidence shows that [he] played an active role in the family and his indirect contributions were substantial, if not more than the [w]ife’s” despite his frequent travel for work.

His allegations that the wife was not a supporting wife, mother, or that she was a poor manager of the household were considered squarely by the Judge (the Judgment at [50]–[52]) and rejected (the Judgment at [56]). It is trite that there is a presumption that the decision appealed against is correct (<span class="font-italic">Lee Bee Kim Jennifer v Lim Yew Khang Cecil</span> [2005] SGHC 209 at [14], cited with approval by this court in <span class="font-italic">Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah</span> [2007] SGCA 21 at [46]), and it is incumbent on the husband to show why we should reject the finding made by the Judge. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 Third, the evidence instead suggests that the wife had made sacrifices for the family and contributed indirectly to the household and the welfare of the children. Despite the husband’s protestations to the contrary, the wife’s decision to stop work and be a full-time homemaker must have been a conscious, if not deliberate one, rather than one brought about entirely by circumstance. The wife held a senior banking position when she was made redundant in 2003. There is nothing which shows that the wife would not have been able to find a job had she tried. Further, the wife relocated from England to Asia in 2003 and twice more within Asia between 2003 and 2008. Each relocation was driven by the demands of the husband’s career; the wife subordinated her interests and career to allow the husband to pursue his. It is evident that the family had made a decision to prioritise the husband’s career. The Judge also acknowledged the wife’s participation in the children’s school-related activities (the Judgment at [56]).

</div> All of these factors point in favour of the wife having contributed non-financially towards the marriage, family and household. She spent time raising the children; she freed up time for the husband to devote to his career; she allowed her interests to take a backseat and followed the husband wherever he was posted.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 In view of these circumstances, the ratio of the parties’ non-financial contributions should be 30:70 in favour of the wife. This appears to be the ratio which the Judge had adopted, since she made an equal division. This ratio is not overly generous to the wife. In <span class="font-italic">ANJ v ANK</span>, we held that the ratio of indirect contributions was 40:60 for the husband and wife respectively in a nine-year marriage with two children, where both spouses were employed full-time throughout the course of the entire marriage.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) The third stage: determination of the average percentage</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 This takes us to the third and final stage, the averaging of both ratios.

That is unlike the present case where the pool of assets is limited, and both the husband and the wife contributed substantially to it. The husband himself acknowledged in the court below that “the [wife’s] primary direct contributions, which were made in the early part of the marriage, were in appreciating assets (the Glasgow and Turkish Properties)” (the Judgment at [42]). The Glasgow and Turkish properties together are worth about $485,750 $485,749, which is approximately a third of the entire pool of matrimonial assets.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 In our judgment, therefore, approximately equal weight should be accorded to the ratios of the parties’ financial and non-financial contributions.

Assuming the wife had applied the full amount in the POSB Account to her expenses, as she claimed, she would have spent the entire balance of $106,375.72 over the span of 36 months (between June 2009 and June 2012). This works out to approximately $2,954.88 per month.

</div> in our judgment, the cumulative sum of money should be considered over the entire period of 36 months between the breakdown of the marriage and the operative date, namely, the commencement of ancillary proceedings. Further, from the bank statements that were made available to us, the pattern of the wife’s withdrawals indeed suggests that she used the money for expenditure, rather than to syphon the money away to conceal it. There was a substantial period of time between the wife’s removal of the $100,000 from the parties’ joint accounts in January 2008, and when she first began drawing down on the account in January 2010. If she had planned to hide the money, she had ample time to do so. Moreover, the withdrawals from the POSB account were also staggered and in relatively small amounts, rather than large withdrawals over a few tranches. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 In our judgment, therefore, the withdrawal of the $100,000 from the parties’ joint account, as well as the wife’s expenditure of it, has been adequately accounted for by the wife.

The Judge said that it was incumbent upon the wife to find full-time employment to defray her personal expenses. The Judge also ordered the husband to pay for the children’s school fees, medical insurance and pocket money, as he had volunteered to.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The parties’ cases on appeal</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 In this appeal, the wife seeks an increase in the monthly maintenance to $10,200.

It struck an appropriate balance between parties’ lifestyles, earning capacities and expenditure. However, her decision was made on the basis that the two children were boarding at the international school they were enrolled in. The children have since ceased boarding, and this change in circumstances necessitates adjustments to the Judge’s orders.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 We will first address the parties’ arguments as to whether the Judge’s original maintenance order was appropriate in the circumstances of the case. We will then address the adjustments that should be made to the Judge’s order in the light of the parties’ revised expenses, following from the children ceasing to board at the international school they are enrolled at.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether the Judge’s maintenance order was reasonable in the circumstances</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 Section 114(1) of the Women’s Charter is the statutory directive for the court to have regard to “all the circumstances of the case” when determining maintenance. These circumstances include the parties’ income and assets, present and anticipated financial position, standard of living during the marriage, age, and contributions to the marriage. The court must endeavour, as far as is practicable, to place the parties “in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down”, (s 114(2) of the Women’s Charter). This is done in a “commonsense holistic manner” in step with the “new realities that follow a failed marriage” (<span class="font-italic">NI v NJ</span> [2007] 1 SLR(R) 75 at [16]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 The objective of a maintenance order made under s 114(1) of the Women’s Charter is to provide the wife with “a fair share of the surplus wealth that had been acquired by the spouses during the subsistence of the marriage” (<span class="font-italic">Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow</span> [2012] 2 SLR 506 at [22], citing with approval Leong Wai Kum, <span class="font-italic">Elements of Family Law in Singapore</span> (LexisNexis, 2007) at p 476). The wife is, however, not entitled to expect “a full subsidy for her lifestyle” (<span class="font-italic">Yow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan</span> [2000] 2 SLR(R) 659 at [93]). She must exert reasonable efforts to secure gainful employment and sustain her pre-breakdown lifestyle (<span class="font-italic">Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee (alias Ho Kian </span><span class="font-italic">Guan)</span> [1995] SGHC 23 at [22]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 In our judgment, the quantum of maintenance ordered by the Judge was appropriate in the circumstances, and we see no reason to disturb it. The figure, viewed at a broad level, and against the husband’s earnings, was reasonable. The wife currently receives monthly maintenance of $7,700. If her salary from her part-time job ($2,500) is included, she receives approximately $10,200 monthly. If she is able to obtain full-time employment in a job which, for the sake of argument, pays $4,500, this will bring the monthly figure up to $12,200. This is an eminently comfortable amount for the wife and children, even from the perspective of her pre-breakdown lifestyle (considering the children’s school fees, insurance and pocket money is paid for by the husband). The husband, on the other hand, will have to pay approximately $7,700 in maintenance, $7,250 for the children’s school fees (the Judgment at [80(a)]), and $400 for the children’s pocket money (the Judgment at [80(c)]). This leaves him with $20,650 of his monthly salary, less the children’s insurance premiums and other expenses.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 The wife’s argument that her maintenance should be increased because she will not be able to find a suitable job is nothing more than a self-serving assertion. She needs to tell us what efforts she has made to secure an appropriate employment. She argues that she will not be able to get a “banking job” in her “area of specialization” because of market conditions, her age, and because she has been out of touch with the industry for a long time. We think it is unrealistic for the wife to expect to be slotted back into a comfortable and well-paying investment banking job after such a long hiatus from the industry. The question is not whether the wife will be able to find her ideal employment, but rather, whether she can be gainfully employed, and thus defray her personal expenses instead of being entirely dependent on the husband.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The wife’s argument for the holiday expenses is also unpersuasive. First, her grounds for advancing the argument are incongruous. On the one hand she says she needs to return to Scotland annually to keep in touch with her roots;

He lists an annual figure of $2,026 for each son for the purchase of a MacBook Pro laptop. He lists annual school registration fees of $5,271 for each son. No documentary proof is given for any of this expenditure, nor is any explanation given to justify these sums, or why they will recur yearly. No documentary proof is produced for S/No 3, which is the alleged rent for his Hong Kong flat.

The husband’s argument is that the reduction in the children’s school fees is offset by his other increased expenses.

Further, if the children should resume boarding, then the husband may make a fresh application for variation of the maintenance for the children.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">105 We thus adjust upwards the Judge’s original monthly maintenance order for the wife of $7,700 by $1,440 to $9,140.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">106 In the result, we dismiss the husband’s appeal and allow the wife’s appeal.

We should add that it was not clear from the wife’s affidavits, or the husband’s, for that matter, exactly when the children ceased boarding and started living with the wife.
