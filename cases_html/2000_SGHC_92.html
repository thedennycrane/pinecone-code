<p align="justify">1. Goh Teck Beng, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in Suit No. 849/98,

applied by way of SIC 601332/2000 to further amend the Amended Defence and Counterclaim

filed by him in that suit.</p>
<p align="justify">2. The application for amendment was made at a time when the hearing of

Suit No. 849/98 (which was heard together with Suit No. 24/98 and Suit No. 822/99) had

gone into the third week of hearing. At the time the application was heard, the hearing

was on its 24<sup>th</sup> day, all witnesses for the plaintiffs in Suit No. 849/98 (and

Suit No. 24/98) had completed their testimony and the plaintiffs had closed their case. I

rejected the application. The 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant has appealed against my decision

and I now give my grounds. </p>
<p align="justify">3. A Memorandum of Charge executed by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant in

connection with certain facilities granted by the plaintiffs, contained a personal

guarantee from the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that the facilities would be re-paid. The 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendant claimed that, at all material times, the plaintiffs and the 1<sup>st</sup>

defendant (Goh Chin Soon) had intended only to have the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant and not

the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant as personal guarantor for the loans under the Facility

Agreement and, by the proposed amendment, sought, for the first time, to introduce the

defence of common mistake. </p>
<p align="justify">4. Counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant submitted that as the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendant - in an affidavit filed as early as 14 August 1998 and, subsequently, in his

affidavit evidence-in-chief filed on 18 February 2000 - had raised the matters covered by

this application, the proposed amendments would not take the plaintiffs by surprise and

would not cause any prejudice to the plaintiffs that could not be compensated by way of

costs. </p>
<p align="justify">5. The plaintiffs had demanded payment from the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendant under the personal guarantee contained in the Memorandum of Charge as early as

13 May 1998. Not getting satisfaction, the plaintiffs had followed up on their demand by

instituting Suit No. 849/98. In paragraph 6 of the Statement of Claim filed by the

plaintiffs on 29 June 1998, the plaintiffs claimed against the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant

under the personal guarantee. In his defence to that claim, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant

not only failed to raise the defence of common mistake, but, by paragraph 3 of his Defence

and Counterclaim admitted, without qualification, that he executed the said personal

guarantee. Even assuming that there was some unwitting error in the filing of that

defence, the need to have that error corrected should have been evident to the 2<sup>nd</sup>

defendant from at least as early as 14 August 1998 when he filed the affidavit relied on

by his counsel. Yet no application for leave to amend was made until 17 March 2000 and no

satisfactory explanation was proffered by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to explain this

failure. </p>
<p align="justify">6. It cannot be over-emphasized that parties to a suit must ensure that

all necessary amendment to their pleadings are effected as early as possible. To effect

amendments at a late stage or in the course of the trial itself is undesirable. In general

terms, the longer a party takes to amend his pleadings after it is clear that an amendment

is called for, the more prejudice it will cause and the less likely it is that the

application for amendment will be granted. If this application for leave to amend was

merely to clarify the issues already raised in the pleadings, I may well have considered

the application favourably, late though the application was. But the amendments sought in

this application not only raised a completely new defence but a defence that would have

been patently obvious to the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant and his advisors from a long time

ago. To allow the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to raise such a defence, at so late a stage,

would, in my view, be prejudicial to the plaintiffs. </p>
<p align="justify">7. In <i>Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Famco (S) Pte Ltd &amp; Ors</i>

[1992] SLR 1008, Judith Prakash JC (as she then was) was faced with a similar application

to amend the defence after the plaintiffs had closed their case. There too the defendants

had the necessary material to have applied for the amendment at a much earlier time. Her

Honour held that the application, if granted, would put the plaintiffs in great difficulty

and the injustice to the plaintiffs was not only a matter of costs. It would involve a

re-presentation of their case, investigation of the defendants’ allegations and a

consideration of whether to allow the defendants another opportunity to cross-examine the

plaintiffs’ witnesses. For those reasons, Her Honour was not prepared to allow the

amendments. </p>
<p align="justify">8. <i>Alegemene Bank Nederland NV v Happy Valley Restaurant Pte Ltd</i>

[1991] SLR 708 is also a case where an application to amend the defence was made after the

plaintiffs had closed their case. Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) refused the application

for reasons, summarised in the headnotes, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(4) The defendants’ application to amend the defence was

  only made after the plaintiffs had closed their case and the defendants had begun to call

  their first witness and while the parties were waiting for dates to be allocated for the

  resumed hearing of the actions. The proposed amendments were of a material nature and

  would unfairly prejudice the plaintiffs. Moreover, the plaintiffs had already closed their

  case and an award of costs alone would not undo the harm which the amendments would cause.

  In any case, the points sought by the defendants to be included in their defence could and

  should have been raised by the defendants very much earlier. In view of the above, it

  would not be proper and just to allow the defendants’ application to amend their

  defence."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The circumstances of the present case are similar to those considered

in <i>Hong Leong Finance Ltd </i>and <i>Alegmene Bank Nederland NV</i>. There was, in the

present case, an additional factor: At the close of the cross-examination of John Low (a

former employee of the 1<sup>st</sup> plaintiffs who had procured the execution of the

Memorandum of Charge by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant), counsel for the plaintiffs had

drawn attention to the fact that there were allegations contained in the affidavit

evidence-in-chief of the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant that had not been put to John Low and

invited counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant, if he was going to rely on those

matters, to cross-examine John Low thereon. That invitation was not taken up. Having

elected not to cross-examine John Low (on matters which would be relevant to the plea of

common mistake) when John Low was in the witness stand, the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant

should not, at this late stage be permitted to amend his pleadings to include that plea.</p>
<p align="justify">9. Counsel for the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant submitted that any

prejudice that the plaintiffs might suffer in this case can be compensated by costs and

that in order to do justice between the parties the amendments ought to be allowed. I

could not accept that submission. The principal witness of the plaintiffs relevant to the

proposed new defence was John Low. John Low had completed his testimony and had returned

to Hong Kong where he resides. If the amendments were allowed, there could be no certainty

that the plaintiffs would be able to procure his further attendance in court. That fact

alone was prejudicial to the plaintiffs and was sufficient to dispose of the submission. </p>
<p align="justify">10. But even if the attendance of John Low could be procured, whether

leave to amend should be granted still remained a matter for the court’s discretion.

As Lord Griffiths said in <i>Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd</i> [1988] 1 All ER 38 at

62: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Furthermore, whatever may have been the rule of conduct a hundred

  years ago, today it is not the practice to invariably allow a defence which is wholly

  different from that pleaded to be raised by amendment at the end of the trial even on

  terms that an adjournment is granted and that the defendant pays all the costs thrown

  away. There is a clear difference between allowing amendments to clarify the issues in

  dispute and those that permit a distinct defence to be raised for the first time.</p>
<p align="justify">Whether an amendment should be granted is a matter for the discretion

  of the trial judge and he should be guided in the exercise of the discretion of his

  assessment of where justice lies. Many and diverse factors will bear on the exercise of

  this discretion. I do not think it possible to enumerate them all or wise to attempt to do

  so. But justice cannot always be measured in terms of money and in my view a judge is

  entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the litigation imposes on litigants,

  particularly if they are personal litigants rather than business corporations, the

  anxieties occasioned by facing new issues, the raising of false hopes, and the legitimate

  expectation that the trial will determine the issues one way or the other."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Lord Griffith, at page 62 of his judgment, made another observation

which is worth noting. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Another factor that a judge must weigh in the balance is the

  pressure on the courts caused by the great increase in litigation and the consequent

  necessity that, in the interests of the whole community, legal business should be

  conducted efficiently. We can no longer afford to show the same indulgence towards the

  negligent conduct of litigation as was perhaps possible in a more leisured age. There will

  be cases in which justice will be better served by allowing the consequences of the

  negligence of the lawyers to fall on their own heads rather than by allowing an amendment

  at a very late stage of the proceedings."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">These comments by Lord Griffiths are apposite in our context. The

application for amendment to include the plea of common mistake, in this case, was made at

so late a stage after the need for the amendment became apparent that it would be

prejudicial to the fair conduct of the trial for the application for amendment to be

allowed.</p>
<p align="justify">11.    For the above reasons, I dismissed with costs the

application by the 2<sup>nd</sup> defendant to amend his pleadings. </p>
