The plaintiffs committed a breach of the first tenancy agreement by ceasing to pay rent under it in late 2019 and by yielding up the first storey to the defendant before the end of the first tenancy agreement’s term.

In other words, it is no part of the plaintiffs’ case that the defendant is in breach of the first tenancy agreement by reason of the URA’s confirmation in February 2019 that the approved use of the first storey under the Planning Act was as a shop and not as a restaurant or an eating house. The plaintiffs therefore raise the first issue only to establish that the breach of the term that they seek to imply into the single contract gave the plaintiffs the right to terminate their tenancy of the entire Property, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, their tenancy of all three storeys including the first storey.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 The plaintiffs submit that that they took their tenancy of the Property under a single contract for four reasons.

</div> Therefore, the plaintiffs’ tenancy of the Property was expressed in two documents purely for reasons of drafting form and not for any reasons of commercial substance. Fourth, the first time the plaintiffs saw the two tenancy agreements was when the defendant presented them to the plaintiffs as a <span class="font-italic">fait accompli</span> for their signature at his office on 3 December 2018.

</div>
</div>
</div> The plaintiffs therefore could not object to the defendant’s decision to separate the plaintiffs’ tenancy of the Property into two tenancy agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 I do not accept the plaintiffs’ submission. Instead, I accept the defendant’s submission that the two tenancy agreements are separate and independent contracts. I arrive at this conclusion for four reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 First, the express terms of the two tenancy agreements show that the agreements are separate and independent in substance, not merely form. The plaintiffs accept that the defendant informed them at the outset, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, when they agreed to take a tenancy of the Property, that they would have to enter into separate tenancy agreements for the first storey and for the second and third storeys. It is true that the differing incidence of GST was the reason for the separation. But the two tenancy agreements that resulted are separate and independent as a matter of contractual substance and not merely as a matter of drafting form. There is no term in one tenancy agreement which makes any of the parties’ rights or obligations under that tenancy agreement dependent on the mere existence of the other tenancy agreement, let alone on the rights and obligations under the other tenancy agreement. Indeed, neither tenancy agreement makes any reference whatsoever to the other tenancy agreement, even as part of the commercial background in recitals. If the parties wanted the performance of one tenancy agreement to be dependent upon the performance of the other tenancy agreement, they would and could have included an express term to capture and define the scope of the dependence in the tenancy agreements. There is no such term.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 Second, there is no contractual basis on which any such dependence can arise in the absence of an express term, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, by implication. The mere fact that the defendant presented the two tenancy agreements to the plaintiffs for their signature as a <span class="font-italic">fait accompli</span> cannot give rise to any such dependence by implication. Equally, there is no contractual basis on which a term giving rise to such dependence can be implied into the tenancy agreements, whether as a term implied in law or as a term implied in fact. Each tenancy agreement is a self-contained contract, commercially workable on its own terms. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">51 Third, contrary to the plaintiffs’ submission, each tenancy agreement had a separate commercial purpose. The commercial purpose of the first tenancy agreement was to operate a restaurant at the ground floor. The commercial purpose of the second tenancy agreement was to house the restaurant’s employees on the second and third storeys. These two purposes were undoubtedly intended to be complementary commercial purposes. But equally undoubtedly, they are independent commercial purposes. Thus, as the defendant points out, even if the plaintiffs were relieved of their obligations under the second tenancy agreement, they were still perfectly able to achieve the commercial purpose of the first tenancy agreement by continuing to operate a restaurant at the first storey.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">52 Fourth, the plaintiffs themselves treated the two tenancy agreements as independent agreements. In October 2019, after the dispute had arisen between the parties, the plaintiffs proposed to the defendant that the defendant suspend the plaintiffs’ obligations under the second tenancy agreement pending clarification from the authorities on the lawfulness of the third storey while keeping the first tenancy agreement on foot.

</div> No doubt the plaintiffs suggested this only to make the best of a bad situation. But the mere fact of the proposal shows that the first tenancy agreement is commercially workable on its own terms. And the fact that it was the plaintiffs who made the proposal shows that they subjectively accepted that it was commercially workable on its own terms as late as October 2019.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">53 Accordingly, I hold that the two tenancy agreements are separate and independent contracts and do not constitute a single contract. As I have mentioned, it is not the plaintiffs’ case that the defendant committed any breach of the first tenancy agreement if the two tenancy agreements are found to be separate and independent contracts.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">56 I have allowed the plaintiffs to advance this submission in the alternative for two reasons. First, doing so is not a departure from the plaintiffs’ pleaded case but remains consistent with it. Second, and more importantly, I do not consider it unfair to the defendant to allow the plaintiffs to advance this submission. The defendant’s case on the implied term does not turn on the distinction between a term implied in law and a term implied in fact. The defendant’s case is that: (a) the content of the implied term contradicts the express terms of the second tenancy agreement; and (b) the implied term is not of a type that gives the plaintiffs a right to terminate the contract upon a breach of it. Allowing the plaintiffs to rely on a term implied in fact therefore causes no unfairness to the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Implied term in fact</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">57 I deal first with the plaintiffs’ submission that there is an implied term in fact in the second tenancy agreement that second and third storeys were constructed lawfully. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">58 In its seminal decision in <span class="font-italic">Sembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal</span> [2013] 4 SLR 193 (“<span class="font-italic">SembCorp</span>”), the Court of Appeal set out authoritatively the process by which a term will be implied in fact into a contract (<span class="font-italic">SembCorp </span>at [93]–[101]). That process “is best understood as an exercise in giving effect to the parties’ <span class="font-italic">presumed</span> intentions [emphasis in original]” (<span class="font-italic">SembCorp </span>at [93]). It is only ever appropriate for a court to imply a term into a contract if it does so in order to fill a contractual gap that has arisen because “the parties did not contemplate the issue at all” (<span class="font-italic">SembCorp </span>at [94]–[95]). The court will therefore not imply a term into a contract simply because the term is reasonable, equitable, clear or consistent with the other terms in the contract (<span class="font-italic">SembCorp </span>at [98] and [100]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">59 In <span class="font-italic">SembCorp</span> at [101], the Court of Appeal set out the three-step process for implying a term in fact into a contract under Singapore law. In short, such a term will be implied into a contract if and only if there is a gap in the contract on a particular issue which exists because the parties did not contemplate the issue and if the term to be implied to fill the gap is necessary to give the contract business efficacy and if the content of that term is obvious having regard to the need for business efficacy. As the Court of Appeal put it: </div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(a) The first step is to ascertain how the gap in the contract arises. Implication will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(b) At the second step, the court considers whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give the contract efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">(c) Finally, the court considers the specific term to be implied. This must be one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had the proposed term been put to them at time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists and the consequences of that gap ensue.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">60 Applying <span class="font-italic">SembCorp</span>’s three-step process, I accept the plaintiffs’ submission that there was a term implied in fact in the second tenancy agreement that the second and third storeys were constructed lawfully. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">61 At <span class="font-italic">SembCorp</span><span class="font-italic">’s </span>first step, I accept that there is a gap in the second tenancy agreement on a specific issue (see <span class="font-italic">SembCorp</span> at [101(a)]). That issue is whether the second and third storeys had been constructed lawfully. Nowhere in the second tenancy agreement do the parties make any provision as to who should bear this risk or address this issue even obliquely. Further, I accept that this gap arose because the parties failed to contemplate the issue. There is no evidence whatsoever that the parties contemplated this issue and nevertheless chose not to provide for it because they thought mistakenly that the express terms of the contract addressed it or because they could not agree on a solution to address it (see <span class="font-italic">SembCorp</span> at [94(b)] and [94(c)]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">62 The defendant submits that an implied term to this effect in the second tenancy agreement would be contrary to the express terms of that agreement, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, cl 31 read with cl 20.1 (see [21] above). The effect of these clauses is to place the burden on the plaintiffs to obtain the necessary approvals, permits and licences to use the second and third storeys for residential use. I do not accept the defendant’s submission. The subject matter of these express terms is only the <span class="font-italic">use</span> of the second and third storeys. These express terms have nothing to do with the second and third storeys having been constructed lawfully. The defendant’s submission meets the issue of lawfulness only if it is understood as an extended submission that the express terms of the second tenancy agreement makes it the plaintiffs’ obligation to obtain approval for the construction of the third storey as an essential condition precedent to obtaining approval from the URA to use the third storey for residential use. I consider this extended submission to be absurd and reject it out of hand.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">63 At <span class="font-italic">SembCorp</span>’s<span class="font-italic"> </span>second step, I accept that it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply this term to give the second tenancy agreement efficacy (see <span class="font-italic">SembCorp</span> at [101(b)]. The plaintiffs contractually bargained for the right in law and in fact to use the second and third storeys in exchange for their obligation to pay rent to the defendant. It is efficacious in the business or commercial sense that they should be able to use the second and third storeys as bargained for without physical or legal impediment and without precarity. The implied term is necessary to achieve that efficacy.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">64 At <span class="font-italic">SembCorp</span><span class="font-italic">’s </span>third step, I accept that the content of this implied term satisfies the test of obviousness. Having regard to the need for business efficacy, I accept that the parties would have responded “Oh, of course!” had it been put to them when they executed the second tenancy agreement that the defendant was impliedly warranting that the second and third storeys had been constructed lawfully (see <span class="font-italic">SembCorp</span> at [101(c)]). The defendant is the owner of the Property. As between the plaintiffs and the defendant, the defendant is in a far better position to ensure that the second and third storeys are constructed lawfully or to know or ascertain whether they have been constructed lawfully. The business and commercial benefit of those storeys having been constructed lawfully accrues ultimately to the landlord as the owner of the Property. This benefit is a permanent benefit and is transmissible with the Property. It therefore endures for the defendant’s benefit even after the plaintiffs’ tenancy of those two storeys ends. Any business or commercial benefit to the plaintiffs from the second and third storeys having been constructed lawfully, or from regularising the position if they have not, is purely transient. It lasts only for the duration of the tenancy. It is obvious that, if the defendant as landlord enters into a tenancy agreement demising the second and third storeys to the plaintiffs as tenants, it is the defendant who should bear and would accept the risk of one or both of those two storeys having been constructed unlawfully.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">65 I find therefore that there is an implied term in fact in the second tenancy agreement by which the defendant, as landlord, warranted that the second and third storeys had been constructed lawfully. Given this finding, it is not necessary for me to decide whether there is an implied term in law to the same effect. For completeness and if it had been necessary for me to do so, I would have been prepared to find that there is an implied term in law in every tenancy agreement by which the landlord warrants to the tenant that every part of the premises demised under the tenancy agreement has been constructed lawfully. But I choose to rest my decision on an implied term in fact because it is unnecessary for me to make a finding on an implied term in law to decide this case, and because such a finding would have far reaching consequences for all tenancy agreements and leases (see <span class="font-italic">Chua Choon Cheng and </span><span class="font-italic">others v Allgreen Properties Ltd and another appeal</span> [2009] 3 SLR(R) 724 at [69]).</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The defendant breached the implied term</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">66 There is no doubt that the defendant has breached this implied term. It is not in dispute that the third storey was not constructed lawfully. The URA confirmed this in October 2019, when it confirmed to the defendant that it had no record of ever having approved the construction of the third storey and imposing conditions if the defendant wanted to retain it:

Subject only to contrary agreement, liability for breach of contract is strict and does not turn on personal responsibility, knowledge or negligence. There is no relevant contrary agreement in this case.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The breach was a repudiatory breach</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">69 I turn now to address the consequences of the defendant’s breach of this implied term. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">70 The plaintiffs submit that the defendant’s breach of this implied term was a repudiatory breach giving the plaintiffs a right to terminate the second tenancy agreement. I accept the plaintiffs’ submission. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">71 In <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd and another appeal</span> [2007] 4 SLR(R) 413 (“<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span>”), the Court of Appeal set out authoritatively at [89]–[113] the situations in which a breach of contract gives the innocent party a right to terminate a contract and thereby to relieve itself of its future obligations under the contract. The most obvious situation is where the contract clearly and unambiguously provides that certain events will, if they occur, entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract. But that situation will rarely give rise to a dispute. Leaving that situation aside, the first situation is where the contract-breaker renounces its contract, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, “clearly conveys to the other party to the contract that it will not perform its contractual obligations at all [emphasis in original omitted]” (<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>at [93]). The second situation is where the parties’ intention, ascertained in the usual contractual way, was “to designate that term as one that is so important that any breach, regardless of the actual consequences of such a breach, would entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract [emphasis in original omitted]” (<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>at [97]). The third situation is where “the breach in question will ‘give rise to an event which will deprive the party not in default … of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract’ [emphasis in original omitted]” (<span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>at [99], citing the judgment of Diplock LJ (as he then was) in <span class="font-italic">Hongkong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd</span> [1962] 2 QB 26 at 70).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">72 This case is not one where the plaintiffs claim a right to terminate the second tenancy agreement arising from an express term in that agreement entitling them to do so. Indeed, that will always be the case where the term breached is, as here, an implied term rather than an express term. By the very nature of the first step of three-step process leading to an implied term in fact, it cannot be the subject of any express agreement between the contracting parties.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">73 I do, however, accept the plaintiffs’ submission that the breach of the implied term falls within the second limb of the third situation identified in <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete</span> at [99]–[101]. The defendant’s breach of the implied term deprived the plaintiffs of substantially the whole benefit which both the plaintiffs and the defendant intended that the plaintiffs should obtain under the second tenancy agreement. The plaintiffs entered into this agreement and undertook the obligation to pay rent to the defendant under it for the very purpose of making lawful use of the second and third storeys without physical or legal impediment or precarity. Yet the plaintiffs were unable to do so because the third floor had been constructed unlawfully. Once they appreciated that the regulatory authorities could, at any time, have ordered the plaintiffs to cease any use of the third storey or even ordered the defendant to demolish it, it was entirely reasonable for the plaintiffs to make no further use of the second and third storeys. The defendant’s breach therefore deprived the plaintiffs of substantially the whole of the bargained-for benefit under the second tenancy agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">The plaintiffs affirmed the contract</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">74 The next issue is to ascertain the contractual consequence of the defendant’s repudiatory breach of the implied term in the second tenancy agreement. The plaintiffs submit that they accepted the repudiatory breach, thereby terminating the second tenancy agreement and relieving themselves of any obligation to pay rent to the defendant under it. The defendant submits that the plaintiffs lost the right to terminate the second tenancy agreement because they affirmed the agreement with knowledge of the repudiatory breach.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">75 The principles governing the consequences of a repudiatory breach of contract are set out in <span class="font-italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (HG Beale gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 30th Ed, 2008) (“<span class="font-italic">Chitty</span>”) at §24–003:</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">Where the innocent party, being entitled to choose whether to treat the contract as continuing or to accept the repudiation and treat himself as discharged, elects to treat the contract as continuing, he is usually said to have ‘affirmed’ the contract. … Affirmation may be express or implied. It will be implied if, with knowledge of the breach and of his right to choose, he does some unequivocal act from which it may be inferred that he intends to go on with the contract regardless of the breach or from which it may be inferred that he will not exercise his right to treat the contract as repudiated. Affirmation must be total: the innocent party cannot approbate and reprobate by affirming part of the contract and disaffirming the rest, for that would be to make a new contract.</div><div class="Judg-Quote-0 mb-3 mt-3 ml-3 mr-3 pl-3 pr-3 text-justify">… [I]f the innocent party unreservedly continues to press for performance or accepts performance by the other party after becoming aware of the breach and of his right to elect, he will be held to have affirmed the contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">76 The plaintiffs discovered the defendant’s repudiatory breach of the second tenancy agreement in February 2019. That was when the plaintiffs discovered that the URA had no record of a third storey at the Property. Despite this, the plaintiffs continued to pay rent to the defendant under the second tenancy agreement for seven months, until September 2019. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">77 The defendant submits that the plaintiffs, by continuing to pay rent to the defendant until September 2019, elected to affirm the second tenancy agreement and therefore lost the right to terminate it. The defendant further submits that the plaintiffs’ failure to pay rent after September 2019 was itself a repudiatory breach of the second tenancy agreement which the defendant accepted in December 2019. By that acceptance, the defendant terminated the second tenancy agreement with effect from December 2019.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">78 I accept the defendant’s submission that the plaintiffs’ conduct in paying rent to the defendant under the second tenancy agreement affirmed the agreement. It is clear from the correspondence that the plaintiffs, with knowledge of the defendant’s repudiatory breach of contract, made a commercial decision to keep the second tenancy agreement on foot while the defendant worked with the URA and the BCA to regularise the lawfulness of the third storey. As a result of this affirmation, the plaintiffs lost their right to terminate the second tenancy agreement arising from the defendant’s repudiatory breach of contract. Of course, the defendant remains liable in damages for this breach (see <span class="font-italic">RDC Concrete </span>at [40] and [114]).</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">79 As a result of the plaintiffs’ affirmation of the second tenancy agreement, the plaintiffs remained bound to pay rent to the defendant under that agreement even after September 2019. The plaintiffs’ failure to pay rent after September 2019 is therefore a breach of contract. That is so even though the defendant was in breach of the implied term of the second tenancy agreement. Subject to contrary agreement, a tenant’s obligation to pay rent to a landlord is independent of the landlord’s performance of his obligations under a tenancy agreement. There is no suggestion of any such contrary agreement. As a result, the defendant’s breach of the second tenancy agreement did not, in itself, relieve the plaintiffs from their obligation to pay rent to the defendant under the second tenancy agreement. The plaintiffs are therefore liable to pay damages to the defendant for this breach of the second tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Damages payable by the defendant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">80 I now turn to the question of damages.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">82 The plaintiffs claim these sums under both the first tenancy agreement and the second tenancy agreement. But the defendant did not breach any term of the first tenancy agreement. The plaintiffs therefore have no right to recover damages from the defendant under the first tenancy agreement. The plaintiffs’ only entitlement to recover damages from the defendant is in respect of the defendant’s breach of the implied term in the second tenancy agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Security deposits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">83 The defendant himself accepts that the plaintiffs are entitled, subject only to set off, to recover the security deposits they paid under both the first tenancy agreement and the second tenancy agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">84 The security deposits are not, strictly speaking, recoverable as heads of any kind of loss or damage. That is because the deposits were not, by the terms of either tenancy agreement, a wasted expense that the plaintiffs incurred or a profit that the plaintiffs expected to earn by reason of the defendant performing his contractual obligations. Instead, the security deposits are sums which the defendant was contractually obliged to refund to the plaintiffs under and subject to cl 2.5 of both tenancy agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">85 The plaintiffs are therefore entitled to recover from the defendant the sum of $68,000. This entitlement is contractually subject only to the defendant’s entitlement to deduct from these deposits any sums due from the plaintiffs to the defendant for breach of their obligations under either of the two tenancy agreements. I will account for that contractual entitlement when I set off the damages due to the defendant against the damages due to the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Rent paid from December 2018</span></div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Under the first tenancy agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">86 The plaintiffs are not entitled to recover the rent that they paid to the defendant for the eleven months from December 2018 to November 2019 under the first tenancy agreement. I have found that the first tenancy agreement was a separate and independent contract from the second tenancy agreement. And, as I have pointed out, it is not the plaintiffs’ case that the defendant breached the first tenancy agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">87 The plaintiffs therefore have no basis to recover the rent that the paid under the first tenancy agreement as damages.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Under the second tenancy agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">88 I accept, however, that the plaintiffs can claim as reliance loss the rent that they paid under the second tenancy agreement for the nine months from December 2018 to August 2019 totalling $54,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">89 Reliance loss is defined generally as the expense that a party incurs in reliance on the other party performing its contractual obligations, but which is wasted because of the other party’s breach of those obligations. An innocent party may recover reliance loss as damages for breach of a contract even if he incurred the relevant expense in order to perform his own obligations under the contract. Thus, if the wasted expense is the payment of a sum due under a contract, that sum remains recoverable in principle as reliance loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">90 In the present case, the plaintiffs as tenants paid rent to the defendant as landlord in reliance on the implied term warranting that the third storey had been constructed lawfully. The rent paid from December 2018 to August 2019 was a wasted expense because the third storey had not in fact been constructed lawfully. Use of the third storey for the contractual purpose stipulated under the second tenancy agreement would have been equally unlawful. The fact that the plaintiffs affirmed the second tenancy agreement by continuing to pay rent to the defendant from February 2019 to August 2019 disentitles them from terminating the second tenancy agreement as a result of the defendant’s repudiatory breach but does not disentitle them from recovering this rent as damages for the defendant’s breach on the reliance measure.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">91 The rent that the plaintiffs paid after affirming the second tenancy agreement constitutes their reliance loss just as much as the rent that they paid before affirming this agreement. That is because the plaintiffs paid the rent after affirming this agreement in anticipation of the defendant regularising the lawfulness of the third storey and thereby curing his breach of the implied term.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">92 Accordingly, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the sum of $54,000 being the rent which they paid from December 2018 to August 2019 under the second tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Renovation at the first storey</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">93 The plaintiffs cannot recover as damages the sums which they paid to renovate the first storey in anticipation of operating a restaurant there under the first tenancy agreement. As the defendant did not breach the first tenancy agreement, the plaintiffs have no right to recover damages under the first tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Compensation paid to previous tenant</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">94 I accept that the plaintiffs can recover as reliance loss at least part of the compensation that they paid to the previous tenant of the Property to induce them to terminate their tenancy of the Property early.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">95 This compensation is an expense that the plaintiffs incurred before they entered into the second tenancy agreement. A pre-contractual expense of this kind is recoverable as reliance loss if it was reasonably in the contemplation of the parties as likely to be wasted if the contract, once entered into, were to be breached. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">96 In November 2018, the previous tenant informed the defendant that the plaintiffs had paid an unspecified sum of money in exchange for the plaintiffs’ taking over the previous tenant’s restaurant business and tenancy agreements. I am therefore satisfied that it was within the reasonable contemplation of the defendant that this sum would be wasted, at least in part, if the defendant breached the express or implied terms of either or both of the first and second tenancy agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">97 The plaintiffs paid $36,500 to the previous tenant as compensation. This payment was paid to secure a tenancy of all three storeys. The defendant did not breach the implied term in the first tenancy agreement. In light of my finding that the defendant breached only the second tenancy agreement, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover only a proportionate amount of the compensation. I therefore hold that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover only two-thirds of this compensation, the one-third referable to the first storey being irrecoverable. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">98 I therefore set the recoverable proportion of the compensation payment at two-thirds of $36,500 being $24,333, rounded off to the nearest dollar.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Fee paid to the URA</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">99 The fee that the plaintiffs paid to the URA was referable to the first tenancy agreement and to the restaurant business that the plaintiffs operated at the first storey under that agreement. As the defendant did not breach the first tenancy agreement, the plaintiffs have no right to recover this sum as damages.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Loss of profits</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">100 The plaintiffs also claim expectation loss that they quantify at $321,000 being the profits that they lost by being unable to operate a restaurant on the Property during the entire duration of the first tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">101 This loss is irrecoverable for two reasons.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">102 First, as a matter of principle, the defendant’s breach of the second tenancy agreement has no connection to any loss of profits from the restaurant business that the plaintiffs were operating at the first storey under the first tenancy agreement. As the defendant did not breach the first tenancy agreement, the plaintiffs have no right to recover this sum as damages.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">103 Second, even if I accept that there is such a connection, I do not accept the calculation presented by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs’ claim is based on estimated sales of $2,000 to $2,500 per day. This estimate is entirely unsupported by evidence and is wholly speculative. The plaintiffs rely on a business plan to support these estimates.

As the second and third storeys remain vacant with no failure on the defendant’s part to mitigate his loss, the defendant need not bring any sums into account for the plaintiffs’ credit.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">119 The defendant is entitled in principle to recover this sum from the plaintiffs under the second tenancy agreement as his expectation loss.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">120 But the result of awarding the defendant his expectation loss under the second tenancy agreement – comprising the rental arrears from September 2019 to January 2020 (see [109] above) and unpaid future rent from January 2020 to November 2022 (see [118] above) – appears odd in a situation such as the present where both the landlord and the tenant are in breach of the same tenancy agreement. It would appear to make no sense to hold that the plaintiffs can recover from the defendant the rent that they paid <span class="font-italic">before</span> August 2019 as their reliance loss (see [88]–[92] above) while at the same time holding that the defendant can recover from the plaintiffs the rent that became payable <span class="font-italic">after</span> September 2019 as his expectation loss. This amounts to holding that the plaintiffs are contractually excused from their obligation to pay rent for a period of time in which the second tenancy agreement remained on foot and they were in possession of the second and third storeys (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from December 2018 until August 2019) but have to pay damages to the defendant for failing to pay rent for a period of time after the second tenancy agreement had been terminated and when they were not in possession of the second and third storeys (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, from January 2020 until November 2022). </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">121 To my mind, the answer to this oddity lies in the formulation of the test for expectation loss. A party claiming expectation loss – the defendant in this case – is not entitled to be put in the position he would have been in if his contractual counterparty had performed his obligations under the contract in some purely notional or abstract sense. A party claiming expectation loss is entitled to be put in the position he would have been in if the counterparty had performed <span class="font-italic">this</span> contract in accordance with the <span class="font-italic">specific</span> circumstances surrounding <span class="font-italic">this</span> breach of contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">122 This formulation means that I cannot assess the defendant’s expectation loss arising from the plaintiffs’ breach of the second tenancy agreement while ignoring the defendant’s own breach of the implied term in the second tenancy agreement. If the plaintiffs had performed their obligation to pay rent under the second tenancy agreement after August 2019, they would have paid the rent of $6,000 due every month to the defendant in compliance with that primary obligation. But as soon as the plaintiffs had paid that rent to the defendant, the defendant would have come under a secondary obligation – by reason of his own breach of the implied term in the second tenancy agreement – to pay damages to the plaintiffs equivalent to the sum he had just received from them as rent, being the plaintiffs’ reliance loss for the defendant’s breach of contract.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">123 The result is that the plaintiffs’ primary obligation to pay rent to the defendant under the second tenancy agreement from September 2019 until November 2022 is entirely set off by the defendant’s secondary obligation to pay those same sums back to the plaintiffs as their reliance loss arising from the defendant’s breach of the implied term in the second tenancy agreement. This leaves nothing owing to the defendant for his expectation loss for the plaintiffs’ breach of the second tenancy agreement. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Conclusion on loss of rental income</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">124 For loss of rental income under both tenancy agreements, therefore, the defendant is entitled to recover from the plaintiffs only his expectation loss under the first tenancy agreement amounting to $347,935.48.

</div>
</div> I accept that the plaintiffs’ photograph taken in April 2022 shows the replacement cassette air conditioning unit and not the original cassette air conditioning unit that was present when the plaintiffs took possession of the Property. I accept the professional engineer’s evidence that this cassette air conditioning unit was missing when the plaintiffs yielded up the Property to the defendant in January 2020. The plaintiffs are therefore obliged to bear this cost under the first tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">129 I accept also the professional engineer’s evidence that the defendant incurred the cost of the electrical works and for the removal of rubbish. The plaintiffs are therefore obliged to bear this cost under the first tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">The second tenancy agreement</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">130 The defendant quantifies his claim for reinstatement costs under the second tenancy agreement at $36,859.16. This comprises the following expenses that he incurred:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $6,063.33 for air conditioning works at the second storey;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $1,783.33 for electrical works at the second storey; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) $1,605.00 for removal of rubbish at the second storey;</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) $2,407.50 for removal of timber boards and carpets at the second storey; and</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(e) $25,000 for rectification of the timber floor and ceiling at the second storey.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">131 The professional engineer’s evidence is that the air conditioning works at the second storey were necessary because the plaintiffs failed to maintain the air conditioning units at the second storey. The electrical works and the removal of rubbish were necessary for the same reasons. I accept his evidence. These were breaches of the second tenancy agreement. I therefore allow the defendant’s claim for the cost of air conditioning works, electrical works and the removal of rubbish under the second tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">132  I also allow the defendant’s claim for the cost of removing the timber boards and carpets and for rectification of the timber floor and ceiling at the second storey, but with a small deduction. I accept that the defendant incurred these costs and that the plaintiffs were obliged to bear them under the second tenancy agreement. But I do not allow the defendant’s claim for the entire cost of removing the plywood planks and the original timber flooring. I accept that the plaintiffs did install plywood planks over the original timber flooring at the second storey. After the plaintiffs yielded up the Property, the defendant had to remove the plywood planks because this created an additional and unacceptable load and had to replace the original timber flooring because the plywood planks had damaged the original timber flooring. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">133 Clause 44 of the second tenancy agreement obliges the plaintiffs to “remove all … fixtures and installations of the [plaintiffs] or any part thereof” at the plaintiffs’ expense before yielding up the Property. But it is a condition precedent to this obligation that the defendant must require the plaintiffs to do so. There is no evidence that the defendant ever required the plaintiffs to remove the plywood planks. Therefore, the cost of removing the plywood planks falls outside the scope of the plaintiffs’ obligation under cl 44 of the second tenancy agreement. The defendant is therefore not entitled to recover from the plaintiffs the cost of removing the plywood planks. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">134 The defendant is, however, entitled to recover the cost of replacing the underlying timber flooring. I accepted the professional engineer’s evidence that the timber flooring was not in good and tenantable repair and condition as required by cl 44 of the second tenancy agreement. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">135 The combined cost of removing the plywood planks and of replacing the original timber flooring was $2,407.50. In light of my finding that the plaintiffs are obliged to bear only the cost of replacing the timber flooring, I set the sum recoverable by the defendant at half of this cost, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $1,203.75.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">136 For the foregoing reasons, the defendant is entitled to recover only the sum of $35,655.41 as reinstatement costs for the second storey under the second tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">137 In conclusion, I restate my findings as follows. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">138 The two tenancy agreements are separate and independent agreements. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">139 The defendant committed no breach of the first tenancy agreement. The plaintiffs committed a breach of the first tenancy agreement by ceasing to pay rent under it in December 2019 and by yielding the first storey up to the defendant prematurely. The plaintiffs are liable to the defendant in damages for this breach of contract. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">140 The defendant committed a repudiatory breach of an implied term of the second tenancy agreement. But the plaintiffs affirmed the second tenancy agreement and thereby lost the right to terminate it for repudiatory breach. The plaintiffs did, however, retain their right to recover damages from the defendant for this breach. The plaintiffs committed a breach of the second tenancy agreement by ceasing to pay rent under it in September 2019 and by yielding the second and third storeys up to the defendant prematurely. The plaintiffs and the defendant are therefore liable in damages to each other for their respective breaches of the second tenancy agreement.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">141 The plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages in the sum of $146,333 from the defendant on the plaintiff’s claim. The defendant is entitled to recover damages in the sum of $411,494.91 from the plaintiffs on the defendant’s counterclaim. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">142 I decline to award the defendant pre-judgment interest on the arrears of rent due to the defendant at the contractual rate specified in the first tenancy agreement. That agreement obliges the plaintiffs to pay interest at the rate of 5% per month, or 60% per annum, on arrears of rent. I consider such a provision to be extravagant and unconscionable and to be a penalty clause. The defendant shall therefore recover interest on arrears of rent only at the statutory rate prescribed in the Civil Law Act 1909.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">143 The sums that each party owes the other can be set off against each other. The defendant is therefore, on balance, entitled to recover the net sum of $265,161.91 from the plaintiffs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">144 The sum awarded on the defendant’s counterclaim is significantly larger than the sum awarded on the plaintiffs’ claim. I therefore consider the event in this action to be in the defendant’s favour. That justifies an award of costs against the plaintiffs and in favour of the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">145 However, the defendant has succeeded in only about half of his counterclaim. He has recovered substantial damages for breach of the first tenancy agreement. But he has been found to have been in repudiatory breach of the second tenancy agreement and therefore unable to recover any expectation loss under it. In these circumstances, I would ordinarily have considered it just on a broad-brush approach to award the defendant only 50% of his costs. But both tenancy agreements require the plaintiffs to pay legal costs to the defendant on the indemnity basis. Taking that into account, I consider it just to award the defendant 70% of his costs instead of 50%.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">146 The defendant quantifies his costs in his costs schedule at $213,551.26. 70% of that figure is $149,485.88. I have rounded that up for convenience to $150,000. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">147 I therefore order that the plaintiffs shall pay to the defendant his costs of and incidental to this action, including both his counterclaim and his defence to the plaintiffs’ claim, such costs fixed at $150,000 including disbursements. </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Vinodh Coomaraswamy J</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left">Judge of the High Court</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-left"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yap Bock Heng Christopher and William Ong Meng Hwa (Alpha Law LLC) for the plaintiffs;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Ng Lip Chih and Chung Jun Hui Joel (Foo &amp; Quek LLC) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
