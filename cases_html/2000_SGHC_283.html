<p align="justify">1.    In this case, the plaintiffs sought to

recover from the defendants, the former distributor of their products in

Singapore, sums due for goods supplied to the latter and for other incidental expenses. The

defendants did not deny that they have not paid for the goods in question but

contended that they owed the plaintiffs nothing because they had a valid set-off

and counterclaim in relation to the plaintiffs wrongful termination of the

distributorship agreement.

</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>A. BACKGROUND</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">2.    The plaintiffs, a company incorporated

in the United States as an agricultural co-operative corporation, are

manufacturers and distributors of citrus fruit juices and drinks. Among their

brands of fruit juices are "Floridas Natural" and "Floridas

Natural Growers Pride". The defendants, a company incorporated in

Singapore, are in the cereals, sugar, oil, sauces, food beverage and dairy

products business.</p>
<p align="justify">3.    In

the beginning, the business relationship between the plaintiffs and the

defendants was mainly handled by Ms Leslie Powell, the manager of the plaintiffs

international sales department, and Mr Melvin Neo, the defendants' general

manager. Although the plaintiffs did not sell their products in Singapore

through any other company, the business dealings between the plaintiffs and

defendants were initially based on a rather loose arrangement. No written

agreement was entered into by the parties and the plaintiffs contended that they

accepted the defendants orders for their products on an ad hoc basis.

However, the defendants took the view that they were the exclusive Singapore

distributors of the plaintiffs products from the time they placed their first

orders with the plaintiffs in 1997.</p>
<p align="justify">4.    Whatever

may have been the nature of the plaintiffs relationship with the defendants

in the past, their relationship with effect from 15 October 1998 was based on a

letter of appointment (hereinafter referred to as the "distributorship

agreement") of that date. Under the terms of this distributorship

agreement, the plaintiffs appointed the defendants as the Singapore distributors

of a specified range of their products for a period of one year.</p>
<p align="justify">5.    In

due course, there was a measure of disagreement between Mr Neo and Mr Vernon

Khoo, the defendants chairman and chief executive officer. As a result, Mr

Neo resigned as the defendants general manager. On 31 August 1999, Mr Neo

informed Ms Powell that he had left the defendant company with immediate effect.

Ms Powell, who obviously had a lot of confidence in Mr Neos handling of the

marketing of the plaintiffs products, was rather concerned with this

development, and especially so after learning that Mr Khoo had no immediate

plans for hiring a replacement for Mr Neo. Instead, Mr Khoo planned to become

directly involved with the management of the fruit and juice business.</p>
<p align="justify">6.    The

plaintiffs were perturbed that the resignation of Mr Neo came at a time when

their American rival, Tropicana, was trying to enter the Singapore market. To

them, it was crucial for an experienced and competent person to oversee their

business when a heavyweight competitor was challenging them for the Singapore

market. They were not comforted by Mr Neos assurance that the defendants

team was capable of handling the distributorship of their products. Their

response was to appoint Mr Neo as their consultant for an initial period of 90

days. He was supposed to work closely with the defendants, who had no choice but

to accept the situation. It was not surprising that the lack of cordiality

between Mr Neo and Mr Khoo did not provide the right environment for a smooth

working relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">7.    Shortly

thereafter, the defendants appointed a Mr Louis Neo to manage the marketing of

the plaintiffs products. He had little experience in the business and did not

impress the plaintiffs. As time passed, Mr Khoo became more involved with the

defendants business with the plaintiffs. By then, the plaintiffs and the

defendants had serious differences with respect to, among other things,

marketing strategy. On 17 September 1999, Mr Khoo proposed three alternatives to

resolve the existing problems. The third alternative was worded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>
<p align="justify">Alternative 3</p>
</i>
<p align="justify">If we cannot find an amicable solution, I do not wish to

  continue as your distributor. We will cease any imports of Floridas Natural

  with immediate effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">8.    The plaintiffs were rather concerned by

Mr Khoos "threat" to cease to act as their distributors. Ms Powell

thought that Mr Khoos response to slight disagreements was "very

emotional". In the meantime, the marketing budget for the period September

1999 to August 2000 was not agreed upon.</p>
<p align="justify">9.    Mr

Khoo was astute enough to realise that the differences between the plaintiffs

and the defendants had to be swiftly resolved because the distributorship

agreement of 15 October 1998 was about to expire. On 4 October 1999, he went to

Orlando for a meeting with Ms Powell to resolve their differences. According to

Ms Powell, the clear understanding was that unless and until a solution was

found to the problems she saw in the defendants handling of the marketing of

the plaintiffs products, the question of a renewal of the distributorship

agreement, which was due to lapse on 14 October 1999, did not arise. However, Mr

Khoo asserted that he left Florida with Ms Powells assurance that the

plaintiffs did not intend to change distributors and that the distributorship

agreement of 15 October 1998 had been extended.</p>
<p align="justify">10.    After

the one-year period of distributorship envisaged by the distributorship

agreement of 15 October 1998 expired, the defendants continued to order goods

from the plaintiffs. The orders were accepted by the plaintiffs and the goods

shipped to Singapore. The defendants appointed a Ms Rita Ng to manage the

defendants distributorship of the plaintiffs products. The plaintiffs were

unhappy with the appointment as Ms Ngs previous experience was in the frozen

chicken business. The plaintiffs contended that their reservations were not

unfounded as subsequent events proved that Ms Ng was inexperienced in the retail

fruit juice business.</p>
<p align="justify">11.    In

the meantime, the defendants continued to press the plaintiffs for a renewal in

writing of the distributorship arrangement of 15 October 1998. However, the

plaintiffs did not provide the defendants with such a written document.</p>
<p align="justify">12.    The

plaintiffs said that they were concerned that they would be left in the lurch if

the defendants ceased to act as their distributors. According to Ms Powell, one

of the plaintiffs contingency plans was to own a shell company which could

take over the distributorship of their products. On 3 December 1999, the

plaintiffs purchased a shell company, Formentar Pte Ltd. The plaintiffs

consultant, Mr Neo, was appointed a director of this company.</p>
<p align="justify">13.    On

13 December 1999, Ms Powell informed Mr Khoo that the plaintiffs were

considering other options for the marketing of their products in Singapore. On

the same day, Mr Khoo cancelled an order for the defendants products for the

next six months and said that the plaintiffs decision to consider another

distributor to replace the defendants contravened the agreement that the

defendants would be the plaintiffs sole distributor in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">14.    On

17 December 1999, Ms Powell informed Mr Khoo that the plaintiffs had decided not

to renew their distributorship agreement with the defendants. The plaintiffs

newly purchased shell company, which was renamed Fresh and Natural Food Pte Ltd,

became the new distributors of the plaintiffs products.</p>
<p align="justify">15.    On

11 January 2000, the plaintiffs informed the defendants that the outstanding

amount due on their invoices for goods sold to the defendants amounted to

$205,092.60. To date, the defendants have not paid this sum as they contended

that they had a right of set-off with respect to, <i>inter alia, </i>damages due

to them for the plaintiffs wrongful termination of the distributorship

arrangement.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>B. WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WERE ENTITLED TO APPOINT A NEW DISTRIBUTOR</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">16.    The main issue in this case is whether

or not the plaintiffs were entitled to appoint a new distributor in December

1999. This

 depends on whether or not the

 distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998 had been extended and if so, for

 how long. In the absence of such an extension, the defendants would have no

 basis for refusing to pay the plaintiffs the sums due for goods purchased from

 them.</p>
<p align="justify">17.    It

ought to be noted that in their pleadings, the defendants also contended that

the plaintiffs had extended the duration of the distributorship agreement by

three years with effect from March 1999, when the defendants took a three-year

lease on a kiosk in Orchard Road for the purpose of selling the plaintiffs

products. The defendants asserted that unless they had the assurance that the

distributorship arrangement had been renewed for three years, they would not

have committed themselves to a three-year lease on the kiosk. During the course

of the trial, the defendants wisely abandoned this claim and decided to adopt

the stand that the plaintiffs had extended the distributorship agreement of 15

October 1998 by one year after its expiry.</p>
<p align="justify">18.    Clause

4 of the letter of appointment of 14 October 1998, under which the plaintiffs

appointed the defendants as their Singapore distributors states as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Unless sooner terminated as stated below, the term of this

  commitment shall be for a period of one year commencing on the date of this

  letter. However, it may be renewed thereafter by Citrus World on a year to

  year basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">19.    The plaintiffs denied that they

extended the distributorship agreement when it expired in October 1999. However,

the defendants contended that the plaintiffs had orally and by their conduct or

course of dealings renewed the distributorship agreement by at least one year.

In support of their contention, the defendants alleged as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(a) the plaintiffs gave written confirmation to them that

  they had no intention "to make any changes" in their

  "current" arrangement in a letter dated 31 August 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">(b) In the first week of October 1999, Ms Powell told Mr

  Khoo in Orlando, Florida, that the duration of the distribution agreement had

  been extended.</p>
<p align="justify">(c) The plaintiffs continued to accept orders and supply

  their products to the defendants after 15 October 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">(d) Between October and December 1999, the defendants, with

  the consent and approval of the plaintiffs, entered into and performed various

  marketing and promotional activities for the purposes of promoting the

  plaintiffs products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Each of the defendants assertions will be dealt with.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<i><u>
<p align="justify">The assurance in the plaintiffs letter of 31 August 1999</p>
</u></i>
<p align="justify">20.    The defendants first ground for

claiming that the distribution agreement had been renewed rests on the wording

of a letter from Ms Powell to Mr Khoo on 31 August 1999, which was before the

expiry date of the distribution agreement. That letter, which was written on the

day Mr Neo resigned from the defendant company, was in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">You are aware that the current situation is that our

  strongest competitor is entering the market. This situation provides for us to

  be in both a defensive and counter-attack position in the market.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of Melvin Neos resignation from Neo Trade, we

  felt in [the plaintiffs] best interest to retain him as a consultant for

  the Singapore market. Melvin was instrumental in the success of the brand, and

  it is particularly important at this time that we have someone managing the

  trade with proven experience.</p>
<p align="justify">This action is not intended to imply that we have plans to

  make any changes in our current arrangement with Neo Trade. The intention is

  to insure that our business is managed by an experienced individual with

  established business arrangements with the trade in Singapore. In addition,

  this appointment is not intended to cause any interference within your

  operation between Melvin Neo and your staff.</p>
<p align="justify">(emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">21.    The defendants had no basis whatsoever

to read the above letter as an extension of the distribution agreement. The

letter was primarily intended to inform the defendants that they were appointing

Mr Neo as their consultant on 31 August 1999 and the assurances to the

defendants, which were made before the expiry of the distribution agreement,

should be read in the proper context. In para 65 of her affidavit of

evidence-in-chief, Ms Powell explained the position convincingly as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I also wish to say that at no time did I verbally assure

  Khoo that we had no intentions of changing distributors. The only time such a

  thing was mentioned was in the letter dated 31 August 1999 informing the

  Defendants of Neos appointment as our consultant: This action is not

  intended to imply that we have plans to make any changes in our current

  arrangement with Neotrade. At the time the letter was written, the

  distributorship agreement had not expired and the Plaintiffs had no plans to

  make any changes in the arrangements then. What I did discuss with Khoo many

  times was the lack of competent management personnel employed by the

  Defendants.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote>
<i><u>
<p align="justify">The alleged oral renewal in Orlando</p>
</u></i>
<p align="justify">22.    The defendants next asserted that Mr

Khoo was assured by Ms Powell during his trip to Orlando, Florida, in the first

week of October 1999 that the distributorship agreement had been extended.</p>
<p align="justify">23.    Ms Powell denied having extended the

distributorship agreement when she met Mr Khoo in Orlando. In para 39 of her

affidavit of evidence-in-chief, she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">On 4 October 1999, Vernon Khoo and I had a meeting in

  Orlando, USA as arranged. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss an

  amicable working arrangement suitable for both parties. The clear

  understanding was that unless and until a solution was found there is no

  question of renewing the Distributorship Agreement. Any new agreement will

  have to be documented in a formal agreement to be signed by the parties. I

  certainly did not confirm that the Distributorship Agreement was extended.

  During the meeting, I reiterated the Plaintiffs dissatisfaction with Louis

  Neos appointment as Melvin Neos replacement. I emphasized to Vernon Khoo

  that the Defendants had to have experienced and professional people in place

  to manage the business and to establish good relationships with the retailers.

  Furthermore, the distribution strategy had to be maintained so that stock

  levels and expiry dates were managed properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">24.    When cross-examined, Ms Powell stood

her ground. She said as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">At the meeting in Florida in October 1999, we discussed

  what I required in order for the distributorship to continue. I gave no

  assurances that the distributorship agreement would continue or that he would

  remain as the distributor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">25.    It is rather telling that when

referring to his meeting in Orlando with Ms Powell in his e-mail to her dated 11

October 1999, Mr Khoo made no reference to the alleged extension of the

distribution agreement. Indeed, his letter confirmed in part what Ms Powell said

was discussed by her and Mr Khoo when they met in Orlando. The relevant portions

of the letter are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Further to our meeting in Orlando, this is to confirm the

  following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">- I will be addressing the issue of a sound management

    replacement for Melvin in Neotrade.</p>
<p align="justify">- I will be employing a marketing executive to handle

    full time our marketing need for the company.</p>
<p align="justify">- I will be forwarding to you a fresh advertising and

    marketing plan for the next 12 months. I have a meeting with the Ad agency

    this week to work on the plan.</p>
<p align="justify">- Upon receipt of your samples, I will be negotiating

    with Tricon to supply Floridas Natural to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Did I miss anything?? Its always possible when you get

  pass 40.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">26.    In the above-mentioned letter, Mr Khoo

certainly missed something very important if the distributorship agreement had

indeed been extended by Ms Powell during their discussions in Orlando. The

absence of this issue in Mr Khoos letter of 11 October 1999 reinforces Ms

Powells evidence that she did not agree to extend the distributorship

agreement when she met Mr Khoo in Orlando in early October 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">27.    In

paras 54 and 55 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Mr Khoo also made no

reference whatsoever to an extension of the distributorship agreement for a

period of one year when he discussed his trip to Orlando in December 1999. He

merely said as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">54. In order to address my concern and to express the

  Defendants commitment to the Plaintiffs, I took a trip to the United States

  of America. I went to see the representatives of the Plaintiffs in Orlando

  Florida, USA sometime between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> October 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">55. At the meetings I had with Leslie Powell, I was again

  given assurances that the Defendants would continue to remain the distributors

  for the products in Singapore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">28.    When

cross-examined, Mr Khoo testified that the word "assurances" in para

55 of the affidavit of evidence-in-chief referred to the fact that the contract

had been extended by one year. His evidence is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q. See para 55 of your affidavit. Did Ms Leslie Powell say

  that the agreement was extended?</p>
<p align="justify">A. She did.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. But you did not say that.</p>
<p align="justify">A. By "assurances", she confirmed she would

  renew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">One would have thought that if the agreement had really been

extended, nothing would have been easier than to state this clearly in the

affidavit of evidence-in-chief.</p>
<p align="justify">29.    It is worth noting that although Mr

Khoo was quick to assert that he had been assured that the distribution

agreement had been renewed, he did not know for how long it had been renewed.

When cross-examined, his answers were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q. Extended for how long?</p>
<p align="justify">A. She did not mention for how long. She said that the

  letter of appointment would be renewed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">30.    The letters which Mr Khoo wrote to Ms

Powell on numerous occasions after 14 October 1999 also did not reveal that he

had secured an extension of the distributorship agreement. On 1 November 1999,

Mr Khoo wrote the following letter to Ms Powell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The existing distributorship appointment letter was dated

  October 15, 1998 and was valid for one year, As we have both invested a vast

  amount of resources to make Floridas Natural successful in Singapore, I

  think it would be in the best interest of all parties if we formalise an

  agreement which will provide confidence to both CWI and Neotrade to further

  develop the Brand in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">The agreement will stipulate clearly, our role and your

  objectives for us in this market. I suggest an agreement for a period of 3

  years renewable provided we commit to a realistic sales volumes, not less than

  what we are doing now and with a reasonable projected growth for the next 3

  years..</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">31.    In the above letter, Mr Khoo accepted

in no uncertain terms that the existing distributorship agreement was valid for

only one year. As such, it had expired. In his proposal for a new formal

agreement, Mr Khoo wanted one which will stipulate clearly the defendants

role and the plaintiffs marketing objectives. Finally, he suggested a period

of three years as the duration for the new distributorship arrangement. All

these show that nothing had been finalised and that the parties respective

positions were still being discussed. What is glaring is that in his letter, Mr

Khoo made no reference whatsoever to the alleged one-year extension of the

distributorship agreement. Neither did he say that the proposed three-year

distributorship relationship was to replace that established by the allegedly

extended distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998.</p>
<p align="justify">32.    Reference may also be made to Mr Khoos

letter of 3 December 1999 to Ms Powell. In this letter, he wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Could you kindly send us a renewal for the appointment

  letter which expired in October. With all the rumours going around that Melvin

  intends to take the agency away from Neotrade, I will be truly grateful if you

  could formalise your verbal assurance that you have no intentions of changing

  distributors as discussed many times. <i>The original letter of appointment

  has expired in October</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">(emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Again, the alleged extension of the distributorship agreement

was not mentioned. Instead, Ms Powell was reminded that the original letter of

appointment had expired.</p>
<p align="justify">33.    Finally, in his letter of 7 December

1999 to Ms Powell, Mr Khoo again did not claim that the distributorship

agreement had been extended by one year. In his letter, he merely stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Im truly worried that you have not replied to my mails

  regarding the expired letter of appointment and a clear position of our status

  as your distributor. I know that you have verbally assured me many times that

  you have no intention of appointing a new distributor.</p>
<p align="justify">However, your representative Melvin has approached  and

  some other parties, offering them to become the distributor of Florida Natural.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">34.    In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief

and in all the letters referred to above, all that Mr Khoo asserted is that

there had been verbal assurances that the plaintiffs had no intention of

changing distributors. He also pointed out that Ms Powell did not deny in her

replies that she had assured him that the plaintiffs had no intentions of

changing distributors. Ms Powell pointed out that in her dealings with Mr Khoo,

what was uppermost in her mind was to have the defendants get their act together

as she had no confidence in the team which took over from Mr Neo. In any case,

there is a world of difference between being told by the plaintiffs that they

had no intention of changing distributors and being told by the plaintiffs that

the distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998 had been extended by one year.</p>
<p align="justify">35.    After weighing the evidence, I do not

accept that the defendants were given assurances that the distribution agreement

would be extended by one year.</p>
<i><u>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Fulfilling of orders and marketing of the plaintiffs

products after 14 October 1999</p>
</u></i>
<p align="justify">36.    The plaintiffs said that after the

expiry of the distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998, they dealt with the

defendants on the basis of "buy and sell" and they reserved their

options as to what they would do with respect to the marketing of their products

in the Singapore market. In para 41 of her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Ms

Powell explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> [T]he Plaintiffs did not renew the Distributorship

  Agreement when it ended on 15 October 1999. Although ideally the Plaintiffs

  would like to continue with the same distributor if possible, the Plaintiffs

  wanted time to assess the Defendants. In the meantime, the Defendants placed

  orders and the Plaintiffs processed the orders per se the loose arrangement

  prior to the Distributorship Agreement. There was no obligation on the part of

  the Defendants to place orders, and either side could terminate the

  arrangement at any point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">37.    However, the defendants asserted that

the fact that the parties continued to import the plaintiffs products and to

perform marketing and promotional activities on the plaintiffs behalf after

14 October 1999 showed that the distributorship agreement had been renewed

beyond that date. They relied on the following statement of Blackburn J in <i>Smith

v Hughes </i>(1871) LR 6 QB 597, 607:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">If, whatever a mans real intention may be, he so

  conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to

  the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief

  enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be

  equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other partys terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">38.    The defendants also relied on the

following statement by Lord Diplock in <i>Paul Wilson &amp; Co A/S</i> v <i>Partenreederei

Hannah Blumenthal</i> [1983] 1 AC 854, 915:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">[I]f A (the offeror) makes a communication to B (the

  offeree) whether in writing, orally or by conduct, which, in the circumstances

  at the time the communication was received, (1) B, if he were a reasonable

  man, would understand as stating As intention to act or refrain from acting

  in some specified manner if B will promise on his part to act or refrain from

  acting in some manner also specified in the offer, and (2) B does in fact

  understand As communication to mean this, and in his turn, makes to A a

  communication conveying his willingness so to act or refrain from acting which

  mutatis mutandis satisfies the same two conditions as respect A, the consensus

  ad idem essential to the formation of a contract in English law is complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">39.    The situations referred to by Blackburn

J in <i>Smith</i> v <i>Hughes</i> and by Diplock J in <i>Paul Wilson &amp; Co

A/S</i> v <i>Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal</i> are completely different from

that in the present case, where both the plaintiffs and the defendants knew that

the distributorship agreement was no longer in force and the defendants were

desperately trying to get it renewed as they were not satisfied with their

rather vague business arrangements with the plaintiffs following the expiry of

the distributorship agreement.</p>
<p align="justify">40.    When cross-examined, Ms Powell pointed

out that there could have not have been an extension of the distributorship

agreement because both parties were still negotiating the terms of any future

distributorship arrangement. Her evidence is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q. During all this time, up to 7 December 1999, you never

  indicated to the defendants that your dealings with them was on an ad hoc

  basis of buy and sell?</p>
<p align="justify">A. The e-mails prove that we were continuing to negotiate

  the terms of the arrangement. Nothing had been agreed upon. I was giving

  Vernon time to perform before we made up our mind.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. Now, 15 October 1999 has come and gone. There was no

  communication from you to Neotrade of the change?</p>
<p align="justify">A. We were continuing to negotiate and had not agreed upon

  an extension of the agreement, the duration of the extension and sales

  volumes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">I accept that Ms Powell described the situation after 14

October 1999 correctly. It is inconceivable that she would have renewed the

distribution agreement when there were so many unresolved differences between

the plaintiffs and the defendants.</p>
<p align="justify">41.    The defendants then argued that if the

position after 14 October 1999 reverted to that which existed before the

distribution agreement was entered into on 15 October 1998, it ought to be noted

that they were the exclusive distributors of the plaintiffs products during

the period 1997 to 15 October 1998. This argument is flawed. Although the

defendants believed that they were exclusive distributors for the plaintiffs

prior to the date of the distribution agreement, a closer look at the actual

position and at the terms of the distribution agreement will show that this was

not the case. The plaintiffs stated in the distribution agreement as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">First, I must advise that it is Citrus Worlds general

  policy not to name any of its distributors as being "exclusive".

  However, in some areas, we have agreed, with certain conditions, not to

  appoint any other distributors in the area for a limited period of time and we

  are willing to make such a commitment to you upon the following terms: .</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">4.  [T]he term of this commitment shall be for a

    period of one year commencing on the date of this letter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">(emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">42.    It is evident from the terms of the

above letter that the plaintiffs agreed to appoint the defendants as their

distributors with effect from 15 October 1998 and that they did not accept that

the defendants were their exclusive distributors before that date.</p>
<p align="justify">43.    I

now turn to the defendants contention that the fact that they carried out

advertising and promotional activities on behalf of the plaintiffs showed that

the distribution agreement must have been renewed. Before the distribution

agreement was entered into on 15 October 1998, the defendants also carried out

advertising and promotional activities on the plaintiffs behalf and they were

given a marketing budget. All these were on an ad hoc basis. It follows that the

fact that the defendants carried out advertising and promotional activities

after 14 October 1999 does not prove that the plaintiffs had, by their conduct,

agreed to extend the distributorship agreement by one year. Neither can the fact

that the defendants were asked to submit a marketing plan that spanned the

remaining period of the distributorship agreement, as well as several months

thereafter, be accepted as proof that the distributorship agreement had been

extended. The plaintiffs were merely trying to see if the defendants were able

to put forward an acceptable plan. As it turned out, they did not approve the

marketing plan and there was no approved marketing budget for the relevant

period. When cross-examined, Ms Powell said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Q. You had in mind that this distributorship agreement

  would go beyond October 1999?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Could be but on a new set of terms.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. The reason why you asked Vernon Khoo for a marketing

  plan was to assure him that the agreement would go beyond October 1999?</p>
<p align="justify">A. I cannot say that it was to give him that assurance.</p>
<p align="justify">Q. What was the reason for not approving the marketing

  plan?</p>
<p align="justify">A. Because of the change in management in Neotrade since 31

  August 1999. I thought it prudent to have a new plan because Melvin Neo had

  left Neotrade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<b>
<p>C. CONCLUSION</p>
</b>
<p align="justify">44.    The defendants laid much emphasis on

the fact that they had built up the market for the plaintiffs products and

that they had expected a long-term relationship with the plaintiffs. If this was

not the case, they would not have invested so much money in promoting the

plaintiffs products. They also pointed out that they had performed well in

marketing and distributing the plaintiffs products and there was no

justification for the plaintiffs to be unhappy with their performance.</p>
<p align="justify">45.    Whatever

expectations the defendants may have had in the past about their long-term

relationship with the plaintiffs, it is common ground that under the

distributorship agreement of 14 October 1998, the defendants were appointed as

distributors for only one year. As such, unless that agreement had been renewed,

the plaintiffs were entitled to appoint a new distributor in place of the

defendants. Whether or not the plaintiffs had been fair to the defendants and

whether or not the plaintiffs judgment on the ability of the defendants to

perform their contractual obligations as distributor was flawed is not relevant

to the plaintiffs right to appoint a new distributor for their products in

December 1999.</p>
<p align="justify">46.    It

is startling that when trying to establish that the distribution agreement had

been extended, the defendants were not altogether sure about the period for

which the distributorship agreement had been allegedly extended. At first, they

contended that it had been extended by three years until 4 March 2002 (see para

47 of Mr Khoos affidavit of evidence-in-chief). Admittedly, the defendants

finally abandoned their claim that the contract had been renewed until 4 March

2002 but this does not change the fact that if the distributorship arrangement

had already been extended in March 1999 until March 2002 as alleged by Mr Khoo,

there was no reason for him to settle for a one-year extension until 14 March

2002 when he met Ms Powell in Florida in October 1999. He should have insisted

on his rights that the distributorship arrangement had at that time, almost 2

years to run. Again, although the defendants finally settled for an extension of

one year, it is pertinent to note that in paragraph 9 of their Amended Defence

and Counterclaim, they made the allegation that the distributorship agreement

had been extended for at least one year with effect from 15 October 1999, thus

suggesting that it may have been extended for a longer period of time. Finally,

in para 36 of his affidavit, Mr Khoo gave the impression that the plaintiffs had

agreed that the distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998 was to be extended

automatically so long as the defendants met the sales target and the terminating

events specified in the agreement did not occur. This view of the plaintiffs

obligations is of course not supported by the express terms of the written

contract and it was not seriously canvassed by the defendants. The various

positions adopted by the defendants with respect to the renewal of the

distributorship agreement certainly did not help their case, and especially so

when it is for them to prove that the distributorship agreement had been

extended by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify">47.    After

reviewing the evidence and after having had the opportunity to assess the

witnesses, I accept that the distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998 had

not been orally extended by Ms Powell and that the course of dealings between

the plaintiffs and the defendants did not evidence any extension of the said

distributorship agreement. The plaintiffs were thus entitled to appoint a new

distributor on 17 December 1999, and by doing so, were not in breach of

contract.</p>
<p align="justify">48.    The

plaintiffs claim for $205,092.60 for products supplied to the defendants is

upheld. They are entitled to interest at the rate of 6% as from the date of the

writ. For the record, it ought to be noted that it is unnecessary for the

plaintiffs other claims or the defendants counterclaim to be considered

because the parties agreed during the course of the trial on the terms for

settling their respective remaining claims in the event that the plaintiffs

claim that they were entitled to appoint a new Singapore distributor for their

products in December 1999 is upheld.</p>
<p align="justify">49.    The plaintiffs are entitled to costs.</p>
