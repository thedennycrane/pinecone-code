        Kan Ting Chiu J:</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       This judgment arises from an assessment of
                    damages for personal injuries by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”).
                    After the damages were assessed, both the plaintiff and defendant appealed
                    against parts of her decisions.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The injuries were sustained by the plaintiff
                    when he was 18 years old, and was just about to commence his second year of
                    junior college. He was crossing a road junction when he was involved in a
                    collision with a taxi driven by the defendant. The parties had agreed to
                    apportion liability at 75:25 in favour of the plaintiff, and interlocutory
                    judgment was entered by consent with damages to be assessed. (For the avoidance
                    of doubt, all the awards herein are stated on the full basis, before the 75:25
                    apportionment.)</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Immediately after the accident, the plaintiff
                    was warded in the National University Hospital for a month and a half. He had
                    sustained severe traumatic brain injury. Emergency craniotomy and removal of the
                    extradural and subdural haematoma were performed upon his admission in hospital.
                    He was found to suffer from post-traumatic amnesia and his cognitive, language
                    and motor skills were affected. He required physical, occupational and language
                    therapy and was transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for that
                purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       He was discharged from the hospital in June 2005
                    on a wheelchair and returned home where he was looked after by his mother,
                    initially with the help of a maid. His parents took exceptional measures to
                    ensure that he received all the treatment and help that he needed, and they were
                    rewarded when the plaintiff made recovery beyond the initial
                    expectations.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       At the time of the assessment the plaintiff was
                    able to walk, swim, engage in recreational sports, travel by public transport,
                    make simple money transactions and socialise at birthday parties, church cell
                    group meetings and at camp. He is a full time student at the LaSalle-SIA College
                    of the Arts, pursuing a Diploma of Higher Education in Painting, although he is
                    given special treatment in view of his existing disabilities.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       A major issue in the appeals is the award for
                    pain and suffering for the head injuries. The AR made an award of $285,000
                    against which both parties appealed. The AR stated in her brief grounds of
                    decision that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I accept that a component approach is preferable to a global approach
                        where the resultant deficits are identifiable and discrete.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In coming to this conclusion, she followed the decision of the High
                    Court in <em>Tan Yu Min Winston (his next friend Tan Cheng Tong)
                        v Uni-Fruitveg Pte Ltd</em> [2008] 4 SLR(R) 825
                        (“<em>Winston Tan</em>”), an appeal from
                    another assessment of damages by the same AR. In that appeal, Chan Seng Onn J
                    increased the AR’s award for pain and suffering for head injuries to the
                    plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Chan J stated in his judgment in <em>Winston Tan</em>:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">14    The AR then awarded a total figure of $90,000 for
                            the collective injuries to the head region using the global approach. In
                            doing so, she had made adjustments to take account of any overlapping
                            injuries/amounts. The global award of $90,000 for the head injuries
                            covered the pain and suffering for the fractures and other injuries,
                            scarring to the head and face region, loss of smell, impairment of
                            mental capacity and mood, and the eye injuries.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Component approach versus the global approach to assessment</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">15    I did not think that the AR’s approach to
                            make one global award for all the injuries to the head would <em>per se</em> be wrong. But without breaking the
                            discrete injuries down into its manageable components, it would be much
                            more difficult to arrive at an appropriate and fair award for the
                            damages and it might lead to an undercompensation or overcompensation as
                            a result. Furthermore, were the court to look towards precedent cases
                            for assistance, it would also be much harder to find similar cases or
                            comparables with matching or similar injuries to the head as a whole
                            (i.e. on a global basis) than on a component basis, and the court might
                            then have to decide without the benefit of the precedent cases. This of
                            course was not the main reason why I chose not to use the global basis
                            of award for the injuries to the head in this case.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">16    The component approach was preferable largely
                            because the multiple injuries to the head spawned a discrete loss of
                            several important distinct and separate functions and amenities, which
                            were located there. After making an assessment based on the component
                            approach, it would still be useful to total up the component awards and
                            perform a further check on (a) whether the aggregate amount awarded for
                            the injuries to the head as a whole remained reasonable and was not
                            excessive; and (b) whether some discounting or adjustment would be
                            needed in case there was some degree of overlapping (for instance where
                            two or more of the injuries were in so close physical proximity to each
                            other that the pain would not likely be distinguishable by the plaintiff
                            although the injuries resulted in a loss of separate
                        functions).</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">17    In the human body, many sensory faculties are
                            located on the head: the eyes for the sight function; the ears for the
                            hearing function; the nose for the smell function; the tongue for the
                            taste function; and the vocal cord for the speech function. A loss or
                            degradation in the performance of each of these important faculties
                            represents <em>a separate and discrete loss of
                                amenities</em>, each with its own attendant pain and suffering
                            experienced by the plaintiff (which includes, <em>inter
                                alia</em>, not only the physical pain, its duration, the
                            degree of permanence of that injury or disability, the inconvenience
                            associated with the loss of that function and the debilitating effects
                            of that disability, but also the mental anxiety and anguish, fear,
                            embarrassment, frustration, and the further pain and suffering from
                            future operations or medical treatments, if any, to correct the
                            disability or improve the condition), which is quite separate from the
                            head injuries to the brain, the skull and other bone structures in the
                            head.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       Chan J propounded the component approach
                    because on his analysis:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">24    The proper way of
                            damage assessment is not to look merely at the initiating injury, but
                            rather at what are the real and definable manifestations of that
                            initiating injury. Head injuries to the brain in my view should be
                            judged in terms of the resulting deficits arising from that injury, and
                            each of these deficits ought to be separately
                            awarded.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">25    The correct and
                            perhaps more scientific way to look at the head injuries to the brain
                            resulting from an accident is to properly classify them into the
                            following three separate domains: structural, psychological and
                            cognitive.</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(a)    “structural” injury (e.g. brain
                                oedema, subdural, extradural subarachnoid haematoma, brain
                                contusion, loss of consciousness), which is the specialisation of
                                neurosurgeons;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(b)    “psychological” injury (e.g.
                                depression, mood swings, anger, anxiety), which is the
                                specialisation of psychiatrists; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(c)    “cognitive” impairment –
                                (e.g. loss of spatial, visual, long and short term memory, intellect
                                (in terms of IQ), learning ability), which is the specialisation of
                                clinical psychologists.</p>

                    injuries, and supplemented it with additional awards for the additional
                    injuries, eye injuries and scars and facial disfigurement.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     There were in fact no additional injuries that
                    surfaced during the appeal. What happened was that Chan J made separate
                    awards for each of these “separate and discrete loss of
                    amenities”. However, under the global approach, all lost amenities would
                    be taken into account when the global award is made. There is no reason to
                    believe that the AR had disregarded the lost amenities. Indeed, the learned
                    judge had not faulted the AR for ignoring them. Following from that, two
                    questions arise:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_i"></a>(i)     whether in adding the four component
                        awards to the original global award, there was an element of
                        double-counting; and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_11-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     whether an award under the component approach is made up
                        of a global award <em>and</em> component awards, or
                        only the latter.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     The component approach and <em>Winston Tan</em> came under the consideration of the Court of Appeal
                    in <em>Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian</em>
                    [2010] 3 SLR 587 (“<em>Samuel
                    Chai</em>”). The Court stated:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">48 ... the point made was that the component approach did not have
                        sufficient regard to the fact that the injuries, and resulting disabilities,
                        were all essentially caused by one single injury. It was emphasised that
                        such an approach would lead to a high possibility of over-compensation as a
                        result of sub-itemisation. As we see it, such sub-itemisation was no more
                        than an instrument to aid the court to determine what would be a fair and
                        reasonable quantification for a particular injury or disability having
                        regard to precedents. It enables the court to address the different aspects
                        of pain, suffering and loss of amenities arising out of an injury
                        systematically.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">49   Damages are awarded on the basis of the injuries
                        sustained and the resulting pain and suffering and loss of amenities
                            <em>that followed</em>, and not merely on the
                        number of injuries inflicted. Admittedly the problem of overlapping or
                        under-compensation can occur when there are multiple injuries causing
                        similar, if not the same, disabilities. ... Properly applied, the component
                        approach could indeed prevent over-compensation rather than encourage it.
                        Nevertheless, in awarding damages by way of the component approach, courts
                        should always be mindful that the overall quantum must be a reasonable sum
                        reflective of the totality of the injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     It is axiomatic that the global includes the
                    components. Where discrete injuries are identified, they will be taken into
                    consideration under the global approach. The difference is that under the
                    component approach awards are made for the components and not subsumed in a
                    global award.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     It is unclear if the Court of Appeal regarded
                    the component approach as a distinct approach which is to replace the global
                    approach, or that it was drawing attention to the need to consider all the
                    components of an injury when assessing damages. A difficulty in affecting a
                    switch-over is that there may not be many precedents for the component damages
                    as awards have hitherto been made on the global approach. In <em>Winston Tan</em> no precedents for the component awards were referred
                    to.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     Chan J had pointed out in <em>Winston Tan</em> at [16] that an assessment under the
                    component approach was not an aggregation of the component awards and
                    that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... it would still be useful to total up the component awards and perform
                        a further check on (a) whether the aggregate amount awarded for the injuries
                        to the head <em>as a whole</em> remained <em>reasonable</em> and was <em>not
                            excessive</em>; and (b) whether some discounting or adjustment
                        would be needed in case there was some degree of overlapping. ...</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Judg-1">It was not made clear how the reasonableness or excessiveness is to be
                    measured. It probably contemplates a reference to a global or overall figure.
                    The Court of Appeal cautioned in <em>Samuel Chai</em> at
                    [49] that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... in awarding damages by way of the component approach, courts should
                        always be mindful that the overall quantum must be a reasonable sum
                        reflective of the totality of the injury.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">which meant that after making and adding up component awards, the
                    aggregate should be reviewed on a global basis. When seen in that way, the two
                    approaches are not functionally distinct. The global approach arrives at a
                    global figure after taking into account the component figures, and the component
                    approach starts by adding up the component figures and ends by ensuring that the
                    aggregate amount is reflective of the “totality of the
                    injury”.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     As in <em>Winston

                        she did not suffer any external injuries over the scalp, she sustained
                        unspecified head injuries. She was in a coma for 20 days, and her head
                        injuries left her with a clumsy left hand as a result of motor nerve damage.
                        She had problems of expressive aphasia and dyslexia due to brain damage.
                        There was marked cerebral atrophy. Her IQ was at the borderline of mental
                        retardation and she talked in a childish manner and showed poor
                        concentration and was disorientated in time, and demonstrated personality
                        change. Chao Hick Tin J made an award of $82,000 for the head injuries and

                        underlying brain damage and contusion. He had paralysis on the right side.
                        He was unable to walk and was wheelchair bound. He was unable to speak and

                        sustained head injury in a motor accident. He was admitted to hospital in a
                        coma. He had a right orbital wall fracture, a right malar fracture and
                        bilateral mandible fractures. Before the accident the plaintiff had an
                        excellent academic record and was awarded a scholarship to pursue a course
                        in electrical engineering. He was enrolled into a course for electrical
                        engineering and computer science after the accident under a disabled
                        students’ program. After reviewing the evidence of the array of
                        experts, an AR accepted that the plaintiff suffered a deterioration of
                        memory and had suffered emotional trauma including symptoms of depression
                        but with little residual physical disability. He also found that the
                        plaintiff was still highly intelligent, with no deterioration in IQ. The AR
                        assessed damages for pain and suffering, including the fracture of the teeth
                        at $80,000.</p>

                        injury with left extradural haematoma and traumatic subarachnoid
                        haemorrhage. His disabilities were “residual cognitive dysfunction
                        resulting in borderline full scale IQ” and increased spasticity of
                        right limbs and motor dysphasia. Damages for pain and suffering were
                        assessed at $60,000 in 2003.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Of these cases, <em>Eddie

                    by the AR is unjustified, and I reduce it to $160,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The plaintiff had also appealed against the
                    AR’s award for pain and suffering. He appealed on a narrower basis, that
                    the award should include a sum for a punctured lung. There were two difficulties
                    with this appeal. Firstly, the injuries pleaded in the statement of claim did
                    not include a punctured lung. Secondly, counsel did not refer to any medical
                    report which recorded that the plaintiff had suffered a punctured lung. There
                    was no basis for the plaintiff’s appeal.</p>

<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In coming to her decision the AR relied on the
                    evidence of Dr Kong Keng He, Head and Senior Consultant, Department of
                    Rehabilitation Medicine, who had treated the plaintiff, that the
                    plaintiff’s physical impairments have improved tremendously, and are
                    almost back to normal. Specifically, Dr Kong thought that it was not
                    necessary for him to continue with speech therapy and occupational therapy. The
                    plaintiff contended that the AR should not have disregarded the evidence of a
                    speech language therapist, Dr Radika Vasudeva, and other persons who had
                    dealt with the plaintiff who recommended that he should continue with
                    occupational therapy and speech and language therapy that he was
                    receiving.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     The AR heard the evidence of all the witnesses
                    on this area and concluded that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">I accept the evidence of Dr Kong Keng He that the patient’s
                        condition has more or less tapered off, and that future speech and
                        occupational therapy sessions are unnecessary, and will be of little or no
                        benefit to him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">In the appeal the plaintiff only submitted that
                    Dr Vasudeva’s recommendations should be accepted, without stating
                    that the AR was wrong to accept Dr Kong’s evidence or that
                    Dr Kong’s opinion was wrong. I do not see any reason for disagreeing
                    on the AR’s finding made after listening to the witnesses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Future nursing care for the plaintiff quantified at
                $120,000</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     The plaintiff had ceased to require nursing
                    care at the time of the assessment of damages. This claim for future nursing
                    care was put forward on the basis that his condition may deteriorate or worsen
                    as he gets older. This claim is really groundless. There was no basis to suppose
                    that the plaintiff’s condition would deteriorate. All the evidence was
                    that he had recovered to a level that he does not require nursing care. The AR
                    was correct to reject it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Mother’s loss of future income</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     This claim, for $251,802 computed at $19,754
                    per year for 13 years until she retires at the age of 62 years was made on the
                    basis that the plaintiff’s mother was due to start work as a full time
                    kindergarten teacher on the day of the accident, and because of the accident,
                    she did not take up the employment. This claim was not supported by any evidence
                    from the mother herself or the employer. The plaintiff’s father produced
                    two letters to support the claim; the first a letter from the Head (Principal),
                    Yuhua Education Centre, PAP Community Foundation, to the mother that she was
                    converted from part-time status from 1 January 2005 at a basic monthly
                    salary of $1000, with no reference to the tenure of employment, and the second
                    was a letter from the education centre which confirmed that she did not take up
                    her appointment. The writers of the letters did not give evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     The defendant had objected to the
                    admissibility of the two letters, and clearly they were not admissible. In the
                    absence of direct evidence from the mother and the writers of the two letters,
                    there was no evidence to support a claim for $251,802.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     The defendant also disputed the
                    plaintiff’s <em>locus standi</em> to make the claim
                    for the mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings and future loss of earnings.
                    On a conceptual standpoint, there is some basis in this objection because the
                    income lost is the mother’s income, not the plaintiff’s income or
                    loss, but there is an answer to the objection. As these claims are acknowledged
                    to be the mother’s losses, the mother is effectively the beneficial
                    claimant, especially as she is aware of these claims being made, and is not
                    making any claims of her own. (It should be noted that the same objection could
                    be taken over other claims e.g. the costs of treatment, transport and the
                    maids’ employment because the plaintiff’s parents paid them, but no
                    objections were taken.)</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Such claims have been allowed. In <em>Kuan Kian Seng v Wong Choon Keh</em>
                    [1995] SGHC 43, K S Rajah JC allowed a claim for the loss of
                    earnings of the plaintiff’s wife. The judge cited as authority <em>Donnelly v Joyce</em> [1974] QB 474 which allowed a
                    claim for a mother’s loss of earnings. For these losses to be recovered,
                    however, they have to be reasonable. If a mother gives up a $10,000 monthly
                    salary to look after a child instead of employing a maid or a nurse, then the
                    recoverable loss should be based on the cost of employment of a maid or nurse
                    and not the mother’s salary.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Other appeals of the defendant</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     There were three appeals which were against
                    the AR’s awards for loss of earning capacity, cost of future psychiatric
                    treatment, pre-trial maid expenses, pre-trial loss of income of the mother, and
                    pre-trial transport expenses.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Loss of earning capacity</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     The AR held that the plaintiff’s loss
                    was a loss of earning capacity rather than a loss of future earnings. As the
                    plaintiff had not completed his education when he was injured, and it was
                    uncertain that he would have become an architect, as he had aspired to be, the
                    AR’s ruling accorded with the Court of Appeal’s rulings in <em>Samuel Chai</em> on loss of future earnings and loss of
                    earning capacity.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     The quantification of the loss at $600,000,
                    however, is not as well-founded. The plaintiff submitted in the assessment
                    hearing that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We have assessed his loss of earning capacity to be $800,000.00 taking
                        into account his age and potential that was nipped in the bud just as he was
                        embarking on his studies to achieve his career path.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">without citing a single precedent award to support the assessment. The
                    AR did not explain how the $600,000 was arrived at.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     The plaintiff submitted at the same hearing
                    that the plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity should be in the range of
                    $150,000 to $180,000. The plaintiff cited the identical awards of $100,000 for
                    the same loss made in <em>Winston Tan</em> and <em>Muhamad Ilyas</em>. There is another case, <em>Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong</em> [2008] 1 SLR 178
                        (“<em>Ronnie Tan</em>”) in which the same
                    sum was awarded, and in <em>Nirumalan V Kanapathi Pillay v Teo
                        Eng Guan</em> [2003] 3 SLR(R) 601 (“<em>Nirumalan</em>”) $180,000 was awarded. Prior to these
                    cases, such awards were conservative. Audrey Lim <em>et
                        al</em>, <em>Practitioners’ Library, Assessment
                        of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents</em> (Butterworths
                    Asia 2001) lists 52 awards made between 1990 and 2000, with the highest at
                    $75,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     In assessing the loss of earning capacity, all
                    the circumstances of the injured person has to be considered, particularly his
                    age, education and work qualification, work record, and the effect the
                    disabilities will have on his work prospects. These matters are relevant for
                    putting a monetary value to the loss. Even with these matters in mind, the
                    assessment of such damages is an inexact exercise, especially when the
                    person’s income-earning potential is uncertain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     These four cases offer guidance for the
                    quantification of the plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity. The plaintiff
                    in <em>Muhamad Ilyas</em> was 21 years old and had
                    completed junior college when he met with the accident and suffered serious head
                    injuries. Despite the injuries, he was doing a course in electrical engineering
                    and computer science at the University of California, under a disabled
                    students’ program. The plaintiff acknowledged that he was still a person
                    of very high intelligence even after his accident, and was just
                    “slower”. The AR did not notice any slowness and found that he was
                    likely to find gainful employment and be successful at whatever career he
                    chose.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The plaintiff in <em>Winston
                        Tan</em> was 13 years old at the time of the accident when he was a
                    secondary school student, and taking a course on information technology at
                    Temasek Polytechnic at the time of the assessment of damages. Chan J found
                    that his residual disabilities should not be a major stumbling block preventing
                    him from making further progress and achieving his employment
                goals.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     The plaintiff in <em>Ronnie
                        Tan</em> was a 36 year-old litigation lawyer. He had a whiplash injury
                    with residual disabilities including frontal headaches, neck pain and stiffness
                    and vertigo which affected his ability and capacity to work, although he
                    continued work, probably at a reduced level.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     The plaintiff in <em>Nirumalan</em> was also a lawyer and was about 40 years old when he
                    suffered a whiplash injury which caused him to cut back on his work. He was
                    awarded $180,000 for loss of earning capacity by me. I have to state that when I
                    reviewed this award against the applicable principles and the other awards, it
                    appeared the award was higher than it should have been.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     In the plaintiff’s case, there is
                    evidence that he can undertake simple undemanding employment, but he would not
                    be able to work and earn at the level of a person who has completed his
                    secondary education (which he had) or his junior college education (which he
                    probably would have, but for the accident). The salient factors for
                    consideration in his case are that:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_i"></a>(i)     his ability to work is significantly
                        diminished,</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_ii"></a>(ii)     the diminution extends over the whole of his working life,
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_39-p2_iii"></a>(iii)     his
                        potential earning level (without the diminution) is
                uncertain.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     Taking into account the factors to be
                    considered and the awards made in the cases mentioned, I set the damages for
                    loss of earning capacity for the plaintiff at $250,000.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Cost of future psychiatric treatment</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     The AR’s award was for $144,000 at $600
                    per month for 20 years, although the plaintiff had claimed $121,200 before the
                    AR, at $505 per month for 20 years,<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_3" id="Ftn_3_1"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> and this was
                    repeated in his submissions in the appeal.<span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_4" id="Ftn_4_1"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The supporting
                    evidence came from Dr Adrian Wang Chee Cheng of the Gleneagles Medical
                    Centre who was treating the plaintiff. Dr Wang testified that there is a
                    70–80% probability that the plaintiff would require long term medication
                    of five to 10 years, and if his condition remained, then he would require
                    life-long medication. However, he did not state the treatment charges, and the
                    defendant had worked out the charges incurred in 2008 and 2009 to be
                    $350–$400 per month. In his reply, the plaintiff did not explain the $505
                    that was put up, or the $600 that the AR used. The plaintiff also did not
                    dispute the defendant’s computation of the $350–$400.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     The defendant had contended that the plaintiff
                    could receive the same treatment for less at a government-structured hospital. I
                    do not accept that argument. It is for the injured party to decide on the
                    treatment that he is to receive, and he is entitled to claim <em>reasonable</em> costs of treatment. He is not obliged to seek
                    treatment or receive damages at the lowest costs available. I allow $90,000 for
                    further psychiatric treatment at $375 per month for 20 years.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Pre-trial expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Maid expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     The AR allowed $22,527 for the costs of
                    employing two maids successively. The defendant appealed against the award on
                    two grounds, firstly, that the documentary evidence produced only showed the
                    Foreign Workers Levy payments. The defendant was not disputing the employment of
                    the maids, which was supported by the evidence of the levy payments. While no
                    supporting documents were produced on the salary and the other expenses incurred
                    on the maids, a list of all the payments was put up. The plaintiff’s
                    father explained that there were no documentary records of the payments of the
                    maids’ salaries because they were paid in cash, and the other expenses for
                    the maids were based on estimated figures issued by the Ministry of
                    Manpower.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     The other point raised was that the maids did
                    not only attend to the plaintiff but undertook some household duties. The
                    plaintiff’s case was that the maids were employed to help his mother to
                    look after him, because she was unable to do it alone. If the maids did some
                    household chores which the mother was unable to do while she attended to the
                    plaintiff, that part of the maids’ services should not be excluded from
                    consideration. The evidence showed that the mother was not seeking to gain an
                    advantage from the employment of the maids because she dispensed with them when
                    she could cope by herself. This award should stand.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Transport expenses</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     The AR made an award of $13,166.80 for
                    pre-trial transport expenses over four years by the family car, taxi and bus.
                    The defendant submitted during the appeal that there were no supporting
                    documents. However, although the plaintiff’s father had listed the trips
                    for which the claims were made, he was not questioned over them by the
                    defendant’s counsel during the assessment. The AR had seen and heard the
                    father and accepted his computation of the claim, and I do not see any reason
                    for disturbing it.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-3">Mother’s loss of income</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     The AR had made an award of $72,600 because
                    she accepted the evidence that the plaintiff’s mother had given up her
                    employment to look after the plaintiff. The employment in question is the
                    full-time job as a kindergarten teacher with the Yuhua Education Centre in
                    respect of which her claim for loss of future earnings has been dealt with. No
                    evidence was produced in support of the claim beside the two letters, one
                    informing her of her appointment and the other confirming her resignation, both
                    of which were not properly proved in evidence.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     The claim was put up and quantified at $72,600
                    over the period 2005–2008 without an explanation or documentation on how
                    that figure was arrived at. Against that state of evidence, there was no basis
                    for the AR to make the award. I therefore set aside this award.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     The following variations are made to the
                    AR’s awards:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_48-p2_i"></a>(i)     the award for pain and suffering and
                        loss of amenities is reduced to $160,000;</p>
