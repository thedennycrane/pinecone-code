<strong>Judgment:</strong>
</font>
</p>
<p xmlns=""><font color="#800000" face="t" size="3"><strong>Grounds of Judgment<br/>
</strong></font></p>
<p xmlns="">1. This is an ex parte application under Order 53 of the Rules of Court by Neel's

Electronics Pte Ltd ("NEP") for leave to apply for an Order of Certiorari to

quash the decision of the Principal Assistant Registrar of the Registry of Trade Marks

made on 24 May 2001 granting to M/s Charles Jourdan Holding AG ("Jourdan") - the

opponents to an application for the registration of a trade mark by NEP - leave to file

Notice of Opposition out of time. </p>
<p xmlns="">2. The application to register the trade mark in question was made on 10 October 1998.

The trade mark was accepted, under s 13(1) of the Trade Marks Act (Ch 332) for

registration, and the application was published in the Trade Marks Journal on 23 February

2001. Under s 13(2) of the Trade Marks Act, any person may, "within the prescribed

time", give notice to the Registrar of opposition to the registration. The

"prescribed time" is contained in rule 29 of the Trade Marks Rules. </p>
<p xmlns="">3. Rule 29(1) of the Trade Marks Rules allows the person opposing to file his Notice of

Opposition "within 2 months" of the date of publication of the application for

registration. Where the person opposing requires additional time to file the notice, the

Rules allow the person to request for an extension of time but this too must be done

"within 2 months" of the date of publication of the application for

registration. This is provided for in rule 29(3) which reads: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"A request for an extension of time to file the notice of opposition shall be made

  by filing with the Registrar Form TM48 within 2 months from the date of the publication of

  the application for registration." </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(Emphasis added.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">In this case therefore, since the application for registration was published on 23

February 2001, Jourdan had to file its Notice of Opposition or apply for extension of time

to file the said Notice by 23 April 2001. </p>
<p xmlns="">4. Jourdan did not file the required notice by 23 April 2001. Neither did Jourdan, by

that date, apply under rule 29(3) for extension of time. It was only on 9 May 2001 - some

16 days after the cut-off date of 23 April 2001 - that Jourdan, through its solicitors,

applied for an extension of time to file the Notice of Opposition. </p>
<p xmlns="">5. The application for extension of time was heard by the Principal Assistant Registrar

on 24 May 2001. NEP objected to any extension of time being granted on the grounds, inter

alia, that: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>(a) the Principal Assistant Registrar had power to grant an extension if, and only if,

  the application for extension had been made on or before 23 April 2001. In this case as

  the application was made after 23 April 2001, the Principal Assistant Registrar would have

  no powers to grant the extension. </p>
<p>(b) Rule 29(8) provides that the Registrar may "if he is satisfied that a good and

  sufficient reason has been shown for the extension" grant the extension. The

  explanation proffered by Jourdan both for the application being made out of time and in

  support of the application for extension of time to file the Notice of Opposition was that

  their agents had overlooked the matter. Such an explanation, it was submitted, could not

  amount to a good and sufficient reason for the grant of the extension of time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">Jourdan took the position, before the Principal Assistant Registrar, that the failure

to apply for the extension on or before 23 April 2001 was a mere irregularity which can be

cured under rule 83 of the Trade Marks Rules. </p>
<p xmlns="">6. Rule 83 of the Trade Marks Rules reads as follows: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"Any irregularity in procedure which, in the opinion of the Registrar, is not

  detrimental to the interests of any person or party may be corrected on such terms as the

  Registrar may direct." </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">It would appear that the Principal Assistant Registrar considered that the failure to

conform with the time constraints imposed by Rule 29(3) was an irregularity which fell

within the purview of rule 83 and in the exercise of her discretion under that rule, she

granted the extension sought. </p>
<p xmlns="">7. Despite the fact that the Principal Assistant Registrar had granted the extension

sought, the Registry accepted the registration and, on 5 June 2001, forwarded to NEP the

Certificate of Registration for the trade mark in question. The Registrar's response, when

this fact was brought to his attention, was that the Certificate had been issued in error.

The Registrar, accordingly, asked for the return of the Certificate and informed NEP that

the register had been amended to reflect that the application was "pending"

instead of "registered". </p>
<p xmlns="">8. Counsel for NEP, in this application for leave to issue certiorari, contended that

the Principal Assistant Registrar, in granting the extension of time after the 2-month

period had expired, had acted in breach of the statutory requirements of rule 29(3). He

also submitted that the discretion in rule 83 could only come into play in respect of

irregularities, the waiver of which would not cause any detriment to any person. In this

case, he submitted, the extension of time had caused a detriment to NEP in that NEP had

been deprived of a certificate that would otherwise have been issued to it. </p>
<p xmlns="">9. Ms Hema Subramaniam, who appeared for the Attorney-General, made it clear from the

outset that if indeed the Registrar had no powers to entertain the application for

extension of time where such application was made after the 2-month period, then the

Registrar's decision would be unlawful and would have to be quashed. Ms Subramaniam

submitted, however, that the time period specified in the Rules related only to matters of

procedure and that since rule 83 of the Trade Marks Rules gave the Registrar a discretion

in such procedural matters to waive any non-compliance, the grant of the extension was

lawful. In respect of the cancellation of the Certificate that had been issued, Ms

Subramaniam submitted that as the Certificate had been issued in error, it had no validity

and the Registrar was duty-bound to cancel it. </p>
<p xmlns="">10. At this hearing I am not called upon to decide which of these two opposing views is

correct. The court's duty in an application for leave to issue certiorari is, as stated in

IRC v National Federation of Self-Employed [1981] 2 All ER 93 at 106 (adopted in Chan

Hiang Leng Colin &amp; Ors v Minister for Information and the Arts <a class="remove" href1="/scripts/lp/dll/prospect.dll?GetHTML_lpqs&amp;type=1&amp;CaseID=9983&amp;freetext=" target="LWBMainFrame">[1996] 1 SLR 609</a>), as

follows: </p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p>"If, on a quick perusal of the material then available, the court thinks that it

  discloses what might on further consideration turn out to be an arguable case in favour of

  granting to the applicant the relief claimed, it ought, in the exercise of a judicial

  discretion, to give him leave to apply for that relief." </p>
</blockquote>
<p xmlns="">It seems to me that there is an arguable case that the Principal Assistant Registrar in

allowing an application for an extension of time made after the statutory period

prescribed in the Rules had elapsed, was acting outside her powers. I therefore grant the

leave sought. </p>
