It was not disputed that Mr Chabtini was the person driving the business. Medica SG was incorporated in 2002 as part of a plan to expand the Medica Group internationally. It was in the business of wholesale medical equipment for aesthetic and plastic surgery, as well as wholesale cosmetic and toiletry products. The initial shareholders of Medica SG were Mr Chabtini and Mr Namir Robert Akl (“Mr Akl”), Ms Akl’s husband. Mr Chabtini held 60% of the shares and Mr Akl held the remaining 40%. Sometime after Medica SG’s incorporation, Mr Akl transferred all his shares in Medica SG to Ms Akl.

This mark was also registered in various countries including Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan and registered globally through the Madrid Protocol.

The “Skin Rejuvenation Solution” brand and trade mark was created by Mr Chabtini and his team in the 2000s. As there were challenges registering the SRS Mark in SRSI’s name at the time of its registration in 2006, it was understood and agreed between Mr Chabtini and Ms Akl that the SRS Mark was to be registered in Medica SG’s name instead, and held by Medica SG on behalf of SRSI.

</div></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">18 The sole issue for my determination was therefore whether the SRS Mark was held on trust by Medica SG for SRSI. The principles governing whether an express trust had arisen were undisputed. In <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale and others v Nine Squares Pty Ltd</span> [2015] 1 SLR 1097 (“<span class="font-italic">Guy Neale</span>”), the Court of Appeal held at [50] that an express trust is created by the actual intention of the settlor, as expressed by his use of the word “trust” in a relevant instrument, or inferred from his words or conduct. Three certainties must be present for the creation of an express trust: certainty of intention, certainty of subject matter, and certainty of the objects of the trust: <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale </span>at [51]. This dispute centred on the requirement of certainty of intention. The subject matter of the purported trust was the SRS Mark, and the alleged object was SRSI. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Was the SRS Mark held on trust for SRSI?  </span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">19 Certainty of intention requires proof that the settlor intended to create a trust.

Nevertheless, there must be clear evidence of a specific intention <span class="font-italic">to create a trust</span>: <span class="font-italic">Guy Neale </span>at [52]. To prove only an intention that property be used for another’s benefit, or be subject to some obligations, would be insufficient.

His alternative argument was that, even if there was no agreement between him and Ms Akl to create a trust, his intention <span class="font-italic">alone</span> was sufficient because it could be attributed to Medica SG. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-2 text-left font-weight-bold font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Attribution</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">21 I deal with the argument on attribution first because it was wholly inapplicable.

Lord Hoffmann grouped the rules of attribution into three sets. The first set comprises the primary rules of attribution which are found in the company’s constitution or implied by company law which deem certain acts by certain natural persons to be the acts of the company (at 506D). The second set comprises the general rules of attribution by which a natural person may have the acts of another attributed to him, <span class="font-italic">ie</span>, the principles of agency; and by which a natural person may be held liable for the acts of another, such as estoppel, ostensible authority and vicarious liability (at 506F). The third and final set comprises special rules of attribution which the court must fashion in exceptional cases where applying the first or second set of principles would defeat the policy underlying a particular provision of the substantive law as it was intended to apply to a company (at 507D–F).

First, an express trust is created by an expression of an intention, not an intention alone. Second, Mr Chabtini had not identified any basis for his intention to be attributed to Medica SG. Article 110 of Medica SG’s articles of association provides that the management of its business vested in the directors. Article 103 provides that unless otherwise specified, the quorum necessary for the transaction of the business of the directors would be two, and that a meeting of the directors at which a quorum is present would be competent to exercise all the powers and discretions exercisable by the directors.

</div>
</div> In the absence of any other evidence on the point, it was clear that the authority to enter into business transactions such as the purported trust arrangement lay with both directors jointly. To establish the existence of the trust, Mr Chabtini therefore had to show that the collective intention of Medica SG’s directors at the time (himself and Ms Akl) was to create a trust over the SRS Mark in favour of SRSI. His personal intention to create a trust was not sufficient.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">23 Mr Chabtini’s assumption was that because he was the founding shareholder and director of Medica SG and its early driving force, his intention was Medica SG’s intention. It is a fundamental principle of company law that a company possesses a legal personality distinct from its shareholders. Mr Chabtini’s assumption ignored this principle. In <span class="font-italic">Jhaveri</span><span class="font-italic"> Darsan Jitendra and others v Salgaocar Anil Vassudeva and others </span>[2018] 5 SLR 689 (“<span class="font-italic">Jhaveri</span><span class="font-italic"> Darsan Jitendra</span>”), Kannan Ramesh J considered such a case of insider reverse piercing of the corporate veil, which is where a shareholder or corporate insider asks the court to disregard the separate legal personality of the company.

Quite to the contrary. If the SRS Mark was already beneficially owned by SRSI, there would be no need to transfer it to SRSI unless SRSI needed to be its <span class="font-italic">legal </span>or<span class="font-italic"> registered </span>owner as well. However, the evidence did not suggest that there was such a need nor did it disclose any expression of that intention. Mr Chabtini testified that he incorporated SRSPL in Singapore because he considered that it might be more convenient for the transfer to be made to a Singapore entity instead of SRSI (a Belgian entity). He instructed employees of Medica SG to make the transfers of the Marks to SRSPL, but again this did not materialise.

</div> If the true motivation for the transfers was to end any trust arrangement or to make SRSI the legal and registered owner of the SRS Mark, such a transfer to SRSPL would not solve the problem. The fact that Mr Chabtini considered a transfer to SRSPL to be a viable alternative showed that the intended transfers were really to make SRSI or SRSPL <span class="font-italic">acquire</span> the ownership of the SRS Mark. This accorded with Mr Chabtini’s evidence that the transfer of the SRS Mark to SRSI in the future was always intended (see [29] above). This meant that the beneficial interest in the SRS Mark could not have been SRSI’s to begin with. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">34 It was also argued that Ms Akl and later Ms Seow were silent in the face of his oft-expressed intention to transfer the SRS Mark, and therefore they had acquiesced to the trust arrangement. There were two problems with this argument. First, mere silence in these circumstances did not amount to acquiescence. At no point did either of them indicate concurrence with any trust arrangement. Nor was there an occasion prior to the transfer of the SRS Mark where either of them was silent in response to an explicit suggestion that the SRS Mark was, or was to be, held on trust. Secondly, this argument did not address the fundamental deficiency in Mr Chabtini’s case. The evidence did not suggest any intention to create a trust at the point of the SRS Mark’s registration, even on his part alone. There was nothing for Ms Akl or Ms Seow to acquiesce to. The internal documents exhibited showed instead confusion on the part of Mr Chabtini and his EMA staff regarding ownership of the mark. An internal email chain around 2 December 2019, for example, revealed that Mr Chabtini was under the mistaken impression that the SRS Mark had been transferred to SRSI previously.

</div> The issue was a red herring because, regardless of who created the SRS Mark, all that mattered was Medica SG’s intention regarding its ownership at the time of registration. On the evidence, it was clear that the SRS Mark was created as a corporate asset of Medica SG and registered as such. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-4 text-left">(3) Communications with external parties</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">37 Mr Chabtini produced three documents which he argued showed that third parties were dealt with on the basis that a trust existed over the SRS Mark. However, these documents did not help his case. First, these were documents of SRSI, rather than Medica SG. Second, for reasons below, their content did not suggest that SRSI was the beneficial owner of the SRS Mark. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(A) Letter of approval</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">38  Mr Chabtini produced a letter from SRSI, signed and stamped by them, dated 1 January 2009, which said the following:

First, there was no specific reference to the SRS Mark. Rather, the letter was concerned with who was “authorised to sell [SRSI’s] range of products”. This was a separate issue from the issue of the ownership of the SRS Mark. Mr Chabtini submitted that this letter represented that it was SRSI who was the principal and the ultimate owner of the SRS range of products and that it was “only logical” that SRSI was therefore the rightful owner of the Marks.

</div> In my view, the logical premise was incorrect. Medica SG’s ownership of the SRS Mark could exist and complement SRSI’s positioning of itself as responsible for the SRS brand. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">40 More fundamentally, because this letter did not even refer to the SRS Mark, it was silent on the issue of the SRS Mark’s beneficial ownership. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(B) SRS brand catalogue</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">41  Second, Mr Chabtini relied on a brand catalogue which bore the Second Mark.

</div> Immediately below the Second Mark was SRSI’s name. Mr Chabtini argued that it was thus communicated to the viewer of the catalogue that the listed products sold under the Second Mark belonged to SRSI. This, in turn, communicated to external parties that SRSI was the true owner of the Second Mark. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">42 In my view, this argument was flawed. First, the catalogue did not bear the SRS Mark, which was the mark in respect of which the remedies were sought in this suit. Second, the fact that SRSI’s name was below the Second Mark did not suggest to a viewer that SRSI owned the Second Mark. All it suggested was that SRSI was entitled to use the Second Mark. Nor was a brand catalogue a cogent piece of evidence. Rather than a brand catalogue, what would generally be used by an external party to determine ownership of a trade mark would be the IPOS register, which would reveal that the Marks were owned by Medica SG.</div><div class="Judg-Heading-5 text-left">(C) The Indonesian Letter of Appointment</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">43  Finally, Mr Chabtini produced a letter which listed various SRS products. The relevant portions of the letter read as follows:

Again, it made no reference to the ownership of the SRS Mark. Contrary to what Mr Chabtini suggested, the fact that this letter stated that SRSI was the “owner” of the various listed SRS products was not inconsistent with Medica SG owning the SRS Mark. Medica SG and SRSI were part of the same group of companies. It could well have been the case that Medica SG owned the SRS Mark, while SRSI was regarded by the group as the owner of the products. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-3 text-left font-italic"><span class="font-italic">Whether an express trust was created</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 The evidence proved the contrary of what Mr Chabtini alleged. There was no oral agreement between Ms Akl and himself; neither could his own personal intention be sufficient to create a trust. In fact, the evidence did not even suggest that he had such a personal intention. The surrounding circumstances did not indicate that SRSI was the beneficial owner of the SRS Mark. </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 The SRS Mark was not held on trust by Medica SG in favour of SRSI. Neither could Mr Chabtini’s intention be attributed to the company, which had a separate legal personality. Mr Chabtini was responsible to take steps for the registration of the SRS Mark to be transferred back to Medica SG’s name in Taiwan and Indonesia and to compensate Medica SG in the sum of $5,850.90, being the cost of the transfers that Medica SG was able to reverse on its own.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 I dealt with costs of the suit on 18 July 2022. Medica SG had sent Mr Chabtini a Calderbank letter. The remedies obtained by Medica SG, however, were not better than those suggested by their Calderbank letter when the letter was construed strictly. This was because the prayer for a declaration that Medica SG was the legal and beneficial owner of the Marks (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, Prayer (a)) had been withdrawn at trial. Thus, I did not take Medica SG’s letter into account on the issue of costs. Mr Chabtini, on his part, had issued both an offer to settle pursuant to O 22A r 9(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“OTS”) and a Calderbank letter. Nevertheless, neither was applicable to change the usual basis for costs. The OTS required Ms Seow to withdraw a separate suit in the State Courts, which was still ongoing at the time of the costs hearing. The Calderbank letter required Medica SG to change its name and give up its rights in countries aside from Singapore, Taiwan and Indonesia. Therefore, costs of the claim were awarded to Medica SG on the standard basis.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In deciding the issue of quantum, I took into consideration that some claims that were abandoned at trial should have been withdrawn by Medica SG much earlier if the appropriate research had been done and if so, due consideration should have been given as to whether the matter ought to have been transferred to the State Courts. Medica SG was awarded $25,000 for the suit. In addition, $4,000 was awarded for various interlocutory applications for which costs were previously ordered to be in the cause. Costs of obtaining judgment on the counterclaim was awarded to Mr Chabtini at $2,000. These orders excluded disbursements, which were separately agreed between the parties. </div><table class="table table-sm table-borderless"><tbody><tr><td><div class="txt-body text-left">Valerie Thean <br>Judge of the High Court</br></div></td><td><div class="txt-body text-left"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Andrew John Hanam (Andrew LLC) for the plaintiff;</div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Suang Wijaya (Eugene Thuraisingam LLP) for the defendant.</div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
