</div> Any doubt in this regard would have been resolved against the defendant, in line with the <span class="font-italic">contra proferentem </span>rule. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">28 The plaintiff submitted that the “as is” clause meant that the defendant had agreed to take the rigs in their then existing condition, including their weights.

In my view, the defendant’s submission was illogical. The condition of the rigs naturally included the addition or removal of any equipment or parts of the rigs.

The existing condition of the rigs therefore had to also include the weights of the rigs.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">30 In my view, Ronnie understood that the “as is” clause meant that the defendant could not complain about the weights of the rigs. The Vasbit Agreement stated the weights of the rigs but also provided that PT Vasbit accepted the rigs on an “as is where is basis”. The weights of the rigs stated in the Vasbit Agreement (6,206.72MT and 8,759.98MT) were very different from the weights as stated by the defendant in these proceedings (4,852MT and 4,697MT).

</div> I did not accept Ronnie’s explanations; he changed his explanation each time he could not answer a question about his previous explanation. In my view, it was more likely that Ronnie did not bother about the weights being stated wrongly in the Vasbit Agreement because he knew that PT Vasbit could not subsequently complain about them due to the “as is” clause. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">31 Second, the Agreements were silent as to the weight of the rigs. The defendant’s case was that the weight of the rigs was material and important. As already mentioned, the Agreements were drafted by the defendant’s lawyers.  Ronnie confirmed that the “as is” clause was inserted in the Agreements on his instructions. He explained that the omission of any reference to the weight of the rigs in the Agreements was simply an oversight. I did not accept Ronnie’s explanation. I found it most unlikely that he would have simply forgotten to include the weight of the rigs in the Agreements when, according to him, the weight was important. This was all the more so when he had given express instructions to include the “as is” clause in the Agreements. Ronnie also asserted that he did not include the weight of the rigs in the Agreements as he had trusted Eunos. His explanation, while convenient, was unconvincing. He had little reason to trust Eunos, whom he had first met only in February 2018.

</div> yet trusted Eunos to the extent of omitting the weights of the rigs (which he had agreed to pay $2.2m in total for) in the Agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">32 In my judgment, the defendant had not been induced to enter into the Agreements by the plaintiff’s representations. The defendant knew it was agreeing to take the rigs as they were, including whatever their actual weights were. Further, if the fact that the rigs had a minimum total weight of 22,000MT was as important as the defendant claimed, Ronnie would surely have instructed the defendant’s lawyers to include that as an express term. His claim that it was a mere oversight rang hollow.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">33 The above findings were sufficient to dispose of the defendant’s counterclaim for misrepresentation. However, I would add that in any event, the defendant had not proved its loss. The defendant pleaded that the actual weight of each of the two rigs was 4,697MT (see [20] above). This was likely an error because the defendant also pleaded that the actual total weight of the two rigs was around 9,550MT.

The defendant did not adduce any evidence that it had paid $280,000 to Rajoo on behalf of Eunos. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">44 Third, the evidence showed that the release of the Loan was simply one of the terms of the agreement for the defendant to purchase the rigs from the plaintiff. The Release Agreement was signed on the same day as the Agreements and the Deed of Novation, and expressly provided that it would be signed only after the Agreements and the Deed of Novation had been signed. The Release Agreement was also described as being supplemental to the Agreements. In other words, the release of the Loan was part of the price paid by the defendant for the purchase of the rigs. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">45 It was not surprising that the release of the Loan formed part of the price paid by the defendant to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had paid Mercator the sum of $220,000, being 10% of the purchase price of the two rigs under the Mercator Agreements. Pursuant to the Deed of Novation, this payment of $220,000 was deemed to have been made by the defendant. Logically, the defendant would have had to repay the plaintiff this sum of $220,000. The release of the Loan was a convenient way of repaying the plaintiff this sum.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">46 The Loan was for $280,000. Eunos claimed that the Loan included interest amounting to $60,000. Rajoo and Ronnie both denied this and claimed that Eunos had said he needed the additional $60,000 to pay legal fees and other expenses. It was not necessary for me to decide whether the Loan included an interest component. What was critical was that the Release Agreement clearly released Eunos from the whole of the Loan.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">47 In my view, although each of the Agreements described the purchase price of each rig as $1.1m, the combined effect of the Agreements, the Deed of Novation and the Release Agreement was that the defendant had agreed to pay a total amount of $2,515,000 for the two rigs, comprising the following:</div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(a) $1,980,000 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $990,000 x 2)<span class="font-italic"> </span>which the defendant had to pay Mercator pursuant to the Deed of Novation;  </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(b) $280,000 pursuant to the Release Agreement; </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(c) $55,000 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $27,500 x 2) that the defendant had already paid to the plaintiff pursuant to the Agreements; and </div><div class="Judg-2 mb-3 text-justify">(d) $200,000 (<span class="font-italic">ie</span>, $100,000 x 2) that the defendant had to pay to the plaintiff pursuant to cl 2 of each of the Agreements.</div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">48 Fourth, even assuming that the defendant did repay the Loan on behalf of the plaintiff’s director (Eunos), there was no basis upon which the plaintiff could be said to be liable to the defendant. There was nothing pleaded in the defendant’s counterclaim as to the basis upon which the plaintiff was alleged to be liable to the defendant in respect of a loan taken by its director in his personal capacity. </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">49 In my view, there was no basis at all for this counterclaim and I dismissed it accordingly.  </div><div class="Judg-Heading-1 text-left font-weight-bold"><span class="font-weight-bold">Conclusion</span></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify">50 For the reasons set out above, I entered judgment for the plaintiff in each suit in the sum of $100,000 with interest at 5.33% from the date of each writ to judgment, and dismissed the defendant’s counterclaims. I ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff costs fixed at $75,000 plus disbursements to be decided by me, if not agreed.  </div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-1 mb-3 text-justify"></div><div class="Judg-Sign text-left">Chua Lee Ming  <br/>Judge  </div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right">Yasmeen Jamil Marican (Eversheds Harry Elias LLP) for the plaintiff;<br/>Navinder Singh and Yik Xin Ying (KSCGP Juris LLP) for the defendant. </div><div class="Judg-EOF text-center"></div><div class="Judg-Lawyers text-right"></div><div class="Judg-Quote-List text-justify"></div></div></div><div class="row mb-3 mt-3"></div>
