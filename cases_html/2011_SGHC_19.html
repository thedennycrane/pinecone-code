<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       Originating Summons No 219 of 2010
                    (“OS 219”) was an application by the Law Society of Singapore
                    (“the Law Society”) for three advocates and solicitors who were
                    all partners of M/s Sadique Marican &amp; Z M Amin (“the Firm”) to
                    show cause why they should not be sanctioned under s 83(1) of the Legal
                    Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”). All
                    three respondents, Mr Zulkifli bin Mohd Amin (“Zulkifli”),
                    Mr Mohd Sadique bin Ibrahim Marican (“Sadique”), and
                    Mr Anand Kumar s/o Toofani Beldar (“Anand”) were admitted as
                    advocates and solicitors in 2000. The disciplinary proceedings came about as a
                    result of misappropriations by Zulkifli, in 2007, of clients’ monies in
                    excess of $11m.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       Originating Summons No 1292 of 2009
                    (“OS 1292”) was an earlier show-cause application against
                    Zulkifli for grossly improper conduct under s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act in a property transaction in failing to:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_a"></a>(a)     use reasonably available legal means
                        consistent with his retainer to advance his clients’
                    interest;</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_b"></a>(b)     keep his
                        clients reasonably informed of the progress of the transaction;
                    and</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_2-p2_c"></a>(c)     explain to his
                        clients certain letters or notices received from the vendor’s
                        solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The facts in OS 219</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       Zulkifli and Sadique set up the Firm in 2004 as
                    equity partners, with Anand as a salaried partner.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       Zulkifli was the managing partner, and he
                    managed the Firm’s client and office accounts. He was also in charge of
                    budgeting. Sadique and Anand had responsibility for matters concerning staff
                    salaries and monthly reviews of the balances in the client
                account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       The Firm did not have an accounts clerk. From
                    1 March 2006 to 31 July 2007, the Firm employed one Ms Sally Ang
                    (“Sally”) as finance and human resource manager. She worked under
                    Zulkifli. Sadique explained how the Firm was managed as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[I]n fact the whole accounting role was in a way performed by all of the
                        staff who were handling the files because they prepared and assisted in the
                        preparation of the documents in support of the payment vouchers and
                        submission of the payment vouchers and copies of the cheques. This was to
                        ensure their accountability for each of the file that they carry... it would
                        be every single staff who handled a file and relating to a client account...
                        No member of the staff kept account books. It was kept by Zulkifli and in
                        Sally Ang’s room... As to the exact person or persons who fill up the
                        books, I would not know. This is simply because the system in the firm,
                        since we started, was one of accountability between the partners... we were
                        not comfortable to allow a person in charge of the accounts to be –
                        like a staff to be in charge of the accounts. So what we did was, as we did
                        from the start, for a partner to be accountable to other partners as to how
                        the accounts were kept. So I ensured that the books were there, and I also
                        ensured that monthly reconciliations were sighted by myself and
                        [Anand].</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       On 31 July 2007, Sally left the Firm.
                    Subsequently, it was discovered that she had misappropriated $838,200 from the
                    Firm. She has since been prosecuted and convicted of seven counts of criminal
                    breach of trust under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev
                    Ed), as well as two offences under s 47(1)(<em>b</em>) of
                    the Corruption, Drug Trafficking &amp; Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of
                    Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed), and has been sentenced to five
                    years’ imprisonment. According to Sadique, Zulkifli took charge of the
                    Firm’s accounts after Sally left. He did not know whether Zulkifli was
                    assisted by anyone. This admission showed that he did not know what was going on
                    in the Firm in relation to their finances and clients’
                monies.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       The manner in which the Firm’s client
                    account was managed was explained in a letter written by Sadique and Anand to
                    the Law Society on 28 December 2007:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Essentially, the operation and management of the Client account is for
                        conveyancing matters, of which Mr Zulkifli was the Managing Partner and
                        Conveyancing Partner, to principally handle monies for conveyancing
                        transactions.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">…</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Mr Zulkifli continued therefore to be in charge of <em>inter alia</em> the engagement of a book-keeper to maintain all
                        cash books, ledgers, journals and reconciliation of the accounts.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The supervision over the Client account was ensured by having in place
                        three signatories to the Client Account of which the mandate to the bank was
                        for any two of the three signatories to sign, namely Zulkifli Bin Mohd Amin,
                        Sadique Marican and Anand Kumar. Zulkifli Bin Mohd Amin is the main
                        signatory.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The mandate given to the Bank was for any two of the three signatories and
                        for <u>any amount</u> from the client
                        account.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis in original]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Sadique and Anand claimed that stringent
                    controls were in place as “every payment out from the client account had
                    to be supported by payment vouchers, evidence of deposits, completion account
                    breakdowns and other forms of paper work, as the case may be.” These
                    controls were obviously not carried out in practice.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       On 19 November 2007, Sadique and Anand
                    discovered that both the Firm’s client and office accounts had been
                    overdrawn. On 20 November 2007, Zulkifli absconded. Two days later, Sadique
                    and Anand informed Ms Yashodhara Dhoraisingam (“Yashodhara”),
                    a Senior Director of the Law Society’s Compliance and Conduct Department,
                    that Zulkifli was missing and that they suspected him of misappropriating monies
                    from both the client and office accounts. Sadique and Anand made a police report
                    on the same day.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     On 23 November 2007, Yashodhara informed
                    Sadique and Anand that pursuant to rule 12 of the Legal Profession
                    (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules (Cap 161, R 8, 1999 Rev Ed)
                    (“the SAR”), the Council of the Law Society (“the
                    Council”) would inspect the Firm’s accounts for the period of
                    1 January 2007 to 22 November 2007 and requested them to deliver
                    various books of accounts and other accounting records to the Law
                    Society.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     The inspection was conducted by the Law
                    Society with the assistance of Mr Kon Yin Tong of Foo Kon Tan Grant Thornton.
                    The inspection revealed that the Firm had not prepared any bank reconciliation
                    statements after July 2007; that, contrary to the SAR, the Firm had issued cash
                    cheques for a total of $5,660,357.02; and that the propriety of issuing these
                    cheques could not be verified due to insufficient documentation supporting the
                    payments.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     On 23 January 2008, the Law Society
                    sought a written undertaking from Sadique and Anand that they would cease to
                    hold and receive clients’ monies or act as signatories to the client
                    account of any law practice. On 1 February 2008, the undertaking, effective
                    as from 29 February 2008, was furnished.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Pursuant to s 85(2) of the Act, on
                    3 June 2008, the Council referred the matter to an Inquiry Committee
                    (“IC”), which recommended a formal investigation by a Disciplinary
                    Tribunal (“DT”) pursuant to s 89(1) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Charges</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Charges against Zulkifli</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     A total of 211 charges were brought against
                    Zulkifli for various breaches of the SAR. The 1st to 208th charges concerned the
                    making of unauthorized withdrawals from the Firm’s client account in
                    breach of rule 7(1)(<em>a</em>) of the SAR, which
                    states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">There may be drawn from a client account —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    in the case of client’s money
                                —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(i)    money properly required for a payment to

                                    partial reimbursement of money expended by the solicitor on
                                    behalf of the client;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(iii)   money drawn on the client’s
                                    authority;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(iv)   money properly required for or towards
                                    payment of the solicitor’s costs where a bill of costs or
                                    other written intimation of the amount of the costs incurred has
                                    been delivered to the client and the client has been notified
                                    that money held for him will be applied towards or in
                                    satisfaction of such costs; and</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-3">(v)    money to be transferred to another client
                                    account.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 209th charge concerned his failure
                    to ensure that the Firm’s client account was not overdrawn on
                    19 November 2007 pursuant to rule 7(2) of the SAR, which provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">In the case of client’s money and trust money referred to in
                        paragraph (1)(<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>), the money so drawn shall not exceed the total of the
                        money held for the time being in the client account on account of the client
                        or trust.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The 210th charge concerned his failure to record all transactions
                    concerning the Firm’s client account in a ledger required to be maintained
                    under rule 11(1) and (2) of the SAR, which reads:</p>

<p class="Judg-1">Finally, the 211th charge concerned
                    his failure to cause the balance shown in the clients’ cash books to be
                    reconciled with the monthly bank statements of the Firm’s client account
                    under rule 11(4) of the SAR, which states:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Every solicitor shall within one month of his commencing practice on his
                        own account (either alone or in partnership) and thereafter not less than

                        books (or clients’ column of his cash book) to be reconciled with his
                        clients’ bank statements and shall keep in the cash book or other
                        appropriate place a statement showing the reconciliation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The Law Society’s case was that these breaches of the
                    above-mentioned rules amounted to grossly improper conduct under

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Charges against Sadique and Anand </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     The Law Society preferred three charges
                    against Sadique and Anand. The 1st charge concerned a breach of rule 11(4)
                    of the SAR. The charge was that they had failed to conduct, from August to
                    October 2007, any reconciliation of the balances in the clients’ cash
                    books and the monthly bank statements of the Firm’s client account, and
                    also to keep a statement showing the reconciliation in a cash book or other
                    appropriate accounting document. The Law Society’s case was that this
                    failure amounted to grossly improper conduct within the meaning of
                        s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, or alternatively,
                    to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of
                        s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     The 2nd charge concerned a breach of
                    rules 11(1) and (2) of the SAR. The charge was that for the period of
                    3 January 2007 to 20 November 2007, Sadique and Anand had failed to
                    record, or cause to be recorded, all transactions concerning the Firm’s
                    client account in ledgers required to be maintained. As with the 1st charge, it
                    was also alleged that this failure amounted to grossly improper conduct within
                    the meaning of s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act, or
                    alternatively, to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor within the
                    meaning of s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the
                Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     The 3rd charge was that between 3 January
                    2007 and 20 November 2007, Sadique and Anand breached their duties as
                    co-signatories of the Firm’s client account by failing to adequately
                    supervise transactions involving the said account and by failing to safeguard
                    clients’ monies in that account such that unauthorized transactions were
                    made from it. It was alleged that the breach amounted to misconduct unbefitting
                    an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of s 83(2)(<em>h</em>) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The DT’s Findings</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     On 5 August 2009, a DT was appointed by
                    the Chief Justice pursuant to s 90 of the Act to hear the complaints
                    against the three respondents.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     Zulkifli was not present at the hearing.
                    Attempts to contact him at his last known residential and business addresses to
                    notify him of the hearing before the DT proved fruitless. Notices had also been
                    posted on both the Supreme Court notice board and in newspapers but to no
                    avail.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     At the conclusion of the hearing, the DT found
                    all the charges had been proven against Zulkifli, and that cause of sufficient
                    gravity for disciplinary action under s 83 of the Act to be taken had been
                    made out.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     With regard to Sadique and Anand, the DT found
                    that the 1st charge was proven only in relation to the month of October 2007,
                    but not August and September 2007. The DT also found Sadique and Anand guilty of
                    the 2nd charge, which concerned their failure to record all transactions
                    concerning the Firm’s client account in ledgers and of the 3rd charge,
                    regarding their failure as co-signatories to adequately supervise transactions
                    involving clients’ monies in the Firm’s client account and to
                    safeguard the said monies. In the DT’s view, there was sufficient cause
                    for disciplinary action under s 83 of the Act to be taken.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Proceedings before this Court</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The parties’ arguments</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     Zulkifli did not appear personally or by
                    counsel to defend the charges against him.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     In regard to Sadique and Anand, the Law
                    Society agreed with the DT’s findings on the 2nd and 3rd charges, but
                    contended that the DT erred in finding that the 1st charge had only been made
                    out in relation to the Firm’s accounts for October 2007.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     In reply, counsel for Sadique and Anand,
                    Professor Tan Cheng Han SC (“Prof Tan”) argued that the DT erred
                    in finding that all the three charges had been made out against his clients.
                    With regard to the 1st charge, he argued that reconciliation statements had been
                    prepared for the relevant months but they could not be produced to the DT as the
                    statements went missing when Zulkifli absconded.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     With regard to the 2nd charge, Prof Tan argued
                    that although the ledgers could not be found, it was evident that there had been
                    ledgers as the Firm’s accounts had been satisfactorily audited in 2006,
                    and monthly reconciliation statements had been drawn up.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     With respect to the 3rd charge against Sadique
                    and Anand, Prof Tan made two procedural arguments. The first was that the Law
                    Society had failed to comply with s 87(1A) of the Act, which provides as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">Where the Council has determined under subsection
                            (1)(<em>d</em>) that a matter be referred back to
                        the Inquiry Committee for reconsideration or a further report —</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>a</em>)    the Council
                                shall notify the Inquiry Committee accordingly;</p>
<p class="Judg-QuoteList-2">(<em>b</em>)    the Inquiry
                                Committee shall submit its response or further report to the Council
                                within 4 weeks from the date of the Council’s notification;
                                and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">…</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     Prof Tan’s complaint was that although
                    the Council had notified the IC through the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel
                    (“IP”) on 6 July 2009 that a further report was required in
                    relation to the 3rd charge, the IC submitted its further report on
                    14 August 2009 to the Chairman of the IP, who submitted it to the Council
                    only on 28 August 2009. Hence, Prof Tan argued that the report had been
                    received by the Council 22 days after the statutory period had expired. This
                    resulted in a breach of s 87(1A<em>)</em>(<em>b</em>) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_28"></a>28     Prof Tan’s second argument was that as
                    Sadique and Anand had not been informed of the Council’s decision to ask
                    the IC for a further report on 6 July 2009, there was also a breach of
                    s 87(4) of the Act, which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Council shall inform the advocate and solicitor and the person who
                        made the complaint of the manner in which it has determined the complaint
                        within 14 days of the determination, and in the event of the determination
                        being that a formal investigation is unnecessary, the Council shall on the
                        request of the person furnish him with its reasons in writing.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_29"></a>29     Prof Tan argued that the effect of these two
                    breaches was that the Law Society should not have been allowed to exercise its
                    statutory powers under s 87(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act
                    to convene a DT to hear the 3rd charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_30"></a>30     In relation to the substance of the 3rd
                    charge, Prof Tan argued that as Zulkifli had forged the signatures of Sadique
                    and Anand in the course of his misappropriation, Sadique and Anand could not
                    have breached their duties as co-signatories of the Firm’s client account
                    since the documents were never placed before them in the first place. As such,
                    it was argued that Sadique and Anand were not guilty of the 3rd
                charge.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Our decision</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charges against Zulkifli </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_31"></a>31     Zulkifli did not appear to defend the 211
                    charges against him. We agreed with the DT that those charges had been proved
                    against Zulkifli.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charges against Sadique</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_32"></a>32     With respect to the 1st charge against
                    Sadique, we affirmed the DT’s finding that the reconciliation statements
                    for October 2007 had not been prepared. However, we could not, with respect,
                    agree with the DT’s finding that the August and September 2007
                    reconciliation statements were <em>in all probability</em>
                    prepared because reconciliation statements had been prepared from January to
                    July 2007. We had two reasons for coming to this conclusion. First, the
                    reconciliation statements that were produced to the DT were reconstructed
                    statements. Sadique asserted that the contemporaneous reconciliation statements
                    were missing only after Zulkifli absconded but no witness was called to confirm
                    that contemporaneous reconciliation statements had been prepared. The second
                    reason was that Sally left suddenly on 31 July 2007 but her position was
                    not filled. Zulkifli started misappropriating clients’ and the
                    Firm’s monies from January 2007 and there was no reason for him to keep
                    proper records.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_33"></a>33     With regard to the 2nd charge, we agreed with
                    the DT’s findings with respect to Sadique. He could not produce the
                    Firm’s actual ledger as he claimed that it went missing. All that he
                    produced was an Excel document called the “Transaction Listing”,
                    which recorded payments into and out of the client account. As the DT rightly
                    noted, this document was insufficient to constitute a ledger. It is also
                    noteworthy that Sally stated in her testimony to the DT that she did not
                    maintain any <em>client ledger</em>, cashbook or journal
                    and that no one else maintained one.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_34"></a>34     With respect to Prof Tan’s procedural
                    arguments in relation to the 3rd charge against Sadique, we agreed that the Law
                    Society was in breach of both s 87(1A) and s 87(4) of the Act. In
                    relation to s 87(1A) of the Act, the Council received the further report
                    only 22 days after the statutory period of four weeks had expired.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_35"></a>35     However, we could not agree with Prof
                    Tan’s argument that a breach of s 87(1A)(<em>a</em>) of the Act would disempower the Law Society from referring
                    the matter to this court. Section 87(1A) of the Act merely sets timelines
                    for certain actions to be taken by the Law Society in certain circumstances.
                    They were not meant to be condition precedents necessary for the exercise of the
                    Law Society’s powers to refer the findings of the DT to this court. The
                    modern approach as to the effect of a breach of a statutory provision is not to
                    treat every breach as a disempowering or invalidating event. In <em>Ng Swee Lang and another v Sassoon Samuel Bernard and
                        others</em> [2008] 2 SLR(R) 597, the Court of Appeal
                    endorsed the modern approach in these words (at [21]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The Judge applied this modern approach to statutory interpretation, which
                        requires the court (see [43] of the GD):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">... [to look] at the whole scheme and purpose of the Act and ... [weigh]
                        the importance of the particular requirement in the context of that purpose
                        and [ask] whether the Legislature would have intended the consequences of a
                        strict construction, having regard to the prejudice to private rights and
                        the claims of the public interest (if any).</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The modern approach was further stated by Simon Brown LJ in <em>Ahmed v Kennedy</em> [2003] 1 WLR 1820 in the form
                    of the following question (at [29]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[D]oes this legislation on its true construction give the court a
                        discretion to waive these petitioners’ timeous non-compliance or must
                        it be regarded as fatal to their proceedings?</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_36"></a>36     The question therefore was whether
                    non-compliance with the time periods in s 87(1A) of the Act was fatal to
                    the present proceedings. In our view, the answer was “no” as these
                    provisions were enacted for the purpose of expediting the disposal of
                    disciplinary proceedings – see the Second Reading speech of the Minister
                    for Law in Parliament when moving the amendment bill (<em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report</em> (26 August
                    2008) vol 84 at col 3187). The amendments were not enacted to put obstacles in
                    the way of disciplining errant advocates and solicitors who were guilty of
                    professional misconduct. In this connection, we might add that counsel for the
                    Law Society, instead of expressing his regret for the carelessness of the Law
                    Society in this regard, and giving his assurance that such mistakes would not be
                    made again, sought to argue that Sadique had not suffered any prejudice as a
                    result of the delay. We agreed with counsel’s legal submission, but not
                    with the moral sentiment in which it was made.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_37"></a>37     Similarly, the Law Society also breached
                    s 87(4) of the Act in failing to inform Sadique of its decision to ask the
                    IC for a further report on 6 July 2009, but this did not prevent the
                    Council from convening a DT pursuant to s 87(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act. Again, a breach of this nature was not regarded
                    as serious since it did not prejudice the solicitor complained against.
                    Nevertheless, it is not a desirable state of affairs that the Law Society, the
                    statutory governing body of the profession, should find itself unable to comply
                    with simple statutory requirements, since it reflects a lack of the same degree
                    of professional standard that it expects of its members. As disciplining errant
                    lawyers is one of the most important statutory functions of the Law Society, the
                    Council should ensure that this function is carried out expeditiously and
                    properly and we trust that such a breach will not recur in the
                future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_38"></a>38     Having disposed of the two preliminary
                    objections to the 3rd charge, we agreed with the DT’s finding that the 3rd
                    charge was made out against Sadique. The very fact that Zulkifli was able to
                    abscond with more than $11m showed that Sadique breached his duty as a
                    co-signatory to supervise the client account. Sadique’s cavalier attitude
                    towards supervising the Firm’s accounts facilitated Zulkifli’s
                    crime. His argument that he had agreed with Zulkifli to divide responsibilities
                    between themselves and was thus not liable for his failure to supervise the
                    accounts as this task fell under Zulkifli’s purview, was completely
                    without merit. Equity partners have a special responsibility to safeguard
                    clients’ monies and not to abdicate such responsibility by delegating it
                    to one or two partners, without any adequate system of periodic checks. On the
                    facts of the present case, Sadique had abdicated such responsibility entirely to
                    Zulkifli. Sadique failed to put in place an adequate system of periodic checks,
                    as a result of which Zulkifli was able, over a comparatively short period of
                    time, to commit a massive fraud. Sadique’s blatant contravention of the
                    SAR undoubtedly amounted to grossly improper conduct within the meaning of
                        s 83(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Act.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The charges against Anand</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_39"></a>39     Anand was merely a salaried partner. He was in
                    effect an employee of the Firm. Even if he had undertaken responsibilities in
                    relation to the accounts, this was an arrangement between him and the partners
                    of the Firm. Such an undertaking would merely have been a voluntary one.
                    Whatever may be his liability to third parties, the law should not, without
                    more, impose obligations on a salaried partner such as Anand to supervise the
                    Firm’s client account. This responsibility is a non-delegable
                    responsibility of the equity partners of the firm. As such, we disagreed with
                    the DT’s finding that all the three charges levelled against Anand were
                    made out and we acquitted him of all the said charges.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The appropriate penalty</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_40"></a>40     For the purpose of determining the appropriate
                    penalty against Zulkifli and Sadique, reference may first be made to
                    s 83(1) of the Act, which provides:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">All advocates and solicitors shall be subject to the control
                        of the Supreme Court and shall be liable on due cause shown —</p>

<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Penalty for Zulkifli</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_41"></a>41     Zulkifli was patently dishonest when he
                    misappropriated more than $11m of his clients’ funds. It is trite that
                    “where solicitors have dishonestly misappropriated their clients’
                    monies, they have inevitably been struck off the roll” (see <em>Law Society of Singapore v Rasif David</em> [2008]
                    2 SLR(R) 955 (at [35])). It follows that Zulkifli, who had embezzled
                    around $11m of his clients’ monies, must be struck off the roll, which we
                    so ordered. In view of this, it was not necessary to consider the charges
                    against him in OS 1292.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Penalty for Sadique</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_42"></a>42     In the present case, Sadique did not
                    misappropriate monies belonging to the Firm’s clients. There was no
                    dishonesty on his part. However, there was gross dereliction of duty in allowing
                    his equity partner to manage the accounts of the firm alone without putting in
                    place a framework for periodic checks. In fact, no check was made at any time
                    during the period when the misappropriations were taking place. Sadique would
                    have known that the firm had a sizable conveyancing practice and that the
                    Firm’s client account would have had substantial amounts of clients’
                    monies in it. By his dereliction of duty, he contributed to the misappropriation
                    by his partner of over $11m. This was undoubtedly a serious matter, as the loss
                    was sure to have caused serious economic harm to the clients. That an advocate
                    and solicitor may be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors for serious
                    transgressions other than dishonesty was pointed out by this court in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Tay Eng Kwee Edwin</em> [2007]
                        4 SLR(R) 171(“<em>Edwin
                    Tay</em>”), as follows (at [20]):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is the settled practice of this court that should it find a solicitor
                        to be dishonest, it will almost invariably direct that his name be struck
                        off the roll. <em>That said, even if no apparent dishonesty
                            is involved, a solicitor may be struck off the roll if the lapse is of
                            such a nature as to indicate that he lacks the requisite qualities of
                            character and trustworthiness expected of all solicitors</em>: see
                            <em>Law Society of Singapore v Ravindra Samuel</em>
                        [1999] 1 SLR 696 at [15]; cited in <em>Selena
                            Chiong</em> at [27].</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">[emphasis added]</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_43"></a>43     
          <em>Edwin Tay</em> shows
                    that although as a general rule the court would not strike an advocate and
                    solicitor off the roll, it may do so in exceptional circumstances. We regarded
                    this as an exceptional case because of the exceptional financial loss caused to
                    clients. This court expects the highest professional standards from lawyers to
                    keep their clients’ monies safe from the depredations of their dishonest
                    partners.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_44"></a>44     Equity partners of law firms who leave the
                    management of clients’ monies entirely to one or two partners without any
                    kind of checking mechanism must answer for their omission, if it facilitated the
                    misappropriation of clients’ monies by the other partner(s). In the
                    present case, Sadique’s dereliction of duty was a serious breach of
                    professional responsibility as it facilitated the loss to more than 80 clients
                    of a sum in excess of $11m. The loss cannot be fully compensated. As such, we
                    were of the view that the most severe sanction had to be imposed on
                    Sadique.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_45"></a>45     Imposing severe sanctions for breaches of the
                    SAR is consistent with the stand taken by other jurisdictions with respect to
                    breaches of accounting rules by partners of law firms. An English case,
                        <em>Re A Solicitor</em> (<em>The
                        Times</em> 15 July 1998), offers some guidance on when striking
                    off the roll may be appropriate. That case involved a three-partner firm, with
                    two equity partners and one salaried partner. W, an equity partner, was unaware
                    that his partner was transferring clients’ monies to office accounts to
                    meet the liabilities of the practice. Nevertheless, the English Court of Appeal
                    upheld the Disciplinary Tribunal’s decision to strike him off the roll on
                    the basis that in such a small practice, W had a responsibility to ensure that
                    he knew what was going on with the firm’s accounts and he ought to have
                    been put on enquiry when he was asked to sign a cheque of 60,000 pounds to HM
                    Customs &amp; Excise at a time when he knew of the firm’s parlous
                    financial state.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_46"></a>46     Similarly, in <em>Re Mayes and
                        the Legal Practitioners Act</em> [1974] 1 NSWLR 19, the New
                    South Wales Court of Appeal stressed the importance of a partner’s duty to
                    supervise accounts (at 25):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">It is no answer for the appellant to claim that he left the conduct of the
                        financial affairs of the firm to his partner. It would be no answer
                        generally and certainly not in this case where the appellant neglected his
                        responsibilities despite warnings that all was not well.  Feelings of
                        delicacy in the belief that queries or checks might be regarded as offensive
                        to the spirit of mutual trust between the partners do not, as claimed,
                        excuse or justify an abdication of responsibility. Instances of defalcation
                        by persons of apparently excellent character are not unknown, and every
                        solicitor should appreciate that there is some risk involved if he allows
                        one partner to be in the position of a sole practitioner so far as control
                        of the trust account is concerned.  This is what the appellant
                        did.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The extent to which each partner must concern himself with the financial
                        controls in a partnership necessarily varies with the size of the
                        partnership and the office organization, but each has the responsibility to
                        see that there is in existence a proper system to which each has access to
                        see that the rules are being obeyed and to check the system.  The
                        existence of a system cannot relieve partners from personal
                        vigilance.</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">We entirely reject the argument that a solicitor who is in partnership
                        can, without being guilty of professional misconduct, simply leave the
                        management of their joint trust account to his partner after he has reason
                        to be apprehensive as to his misuse of it, if it subsequently appears that
                        this facilitated misappropriation.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_47"></a>47     Sadique asserted that in considering the
                    appropriate penalty, account should be taken of the fact that the Firm had
                    effected payment of around $1,034,918.60 to its clients after Zulkifli
                    absconded. He also pointed out that he had a good record prior to the incident.
                    Finally, he submitted that it is relevant that he and Anand were themselves the
                    “whistle-blowers” who reported the matter to the Law Society and
                    the Commercial Affairs Department (“the CAD”). While Sadique may
                    have had a good record previously and the Firm has paid around $1m to its
                    clients, the fact remains that the said clients are still owed about $10m due to
                    his dereliction of duty as an equity partner in a small firm with a not
                    inconsiderable conveyancing practice. We did not regard his reporting of his
                    partner’s misappropriations to the Law Society and the CAD as a mitigating
                    factor: in the circumstances, the reporting was much too late for any person to
                    take remedial action. The errant partner had fled the jurisdiction and there was
                    nothing left for him to do but to make the report to the CAD.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_48"></a>48     For the above reasons, we also ordered that
                    Sadique be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Costs </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_49"></a>49     We ordered costs in favour of the Law Society
                    with regard to the proceedings against Zulkifli and Sadique, and made no order
                    as to costs in the case of Anand.</p>
