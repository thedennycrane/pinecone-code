<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Introduction</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_1"></a>1       The present matter concerns the division of
                    matrimonial assets, maintenance and custody of two children after interim
                    judgment of divorce was pronounced by the Family Court. The matter is before the
                    High Court as the matrimonial assets have been declared to be above $1.5 million
                    in value.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">Background facts</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_2"></a>2       The plaintiff (“Wife”) and the
                    defendant (“Husband”) met in Hong Kong in 1989 and were married in
                    Singapore in 1994. The Wife is now 46 years old while the Husband is 51. Two
                    children were born during the marriage. The elder son is presently 13 years of
                    age whilst the younger son is 10 years old. They are both schooling. During the
                    subsistence of the marriage, both the Wife and the Husband were gainfully
                    employed and earned their own keep. The Wife is an auditor making more than
                    $28,000 per month. The Husband is in the advertising industry and, up to January
                    2007, was drawing a salary of more than $45,000 per month. He was then placed on
                    “garden leave” from February to end July 2007. He managed to
                    secure alternative employment with effect from 5 January 2009 earning a
                    monthly income of $25,000. On 15 May 2009, his employment was terminated
                    and he started a business called Innovize. The Husband claims that he derives no
                    income from this business and that it was set up just to maintain his
                    marketability and for public relations purposes.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_3"></a>3       The marriage broke down some time in 2006 and
                    both parties commenced various divorce proceedings. These proceedings were
                    eventually withdrawn and the parties agreed that a fresh writ be filed and that
                    the same proceed on an uncontested basis. The current divorce proceedings were
                    filed by the Wife on 16 February 2007. She relied on the Husband’s
                    improper association with a series of women to argue that the Husband had
                    behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him
                    any longer. Interim judgment of divorce was granted by consent on 13 April
                    2007 and the ancillary matters were adjourned to be decided on a later date.
                    Since that date, various interim orders have been made by the Family Court upon
                    the parties’ applications.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_4"></a>4       The ancillary matters for determination by the

<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Wife’s Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_5"></a>5       In respect of the Children’s Matters, the
                    Wife asked for a range of orders, some of which the Husband was agreeable to,
                    while the rest were disputed. The orders which the Wife requested included
                    orders pertaining to joint custody as well as care and control of the children.
                    She also sought various consequential orders concerning matters such as the
                    children’s education, health, daily living arrangements (during school
                    term, school holidays as well as major holidays), as well as other
                    administrative matters.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_6"></a>6       In respect of maintenance for herself, the Wife
                    initially sought S$8,000 in monthly maintenance. Eventually she asked for a
                    nominal $1 per year as maintenance in order to preserve her rights should she
                    require maintenance in future.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_7"></a>7       As for maintenance for the children, the Wife
                    initially sought S$14,000 as monthly maintenance for both children but later
                    sought S$250 per child, totalling S$500 a month for both children. She also
                    sought an order for a trust fund to be established for the children by the
                    Husband in the amount of US$250,000 for each child. This trust fund would be
                    paid out to each child once he reaches 25 years of age. Additionally, she wanted
                    both parties to share the children’s educational and medical expenses
                    equally, unless such expenses were covered under insurance.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_8"></a>8       Finally on the issue of division of the
                    matrimonial home and other matrimonial assets, the Wife requested a 44% share of
                    the total matrimonial assets. This 44% would comprise 80% of the net sale
                    proceeds (including interest, if any) of the couple’s matrimonial home at
                    [address redacted] (“Matrimonial Property”) as well as all the
                    assets in her name. The wife hence sought orders that she be allowed to retain
                    80% of the net sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Property and that all other
                    assets be retained by the respective parties in their sole names.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">The Husband’s Case</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_9"></a>9       With respect to the Children’s Matters,
                    the Husband desired that the children spend equal time with both parents. He
                    hence requested joint custody and joint care and control of the children. During
                    the period in which the children were with either himself or the Wife, he also
                    sought orders governing access by the other parent to them. In respect of the
                    Wife’s application seeking a range of consequential orders, the
                    Husband’s response to those requests was mixed; he was agreeable to some
                    requests but not others.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_10"></a>10     As for maintenance for the Wife, the Husband
                    was not prepared to offer her any form of maintenance in view of the high salary
                    she is earning, her excellent career path and promising future prospects. He
                    claims that the Wife has received a promotion to principal auditor in a
                    multi-national company.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_11"></a>11     In respect of maintenance for the children,
                    the Husband sought an order that each party maintains the children while they
                    are in their respective care and control and argued that he should not be
                    required to make additional payments of maintenance over and above those
                    incurred while the children are spending time with him since the children would
                    be spending equal time with both parties. The Husband was also agreeable to the
                    setting up of a trust fund but requested that it be funded equally by both
                    parties and that the value of the fund be only US$150,000 per
                child.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_12"></a>12     Finally on the issue of division of the
                    matrimonial home and other matrimonial assets, the Husband sought an order that
                    he be allowed to retain 80% of the net sale proceeds (including interest, if
                    any)of the Matrimonial Property.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-1">My Decision</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_13"></a>13     Having considered both the Wife’s and
                    Husband’s respective cases, I made the following orders.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">The Children’s Matters</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_14"></a>14     In respect of the Children’s Matters, I
                    noted that both parties consented to having joint custody of the children.
                    Accordingly, I ordered the same. I also noted that at the time of the hearing
                    before me, an interim care and control order was in place for the children. The
                    arrangement was for the Wife and Husband respectively to have care and control
                    of the children on a two-week alternating basis. The children have been living
                    with the parties on this rotational cycle since January 2009 and it appears that
                    this arrangement has been working well. Hence, I ordered a continuation of this
                    arrangement. Access arrangements were also made for the other party when one
                    party has care and control of the children. However, parties could not agree on
                    some details regarding this matter. I hence made the following orders:</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_a"></a>(a)     The Wife’s address is to be
                        listed as the children’s official address. There would be a clause
                        explaining that this arrangement is for administrative purposes and that the
                        Wife would provide the Husband with copies of all documents relating to the
                        children, which are sent to her address, as soon as
                    possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_b"></a>(b)     Both
                        parties would inform the other whenever some information comes to one of
                        them from any external party, such as teachers and doctors. Once again, this
                        notification should take place as soon as the parties are able
                    to.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_c"></a>(c)     In the event
                        that either party wishes to change the dates when the children are to be
                        with him/her, at least one week’s prior notice is to be given to the
                        other party.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_d"></a>(d)     If
                        either party is travelling during the month, the children would remain with
                        the other party during the duration of the party’s travel. This period
                        would count as that party’s two week cycle with the children. If both
                        parties are travelling, the children would reside at the Wife’s
                        residence and her mother would look after the children in the absence of
                        both parties. If the Husband returns earlier than the Wife, the children
                        would be allowed to stay at his residence provided he informs the Wife
                        before hand and the children’s activities would not be affected
                        negatively.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_e"></a>(e)     During the children’s school holidays, the two week cycle access
                        arrangements would cease and the following arrangements would be put in
                        place. First, each party would have the children for half the school
                        holidays. Second, the parties would be at liberty to take the children out
                        of jurisdiction upon furnishing the other party with written details of the
                        transport (e.g. flight details), accommodation, itinerary and contact
                        details at least one month prior to the trip.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_f"></a>(f)     Discussions for access arrangements for public
                        holidays would be reached broadly before the start of the year.
                        Additionally, the children would spend time with each parent alternately for
                        Christmas and New Year. These would be agreed upon in the last two months of
                        each year for the following year’s arrangements. The children would
                        also spend Chinese New Year’s Eve and Chinese New Year with the
                        Wife.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_g"></a>(g)     The
                        parties would send the children for counselling sessions and, if required by
                        the counsellor, would attend the counselling sessions alone or jointly with
                        the Children.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_h"></a>(h)     Order 5(IV)(q) of a Draft Consent Order on the Children’s Matters
                        which was proposed by the Wife (“Draft Consent Order”) would
                        be deleted. This proposed order prohibited both the Wife and the Husband
                        from exposing the children to their partners until both agree on when that
                        would be a right time to do so.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_i"></a>(i)     The Husband would not have access with the children on
                        the Wife’s birthday and Mother’s Day, or, alternatively, the
                        days that the Wife intended to celebrate those occasions with the children.
                        Similarly, the Wife would not have access to the children on the
                        Husband’s birthday and Father’s Day, or, alternatively, the days
                        that the Husband intended to celebrate those occasions with the
                        children.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_j"></a>(j)     The
                        children’s birthdays would be celebrated jointly with both parties,
                        where possible.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_k"></a>(k)     There would be liberal telephone access.</p>
<p class="Judg-2"><a id="p1_14-p2_l"></a>(l)     An overriding clause that both parties are to be
                        flexible in all arrangements would be included in the Draft Consent
                        Order.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance for the Wife </p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_15"></a>15     In respect of maintenance for the Wife, I
                    ordered the Husband to make a nominal contribution of $1 per month to the Wife
                    as it was clear that the Wife could support herself presently and in the
                    foreseeable future. Although this is more than what she asked for ($1 per year),
                    the Husband is making no issue about the excess $11 per year. I wanted to
                    preserve the Wife’s right to make future applications for maintenance
                    should there be a material change in her circumstances. Under section 112
                    of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed), the
                    Court may vary any subsisting order for maintenance. If I dismissed the
                    Wife’s application for maintenance, there would not be any <em>subsisting</em> maintenance order for the court to vary in
                    future and the Wife would be precluded from applying to court for maintenance
                    forever (<em>Tan Bee Giok v Loh Kum Yong</em> [1996]
                    3 SLR(R) 605 at [13] to [15]).</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Maintenance for the Children</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_16"></a>16     Turning to the issue of maintenance for the
                    children, section 127(1) of the Women’s Charter provides that”
                    the court may order a parent to pay maintenance for the benefit of his child in
                    such manner as the court thinks fit”. Additionally, section 127(2)
                    provides that “[t]he provisions of Parts VIII and IX shall apply, with
                    the necessary modifications, to an application for maintenance and a maintenance
                    order made under [section 127(1) of the Women’s Charter]”. Section
                    69(4) of the Women’s Charter, which is found in Part VIII of the
                    Women’s Charter, provides that:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(4) The court, when ordering maintenance for a wife or child
                        under this section, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case
                        including the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(a)   the financial needs of the wife or child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(b)   the income, earning capacity (if any), property
                            and other financial resources of the wife or child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(c)   any physical or mental disability of the wife or
                            child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(d)   the age of each party to the marriage and the
                            duration of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(e)   the contributions made by each of the parties to
                            the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution
                            made by looking after the home or caring for the family;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(f)   the standard of living enjoyed by the wife or
                            child before the husband or parent, as the case may be, neglected or
                            refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the wife or child;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(g)   in the case of a child, the manner in which he
                            was being, and in which the parties to the marriage expected him to be,
                            educated or trained; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-2">(h)   the conduct of each of the parties to the
                            marriage, if the conduct is such that it would in the opinion of the
                            court be inequitable to disregard it.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_17"></a>17     Upon considering the facts before me, I made
                    no order for maintenance for the children as they would spend about the same
                    amount of time with each parent. I also agreed with the Husband’s position
                    in respect of the trust fund and ordered a trust fund to be established for both
                    children at US $150,000 per child, with both the Wife and the Husband as
                    joint-signatories and trustees. Each party would contribute 50% to the trust
                    fund within three months from 3 May 2010 or such time as agreed between the
                    parties. I thought it fair to have both parties contribute equally as they were
                    capable professionals with assets and have high earning capacities. There is no
                    urgency in setting up this trust fund as the money will go to the children only
                    after more than a decade from now. I therefore left the door open for the
                    parties to agree on when they should put up the funds for this
                purpose.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Division of assets</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_18"></a>18     I now come to the division of the Matrimonial
                    Property and other matrimonial assets. This issue appeared to be the
                    parties’ main concern as it was keenly contested.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_19"></a>19     The starting point for any division of
                    matrimonial assets is section 112(1) of the Women’s Charter which
                    gives the Court the power to order a division of matrimonial assets and a wide
                    discretion in doing the same. This discretion is subject to the overriding
                    requirement that the division would be in a manner which is just and equitable
                    in the circumstances of the case. Section 112(1) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a
                        judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order
                        the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any
                        such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale
                        of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and
                        equitable.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">Section 112(2) of the Women’s Charter further provides a
                    list of factors to be considered by the court when exercising its powers under
                    section 112(1):</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its
                        powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to
                        all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party
                            in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining
                            the matrimonial assets;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(b)    any debt owing or obligation incurred or
                            undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of
                            any child of the marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the
                            marriage;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(d)    the extent of the contributions made by each party
                            to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring
                            for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either
                            party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(e)    any agreement between the parties with respect to
                            the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in
                            contemplation of divorce;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(f)    any period of rent-free occupation or other
                            benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of
                            the other party;</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(g)    the giving of assistance or support by one party
                            to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the
                            giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the
                            carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">(h)    the matters referred to in section 114 (1) so far
                            as they are relevant.</p>
<p class="Judg-1">The factors enumerated in section 112(2) are not exhaustive
                    and are to be assessed as a whole to achieve a just and equitable
                    division.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_20"></a>20     Both the Wife and Husband made financial and
                    non-financial, direct and indirect, contributions to the 13-year long marriage.
                    The Wife submitted that the relationship was in fact several years longer. To
                    attribute their respective contributions to the division of the matrimonial
                    assets, I opted for “the global assessment methodology”, which
                    involves a calculation of the net value of all matrimonial assets followed by a
                    just and equitable division based on the facts. The global assessment
                    methodology was described by the Court of Appeal in <em>NK v NL</em> [2007] 3 SLR(R) 743
                        (“<em>NK v NL</em>”) at [31] as
                    follows:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The first methodology consists of four distinct phases: viz,
                        identification, assessment, division and apportionment ("the global
                        assessment methodology"). According to this approach, the court's duty is to
                        (a) identify and pool all the matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(10) of
                        the Act; (b) assess the net value of the pool of assets; (c) determine a
                        just and equitable division in the light of all the circumstances of the
                        case; and (d) decide on the most convenient way to achieve these proportions
                        of division, ie, how the order of division should be satisfied from the
                        assets (see Leong Wai Kum, <em>Principles of Family Law in
                            Singapore (Butterworths</em>, 1997) at p 895). Pursuant to this
                        approach, the percentage for indirect contributions is applied without
                        distinction to all matrimonial assets (see, for example, <em>Ryan Neil John v Berger Rosaline</em> [2000]
                        3 SLR(R) 647 at [24]; and <em>Tham Lai Hoong v Fong
                            Weng Sun Peter Vincent</em> [2002] 1 SLR(R) 391
                            ("<em>Tham Lai Hoong</em>") at [12]).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_21"></a>21     The Court of Appeal also mentioned the
                    “classification methodology” for the division of matrimonial
                    assets at [32]:</p>
<p class="Judg-Quote-1">The second methodology, on the other hand, involves an assimilation of all
                        four of the above steps [of identification, assessment, division and
                        apportionment] into a broad judicial discretion which, in the first
                        instance, separately considers and divides classes of matrimonial assets
                        ("the classification methodology"). Pursuant to this method, the court
                        apportions classes of matrimonial assets separately, for example, the
                        matrimonial home, cash in bank accounts, shares, and businesses, etc. Any
                        direct financial contributions and indirect contributions are considered in
                        relation to each class of assets, rather than by way of a global assessment
                        (see, for example, <em>NI v NJ</em> [2007]
                        1 SLR(R) 75).</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_22"></a>22     I opted for “the global assessment
                    methodology” as I was of the view that it would achieve a just and
                    equitable result for both parties while minimizing the inconvenience of having
                    to reshuffle assets between them. It would cause the least disruption to the
                    lives of both parties.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_23"></a>23     The focus of the parties was the division of
                    the sale proceeds of the Matrimonial Property. They appeared contented to retain
                    the other assets in their respective sole names.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_24"></a>24     Turning to the assets of both parties, the
                    Wife and Husband had the Matrimonial Property, as well as a joint Standard
                    Chartered Bank account. The Matrimonial Property has been sold and the sale
                    proceeds, some S$1,247,044.04, are being held by PKWA Law Practice LLC as
                    stakeholders pending the final determination of the ancillary matters. The total
                    value of the parties’ joint assets, <em>i.e</em>.,
                    the amount held by the said stakeholders as well as that in the joint Standard
                    Chartered Bank account, stood at S$1,247,578.80. Additionally, the Wife has
                    several bank accounts in Australian, Singapore and US dollars, insurance
                    policies, stocks and shares, jewellery and watches, club memberships and a motor
                    vehicle. After deducting the Wife’s liabilities, her assets totalled some
                    S$339,583.32, A$2,973.34 and US$399.57. The Husband has several bank accounts in
                    Australian and Singapore dollars, insurance policies, stocks and shares, as well
                    as a motor vehicle. After deducting the Husband’s liabilities, his assets
                    amounted to some S$1,435,930.24 and A$108,935. Upon totalling up the value of
                    the joint assets and the Wife’s and the Husband’s assets in their
                    respective names, the combined values of all the matrimonial assets subject to
                    division were S$3,023,092.82, A$111,908.34 and US$399.57. After taking into
                    account the respective currency conversion rates, the total was
                    S$3,167,998.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_25"></a>25     Translating the contributions made by the Wife
                    and the Husband to a sum that fairly represented their respective contributions
                    to the marriage, I was of the view that it would be just and equitable for the
                    Wife to be awarded 40% of the combined value of the total matrimonial assets and
                    the Husband the remaining 60%. This ratio reflects the Wife’s and the
                    Husband’s respective financial and non-financial, direct and indirect,
                    contributions to the overall assets and welfare of the family. While the Husband
                    made a greater degree of direct financial contribution to the matrimonial assets
                    (which can be readily traced to the purchase price of those assets), I was of
                    the view that the Wife’s contributions towards the family’s welfare,
                    which included both financial contributions unrelated to the acquisition or
                    maintenance of any identifiable matrimonial asset (e.g. expenditure on the
                    children’s education, healthcare and the like, which was harder to trace)
                    as well as indirect non-financial contributions to the family (e.g. the time,
                    effort and commitment she put in as the children’s primary care-giver
                    notwithstanding her career, as well as the support given to the Husband), ought
                    to be recognised. I also took into account the Husband’s indirect
                    contributions to the family as a father and husband in deciding on a 40%-60%
                    division. In the result, the Wife ought to receive a sum of S$1,267,199.20. As
                    the Wife has assets worth S$343,962.35 in her name (this figure was the sum
                    total, post conversion into Singapore dollars, of S$339,583.32, A$2,973.34 and
                    US$399.57 – see <a href="#p1_24">[24]</a> above), the
                    amount due to the Wife, which would be paid out of the sale proceeds of the
                    Matrimonial Property, works out to be S$923,236.85. I therefore ordered this
                    amount to be paid out to the Wife’s solicitors by the stakeholders with
                    the balance payable to the Husband’s solicitors.</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_26"></a>26     Although paying out S$923,236.85 of the sale
                    proceeds of the Matrimonial Property to the Wife appears to give her a
                    significant share of the Matrimonial Property, this is pursuant to my decision
                    to award the Wife a percentage of the <em>total matrimonial
                        assets</em> and not a percentage of the value of the Matrimonial
                    Property. Her apparently greater share of the sale proceeds of the Matrimonial
                    Property is merely a result of the computation and distribution of assets
                    process. As mentioned earlier, I wanted to minimize inconvenience and disruption
                    to the parties’ lives.</p>
<p class="Judg-Heading-2">Costs</p>
<p class="Judg-1"><a id="p1_27"></a>27     As is not uncommon in such proceedings, both
                    parties had a lot to say about each other. However, as each has succeeded or
                    failed to some extent in the ancillary matters, I was of the view that each
                    party should bear his or her own costs of the hearing before me.</p>
