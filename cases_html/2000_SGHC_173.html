under Section 354A(1), Penal Code (Cap. 224)</font></p>
</u></b>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<b><u><p align="justify"></p></u></b><font face="Times New Roman">4 On 28 October 1999, the

  accused fetched the victim from the maids’ agency (Infobiz Resources). This was the

  victim’s first day at work in the accused’s household. No one was at home when

  they arrived at the accused’s flat. The accused then told the victim that it was a

  matter of procedure for him to check the naked body of his domestic maids before they

  commenced work. When the victim refused to remove her clothes, the accused threatened her.

  He then pulled at her t-shirt and ordered her to remove the rest of her clothing but she

  refused. The accused then called his wife; Goh Bee Choo @ Penny (hereafter known as Penny)

  and complained that the victim had refused to strip. The wife however heard wrongly and

  thought that the maid had refused to sweep the floor. She then called the agency and spoke

  to the agent, Lee Lian Eng Adriana @ Cindy (hereafter known as Cindy) to complain about

  the maid’s refusal to sweep the floor. Cindy called up the house and counselled the

  victim to comply with the instructions of her employers. The victim tried to explain to

  Cindy about what was actually going, but stopped when she saw the accused gesturing at her

  with his hands. After the telephone conversation, the accused continued to threaten the

  victim to strip and she consequently stripped, out of fear. The accused then stared at her

  naked body for a while before asking her to dress up.</font>

  at about 11.00 am, the accused grabbed the victim and hugged her from the back whilst she

  was in the kitchen. He told her that he wanted to sleep with her. The victim struggled and

  broke loose from the accused. After the accused had left the house for work, the victim

  called and complained about the matter to Cindy. When Cindy told her to report the matter

  to Penny, the victim replied that it would be pointless to complain to Penny as she knew

  and tolerated her husband’s behaviour. Right after this telephone conversation, Cindy

  called and told Penny about the victim’s allegation. Penny remained silent. Cindy

  then arranged to pick up the victim the same evening. However, the accused’s father

  called and persuaded the victim to forgive the accused and she eventually relented.</font></p>

under Section 376(1), Penal Code (Cap. 224)</font></p>
</b></u>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">6 Investigations revealed that on 14 Feb

  2000 at about 11.00 am, the victim went and tidy up the master bedroom. The door to the

  master bedroom was left ajar. At that time, the accused was on the computer in the

  adjacent room and there was no one else in the house. Thereafter, she went into the

  attached bathroom in the master bedroom to clean it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">7 At about 11.30 am, after she had

  finished cleaning the bathroom, she stepped out and saw the master bedroom door closed.

  The accused was lying on the bed with a pair of shorts. Accused got up and approached her.

  He then held her hand and used his other free hand to pull down his shorts. He then pushed

  her onto the bed and held both her hands over her head with his left hand. He used his

  free right hand to pull down the victim’s shorts and panty.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">8 Accused used his body weight and his

  right hand to pin the victim to the bed as she was struggling to get free. He then used

  both his legs to spread the victim’s leg and he raped her. Victim cried throughout

  the ordeal.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">9 After the rape, the victim wore her

  panty and shorts and ran out of the master bedroom while the accused was wearing his

  shorts. A while later, on the insistence of the victim, the accused called up his wife to

  tell her that he had ‘fucked’ the maid. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">10 The following morning, at about 7.40

  am, after sending the accused’s son to his kindergarten, victim confided about the

  rape to another Indonesian maid; Haryati Sriyanto. The latter then brought the victim to

  her house and told her employer about the rape. Her employer, SSgt Norhayati interviewed

  the victim and subsequently brought the victim to Choa Chu Kang NPC where the report was

  lodged.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">11 On the same day at about 2.05 pm, the

  accused was arrested at his flat. On 16 Feb 2000 at 0900 hrs, the accused was charged in

  court for rape under Section 376(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">THE SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">5 Mr Low Cheong Yeow for the Prosecution

informed me that the Accused had no previous conviction or antecedent. He submitted that a

severe sentence was warranted here as the victim under the control and at the mercy of the

Accused, her employer. She had no one to turn to in Singapore. It was also not an isolated

case of sexual assault in a moment of weakness. It was a series of offences with the first

incident happening on the victim’s very first day of work and ending with the rape

almost four months later.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">6 Relying on <i>Sim Gek Yong v PP</i>
<nobr>[1995] 1 SLR 537</nobr> and <i>Fu Foo Tong v PP</i> <nobr>[1995] 1 SLR 448</nobr>, Mr Low submitted that the

Accused’s plea of guilt did not automatically entitle him to a discount in sentence.

He also referred to the Parliamentary Debates of 20 April 1998, during which the new

Section 73 of the Penal Code was enacted, to emphasize the seriousness with which

Parliament viewed cases of abuse of domestic maids. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">7 Mr Parambir Singh informed me that the

Accused is married with two young children aged six and seven. He used to work as a Senior

Technician but had to resign from his job because of the present proceedings. His wife is

gainfully employed. He helped to support his father and his mother who are 61 and 58 years

old respectively. They are not working and are in poor health. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">8 The Accused was remorseful and wished to

apologise to the victim for the pain and suffering caused to her. He cooperated fully with

the police and had in fact admitted the offences when confronted by them the day after the

rape. He has also pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">9 Mr Parambir Singh also informed me that

the Accused was released on bail on 29 March 2000 after having been in remand for some six

weeks. He submitted that while any imprisonment sentence could not be backdated in the

circumstances, the period spent in custody ought to be taken into account when determining

the length of sentence.</font></p>
<u xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">THE DECISION OF THE COURT</font></p></u>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">10 In 1998, Parliament enacted the Penal

Code (Amendment) Act which brought about the present section 73 of the Penal Code. This

section, which came into operation on 15 May 1998, provides for enhanced penalties for

offences against domestic maids such as Ms Sri Utami Tumijan here. It states:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"73. (1) Subsection (2) shall apply

  where an employer of a domestic maid or a member of the employer’s household is

  convicted of – </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(a) an offence of causing hurt or grievous

    hurt to any domestic maid employed by the employer punishable under section 323, 324 or

    325;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(b) an offence of wrongfully confining any

    domestic maid employed by the employer punishable under section 342, 343 or 344;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(c) an offence of assaulting or using

    criminal force to any domestic maid employed by the employer punishable under section 354;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(d) an offence of doing any act that is

    intended to insult the modesty of any domestic maid employed by the employer punishable

    under section 509; or</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(e) an offence of attempting to commit,

    abetting the commission of, or being a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit, an

    offence described in paragraphs (a) to (d). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) Where an employer of a domestic maid

  or a member of the employer’s household is convicted of an offence described in

  subsection (1) (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e), the court may sentence the employer of the

  domestic maid or the member of his household, as the case may be, to one and a half times

  the amount of punishment to which he would otherwise have been liable for that

  offence."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">11 In moving the Second Reading of the

Penal Code (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on 20 April 1998, the Honourable Minister for

Home Affairs, Mr Wong Kan Seng, said:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">"Maid abuse runs counter to

  Singapore’s aspiration to become a gracious and civil society. Abuse of foreign

  domestic maids can also damage our international reputation and bilateral relations.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">Sir, this Bill is intended to send a

  strong signal to those employers who have a tendency to abuse their domestic maids that we

  take a very stern view against such abuse.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">…</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">The reason why we have brought up this

  subject of maids to this House and ask Parliament to enhance the punishment is that maids

  are very different from our relatives and other categories of workers. These maids come

  from far away countries. I would say most of them are illiterate and live in rural areas.

  Some have practically no idea what Singapore really is like until they step on to our

  shores and, therefore, adjustment can become quite difficult for them. More so, when they

  have to be separated from their families and work in a totally strange environment under

  very strange conditions. I think we have to pay some special attention to how they adjust

  and cope with the new environment. If in the process of working here, the employers were

  to take advantage of them or abuse them, then, in order to become a gracious and civil

  society, we have got to find ways of protecting them. Hence, this particular amendment to

  enhance the punishment for those who abuse their maids."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">12 Section 73 of the Penal Code is

relevant to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge only, enhancing the maximum imprisonment term to

three years from two years in the ordinary case of outrage of modesty. While the said

Section 73 does not apply to the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 5<sup>th</sup> Charges, Section

354A (1) of the Penal Code (in respect of the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge) already provides for

mandatory imprisonment of not less than two years and not more than 10 years and for

mandatory caning and Section 376 (1) of the Penal Code already provides for mandatory

imprisonment of up to 20 years together with a discretionary fine or caning. Nevertheless,

such offences committed against domestic maids must, in the spirit of Section 73, be

regarded as aggravated offences.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">13 The unfortunate victim was terrorized

from the very first day of her employment in the Accused’s flat. He had the audacity

to telephone his wife to complain that the new maid refused to strip! Even if he had

deliberately mispronounced "strip" to make it sound like "sweep", it

would still show what a shamelessly cunning man he was.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">14 Having been let off by his maid for the

earlier instances of outrage of her modesty, the unappreciative and unremorseful Accused

nevertheless progressed to more intrusive molestation of her body and this culminated in

the rape on Valentine’s Day this year. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">15 It is clear that the most serious

offence in the series of Charges here is that of rape. The guidelines on sentencing in

rape cases enunciated by our Court of Appeal in <i>Frederick Chia Kim Heng v PP</i> <nobr>[1992] 1 SLR 361</nobr> have been cited so frequently and are so well known I need not repeat them here.

It is sufficient to state that the starting point of punishment for an adult rapist is 10

years imprisonment and six strokes of the cane in a contested matter.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">16 In <i>PP v Soip Bin Mohd Saju</i>

(Criminal Case No. 50 of 1999 – unreported), the Accused claimed trial before me to

one Charge of rape under Section 376 (1) of the Penal Code and three Charges of outrage of

modesty under Section 354 of the Penal Code committed against his domestic maid. I

convicted him and sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane for

the rape charge and 15 months imprisonment for two of the outrage of modesty charges

involving the touching of the victim’s breasts and 24 months imprisonment for the

remaining outrage of modesty charge involving the use of a vibrator on the victim’s

private parts. I ordered the imprisonment sentence for the rape charge and one of the

15-month imprisonment sentences to run consecutively making a total sentence of 13 years 3

months and nine strokes of the cane.</font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">17 There are some salient differences

between the present case and the facts in <i>Soip’s case</i>. The accused here has

pleaded guilty and indeed has indicated he would do so even at the stage of the

Preliminary Inquiry. This is his strongest mitigating factor. Soip made the victim there

recount her story in Court and cast aspersions on her character. Here, the offences

started from the very first day of the maid’s employment and covered a period of some

three and a half months whereas all the offences in <i>Soip’s case</i> took place on

the same day. The maid here would therefore have suffered longer and would be in constant

dread and fear of the next encounter. Soip was nearly 50 years old and was spared some

caning as he would not be liable to be caned if he were already 50 years of age at the

material time. To aggravate the sorry situation, the Accused here announced to his wife

with seeming nonchalance and arrogance his sordid act using the graphic four-letter word.

Although the telephone call to his wife was made at the insistence of the victim, one

could almost sense his conceited indifference to what he had done to the poor maid. It was

as if he felt a surge of masculine pride at having committed the outrageous offence. </font></p>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">18 Considering all the circumstances, I

now sentence the Accused as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote xmlns="">
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(1) 1<sup>st</sup> Charge - 3 years

  imprisonment and 6 strokes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(2) 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge - 1 year

  imprisonment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">(3) 5<sup>th</sup> Charge - 12 years

  imprisonment and 12 strokes.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify" xmlns=""><font face="Times New Roman">The imprisonment terms for the 1<sup>st</sup>

and 5<sup>th</sup> Charges are to run consecutively with effect from today while the

imprisonment term for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Charge is to run concurrently with the other two.

The total sentence is therefore 15 years imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane. </font></p>
